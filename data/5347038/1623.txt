Democratic Party br Jackson ran again in defeating Adams in a landslide In he signed the Indian Removal Act This act which has been described as ethnic cleansing displaced tens of thousands of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands east of the Mississippi and resulted in thousands of deaths Jackson faced a challenge to the integrity of the federal union when South Carolina threatened to

the presidencies of Martin Van Buren and James K Polk as well as the annexation of Texas Jackson s legacy remains controversial and opinions are frequently polarized Supporters characterize him as a defender of democracy and the Constitution while critics point to his reputation as a demagogue who ignored the law when it suited him Jackson s presidency has consistently been ranked as being above average although his reputation has declined since the late th century br br br Early life and education br Andrew Jackson was born on March in the Waxhaws region of the Carolinas His parents were Scots Irish colonists Andrew Jackson and Elizabeth Hutchinson Presbyterians who had emigrated from Ulster Ireland in Jackson s father was born in Carrickfergus County Antrim around and his ancestors had crossed into Northern Ireland from Scotland after the Battle of the Boyne in Jackson had two older brothers who came with his parents from Ireland Hugh born and Robert born Elizabeth had a strong hatred of the British that she passed on to her sons br Jackson s exact birthplace is unclear Jackson s father died at the age of in a logging accident while clearing land in February three weeks before his son Andrew was born Afterwards Elizabeth and her three sons moved in with her sister and brother in law Jane and James Crawford Jackson later stated that he was born on the Crawford plantation which is in Lancaster County South Carolina but second hand evidence suggests that he might have been born at another uncle s home in North Carolina br When Jackson was young Elizabeth thought he might become a minister and paid to have him schooled by a local clergyman He learned to read write work with numbers and was exposed to Greek and Latin but he was too strong willed and hot tempered for the ministry br br br Revolutionary War br br Jackson and his older brothers Hugh and Robert served on the Patriot side against British forces during the American Revolutionary War Hugh served under Colonel William Richardson Davie dying from heat exhaustion after the Battle of Stono Ferry in June After anti British sentiment intensified in the Southern Colonies following the Battle of Waxhaws in May Elizabeth encouraged Andrew and Robert to participate in militia drills They served as couriers and were present at the Battle of Hanging Rock in August br Andrew and Robert were captured in April when the British occupied the home of a Crawford relative A British officer demanded to have his boots polished Andrew refused and the officer slashed him with a sword leaving him with scars on his left hand and head Robert also refused and was struck a blow on the head The brothers were taken to a prisoner of war camp in Camden South Carolina where they became malnourished and contracted smallpox In late spring the brothers were released to their mother in a prisoner exchange Robert died two days after arriving home but Elizabeth was able to nurse Andrew back to health Once he recovered Elizabeth volunteered to nurse American prisoners of war housed in British prison ships in the harbor of Charleston South Carolina She contracted cholera and died soon afterwards The war made Jackson an orphan at age and increased his hatred for the values he associated with Britain in particular aristocracy and political privilege br br br Early career br br br Legal career and marriage br br After the American Revolutionary War Jackson worked as a saddler briefly returned to school and taught reading and writing to children In he left the Waxhaws region for Salisbury North Carolina where he studied law under attorney Spruce Macay He completed his training under John Stokes and was admitted to the North Carolina bar in September Shortly thereafter his friend John McNairy helped him get appointed as a prosecuting attorney in the Western District of North Carolina which would later become the state of Tennessee While traveling to assume his new position Jackson stopped in Jonesborough While there he bought his first slave a woman who was around his age He also fought his first duel accusing another lawyer Waightstill Avery of impugning his character The duel ended with both men firing in the air br Jackson began his new career in the frontier town of Nashville in and quickly moved up in social status He became a prot g of William Blount one of the most powerful men in the territory Jackson was appointed attorney general of the Mero District in and judge advocate for the militia the following year He also got involved in land speculation eventually forming a partnership with fellow lawyer John Overton Their partnership mainly dealt with claims made under a land grab act of that opened Cherokee and Chickasaw territory to North Carolina s white residents br While boarding at the home of Rachel Stockly Donelson the widow of John Donelson Jackson became acquainted with their daughter Rachel Donelson Robards The younger Rachel was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards and the two were separated by After the separation Jackson and Rachel became romantically involved living together as husband and wife Robards petitioned for divorce which was granted on the basis of Rachel s infidelity The couple legally married in January In they acquired their first plantation Hunter s Hill on acres ha of land near Nashville br br br Early public career br Jackson became a member of the Democratic Republican Party the dominant party in Tennessee He was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee constitutional convention in When Tennessee achieved statehood that year he was elected to be its U S representative In Congress Jackson argued against the Jay Treaty criticized George Washington for allegedly removing Democratic Republicans from public office and joined several other Democratic Republican congressmen in voting against a resolution of thanks for Washington He advocated for the right of Tennesseans to militarily oppose Native American interests The state legislature elected him to be a U S senator in but he resigned after serving only six months br In the spring of Governor John Sevier appointed Jackson to be a judge of the Tennessee Superior Court br In he also became major general or commander of the Tennessee militia a position that was determined by a vote of the militia s officers The vote was tied between Jackson and Sevier a popular Revolutionary War veteran and former governor but the governor Archibald Roane broke the tie in Jackson s favor Jackson later accused Sevier of fraud and bribery Sevier responded by impugning Rachel s honor resulting in a shootout on a public street Soon afterwards they met to duel but parted without having fired at each other br br br Planting career and slavery br br Jackson resigned his judgeship in He had almost gone bankrupt when the land and mercantile speculations he had made on the basis of promissory notes fell apart in the wake of an earlier financial panic He had to sell Hunter s Hill as well as acres ha of land he bought for speculation and bought a smaller acre ha plantation near Nashville that he would call the Hermitage He focused on recovering from his losses by becoming a successful planter and merchant The Hermitage would grow to acres ha making it one of the largest cotton growing plantations in the state br Like most planters in the Southern United States Jackson used slave labor In Jackson had nine African American slaves by he had over and by his death in he had over Over his lifetime he owned a total of slaves Jackson subscribed to the paternalistic idea of slavery which claimed that slave ownership was morally acceptable as long as slaves were treated with humanity and their basic needs were cared for In practice slaves were treated as a form of wealth whose productivity needed to be protected Jackson directed harsh punishment for slaves who disobeyed or ran away For example in an advertisement to recover a runaway slave he offered ten dollars extra for every hundred lashes any person will give him up to three hundred lashes a number that would likely have been deadly Jackson also participated in the local slave trade Over time his accumulation of wealth in both slaves and land placed him among the elite families of Tennessee br br br Duel with Dickinson and adventure with Burr br In May Jackson fought a duel with Charles Dickinson They had gotten into an argument over a horse race and Dickinson allegedly uttered a slur against Rachel During the duel Dickinson fired first and the bullet hit Jackson in the chest The wound was not life threatening because the bullet had shattered against his breastbone Jackson returned fire and killed Dickinson The killing tarnished Jackson s reputation br Later that year Jackson became involved in former vice president Aaron Burr s plan to conquer Spanish Florida and drive the Spanish from Texas Burr who was touring what was then the Western United States after mortally wounding Alexander Hamilton in a duel stayed with the Jacksons at the Hermitage in He eventually persuaded Jackson to join his adventure In October Jackson wrote James Winchester that the United States can conquer not only Florida but all Spanish North America He informed the Tennessee militia that it should be ready to march at a moment s notice when the government and constituted authority of our country require it and agreed to provide boats and provisions for the expedition Jackson sent a letter to President Thomas Jefferson telling him that Tennessee was ready to defend the nation s honor br Jackson also expressed uncertainty about the enterprise He warned the Governor of Louisiana William Claiborne and Tennessee Senator Daniel Smith that some of the people involved in the adventure might be intending to break away from the United States In December Jefferson ordered Burr to be arrested for treason Jackson safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail organized the militia to capture the conspirators He testified before a grand jury in implying that it was Burr s associate James Wilkinson who was guilty of treason not Burr Burr was acquitted of the charges br br br Military career br br br War of br br br Creek War br br On June the United States declared war on the United Kingdom launching the War of Though the war was primarily caused by maritime issues it provided white American settlers on the southern frontier the opportunity to overcome Native American resistance to settlement undermine British support of the Native American tribes and pry Florida from the Spanish Empire br Jackson immediately offered to raise volunteers for the war but he was not called to duty until after the United States military was repeatedly defeated in the American Northwest After these defeats in January Jackson enlisted over volunteers who were ordered to head to New Orleans to defend against a British attack When his forces arrived at Natchez they were ordered to halt by General Wilkinson the commander at New Orleans and the man Jackson accused of treason after the Burr adventure A little later Jackson received a letter from the Secretary of War John Armstrong stating that his volunteers were not needed and that they were to hand over any supplies to Wilkinson and disband Jackson refused to disband his troops instead he led them on the difficult march back to Nashville earning the nickname Hickory later Old Hickory for his toughness br After returning to Nashville Jackson and one of his colonels John Coffee got into a street brawl over honor with the brothers Jesse and Thomas Hart Benton Nobody was killed but Jackson received a gunshot in the shoulder that nearly killed him br Jackson had not fully recovered from his wounds when Governor Willie Blount called out the militia in September following the August Fort Mims Massacre The Red Sticks a confederate faction that had allied with Tecumseh a Shawnee chief who was fighting with the British against the United States killed about militia men and civilians at Fort Mims in retaliation for an ambush by American militia at Burnt Corn Creek br Jackson s objective was to destroy the Red Sticks He headed south from Fayetteville Tennessee in October with militia establishing Fort Strother as his supply base He sent his cavalry under General Coffee ahead of the main force destroying Red Stick villages and capturing supplies Coffee defeated a band of Red Sticks at the Battle of Tallushatchee on November and Jackson defeated another band later that month at the Battle of Talladega br By January the expiration of enlistments and desertion had reduced Jackson s force by about volunteers but he continued the offensive The Red Sticks counterattacked at the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek Jackson repelled them but was forced to withdraw to Fort Strother Jackson s army was reinforced by further recruitment and the addition of a regular army unit the th U S Infantry Regiment The combined force of men including Cherokee Choctaw and Creek allies attacked a Red Stick fort at Horseshoe Bend on the Tallapoosa River which was manned by about men The Red Sticks were overwhelmed and massacred Almost all their warriors were killed and nearly women and children were taken prisoner and distributed to Jackson s Native American allies The victory broke the power of the Red Sticks Jackson continued his scorched earth campaign of burning villages destroying supplies and starving Red Stick women and children The campaign ended when William Weatherford the Red Stick leader surrendered although some Red Sticks fled to East Florida br On June Jackson was appointed a brigadier general in the United States Army and days later was made a brevet major general with command of the Seventh Military District which included Tennessee Louisiana the Mississippi Territory and the Muscogee Creek Confederacy With President James Madison s approval Jackson imposed the Treaty of Fort Jackson The treaty required all Creek including those who had remained allies to surrender acres ha of land to the United States br Jackson then turned his attention to the British and Spanish He moved his forces to Mobile Alabama in August accused the Spanish governor of West Florida Mateo Gonz lez Manrique of arming the Red Sticks and threatened to attack The governor responded by inviting the British to land at Pensacola to defend it which violated Spanish neutrality The British attempted to capture Mobile but their invasion fleet was repulsed at Fort Bowyer Jackson then invaded Florida defeating the Spanish and British forces at the Battle of Pensacola on November Afterwards the Spanish surrendered and the British withdrew Weeks later Jackson learned that the British were planning an attack on New Orleans which was the gateway to the Lower Mississippi River and control of the American West He evacuated Pensacola strengthened the garrison at Mobile and led his troops to New Orleans br br br Battle of New Orleans br br Jackson arrived in New Orleans on December There he instituted martial law because he worried about the loyalty of the city s Creole and Spanish inhabitants He augmented his force by forming an alliance with Jean Lafitte s smugglers and raising units of free African Americans and Creek paying non white volunteers the same salary as whites This gave Jackson a force of about men when the British arrived br The British arrived in New Orleans in mid December Admiral Alexander Cochrane was the overall commander of the operation General Edward Pakenham commanded the army of soldiers many of whom had served in the Napoleonic Wars As the British advanced up the east bank of the Mississippi River Jackson constructed a fortified position to block them The climactic battle took place on January when the British launched a frontal assault Their troops made easy targets for the Americans protected by their parapets and the attack ended in disaster The British suffered over casualties including Pakenham to the Americans br The British decamped from New Orleans at the end of January but they still remained a threat Jackson refused to lift martial law and kept the militia under arms He approved the execution of six militiamen for desertion Some Creoles registered as French citizens with the French consul and demanded to be discharged from the militia due to their foreign nationality Jackson then ordered all French citizens to leave the city within three days and had a member of the Louisiana legislature Louis Louaillier arrested when he wrote a newspaper article criticizing Jackson s continuation of martial law U S District Court Judge Dominic A Hall signed a writ of habeas corpus for Louaillier s release Jackson had Hall arrested too A military court ordered Louaillier s release but Jackson kept him in prison and evicted Hall from the city Although Jackson lifted martial law when he received official word that the Treaty of Ghent which ended the war with the British had been signed his previous behavior tainted his reputation in New Orleans br Jackson s victory made him a national hero and on February he was given the Thanks of Congress and awarded a Congressional Gold Medal Though the Treaty of Ghent had been signed in December before the Battle of New Orleans was fought Jackson s victory assured that the United States control of the region between Mobile and New Orleans would not be effectively contested by European powers This control allowed the American government to ignore one of the articles in the treaty which would have returned the Creek lands taken in the Treaty of Fort Jackson br br br First Seminole War br br Following the war Jackson remained in command of troops in the southern half of the United States and was permitted to make his headquarters at the Hermitage Jackson continued to displace the Native Americans in areas under his command Despite resistance from Secretary of the Treasury William Crawford he signed five treaties between and in which the Creek Choctaw Cherokee and Chickasaw ceded tens of millions of acres of land to the United States These included the Treaty of Tuscaloosa and the Treaty of Doak s Stand br Jackson soon became embroiled in conflict in Florida The former British post at Prospect Bluff which became known to Americans as the Negro fort remained occupied by more than a thousand former soldiers of the British Royal and Colonial Marines escaped slaves and various indigenous peoples It had become a magnet for escapees and was seen as a threat to the property rights of American enslavers even a potential source of insurrection by enslaved people Jackson ordered Colonel Duncan Clinch to capture the fort in July He destroyed it and killed many of the garrison Some survivors were enslaved while others fled into the wilderness of Florida br White American settlers were in constant conflict with Native American people collectively known as the Seminoles who straddled the border between the U S and Florida In December Secretary of War John C Calhoun initiated the First Seminole War by ordering Jackson to lead a campaign with full power to conduct the war as he may think best Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida from Spain once and for all Before departing Jackson wrote to President James Monroe Let it be signified to me through any channel that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States and in sixty days it will be accomplished br Jackson invaded Florida captured the Spanish fort of St Marks and occupied Pensacola Seminole and Spanish resistance was effectively ended by May He also captured two British subjects Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot who had been working with the Seminoles After a brief trial Jackson executed both of them causing an international incident with the British Jackson s actions polarized Monroe s cabinet The occupied territories were returned to Spain Calhoun wanted him censured for violating the Constitution since the United States had not declared war on Spain Secretary of State John Quincy Adams defended him as he thought Jackson s occupation of Pensacola would lead Spain to sell Florida which Spain did in the Adams On s Treaty of In February a congressional investigation exonerated Jackson and his victory was instrumental in convincing the Seminoles to sign the Treaty of Moultrie Creek in which surrendered much of their land in Florida br br br Presidential aspirations br br br Election of br br The Panic of the United States first prolonged financial depression caused Congress to reduce the military s size and abolish Jackson s generalship In compensation Monroe made him the first territorial governor of Florida in He served as the governor for two months returning to the Hermitage in ill health During his convalescence Jackson who had been a Freemason since at least became the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Tennessee for Around this time he also completed negotiations for Tennessee to purchase Chickasaw lands This became known as the Jackson Purchase Jackson Overton and another colleague had speculated in some of the land and used their portion to form the town of Memphis br In Jackson agreed to run in the presidential election and he was nominated by the Tennessee legislature in July At the time the Federalist Party had collapsed and there were four major contenders for the Democratic Republican Party nomination William Crawford John Quincy Adams Henry Clay and John C Calhoun Jackson was intended to be a stalking horse candidate to prevent Tennessee s electoral votes from going to Crawford who was seen as a Washington insider Jackson unexpectedly garnered popular support outside of Tennessee and became a serious candidate He benefited from the expansion of suffrage among white males that followed the conclusion of the War of He was a popular war hero whose reputation suggested he had the decisiveness and independence to bring reform to Washington He also was promoted as an outsider who stood for all the people blaming banks for the country s depression br During his presidential candidacy Jackson reluctantly ran for one of Tennessee s U S Senate seats Jackson s political managers William Berkeley Lewis and John Eaton convinced him that he needed to defeat incumbent John Williams who opposed him The legislature elected Jackson in October He was attentive to his senatorial duties He was appointed chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs but avoided debate or initiating legislation He used his time in the Senate to form alliances and make peace with old adversaries Eaton continued to campaign for Jackson s presidency updating his biography and writing a series of widely circulated pseudonymous letters that portrayed Jackson as a champion of republican liberty br Democratic Republican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal congressional nominating caucuses In most of the Democratic Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus and the power to choose nominees was shifting to state nominating committees and legislatures Jackson was nominated by a Pennsylvania convention making him not merely a regional candidate but the leading national contender When Jackson won the Pennsylvania nomination Calhoun dropped out of the presidential race Afterwards Jackson won the nomination in six other states and had a strong second place finish in three others br In the presidential election Jackson won a percent plurality of the popular vote More importantly he won a plurality of electoral votes receiving votes from states in the South West and Mid Atlantic He was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base Adams dominated New England Crawford won Virginia and Georgia and Clay took three western states Because no candidate had a majority of electoral votes the House of Representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment The amendment specifies that only the top three electoral vote winners are eligible to be elected by the House so Clay was eliminated from contention Clay who was also Speaker of the House and presided over the election s resolution saw a Jackson presidency as a disaster for the country Clay threw his support behind Adams who won the contingent election on the first ballot Adams appointed Clay as his Secretary of State leading supporters of Jackson to accuse Clay and Adams of having struck a corrupt bargain After the Congressional session concluded Jackson resigned his Senate seat and returned to Tennessee br br br Election of and death of Rachel Jackson br br After the election Jackson s supporters formed a new party to undermine Adams and ensure he served only one term Adams s presidency went poorly and Adams s behavior undermined it He was perceived as an intellectual elite who ignored the needs of the populace He was unable to accomplish anything because Congress blocked his proposals In his First Annual Message to Congress Adams stated that we are palsied by the will of our constituents which was interpreted as his being against representative democracy Jackson responded by championing the needs of ordinary citizens and declaring that the voice of the people must be heard br Jackson was nominated for president by the Tennessee legislature in October more than three years before the election He gained powerful supporters in both the South and North including Calhoun who became Jackson s vice presidential running mate and New York Senator Martin Van Buren Meanwhile Adams s support from the Southern states was eroded when he signed a tax on European imports the Tariff of which was called the Tariff of Abominations by opponents into law Jackson s victory in the presidential race was overwhelming He won percent of the popular vote and percent of the electoral vote The election ended the one party system that had formed during the Era of Good Feelings as Jackson s supporters coalesced into the Democratic Party and the various groups who did not support him eventually formed the Whig Party br The political campaign was dominated by the personal abuse that partisans flung at both candidates Jackson was accused of being the son of an English prostitute and a mulatto and he was labeled a slave trader who trafficked in human flesh A series of pamphlets known as the Coffin Handbills accused him of having murdered white men including the soldiers he had executed for desertion and alleging that he stabbed a man in the back with his cane They stated that he had intentionally massacred Native American women and children at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend ate the bodies of Native Americans he killed in battle and threatened to cut off the ears of congressmen who questioned his behavior during the First Seminole War br Jackson and Rachel were accused of adultery for living together before her divorce was finalized and Rachel heard about the accusation She had been under stress throughout the election and just as Jackson was preparing to head to Washington for his inauguration she fell ill She did not live to see her husband become president dying of a stroke or heart attack a few days later Jackson believed that the abuse from Adams supporters had hastened her death stating at her funeral May God Almighty forgive her murderers as I know she forgave them I never can br br br Presidency br br br Inauguration br br Jackson arrived in Washington D C on February and began forming his cabinet He chose Van Buren as Secretary of State John Eaton as Secretary of War Samuel D Ingham as Secretary of Treasury John Branch as Secretary of Navy John M Berrien as Attorney General and William T Barry as Postmaster General Jackson was inaugurated on March Adams who was embittered by his defeat refused to attend Jackson become the first president elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U S Capitol In his inaugural address he promised to protect the sovereignty of the states respect the limits of the presidency reform the government by removing disloyal or incompetent appointees and observe a fair policy toward Native Americans Jackson invited the public to the White House which was promptly overrun by well wishers who caused minor damage to its furnishings The spectacle earned him the nickname King Mob br br br Reforms and rotation in office br br Jackson believed that Adams s administration had been corrupt and he initiated investigations into all executive departments These investigations revealed that equivalent to in was stolen from the Treasury They also resulted in a reduction in costs to the Department of the Navy saving million equivalent to in Jackson asked Congress to tighten laws on embezzlement and tax evasion and he pushed for an improved government accounting system br Jackson implemented a principle he called rotation in office The previous custom had been for the president to leave the existing appointees in office replacing them through attrition Jackson enforced the Tenure of Office Act an law that limited office tenure authorized the president to remove current office holders and appoint new ones During his first year in office he removed about of all federal employees and replaced them with loyal Democrats Jackson argued that rotation in office reduced corruption by making officeholders responsible to the popular will but it functioned as political patronage and became known as the spoils system br br br Petticoat affair br br Jackson spent much of his time during his first two and a half years in office dealing with what came to be known as the Petticoat Affair or Eaton Affair The affair focused on Secretary of War Eaton s wife Margaret She had a reputation for being promiscuous and like Rachel Jackson she was accused of adultery She and Eaton had been close before her first husband John Timberlake died and they married nine months after his death With the exception of Barry s wife Catherine the cabinet members wives followed the lead of Vice president Calhoun s wife Floride and refused to socialize with the Eatons Though Jackson defended Margaret her presence split the cabinet which had been so ineffective that he rarely called it into session and the ongoing disagreement led to its dissolution br In the spring of Jackson demanded the resignations of all the cabinet members except Barry who would resign in when a Congressional investigation revealed his mismanagement of the Post Office Jackson tried to compensate Van Buren by appointing him the Minister to Great Britain but Calhoun blocked the nomination with a tie breaking vote against it Van Buren along with newspaper editors Amos Kendall and Francis Preston Blair would become regular participants in Jackson s Kitchen Cabinet an unofficial varying group of advisors that Jackson turned to for decision making even after he had formed a new official cabinet br br br Indian Removal Act br br Jackson s presidency marked the beginning of a national policy of Native American removal Before Jackson took office the relationship between the southern states and the Native American tribes who lived within their boundaries was strained The states felt that they had full jurisdiction over their territories the native tribes saw themselves as autonomous nations that had a right to the land they lived on Significant portions of the five major tribes in the area then known as the Southwest the Cherokee Choctaw Chickasaw Creek and Seminoles began to adopt white culture including education agricultural techniques a road system and rudimentary manufacturing In the case of the tensions between the state of Georgia and the Cherokee Adams had tried to address the issue encouraging Cherokee emigration west of the Mississippi through financial incentives but most refused br In the first days of Jackson s presidency some southern states passed legislation extending state jurisdiction to Native American lands Jackson supported the states right to do so His position was later made clear in the Supreme Court test case of this legislation Worcester v Georgia Georgia had arrested a group of missionaries for entering Cherokee territory without a permit the Cherokee declared these arrests illegal The court under Chief Justice John Marshall decided in favor of the Cherokee imposition of Georgia law on the Cherokee was unconstitutional Horace Greeley alleges that when Jackson heard the ruling he said Well John Marshall has made his decision but now let him enforce it Although the quote may be apocryphal Jackson made it clear he would not use the federal government to enforce the ruling br Jackson used the power of the federal government to enforce the separation of Indigenous tribes and whites In May Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act which Congress had narrowly passed It gave the president the right to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the eastern part of the United States in exchange for lands set aside for Native Americans west of the Mississippi as well as broad discretion on how to use the federal funds allocated to the negotiations The law was supposed to be a voluntary relocation program but it was not implemented as one Jackson s administration often achieved agreement to relocate through bribes fraud and intimidation and the leaders who signed the treaties often did not represent the entire tribe The relocations could be a source of misery too the Choctaw relocation was rife with corruption theft and mismanagement that brought great suffering to that people br In Jackson personally negotiated with the Chickasaw who quickly agreed to move In the same year Choctaw leaders signed the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek the majority did not want the treaty but complied with its terms In Seminole leaders signed the Treaty of Payne s Landing which stipulated that the Seminoles would move west and become part of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy if they found the new land suitable Most Seminoles refused to move leading to the Second Seminole War in that lasted six years Members of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy ceded their land to the state of Alabama in the Treaty of Cusseta of Their private ownership of the land was to be protected but the federal government did not enforce this The government did encourage voluntary removal until the Creek War of after which almost all Creek were removed to Oklahoma territory In Cherokee leaders ceded their land to the government by the Treaty of New Echota Their removal known as the Trail of Tears was enforced by Jackson s successor Van Buren br Jackson also applied the removal policy in the Northwest He was not successful in removing the Iroquois Confederacy in New York but when some members of the Meskwaki Fox and the Sauk triggered the Black Hawk War by trying to cross back to the east side of the Mississippi the peace treaties ratified after their defeat reduced their lands further br During his administration he made about treaties with American Indian tribes He had removed almost all the Native Americans east of the Mississippi and south of Lake Michigan about people from the United States though it was done at the cost of thousands of Native American lives lost because of the unsanitary conditions and epidemics arising from their dislocation as well as their resistance to expulsion Jackson s implementation of the Indian Removal Act contributed to his popularity with his constituency He added over square miles of land to the public domain which primarily benefited the United States agricultural interests The act also benefited small farmers as Jackson allowed them to purchase moderate plots at low prices and offered squatters on land formerly belonging to Native Americans the option to purchase it before it was offered for sale to others br br br Nullification crisis br br Jackson had to confront another challenge that had been building up since the beginning of his first term The Tariff of which had been passed in the last year of Adams administration set a protective tariff at a very high rate to prevent the manufacturing industries in the Northern states from having to compete with lower priced imports from Britain The tariff reduced the income of southern cotton planters it propped up consumer prices but not the price of cotton which had severely declined in the previous decade Immediately after the tariff s passage the South Carolina Exposition and Protest was sent to the U S Senate This document which had been anonymously written by John C Calhoun asserted that the constitution was a compact of individual states and when the federal government went beyond its delegated duties such as enacting a protective tariff a state had a right to declare this action unconstitutional and make the act null and void within the borders of that state br Jackson suspected Calhoun of writing the Exposition and Protest and opposed his interpretation Jackson argued that Congress had full authority to enact tariffs and that a dissenting state was denying the will of the majority He also needed the tariff which generated of the federal revenue to achieve another of his presidential goals eliminating the national debt The issue developed into a personal rivalry between the two men For example during a celebration of Thomas Jefferson s birthday on April the attendees gave after dinner toasts Jackson toasted Our federal Union It must be preserved a clear challenge to nullification Calhoun whose toast immediately followed rebutted The Union Next to our Liberty the most dear br As a compromise Jackson supported the Tariff of which reduced the duties from the Tariff of by almost half The bill was signed on July but failed to satisfy extremists on either side On November South Carolina had passed the Ordinance of Nullification declaring both tariffs null and void and threatening to secede from the United States if the federal government tried to use force to collect the duties In response Jackson sent warships to Charleston harbor and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession On December he issued a proclamation against the nullifiers condemning nullification as contrary to the Constitution s letter and spirit rejecting the right of secession and declaring that South Carolina stood on the brink of insurrection and treason On December Calhoun who had been elected to the U S Senate resigned as vice president br Jackson asked Congress to pass a Force Bill authorizing the military to enforce the tariff It was attacked by Calhoun as despotism Meanwhile Calhoun and Clay began to work on a new compromise tariff Jackson saw it as an effective way to end the confrontation but insisted on the passage of the Force Bill before he signed On March he signed into law the Force Bill and the Tariff of The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance but nullified the Force Bill in a final act of defiance Two months later Jackson reflected on South Carolina s nullification the tariff was only the pretext and disunion and southern confederacy the real object The next pretext will be the negro or slavery question br br br Bank War and Election of br br br Bank Veto br br A few weeks after his inauguration Jackson started looking into how he could replace the Second Bank of the United States The Bank had been chartered by President Madison in to restore the United States economy after the War of Monroe had appointed Nicholas Biddle as the Bank s executive The Bank was a repository for the country s public monies which also serviced the national debt it was formed as a for profit entity that looked after the concerns of its shareholders In the country was prosperous and the currency was stable but Jackson saw the Bank as a fourth branch of government run by an elite what he called the money power that sought to control the labor and earnings of the real people who depend on their own efforts to succeed the planters farmers mechanics and laborers Additionally Jackson s own near bankruptcy in due to credit fuelled land speculation had biased him against paper money and toward a policy favorable to hard money br In his First Annual Address in December Jackson openly challenged the Bank by questioning its constitutionality and the soundness of its money Jackson s supporters further alleged that it gave preferential loans to speculators and merchants over artisans and farmers that it used its money to bribe congressmen and the press and that it had ties with foreign creditors Biddle responded to Jackson s challenge in early by using the Bank s vast financial holding to ensure the Bank s reputation and his supporters argued that the Bank was the key to prosperity and stable commerce By the time of the election Biddle had spent over equivalent to in in printing pamphlets lobbying for pro Bank legislation hiring agents and giving loans to editors and congressmen br On the surface Jackson s and Biddle s positions did not appear irreconcilable Jackson seemed open to keeping the Bank if it could include some degree of Federal oversight limit its real estate holdings and have its property subject to taxation by the states Many of Jackson s cabinet members thought a compromise was possible In Treasury Secretary Louis McLane told Biddle that Jackson was open to chartering a modified version of the Bank but Biddle did not consult Jackson directly Privately Jackson expressed opposition to the Bank publicly he announced that he would leave the decision concerning the Bank in the hands of the people Biddle was finally convinced to take open action by Henry Clay who had decided to run for president against Jackson in the election Biddle would agree to seek renewal of the charter two years earlier than scheduled Clay argued that Jackson was in a bind If he vetoed the charter he would lose the votes of his pro Bank constituents in Pennsylvania but if he signed the charter he would lose his anti Bank constituents After the recharter bill was passed Jackson vetoed it on July arguing that the country should not surrender the will of the majority to the desires of the wealthy br br br Election of br br The presidential election demonstrated the rapid development of political parties during Jackson s presidency The Democratic Party s first national convention held in Baltimore nominated Jackson s choice for vice president Martin Van Buren The National Republican Party which had held its first convention in Baltimore earlier in December nominated Clay now a senator from Kentucky and John Sergeant of Pennsylvania An Anti Masonic Party with a platform built around opposition to Freemasonry supported neither Jackson nor Clay who both were Masons The party nominated William Wirt of Maryland and Amos Ellmaker of Pennsylvania br In addition to the votes Jackson would lose because of the bank veto Clay hoped that Jackson s Indian Removal Act would alienate voters in the East but Jackson s losses were offset by the Act s popularity in the West and Southwest Clay had also expected that Jackson would lose votes because of his stand on internal improvements Jackson had vetoed the Maysville Road bill which funded an upgrade of a section of the National Road in Clay s state of Kentucky Jackson had argued it was unconstitutional to fund internal improvements using national funds for local projects br Clay s strategy failed Jackson was able to mobilize the Democratic Party s strong political networks The Northeast supported Jackson because he was in favor of maintaining a stiff tariff the West supported him because the Indian Removal Act reduced the number of Native Americans in the region and made available more public land Except for South Carolina which passed the Ordinance of Nullification during the election month and refused to support any party by giving its votes to the future Governor of Virginia John B Floyd the South supported Jackson for implementing the Indian Removal Act as well as for his willingness to compromise by signing the Tariff of Jackson won the election by a landslide receiving percent of the popular vote and electoral votes br br br Removal of deposits and censure br br Jackson saw his victory as a mandate to continue his war on the Bank s control over the national economy In Jackson signed an executive order ending the deposit of Treasury receipts in the bank When Secretary of the Treasury McLane refused to execute the order Jackson replaced him with William J Duane who also refused Jackson then appointed Roger B Taney as acting secretary who implemented Jackson s policy With the loss of federal deposits the Bank had to contract its credit Biddle used this contraction to create an economic downturn in an attempt to get Jackson to compromise Biddle wrote Nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad will produce any effect in Congress The attempt did not succeed the economy recovered and Biddle was blamed for the recession br Jackson s actions led those who disagreed with him to form the Whig Party They claimed to oppose Jackson s expansion of executive power calling him King Andrew the First and naming their party after the English Whigs who opposed the British monarchy in the th century In March the Senate censured Jackson for inappropriately taking authority for the Treasury Department when it was the responsibility of Congress and refused to confirm Taney s appointment as secretary of the treasury In April however the House declared that the bank should not be rechartered By July the Bank no longer held any federal deposits br Jackson had Federal funds deposited into state banks friendly to the administration s policies which critics called pet banks The number of these state banks more than doubled during Jackson s administration and investment patterns changed The Bank which had been the federal government s fiscal agent invested heavily in trade and financed interregional and international trade State banks were more responsive to state governments and invested heavily in land development land speculation and state public works projects In spite of the efforts of Taney s successor Levi Woodbury to control them the pet banks expanded their loans helping to create a speculative boom in the final years of Jackson s administration br In January Jackson paid off the national debt the only time in U S history that it had been accomplished It was paid down through tariff revenues carefully managing federal funding of internal improvements like roads and canals and the sale of public lands Between and the government had an unprecedented spike in land sales At its peak in the profits from land sales were eight to twelve times higher than a typical year During Jackson s presidency million acres of public land about the size of the state of Oklahoma was sold After Jackson s term expired in a Democrat majority Senate expunged Jackson s censure br br br Panic of br br Despite the economic boom following Jackson s victory in the Bank War land speculation in the west caused the Panic of Jackson s transfer of federal monies to state banks in caused western banks to relax their lending standards the Indian Removal Act made large amounts of former Native American lands available for purchase and speculation Two of Jackson s acts in contributed to the Panic of One was the Specie Circular which mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by specie The act was intended to stabilize the economy by reducing speculation on credit but it caused a drain of gold and silver from the Eastern banks to the Western banks to address the needs of financing land transactions The other was the Deposit and Distribution Act which transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks Together they left Eastern banks unable to pay specie to the British when they recalled their loans to address their economic problems in international trade The panic drove the U S economy into a depression that lasted until br br br Physical assault and assassination attempt br br Jackson was the first president to be subjected to both a physical assault and an assassination attempt On May Robert B Randolph struck Jackson in the face with his hand because Jackson had ordered Randolph s dismissal from the navy for embezzlement Jackson declined to press charges While Jackson was leaving the United States Capitol on January Richard Lawrence an unemployed house painter from England aimed a pistol at him which misfired Lawrence pulled out a second pistol which also misfired Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane until others intervened to restrain Lawrence who was later found not guilty by reason of insanity and institutionalized br br br Slavery br During Jackson s presidency slavery remained a minor political issue Though federal troops were used to crush Nat Turner s slave rebellion in Jackson ordered them withdrawn immediately afterwards despite the petition of local citizens for them to remain for protection Jackson considered the issue too divisive to the nation and to the delicate alliances of the Democratic Party br Jackson s view was challenged when the American Anti Slavery Society agitated for abolition by sending anti slavery tracts through the postal system into the South in Jackson condemned these agitators as monsters who should atone with their lives because they were attempting to destroy the Union by encouraging sectionalism The act provoked riots in Charleston and pro slavery Southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials To address the issue Jackson authorized that the tracts could be sent only to subscribers whose names could be made publicly accountable That December Jackson called on Congress to prohibit the circulation through the South of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection br br br Foreign affairs br br The Jackson administration successfully negotiated a trade agreement with Siam the first East Asian country to form a trade agreement with the U S The administration also made trade agreements with Great Britain Spain Russia and the Ottoman Empire br In his First Annual Message to Congress Jackson addressed the issues of spoliation claims demands of compensation for the capture of American ships and sailors by foreign nations during the Napoleonic Wars Using a combination of bluster and tact he successfully settled these claims with Denmark Portugal and Spain but he had difficulty collecting spoliation claims from France which was unwilling to pay an indemnity agreed to in an earlier treaty Jackson asked Congress in to authorize reprisals against French property if the country failed to make payment as well as to arm for defense In response France put its Caribbean fleet on a wartime footing Both sides wanted to avoid a conflict but the French wanted an apology for Jackson s belligerence In his Annual Message to the Congress Jackson asserted that he refused to apologize but stated that he did not intend to menace or insult the Government of France The French were assuaged and agreed to pay equivalent to in to settle the claims br Since the early s large numbers of Americans had been immigrating into Texas a territory of the newly independent nation of Mexico As early as Jackson had supported acquiring the region for the United States In he attempted to purchase it but Mexico did not want to sell By there were twice as many settlers from the United States as from Mexico leading to tensions with the Mexican government that started the Texas Revolution During the conflict Jackson covertly allowed the settlers to obtain weapons and money from the United States They defeated the Mexican military in April and declared the region an independent country the Republic of Texas The new Republic asked Jackson to recognize and annex it Although Jackson wanted to do so he was hesitant because he was unsure it could maintain independence from Mexico He also was concerned because Texas had legalized slavery which was an issue that could divide the Democrats during the election Jackson recognized the Republic of Texas on the last full day of his presidency March br br br Judiciary br br Jackson appointed six justices to the Supreme Court Most were undistinguished Jackson nominated Roger B Taney in January to the Court in reward for his services but the nomination failed to win Senate approval br When Chief Justice Marshall died in Jackson again nominated Taney for Chief Justice he was confirmed by the new Senate serving as Chief Justice until He was regarded with respect during his career on the bench but he is most remembered for his widely condemned decision in Dred Scott v Sandford On the last day of his presidency Jackson signed the Judiciary Act of which created two new Supreme Court seats and reorganized the federal circuit courts br br br States admitted to the Union br Two new states were admitted into the Union during Jackson s presidency Arkansas June and Michigan January Both states increased Democratic power in Congress and helped Van Buren win the presidency in as new states tended to support the party that had done the most to admit them br br br Later life and death br br Jackson s presidency ended on March Jackson left Washington D C three days later retiring to the Hermitage in Nashville where he remained influential in national and state politics To reduce the inflation caused by the Panic of Jackson supported an Independent Treasury system that would restrict the government from printing paper money and require it to hold its money in silver and gold br During the presidential election Jackson campaigned for Van Buren in Tennessee but Van Buren had become unpopular during the continuing depression The Whig Party nominee William Henry Harrison won the election using a campaign style similar to that of the Democrats Van Buren was depicted as an uncaring aristocrat while Harrison s war record was glorified and he was portrayed as a man of the people Harrison won the election and the Whigs captured majorities in both houses of Congress but Harrison died a month into his term and was replaced by his vice president former Democrat John Tyler Jackson was encouraged because Tyler was not bound to party loyalties and praised him when he vetoed two Whig sponsored bills to establish a new national bank in br Jackson lobbied for the annexation of Texas He was concerned that the British could use it as a base to threaten the United States and insisted that it was part of the Louisiana Purchase Tyler signed a treaty of annexation in April but it became associated with the expansion of slavery and was not ratified Van Buren who had been Jackson s preferred candidate for the Democratic Party in the presidential election had opposed annexation Disappointed by Van Buren Jackson convinced fellow Tennessean James K Polk who was then set to be Van Buren s running mate to run as the Democratic Party s presidential nominee instead Polk defeated Van Buren for the nomination and won the general election against Jackson s old enemy Henry Clay Meanwhile the Senate passed a bill to annex Texas and it was signed on March br Jackson died of dropsy tuberculosis and heart failure at years of age on June He was surrounded by family enslaved persons and friends at his deathbed and he was recorded to have said Do not cry I hope to meet you all in Heaven yes all in Heaven white and black He was buried in the same tomb as his wife Rachel br br br Personal life br br br Family br br Jackson and Rachel had no children together but adopted Andrew Jackson Jr the son of Rachel s deceased brother Severn Donelson The Jacksons acted as guardians for Donelson s other children John Samuel Daniel Smith and Andrew Jackson They were also guardians for Andrew Jackson Hutchings Rachel s orphaned grand nephew and the orphaned children of a friend Edward Butler Caroline Eliza Edward and Anthony who lived with the Jacksons after their father died Jackson also had three Creek children living with them Lyncoya a Creek orphan Jackson had adopted after the Battle of Tallushatchee and two boys they called Theodore and Charley br For the only time in U S history two women acted simultaneously as unofficial first lady for the widower Jackson Rachel s niece Emily Donelson was married to Andrew Jackson Donelson who acted as Jackson s private secretary and served as hostess at the White House The president and Emily became estranged for over a year during the Petticoat affair but they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House hostess Sarah Yorke Jackson the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr became co hostess of the White House in and took over all hostess duties after Emily died from tuberculosis in br br br Temperament br Jackson had a reputation for being short tempered and violent which terrified his opponents He was able to use his temper strategically to accomplish what he wanted He could keep it in check when necessary his behavior was friendly and urbane when he went to Washington as senator during the campaign leading up to the election According to Van Buren he remained calm in times of difficulty and made his decisions deliberatively br He had the tendency to take things personally If someone crossed him he would often become obsessed with crushing them For example on the last day of his presidency Jackson declared he had only two regrets that he had not hanged Henry Clay or shot John C Calhoun He also had a strong sense of loyalty He considered threats to his friends as threats to himself but he demanded unquestioning loyalty in return br Jackson was self confident without projecting a sense of self importance This self confidence gave him the ability to persevere in the face of adversity Once he decided on a plan of action he would adhere to it His reputation for being both quick tempered and confident worked to his advantage it misled opponents to see him as simple and direct leading them to often understimate his political shrewdness br br br Religious faith br In Jackson became an official member of the First Presbyterian Church in Nashville Both his mother and his wife had been devout Presbyterians all their lives but Jackson stated that he had postponed officially entering the church until after his retirement to avoid accusations that he had done so for political reasons br br br Legacy br br Jackson s legacy is controversial and polarizing His contemporary Alexis de Tocqueville depicted him as the spokesperson of the majority and their passions He has been variously described as a frontiersman personifying the independence of the American West a slave owning member of the Southern gentry and a populist who promoted faith in the wisdom of the ordinary citizen He has been represented as a statesman who substantially advanced the spirit of democracy and upheld the foundations of American constitutionalism as well as an autocratic demagogue who crushed political opposition and trampled the law br In the s Jackson s rise to power became associated with the idea of the common man This idea defined the age as a populist rejection of social elites and a vindication of every person s value independent of class and status Jackson was seen as its personification an individual free of societal constraints who can achieve great things In Arthur M Schlesinger Jr s influential Age of Jackson redefined Jackson s legacy through the lens of Franklin D Roosevelt s New Deal describing the common man as a member of the working class struggling against exploitation by business concerns br In the twenty first century Jackson s Indian Removal Act has been described as ethnic cleansing the use of force terror and violence to make an area ethnically homogeneous To achieve the goal of separating Native Americans from the whites coercive force such as threats and bribes were used to effect removal and unauthorized military force was used when there was resistance as in the case of the Second Seminole War The act has been discussed in the context of genocide and its role in the long term destruction of Native American societies and their cultures continues to be debated br Jackson s legacy has been variously used by later presidents Abraham Lincoln referenced Jackson s ideas when negotiating the challenges to the Union that he faced during including Jackson s understanding of the constitution during the nullification crisis and the president s right to interpret the constitution Franklin D Roosevelt used Jackson to redefine the Democratic Party describing him as a defender of the exploited and downtrodden and as a fighter for social justice and human rights The members of the Progressive Party of to saw themselves as the heirs to Jackson Donald Trump used Jackson s legacy to present himself as the president of the common man praising Jackson for saving the country from a rising aristocracy and protecting American workers with a tariff In President Barack Obama s administration announced it was removing Jackson s portrait from the bill and replacing it with one of Harriet Tubman Though the plan was put on hold during Trump s presidency President Joe Biden s administration resumed it in br Jackson is usually rated highly as a president but his reputation began to decline in the s His contradictory legacy is shown in opinion polls A survey of political scientists rated Jackson as the ninth highest rated president but the third most polarizing He was also ranked the third most overrated president In a C SPAN poll of historians Jackson was ranked the th in th in and nd in br br br Writings br Feller Daniel Coens Thomas Moss Laura Eve Moser Harold D Alexander Erik B Smith Sam
