British Loyalists br During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries colonists depended on enslaved African American workers and whites to clear land develop plantations and cultivate and process cotton in this area Long staple cotton would not grow in this upland areas and short staple cotton was originally too labor intensive to be profitable br In American Eli Whitney perfected his revolutionary invention of the cotton gin at Mount Pleasant a cotton plantation east of Washington It allowed mechanization of the processing of short staple cotton making its cultivation profitable in the upland areas As a result there was a dramatic increase in the development of new cotton plantations throughout the Deep South to cultivate short staple cotton br Settlers increased pressure on the federal government to remove Native Americans from the region including the Five Civilized Tribes from the Southeast In Revolutionary War veteran Elijah Clarke led a group of men from Wilkes County into traditionally Creek lands and established a town and several forts and called it the Trans Oconee Republic While short lived the incursion was part of a broader movement of incursion into traditionally native lands Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in and the government forcibly removed most of the members of these tribes to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River br Production of short staple cotton in the Deep South soon superseded that of long staple cotton grown primarily on the Sea Islands and in the Low Country Such expansion dramatically increased the demand for slave labor in the Deep South resulting in a longstanding domestic slave trade that transported more than a million slaves in forced migrations from the Upper South King Cotton brought great wealth to many planters in the decades before the Civil War br None of the battles of the American Civil War was fought in or near Wilkes County But here President Jefferson Davis met for the
