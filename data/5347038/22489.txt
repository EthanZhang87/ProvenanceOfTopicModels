the United States Its residents are known as Oklahomans and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City br The state s name is derived from the Choctaw words okla people and humma which translates as red Oklahoma is also known informally by its nickname The Sooner State in reference to the Sooners American settlers who staked their claims in formerly American Indian owned lands until the Indian Appropriations Act of authorized the Land Rush of opening the land to settlement br With ancient mountain ranges prairie mesas and eastern forests most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains Cross Timbers and the U S Interior Highlands all regions prone to severe weather Oklahoma is at a confluence of three major American cultural regions Historically it served as a government sanctioned territory for American Indians moved from east of the Mississippi River a route for cattle drives from Texas and related regions and a destination for Southern settlers There are currently Indigenous languages spoken in Oklahoma According to the U S census percent of Oklahomans identify as American Indians the highest indigenous population by percentage in any state br A major producer of natural gas oil and agricultural products Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation energy telecommunications and biotechnology Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma s primary economic anchors with nearly two thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas br br br Etymology br The name Oklahoma comes from the Choctaw language phrase okla people and humma translated as red Choctaw Nation Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in during treaty negotiations with the federal US government on the use of Indian Territory He envisioned an all exclusive American Indian state controlled by the United States bureau of Indian Affairs Oklahoma later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory and it was officially approved in two years after that area was opened to American settlers br br br History br br br Pre Columbian br Indigenous peoples were present in what is now Oklahoma by the last ice age Ancestors of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes including Teyas and Escanjaques and Tawakoni Tonkawa and Caddo including Kichai lived in what is now Oklahoma Southern Plains villagers lived in the central and west of the state with a subgroup the Panhandle culture people living in the panhandle region Caddoan Mississippian culture peoples lived in the eastern part of the state Spiro Mounds in what is now Spiro Oklahoma was a major Mississippian mound complex that flourished between AD and Plains Apache people settled in the Southern Plains and in Oklahoma between and br European exploration and colonization br The expedition of Spaniard Francisco V zquez de Coronado traveled through the state in but French explorers claimed the area in the early th century By the th century Comanche and Kiowa entered the region from the west and Quapaw and Osage peoples moved into what is now eastern Oklahoma French colonists claimed the region until when all the French territory west of the Mississippi River was acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase The territory was a part of the Arkansas Territory from until br th century br During the th century the U S federal government forcibly removed tens of thousands of American Indians from their ancestral homelands from across North America and transported them to the area including and surrounding present day Oklahoma The Choctaw was the first of the Five Civilized Tribes to be removed from the Southeastern United States The phrase Trail of Tears originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw Nation in although the term is usually used for the Cherokee removal br Seventeen thousand Cherokees and of their black slaves were deported The area already occupied by Osage and Quapaw tribes was called for the Choctaw Nation until revised Native American and then later American policy redefined the boundaries to include other Native Americans By more than Native American nations and tribes had been concentrated on land within Indian Territory or Indian Country br All Five Civilized Tribes supported and signed treaties with the Confederate military during the American Civil War The Cherokee Nation had an internal civil war Slavery in Indian Territory was not abolished until br In the period between and cattle ranches in Texas strove to meet the demands for food in eastern cities and railroads in Kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner Cattle trails and cattle ranches developed as cowboys either drove their product north or settled illegally in Indian Territory In four of five major cattle trails on the western frontier traveled through Indian Territory br br Increased presence of white settlers in Indian Territory and their demand for land owned and guaranteed to Indian tribes by treaties with the U S government prompted the United States to enact the Dawes Act in and the Curtis Act of The acts abolished tribal governments eliminated tribal ownership of land and allotted acres ha of land to each head of an Indian family An objective of the acts was the forced assimilation of Indians into white society Land not allotted to individual Indians was owned by the U S government and sold or distributed to settlers and railroads The proceeds of the land sales were used to educate Indian children and advance the policy of assimilation As a result of the two acts about one half of land previously owned by Indian tribes was owned by whites by Moreover much of the land allotted to individual Indian heads of families became white owned Allottees often sold or were fraudulently deprived of their land br The acquisition of tribal lands by the U S government led to land runs also called land rushes from and Major land runs including the Land Rush of opened up millions of acres of formerly tribal lands to white settlement The rushes began at a precise times as each prospective settler literally raced with other prospective settlers to claim ownership of acres ha of land under the Homestead Act of Usually land was claimed by settlers on a first come first served basis Those who broke the rules by crossing the border into the territory before the official opening time were said to have been crossing the border sooner leading to the term sooners which eventually became the state s official nickname George Washington Steele was appointed the first governor of the territory of Oklahoma in br br br th century br br Attempts to create an all Indian state named Oklahoma and a later attempt to create an all Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of eventually laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention which took place two years later On June Congress enacted a statute authorizing the people of the Oklahoma and Indian Territories as well what would become the states of Arizona and New Mexico to form a constitution and state government in order to be admitted as a state On November President Theodore Roosevelt issued Presidential Proclamation no establishing Oklahoma as the th state in the Union br The new state became a focal point for the emerging oil industry as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth Tulsa eventually became known as the Oil Capital of the World for most of the th century and oil investments fueled much of the state s early economy In Oklahoman businessman Cyrus Avery known as the Father of Route began the campaign to create U S Route Using a stretch of highway from Amarillo Texas to Tulsa Oklahoma to form the original portion of Highway Avery spearheaded the creation of the U S Highway Association to oversee the planning of Route based in his hometown of Tulsa br In late September the first cases of the Spanish flu appeared in Oklahoma Though public health authorities statewide had some indication that the pandemic was westward the turmoil caused by the rapid advancement of the disease quickly overwhelmed both health workers and local governing bodies In Oklahoma City shortages of both supplies and personnel were mitigated in part by the mobilization of the American Red Cross Rough estimates based on contemporary reports indicate that approximately people fell ill with the disease before the pandemic ebbed in Of those cases it is assumed that around proved fatal placing total mortality rates for the state in the area of br Oklahoma also has a rich African American history Many Black towns founded by the Freedmen of the Five Tribes during Reconstruction thrived in the early th century with the arrival of Black Exodusters who migrated from neighboring states especially Kansas The politician Edward P McCabe encouraged Black settlers to come to what was then Indian Territory McCabe discussed with President Theodore Roosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma a majority Black state br By the early th century the Greenwood district of Tulsa was one of the most prosperous African American communities in the United States Jim Crow laws had established racial segregation since before the start of the th century but Tulsa s Black residents had created a thriving area br Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after The Tulsa race massacre broke out in with White mobs attacking Black people and carrying out a pogrom in Greenwood In one of the costliest episodes of racist violence in American history sixteen hours of rioting resulted in the destruction of city blocks million in property damage and an estimated death toll of between and people By the late s the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state br br During the s parts of the state began to suffer from the consequences of poor farming practices This period was known as the Dust Bowl throughout which areas of Kansas Texas New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall strong winds abnormally high temperatures and most notably severe dust storms sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States Over a twenty year period ending in the state saw its only historical decline in population dropping percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl br Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams they built hundreds of reservoirs and man made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation br br In Oklahoma City was the site of the most destructive act of domestic terrorism in American history The Oklahoma City bombing of April in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large crude explosive device outside the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building killed people including children For his crime McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June His accomplice Terry Nichols is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive br st century br On May several cities experienced record setting flooding br br On July the Supreme Court of the United States determined in McGirt v Oklahoma that the reservations of the Five Tribes comprising much of Eastern Oklahoma were never disestablished by Congress and thus are still Indian Country for the purposes of criminal law br Later decisions by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals also found the Quapaw Nation Ottawa Tribe Peoria Tribe and Miami Tribe also had existing reservations The Osage Nation is awaiting for a possible appellate decision after a district judge had ruled that the Osage reservation was disestablished br br br Geography br br Oklahoma is the th largest state in the United States covering an area of square miles km with square miles km of land and square miles km of water It lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the contiguous states It is bordered on the east by Arkansas and Missouri on the north by Kansas on the northwest by Colorado on the far west by New Mexico and on the south and near west by Texas br br br Borders br Oklahoma s border with Kansas was defined as the th Parallel in the Kansas Nebraska Act This was disputed with the Cherokee and Osage Nations which claimed their border extended North of this line and could not be part of the Kansas Territory This was resolved in with the Drum Creek Treaty which reestablished Kansas s southern border as the th parallel This also applied to the then No Man s Land that became the Oklahoma Panhandle br The Oklahoma Texas border consists of the Red River of the South in the south and the th meridian west as the western border between Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle These were first established in the Adams On s Treaty between the United States and Spain br The Oklahoma panhandle was originally part of the Panhandle of the Republic of Texas but when Texas joined the Union as a slave state it could not retain any lands north of degrees minutes as specified in the Missouri Compromise The Panhandle existed as a no man s land until when Oklahoma acquired the territory upon gaining statehood br Oklahoma s Eastern border is divided between Missouri and Arkansas The Missouri Oklahoma border is defined as the Meridian passing through the Kawsmouth where the Kansas River meets the Missouri River This is the same Meridian as the Kansas Missouri border br The Oklahoma Arkansas border was originally defined by two lines the borders between Arkansas and the Cherokee and Choctaw Reservations This formed two diagonal lines meeting at the western edge of Fort Smith Arkansas with one line running northeast from the Red River and the other running southeast from the Oklahoma Arkansas Missouri border The Choctaw Arkansas border was established in the Treaty of Doak s Sand and later refined in the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek These treaties left a acre exclave of the Choctaw reservation bounded by Arkansas the Arkansas River and the Poteau River This became the site of a smuggling camp called Coke Hill noted mostly for its importance in cocaine smuggling br After Petitioning congress to hand over jurisdiction the acres was given to Arkansas in The US Supreme Court Case Oklahoma v Arkansas decided the land would remain Arkansas even though the Choctaw had not been notified or asked about the territory being handed over Therefore the Poteau River serves as the Oklahoma Arkansas boundary for approximately mile reducing the Choctaw Reservation and later Oklahoma by acres as established in the treaties of the early s br br br Topography br br Oklahoma is between the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf of Mexico watershed generally sloping from the high plains of its western boundary to the low wetlands of its southeastern boundary Its highest and lowest points follow this trend with its highest peak Black Mesa at feet m above sea level situated near its far northwest corner in the Oklahoma Panhandle The state s lowest point is on the Little River near its far southeastern boundary near the town of Idabel which dips to feet m above sea level br Among the most geographically diverse states Oklahoma is one of four to harbor more than distinct ecological regions with in its borders more per square mile than in any other state Its western and eastern halves however are marked by extreme differences in geographical diversity Eastern Oklahoma touches eight ecological regions and its western half contains three Although having fewer ecological regions Western Oklahoma contains many rare relic species br Oklahoma has four primary mountain ranges the Ouachita Mountains the Arbuckle Mountains the Wichita Mountains and the Ozark Mountains Contained within the U S Interior Highlands region the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains are the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians A portion of the Flint Hills stretches into north central Oklahoma and near the state s eastern border The Oklahoma Tourism Recreation Department regards Cavanal Hill as the world s tallest hill at feet m it fails their definition of a mountain by one foot br The semi arid high plains in the state s northwestern corner harbor few natural forests the region has a rolling to flat landscape with intermittent canyons and mesa ranges like the Glass Mountains Partial plains interrupted by small sky island mountain ranges like the Antelope Hills and the Wichita Mountains dot southwestern Oklahoma transitional prairie and oak savannas cover the central portion of the state The Ozark and Ouachita Mountains rise from west to east over the state s eastern third gradually increasing in elevation in an eastward direction br More than named creeks and rivers make up Oklahoma s waterways and with lakes created by dams it holds the nation s highest number of artificial reservoirs Most of the state lies in two primary drainage basins belonging to the Red and Arkansas Rivers though the Lee and Little Rivers also contain significant drainage basins br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Flora and fauna br br Due to Oklahoma s location at the confluence of many geographic regions the state s climatic regions have a high rate of biodiversity Forests cover percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass mixed grass and tallgrass prairie harbor expansive ecosystems in the state s central and western portions although cropland has largely replaced native grasses Where rainfall is sparse in the state s western regions shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems though pinyon pines red cedar junipers and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the panhandle s far western reaches Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare disjunct species including sugar maple bigtooth maple nolina and Texas live oak br Marshlands cypress forests and mixtures of shortleaf pine loblolly pine blue palmetto and deciduous forests dominate the state s southeastern quarter while mixtures of largely post oak elm red cedar Juniperus virginiana and pine forests cover northeastern Oklahoma br The state holds populations of white tailed deer mule deer antelope coyotes mountain lions bobcats elk and birds such as quail doves cardinals bald eagles red tailed hawks and pheasants In prairie ecosystems American bison greater prairie chickens badgers and armadillo are common and some of the nation s largest prairie dog towns inhabit shortgrass prairie in the state s panhandle The Cross Timbers a region transitioning from prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma harbors vertebrate species The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear red fox gray fox and river otter populations which coexist with vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma Also in southeastern Oklahoma lives the American alligator br br br Protected lands br Oklahoma has fifty one state parks six national parks or protected regions two national protected forests or grasslands and a network of wildlife preserves and conservation areas Six percent of the state s million acres km of forest is public land including the western portions of the Ouachita National Forest the largest and oldest national forest in the Southern United States br With acres km the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in north central Oklahoma is the largest protected area of tallgrass prairie in the world and is part of an ecosystem that encompasses only ten percent of its former land area once covering fourteen states In addition the Black Kettle National Grassland covers acres km of prairie in southwestern Oklahoma The Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge is the oldest and largest of nine National Wildlife Refuges in the state and was founded in encompassing acres km br Of Oklahoma s federally protected parks or recreational sites the Chickasaw National Recreation Area is the largest with acres km Other sites include the Santa Fe and Trail of Tears national historic trails the Fort Smith and Washita Battlefield national historic sites and the Oklahoma City National Memorial br br br Climate br br Oklahoma is in a humid subtropical region that lies in a transition zone between semiarid further to the west humid continental to the north and humid subtropical to the east and southeast Most of the state lies in an area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold dry air from Canada warm to hot dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U S and warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather severe thunderstorms damaging thunderstorm winds large hail and tornadoes with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth An average tornadoes strike the state per year one of the highest rates in the world br Because of Oklahoma s position between zones of differing prevailing temperature and winds weather patterns within the state can vary widely over relatively short distances and they can change drastically in a short time On November the temperature at Oklahoma City reached F C the record high for that date then a cold front of unprecedented intensity slammed across the state causing the temperature to reach F C the record low for that date by midnight This type of phenomenon is also responsible for many of the tornadoes in the area such as the Oklahoma tornado outbreak when a warm front traveled along a stalled cold front resulting in an average of about one tornado per hour br The humid subtropical climate K ppen Cfa of central southern and eastern Oklahoma is influenced heavily by southerly winds bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico Traveling westward the climate transitions progressively toward a semiarid zone K ppen BSk in the high plains of the Panhandle and other western areas from about Lawton westward less frequently touched by southern moisture Precipitation and temperatures decline from east to west accordingly with areas in the southeast averaging an annual temperature of F C and an annual rainfall of generally over in mm and up to in mm while areas of the higher elevation panhandle average F C with annual rainfall under in mm br Over almost all of Oklahoma winter is the driest season Average monthly precipitation increases dramatically in the spring to a peak in May the wettest month over most of the state with its frequent and not uncommonly severe thunderstorm activity Early June can still be wet but most years see a marked decrease in rainfall during June and early July Mid summer July and August represents a secondary dry season over much of Oklahoma with long stretches of hot weather with only sporadic thunderstorm activity not uncommon many years Severe drought is common in the hottest summers such as those of and all of which featured weeks on end of virtual rainlessness and highs well over F C Average precipitation rises again from September to mid October representing a secondary wetter season then declines from late October through December br The entire state frequently experiences temperatures above F C or below F C though below zero temperatures are rare in south central and southeastern Oklahoma Snowfall ranges from an average of less than in mm in the south to just over in mm on the border of Colorado in the panhandle The state is home to the Storm Prediction Center
