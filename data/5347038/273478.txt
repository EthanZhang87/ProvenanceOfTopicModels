id: 273478
The Chattahoochee River is a river in the Southern United States It forms the southern half of the Alabama and Georgia border as well as a portion of the Florida and Georgia border It is a tributary of the Apalachicola River a relatively short river formed by the confluence of the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers and emptying from Florida into Apalachicola Bay in the Gulf of Mexico The Chattahoochee River is about miles km long The Chattahoochee Flint and Apalachicola rivers together make up the Apalachicola Chattahoochee Flint River Basin ACF River Basin The Chattahoochee makes up the largest part of the ACF s drainage basin br br br Course br br The source of the Chattahoochee River is located in Jacks Gap at the southeastern foot of Jacks Knob in the very southeastern corner of Union County in the southern Blue Ridge Mountains a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains The headwaters of the river flow south from ridges that form the Tennessee Valley Divide The Appalachian Trail crosses the river s uppermost headwaters The Chattahoochee s source and upper course lie within Chattahoochee National Forest br From its source in the Blue Ridge Mountains the Chattahoochee River flows southwesterly to Atlanta and through its suburbs It eventually turns due south to form the southern half of the Georgia Alabama state line Flowing through a series of reservoirs and artificial lakes it flows by Columbus the second largest city in Georgia and the Fort Moore Army base At Columbus it crosses the Fall Line of the eastern United States br From Lake Oliver to Fort Moore the Chattahoochee Riverwalk provides cycling rollerblading and walking along miles km of the river s banks Farther south it merges with the Flint River and other tributaries at Lake Seminole near Bainbridge to form the Apalachicola River that flows into the Florida Panhandle The Chattahoochee River ends in the city of Chattahoochee FL From there the same river is then named Apalachicola River which ends miles away in the city of Apalachicola FL meaning both rivers end in the city named after them Although the same river this portion was given a different name by separated settlers in different regions during the colonial times br br br Etymology br The name Chattahoochee is thought to come from a Muskogee word meaning rocks marked or painted from chato rock plus huchi marked This possibly refers to the many colorful granite outcroppings along the northeast to southwest segment of the river Much of that segment of the river runs through the Brevard fault zone br br br History br br br Geologic history br The current course of the Chattahoochee River has a geologic history that extends back in time at least million years A Late Cretaceous system of paleovalleys incised into the Coastal Plain unconformity in the vicinity of Columbus Georgia is infilled with fluvial sands and gravels of the lower Tuscaloosa Formation Younger rocks of the overlying Eutaw Formation record an estuarine environment in approximately the same location suggesting a persistent paleodrainage system in the vicinity of the modern Chattahoochee for at least million years during the Late Cretaceous North of the Fall Line in the Piedmont of Georgia and Alabama the course of the Chattahoochee River cuts across prominent resistant rock layers including the Hollis Quartzite of the Pine Mountain belt and must have established its current course prior to uplift of those units At the mouth of the Chattahoochee Flint Apalachicola River system in the Apalachicola River delta the geologic history of the delta can be traced at least as far back as the Miocene br br br Early history br The vicinity of the Chattahoochee River was inhabited in prehistoric times by indigenous peoples since at least BC The Kolomoki Mounds now protected in the Kolomoki Mounds Historic Park near present day Blakely in Early County southwest Georgia were built between AD and AD and constitute the largest mound complex in the state br br br American Civil War br The Chattahoochee River was of considerable strategic importance during the Atlanta Campaign by Union General William Tecumseh Sherman of the American Civil War br Between the tributaries of Proctor Creek and Nickajack Creek on the Cobb and Fulton county lines in metropolitan Atlanta are nine remaining fortifications nicknamed Shoupades that were part of a defensive line occupied by the Confederate Army in early July Designed by Confederate Brigadier General Francis A Shoup the line became known as Johnston s River Line after Confederate General Joseph E Johnston and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places br A month prior to the Battle of Atlanta Shoup talked with Johnston on June about building fortifications Johnston agreed and Shoup supervised the building of small elevated earth and wooden triangular fortifications arranged in a sawtooth pattern to maximize the crossfire of defenders Sherman tried to avoid the Shoupade defenses by crossing the river to the northeast The nine remaining Shoupades consist of the earthworks portion of the original earth and wooden structures they are endangered by land development in the area br Two of the last battles of the war West Point and Columbus took place at strategically important crossings of the Chattahoochee br br br Recent history br Since the nineteenth century early improvements and alterations to the river were for the purposes of navigation The river was important for carrying trade and passengers and was a major transportation route br In the twentieth century the United States Congress passed legislation in and to improve navigation for commercial traffic on the river as well as to establish hydroelectric power and recreational facilities on a series of lakes to be created by building dams and establishing reservoirs Creating the manmade acre Walter F George Lake also known as Lake Eufaula in Eufaula Alabama required evacuating numerous communities including the historically majority Native American settlement of Oketeyeconne Georgia The lakes were complete in covering over numerous historic and prehistoric sites of settlement br Beginning in the late twentieth century the nonprofit organization called Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper has advocated for the preservation of the environment and ecology of the northern part of the river especially the part traversing Metropolitan Atlanta br In a campaign to create a whitewater river course was launched in the portion of the Chattahoochee River that runs through Columbus Georgia Between and construction took place on the river the Eagle and Phenix and City Mills Dams were breached and a mile Whitewater Course was formed in Uptown Columbus The project returned the river to its natural path across the Fall Line as well as creating the longest urban whitewater course in the world br br br Modifications br Several large manmade reservoirs including Lanier Lake Eufaula West Point and George W Andrews lakes are controlled by the United States Army Corps of Engineers The dams and reservoirs were developed following legislation by Congress of the mid s for flood control domestic and industrial water hydroelectricity recreation and improved navigation for river barges Most of the lakes were completed by Numerous historic and prehistoric sites were covered over by the lakes during the flooding of the reservoirs including Oketeyconne Georgia br The Georgia Power Company also owns a small series of dams along the middle portion of the river the Columbus area between West Point Lake and Lake Walter F George Several smaller and older lakes and dams also provide these services on a much smaller and more localized scale including Bull Sluice Lake which is held by the Morgan Falls Dam This dam was built by the Georgia Railway and Power Company in to provide electric power for the Atlanta trolley system which has long since been replaced by other forms of transportation br br br River borders br br At various points the Chattahoochee serves as the boundary between several counties and cities as well as forming the lower half of the boundary between Alabama and Georgia br Within Georgia it divides br br Habersham County and White County br Forsyth County and Hall County br Forsyth County and Gwinnett County br Fulton County and Gwinnett County br Sandy Springs and Roswell br Cobb County and Fulton County br Douglas County and Fulton County br Carroll County and Fulton County br Carroll County and Coweta County br Columbus Georgia and Phenix City Alabama br Georgetown Georgia and Eufaula Alabama br br br Atlanta br br Atlanta is built upon the crest of a large ridge rather than in the floodplain of the river This has contributed to the preservation of much of the natural scenic beauty of the section that runs through metropolitan Atlanta North of the metropolis the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area protects other portions of the riverbanks in a region that is spread across several disconnected areas br The river traverses much of Atlanta s hilly topography of the northern suburbs Wealthy suburban communities in northern metro Atlanta that abut the river include Vinings Buckhead Sandy Springs East Cobb Roswell Dunwoody Peachtree Corners Duluth Johns Creek and Berkeley Lake br Since three states have needs related to the river there has been increasing controversy since the late twentieth century related to competing development among the regions and the implications for the river The enormous growth of metropolitan Atlanta has increased its water withdrawals from the river This has effects downstream For example the oysters in the Apalachicola Bay of Florida depend on the brackish water mixture of river and ocean water and the alternating freshwater and saltwater flows that the river and the tides provide The amount of flow in the Chattahoochee has also been decreased by interbasin water transfers where water is withdrawn from the Chattahoochee but discharged as treated sewage water into another river such as the Oconee River which flow to the Atlantic Seaboard via the Altamaha River br Interest groups and the state of Florida have asked the U S Congress to intervene to reduce the priority given to put navigation of the lower Chattahoochee south of Columbus by river barge This requirement causes large water withdrawals which environmental supporters consider a waste of water needed to support habitats especially during droughts The navigation issue has aggravated the fight between Georgia Florida and Alabama over rights to the river water A lawsuit has been filed in the case to reduce priorities given to navigation The lawsuit is now in court and may take years to resolve br br br Flooding br The most recent major flooding of the Chattahoochee River took place in November This was caused by torrential rains from Tropical Storm Ida as it tore through the Georgia Piedmont Downstream from Roswell the Chattahoochee River remained in moderate flood stage Streams affected by the September floods included the following br br Chattahoochee River br Vickery Creek br Johns Creek br Sweetwater Creek br Nancy Creek br Peachtree Creek br Oconee River br James Creek br The second most recent major flood along the river occurred during the Georgia floods with feet m of water recorded at Vinings at the northwestern Atlanta city limit The flood was over feet m higher than the previous flood recorded in September as a result of Hurricane Fred Numerous tributaries also swelled far over and beyond their banks These were the highest water levels seen since and the second highest ever since the large Buford Dam was built upstream The National Weather Service in
