The National Register of Historic Places NRHP is the United States federal government s official list of districts sites buildings structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance or great artistic value A property listed in the National Register or located within a National Register Historic District may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property br The enactment of the National Historic Preservation Act NHPA in established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it Of the more than one and a half million properties on the National Register are listed individually The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts br For most of its history the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service NPS an agency within the United States Department of the Interior Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation as well as coordinate identify and protect historic sites in the United States While National Register listings are mostly symbolic their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties Protection of the property is not guaranteed During the nomination process the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation as well as the public and politicians br Occasionally historic sites outside of the country but associated with the United States such as the American Legation in Tangier are also listed Properties can be nominated in a variety of forms including individual properties historic districts and multiple property submissions MPS The Register categorizes general listings into one of five types of properties district site structure building or object br National Register Historic Districts are defined geographical areas consisting of contributing and non contributing properties Some properties are added automatically to the National Register when they become administered by the National Park Service These include National Historic Landmarks NHL National Historic Sites NHS National Historical Parks National Military Parks National Memorials and some National Monuments br Federal properties can be proclaimed National Monuments under the Antiquities Act because of either their historical or natural significance They are managed by multiple agencies Only monuments that are historic in character and managed by the National Park Service are listed administratively in the National Register br br br History br br On October the Historic Preservation Act created the National Register of Historic Places and the corresponding State Historic Preservation Offices SHPO The National Register initially consisted of the National Historic Landmarks designated before the Register s creation as well as any other historic sites in the National Park system Approval of the act which was amended in and represented the first time the United States had a broad based historic preservation policy The act required those agencies to work in conjunction with the SHPO and an independent federal agency the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation ACHP to confront adverse effects of federal activities on historic preservation br To administer the newly created National Register of Historic Places the National Park Service of the U S Department of the Interior with director George B Hartzog Jr established an administrative division named the Federal Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation OAHP Hartzog charged OAHP with creating the National Register program mandated by the law Ernest Connally was the Office s first director Within OAHP new divisions were created to deal with the National Register The division administered several existing programs including the Historic Sites Survey and the Historic American Buildings Survey as well as the new National Register and Historic Preservation Fund br The first official Keeper of the Register was William J Murtagh an architectural historian During the Register s earliest years in the late s and early s organization was lax and SHPOs were small understaffed and underfunded However funds were still being supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching grants in aid to listed property owners first for house museums and institutional buildings but later for commercial structures as well br In the NPS history programs affiliated with both the U S National Parks system and the National Register were categorized formally into two Assistant Directorates Established were the Assistant Directorate for Archeology and Historic Preservation and the Assistant Directorate for Park Historic Preservation From until the main agency for the National Register was the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service HCRS of the United States Department of the Interior br In February the two assistant directorates were merged to promote efficiency and recognize the interdependency of their programs Jerry L Rogers was selected to direct this newly merged associate directorate He was described as a skilled administrator who was sensitive to the need for the NPS to work with SHPOs academia and local governments br Although not described in detail in the act SHPOs eventually became integral to the process of listing properties on the National Register The amendments of the law further defined the responsibilities of SHPOs concerning the National Register Several amendments of the NHPA added a category to the National Register known as Traditional Cultural Properties those properties associated with Native American or Hawaiian groups br The National Register of Historic Places has grown considerably from its legislative origins in In citizens and groups nominated separate properties sites and districts for inclusion on the National Register a total of separate properties Of the more than one and a half million properties on the National Register are listed individually Others are listed as contributing members within historic districts br br br Nomination process br It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States Government that special effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside and public park and recreation lands wildlife and waterfowl refuges and historic sites Any individual can prepare a National Register nomination although historians and historic preservation consultants often are employed for this work The nomination consists of a standard registration form NPS and contains basic information about a property s physical appearance and the type of significance embodied in the building structure object site or district br The State Historic Preservation Office SHPO receives National Register nominations and provides feedback to the nominating individual or group After preliminary review the SHPO sends each nomination to the state s historic review commission which then recommends whether the State Historic Preservation Officer should send the nomination to the Keeper of the National Register For any non Federally owned property only the State Historic Preservation Officer may officially nominate a property for inclusion in the National Register After the nomination is recommended for listing in the National Register by the SHPO the nomination is sent to the National Park Service which approves or denies the nomination br If approved the property is entered officially by the Keeper of the National Register into the National Register of Historic Places Property owners are notified of the nomination during the review by the SHPO and state s historic review commission If an owner objects to a nomination of private property or in the case of a historic district a majority of owners then the property cannot be listed in the National Register of Historic Places br br br Criteria br br For a property to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places it must meet at least one of its four main criteria Information about architectural styles association with various aspects of social history and commerce and ownership are all integral parts of the nomination Each nomination contains a narrative section that provides a detailed physical description of the property and justifies why it is significant historically with regard either to local state or national history The four National Register of Historic Places criteria are the following br br Criterion A Event the property must make a contribution to the major pattern of American history br Criterion B Person is associated with significant people of the American past br Criterion C Design Construction concerns the distinctive characteristics of the building by its architecture and construction including having great artistic value or being the work of a master br Criterion D Information potential is satisfied if the property has yielded or may be likely to yield information important to prehistory or history br The criteria are applied differently for different types of properties for instance maritime properties have application guidelines different from those of buildings br br br Exclusions br The National Park Service names seven categories of properties that are not usually considered for and ordinarily shall not be considered eligible for the National Register religious properties e g churches buildings that have been moved birthplaces or graves of important persons cemeteries reconstructed properties commemorative properties e g statues and properties that have achieved significance within the last fifty years However if they meet particular Criteria Considerations for their category in addition to the overall criteria they are in fact eligible Hence despite the forbidding language these kinds of places are not actually excluded as a rule For example the Register lists thousands of churches See also Misconceptions br The National Register evaluation procedures do not use the term exclusions The stricter National Historic Landmarks Criteria upon which the National Register criteria are based do specify exclusions along with corresponding exceptions to the exclusions which are supposed to apply more narrowly br br br Properties listed br br A listing on the National Register of Historic Places is governmental acknowledgment of a historic district site building or property However the Register is mostly an honorary status with some federal financial incentives The National Register of Historic Places automatically includes all National Historic Landmarks as well as all historic areas administered by the National Park Service br Landmarks such as these include National Historic Sites NHS National Historical Parks National Military Parks Battlefields National Memorials and some National Monuments Occasionally historic sites outside the United States borders but associated with the United States such as the American Legation in Tangier Morocco also are listed br Listing in the National Register does not restrict private property owners from the use of their property br Some states and municipalities however may have laws that become effective when a property is listed in the National Register If federal money or a federal permitting process is involved Section of the National Historic Preservation Act of is invoked Section requires the federal agency involved to assess the effect of its actions on historic resources Statutorily the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation ACHP has the most significant role by Section of the National Historic Preservation Act The section requires that the director of any federal agency with direct or indirect jurisdiction of a project that may affect a property listed or determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places must first report to the Advisory Council The director of said agency is required to take into account the effect of the undertaking on the National Register property as well as to afford the ACHP a reasonable opportunity to comment br While Section does not mandate explicitly that any federal agency director accept the advice of the ACHP their advice has a practical influence especially given the statutory obligations of the NHPA that require federal agencies to take into account the effect of the undertaking br In cases where the ACHP determines federal action will have an adverse effect on historic properties mitigation is sought Typically a Memorandum of Agreement MOA is created by which the involved parties agree to a particular plan Many states have laws similar to Section In contrast to conditions relating to a federally designated historic district municipal ordinances governing local historic districts often restrict certain kinds of changes to properties Thus they may protect the property more than a National Register listing does br The Department of Transportation Act passed on October the same day as the National Historic Preservation Act included provisions that addressed historic preservation The DOT Act is much more general than Section NHPA in that it refers to properties other than those listed in the Register br The more general language has allowed more properties and parklands to enjoy status as protected areas by this legislation a policy developed early in its history The United States Supreme Court ruled in the case Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v Volpe that parklands could have the same protected status as historic sites br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Multiple property submission br br A multiple property submission MPS is a thematic group listing of the National Register of Historic Places that consists of related properties that share a common theme and can be submitted as a group Multiple property submissions must satisfy certain basic criteria for the group of properties to be included in the National Register br The process begins with the multiple property documentation form which acts as a cover document rather than the nomination to the National Register of Historic Places The purpose of the documentation form is to establish the basis of eligibility for related properties The information of the multiple property documentation form can be used to nominate and register related historic properties simultaneously or to establish criteria for properties that may be nominated in the future Thus additions to an MPS can occur over time br The nomination of individual properties in an MPS is accomplished in the same manner as other nominations The name of the thematic group denotes the historical theme of the properties It is considered the multiple property listing Once an individual property or a group of properties is nominated and listed in the National Register the multiple property documentation form combined with the individual National Register of Historic Places nomination forms constitute a multiple property submission br Examples of MPS include the Lee County Multiple Property Submission the Warehouses in Omaha the Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia and the Illinois Carnegie Libraries Before the term Multiple Property Submission was introduced in such listings were known as Thematic Resources such as the Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource or Multiple Resource Areas br br br Types of properties br br Listed properties are generally in one of five broad categories although there are special considerations for other types of properties that in anyone or into more specialized subcategories The five general categories for National Register properties are building structure site district and object In addition historic districts consist of contributing and non contributing properties br Buildings as defined by the National Register are distinguished in the traditional sense Examples include a house barn hotel church or similar construction They are created primarily to shelter human activity The term building as in outbuilding can be used to refer to historically and functionally related units such as a courthouse and a jail or a barn and a house br Structures differ from buildings in that they are functional constructions meant to be used for purposes other than sheltering human activity Examples include an aircraft a grain elevator a gazebo and a bridge br Objects are usually artistic in nature or small in scale compared to structures and buildings Although objects may be movable they are generally associated with a specific setting or environment Examples of objects include monuments sculptures and fountains br Sites are the locations of significant events which can be prehistoric or historic in nature and represent activities or buildings standing ruined or vanished When sites are listed it is the locations themselves that are of historical interest They possess cultural or archaeological value regardless of the value of any structures that currently exist at the locations Examples of types of sites include shipwrecks battlefields campsites natural features and rock shelters br Historic districts possess a concentration association or continuity of the other four types of properties Objects structures buildings and sites in a historic district are united historically or aesthetically either by choice or by the nature of their development br There are several other different types of historic preservation associated with the properties of the National Register of Historic Places that cannot be classified as either simple buildings or historic districts Through the National Park Service the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation of different types of properties Although the criteria are always the same the manner they are applied may differ slightly depending upon the type of property involved The National Register bulletins describe the application of the criteria for aids to navigation historic battlefields archaeological sites aviation properties cemeteries and burial places historic designed landscapes mining sites post offices properties associated with significant persons properties achieving significance within the last fifty years rural historic landscapes traditional cultural properties and vessels and shipwrecks br br br Property owner incentives br br Properties are not protected in any strict sense by the Federal listing States and local zoning bodies may or may not choose to protect listed historic places Indirect protection is possible by state and local regulations on the development of National Register properties and by tax incentives By contrast the state of Colorado for example does not set any limits on owners of National Register properties br Until federal tax incentives were virtually non existent for buildings on the National Register Before the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing sometimes historical structures In the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote the preservation of income producing historic properties The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior s Standards for Rehabilitation Properties and sites listed in the Register as well as those located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts became eligible for the federal tax benefits br Owners of income producing properties listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or of properties that are contributing resources within a National Register Historic District may be eligible for a investment tax credit for the rehabilitation of the historic structure The rehabilitation may be of a commercial industrial or residential property for rentals The tax incentives program is operated by the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program which is managed jointly by the National Park Service individual State Historic Preservation Offices and the Internal Revenue Service br Some property owners may also qualify for grants like the now defunct Save America s Treasures grants which apply specifically to properties entered in the Register with national significance or designated as National Historic Landmarks br The NHPA did not distinguish between properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places and those designated as National Historic Landmarks concerning qualification for tax incentives or grants This was deliberate as the authors of the act had learned from experience that distinguishing between categories of significance for such incentives caused the lowest category to become expendable Essentially this made the Landmarks a kind of honor roll of the most significant properties of the National Register of Historic Places br br br Misconceptions br br br year rule br In American historic preservation the year rule is the generally held belief that a property must be at least years old to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places In reality there is no hard rule John H Sprinkle Jr deputy director of the Federal Preservation Institute stated br br T his rule is only an exception to the criteria that shape listings within the National Register of Historic Places Of the eight exceptions or criteria considerations Consideration G for properties that have achieved significance within the past fifty years is probably the best known yet also misunderstood preservation principle in America br Each year a new group of resources crosses the year threshold The preservation of these underage resources has gained attention in recent years br br br Limitations br br As of properties have been removed from the Register most often due to being destroyed Among the properties that were demolished or otherwise destroyed after their listing are the Jobbers Canyon Historic District in Omaha Nebraska listed in demolished in Pan Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles California listed in destroyed in a fire in Palace Amusements in Asbury Park New Jersey listed in demolished in The Balinese Room in Galveston Texas listed in destroyed by Hurricane Ike in seven of the nine buildings included in the University of Connecticut Historic District in Storrs Connecticut listed in demolished in and the Terrell Jacobs Circus Winter Quarters in Peru Indiana listed in demolished in br br br Comparisons to historic registers of other nations br In France designation of monument historique is similar to NRHP listing In the French program however permanent restrictions are imposed upon designated monuments for example requiring advance approval for any renovation of a designated building NRHP listing imposes no such restrictions but rather is primarily an honor although tax subsidies may be available for renovations France had about monuments in br Listed buildings of the United Kingdom may not be demolished extended or altered without special permission the program covers about listings in involving more than buildings br In the U S has about NRHP listed properties including historic districts the total number of buildings covered is much larger br br br See also br br br br br br
