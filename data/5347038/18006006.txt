Passenger Program is a plan for seven railway commuter routes to serve the Atlanta suburbs and nearby cities br The Athens route will connect nine of Georgia s colleges and universities including Georgia Institute of Technology Georgia State University Emory University Georgia Gwinnett College and the University of Georgia Furthermore the commuter rail will link the Centers for Disease Control the new Paul D Coverdell Center for Biomedical and Health Sciences as well as the emerging BioScience Corridor along Georgia State Route br The route is estimated to divert million drivers from the highways by As many as individuals or more could conceivably use the system every day and it could remove cars daily from already overtaxed roadways during peak travel times Also previous studies have indicated that commuter rail is times safer than driving br br br See also br Transport portal br Georgia U S state portal br Plug in electric vehicles in Georgia U S state br Transportation in the
