Pacific Islander Americans also colloquially referred to as Islander Americans are Americans who are of Pacific Islander ancestry or are descendants of the indigenous peoples of Oceania or of Austronesian descent For its purposes the United States census also counts Aboriginal Australians as part of this group br Pacific Islander Americans make up of the U S population including those with partial Pacific Islander ancestry enumerating about million people The largest ethnic subgroups of Pacific Islander Americans are Native Hawaiians Samoans and Chamorros Much of the Pacific Islander population resides in Hawaii Alaska California Utah and Texas br Pacific Islanders may be considered Oceanian Americans but this group may include Australians and New Zealander origin people who can be of non Pacific Islander ethnicity Pacific Islander Americans are often mixed with other races especially European and Asian due to Pacific Islanders being a small population in most communities in mainland U S For instance most Hawaiian Americans are only part Hawaiian in ethnicity br American Samoa Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands are insular areas U S territories while Hawaii is a state br br br History br br br First stage Hawaiian migration th th centuries br br Migration from Oceania to the United States began in the last decade of the th century but the first migrants to arrive in the country were Native Hawaiians People from other Oceanian backgrounds except Australians and M ori did not migrate to the United States until the late th century The first Native Hawaiians to live in the present day United States were fur traders They were hired by British fur traders in Hawaii and taken to the northwestern United States from where trade networks developed with Honolulu However they charged less than Americans for doing the same jobs and returned to Hawaii when their contracts ended The first Native Hawaiians to live permanently in the United States settled in the Astoria colony in present day Oregon in having been brought there by its founder fur merchant John Jacob Astor Astor created the Pacific Fur Company in the colony and used the Native Hawaiians to build the city s infrastructure and houses and to develop the primary sector agriculture hunting and fishing The labor employment of the Native Hawaiians was done to make them serve the company although later most of them worked for North West Company when this company absorbed the Pacific Fur Company in br After Native Hawaiians continued to migrate to the Pacific Northwest They migrated to work in companies such as the Hudson s Bay Company which absorbed the North West Company in and the Columbia Fishing and Trading Company as well as in Christian missions Since some groups of Polynesian Protestant students immigrated to the United States to study theology Since the s another group of Native Hawaiians arrived on California s shores where they were traders and formed communities So they made up of the population of Yerba Buena now San Francisco in During the California Gold Rush many other Native Hawaiians migrated to California to work as miners br In the first Polynesian Mormon colony was founded in Utah and consisted of Native Hawaiians Tahitians Samoans and M ori Also in the late th century small groups of Pacific Islanders usually sailors moved to the western shores mainly on San Francisco Later the U S occupied Hawaii in Guam in and American Samoa in This fact diversified Oceanian emigration in the United States br br br Second stage th st centuries br However the first record of non Hawaiian Pacific Islanders in the United States is from with the first Guamanians living in the United States In the following decades small groups of people from islands such as Hawaii Guam Tonga or American Samoa emigrated to the United States Many of them were Mormons including most of Tongans and American Samoans who emigrated to help build Mormon churches or to seek an education either in Laie or Salt Lake City However the emigration of Pacific Islanders to the U S was small until the end of World War II when many American Samoans Guamanians who got the American citizenship in and Tongans emigrated to the United States Most of them were in the military or married with military people but some Pacific Islanders particularly Tongans looked for a job in several religious and cultural centers Since then the emigration increased and diversified every decade with a majority emigrating to the Western urban areas and Hawaii br This increase and diversification in the Oceanian emigration was especially true in the s In the population of Guam gained full American citizenship In the natives of American Samoa become American nationals although not American citizens through the Immigration and Nationality Act of Shortly thereafter the first major waves of migration from American Samoa and Guam emerged while other groups of places such as French Polynesia Palau or Fiji began to emigrate Over Pacific Islanders emigrated to the United States in the s mostly from American Samoa Guam and Tonga The first of them were Samoan military personnel who had worked at the American bases of Pago Pago but moved to the Honolulu s American bases when American Samoa began to be administered by the United States Department of the Interior as well as their relatives Most of the new Pacific Islander immigrants were Mormons and many islanders from the region emigrated to the United States seeking economic opportunities br In Hawaii became a state and its natives got U S citizenship This made more than people Americans many of them were Pacific Islanders both Native Hawaiians and people of other Oceanian origins Thus the Hawaiian migration to the continental U S began to increase In the s many more Pacific Islanders emigrated to the U S mainly due to increased migration from Guam Fiji Tonga and Samoa archipelago both independent and American Samoa The Pacific Islanders migrated by diverse reasons Many Guamanians fled the Korean War and Typhoon Karen and the Fijian population living in the U S skyrocketed from a few dozen people in the s to more than people The Pacific Islander migration increased especially since when the United States government facilitated the non European migration to the U S Many of them were recruited to pick fruit in California br During the s over nine thousand Pacific Islanders migrated to the U S mostly from Samoa both Western and American Guam Tonga and Fiji but also from other islands such as Federated States of Micronesia or Palau Many of these people emigrated to the U S to study at its universities Moreover in the s migration from the Pacific Islands to the United States became more diversified when this country acquired the Northern Marianas Islands in and signed an agreement with TTPI FSM Palau and the Marshall Islands called the Compact of Free Association The Compact of Free Association allows the inhabitants from TTPI to travel and work in the United States without visas On the other hand the Tyson Foods company which employed a significant part of the population of the Marshall Islands relocated many of its Marshellese employees in Springdale Arkansas where the company is based However most of Pacific Islanders continued to migrate to western urban areas and Hawaii More of five thousand Pacific Islanders migrated to the U S in the s settling mostly in western cities such as Los Angeles San Francisco Seattle or Salt Lake City In the U S census almost all the countries of Oceania were mentioned although only the ethnic groups mentioned in the article consisted of thousands of people In the s and s several thousands more Pacific Islanders emigrated to the United States br br br Population br br br Demography br In the and censuses the term Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander refers to people having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii Guam Tonga Samoa Fiji New Zealand and the Marshalls or other Pacific Islands Most of the Pacific Islander Americans are of Native Hawaiian Samoan and Chamorro origin br The fact that Hawaii is a U S state meaning that almost the entire native Hawaiian population lives in the U S as well as the migration high birth rate and miscegenation of the Pacific Islanders have favored the permanence and increase of this population in the U S especially in the number of people who are of partial Pacific Islander descent In the census over people claimed to be of Pacific Islander descent and in the census Americans claimed Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander as their race alone or in combination Most of them live in urban areas of Hawaii and California but they also have sizeable populations in Washington Utah Nevada Oregon Texas Florida Arizona and New York On the other hand Pacific Islander Americans represent the majority or are the main ethnic group in American Samoa Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands from where many of them are natives br br br Areas of origin br br br Melanesian Americans br Melanesian Americans are Americans of Melanesian descent br Most of them are of Fijian descent Most of Fijian Americans are of Fijian and Indian descent More than people of Fijian origin live in the U S Most of them live in California br Smaller communities of New Caledonian Papuan Vanuatuan and Solomon Islander origin also live in the U S br br br Micronesian Americans br Micronesian Americans are Americans of Micronesian descent or are Americans whose origins are in the Federated States of Micronesia br There are more than people living in the U S whose origins are in the Federated States of Micronesia Most of them live in Hawaii California Oregon and Texas as well as in Mariana Islands Another Americans are of Palauan descent br According to the census the largest Chamorro populations were located in California Washington and Texas but their combined number from these three states totaled less than half the number living throughout the U S It also revealed that the Chamorro people are the most geographically dispersed Oceanian ethnicity in the country br Marshallese Americans or Marshallese come from the Marshall Islands In the census Americans identified as being of Marshallese descent br Because of the Marshall Islands entering the Compact of Free Association in Marshallese have been allowed to migrate and work in the United States There are many reasons why Marshallese came to the United States Some Marshallese came for educational opportunities particularly for their children Others sought work or better health care than what is available in the islands Massive layoffs by the Marshallese government in led to a second big wave of immigration br Arkansas has the largest Marshallese population with over residents Many live in Springdale and the Marshallese constitute over of the city s population Other significant Marshallese populations include Spokane and Costa Mesa br Smaller communities of I Kiribati and Nauruan origins also live in the U S br br br Polynesian Americans br Polynesian Americans are Americans of Polynesian descent br Large subcategories of Polynesian Americans include Native Hawaiians and Samoan Americans In addition there are smaller communities of Tongan Americans French Polynesian Americans and M ori Americans br A Samoan American is an American who is of ethnic Samoan descent from either the independent nation Samoa or the American territory of American Samoa Samoan American is a subcategory of Polynesian American About people live on American Samoa while the U S censuses in and has found times the number of Samoan Americans live in the mainland U S br California has the most Samoans concentrations live in the San Francisco Bay Area Los Angeles County and San Diego County San Francisco has approximately people of Samoan ancestry and other Bay Area cities such as East Palo Alto and Daly City have Samoan communities In Los Angeles County Long Beach and Carson have abundant Samoan communities as well as in Oceanside in San Diego County Other West Coast metropolitan areas such as Seattle have strong Samoan communities mainly in King County and in Tacoma Anchorage Alaska and Honolulu Hawaii both have thousands of Samoan Americans residing in each city br Persons born in American Samoa are United States nationals but not United States citizens this is the only circumstance under which an individual would be one and not the other For this reason Samoans can move to Hawaii or the mainland United States and obtain citizenship comparatively easily Like Hawaiian Americans the Samoans arrived in the mainland in the th century as agricultural laborers and factory workers br Elsewhere in the United States Samoan Americans are plentiful throughout the state of Utah as well as in Killeen Texas Norfolk Virginia and Independence Missouri br A Tongan American is an American who is of ethnic Tongan descent Utah has the largest Tongan American population followed by Hawaii Many of the first Tongan Americans came to the United States in connection to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints They have strong presence in parts of Salt Lake Valley in Utah especially West Valley City and Salt Lake City Utah is roughly one percent Tongan a high rate compared to Tongans only making up less than a scant of the U S population Tongan communities are also more common in the west coast such as San Mateo County California some areas of the South Bay of Los Angeles and the Seattle Tacoma metropolitan area of Washington Portland Oregon is also home to a Tongan community that started to emigrate in the s The Dallas Texas suburb of Euless also has a Tongan population in the low thousands br Native Hawaiians are plentiful in Las Vegas br br br Location br br br Military br Based on recruiting data Pacific Islander Americans were over represented in the military br American Samoans are distinguished among the wider Pacific Islander group for enthusiasm for enlistment In a Chicago Tribune reporter covering the island s military service noted American Samoa is one of the few places in the nation where military recruiters not only meet their enlistment quotas but soundly exceed them As of March there have been American Samoans who have died in Iraq and who have died in Afghanistan br Pacific Islander Americans are also represented in the United States Navy SEALs making up of the enlisted and of the officers br br br Notes
