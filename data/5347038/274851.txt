title: Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority
id: 274851
The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority MARTA is the principal public transport operator in the Atlanta metropolitan area Formed in as strictly a bus system MARTA operates a network of bus routes linked to a rapid transit system consisting of miles km of rail track with subway stations MARTA s rapid transit system is the eighth largest rapid transit system in the United States by ridership br MARTA operates almost exclusively in Fulton Clayton and DeKalb counties although they maintain bus service to two destinations in neighboring Cobb County Six Flags Over Georgia and the Cumberland Transfer Center next to the Cumberland Mall while Doraville station serves portions of Gwinnett County via Ride Gwinnett buses MARTA also operates Mobility a separate paratransit service for disabled customers br In the entire system bus and subway lines had rides or about per weekday in the first quarter of MARTA s first bus rapid transit BRT line is currently under construction and is scheduled to open in Summer The mile line will run from downtown Atlanta through Summerhill and end at the Atlanta BeltLine The line named the Summerhill BRT Line will utilize new electric buses br br br History br br MARTA was originally proposed as a rapid transit agency for DeKalb Fulton Clayton Gwinnett and Cobb counties These were the five original counties in the Atlanta metropolitan area and to this day are the five largest counties in the region and state MARTA was formed by an act of the Georgia General Assembly in In the same year four of the five metropolitan area counties Clayton DeKalb Fulton and Gwinnett and the City of Atlanta passed a referendum authorizing participation in the system but the referendum failed in Cobb br Although a referendum to actually fund MARTA failed in voters in Fulton and DeKalb counties successfully passed a sales tax increase to pay for MARTA operations while Clayton and Gwinnett counties overwhelmingly rejected the tax in the referendum Gwinnett County remains outside of the MARTA system In November however Clayton County voters passed a sales tax to join the MARTA system reversing its decision Also in the agency agreed to purchase the existing bus only Atlanta Transit Company the sale of the company closed on February giving the agency control over all public transit in the immediate Atlanta area br Construction began on MARTA s heavy rail system in with the first rail service commencing on June The system has since built most of the proposed rail lines as well as stations in Dunwoody Sandy Springs and North Springs which were not included in the original plan The missing rail segments from the original plan include a Tucker North DeKalb line with service to Emory University and North Druid Hills a Northwest line with service to Brookwood and Northside Drive the extension of the West line to Brownlee Boulder Park near Fairburn Road the extension of the Proctor Creek line to West Highlands and a branch off the south line to Hapeville and Clayton County br Georgia State University was contracted to undergo archaeological excavations of rail construction areas in the late s with the MARTA Archeology Project Artifacts from the excavations are still housed at GSU br br br System br Interactive map of the MARTA rail system and the Atlanta Streetcar br MARTA is composed of a heavy rail rapid transit system a light rail system and a bus system all of which operate primarily within the boundaries of Fulton Clayton and DeKalb counties In addition to Atlanta itself the transit agency serves various suburbs within its service area including Alpharetta Avondale Estates Brookhaven Chamblee Clarkston College Park Decatur Doraville Dunwoody East Point Ellenwood Fairburn Forest Park Hapeville Jonesboro Lake City Lovejoy Lithonia Morrow Palmetto Riverdale Roswell Sandy Springs Stone Mountain and Union City MARTA also serves the airport via a station located next to the main terminal Although Cobb County is not part of the MARTA system the agency operates one limited bus route to the Cumberland Boulevard Transfer Center and another to Six Flags Over Georgia br MARTA allows bicycles on its trains and buses have room for two bicycles on racks mounted on the front of the bus At the airport bicycles can be locked up in all of the parking decks so long as they are not obstructing either pedestrian or vehicular traffic br In MARTA had full and part time employees of whom were bus drivers or train operators Rail and bus operators station agents rail maintenance workers and many other employees of MARTA are represented in negotiations by the Amalgamated Transit Union s Local br br br Subway Metro br br MARTA s rapid transit system has miles km of route and rail stations located on four lines the Red Line prior to October known as the North South Line Gold Line former Northeast South Line Blue Line former East West Line and Green Line former Proctor Creek Line The tracks for this system are a combination of elevated ground level and subway tracks br The deepest Subway station in the MARTA system is the Peachtree Center station which is located in a hard rock tunnel feet m beneath the city where the highest hills in Atlanta are feet m above sea level No tunnel lining was installed in this station or the adjacent tunnels The architects and civil engineers decided to leave these with their rugged gneiss rock walls The highest station in the MARTA system is the King Memorial station It rises feet m over a former CSX rail yard br MARTA switched to a color based identification system in October Formerly the lines were named based upon their terminal stations namely Airport Doraville North Springs H E Holmes Bankhead King Memorial Candler Park Indian Creek or by their compass direction During the transition between the two naming systems all stations on the Red and Gold lines used their original orange signs and all stations on the Blue and Green lines used their original blue signs br All rapid transit lines have an ultimate nexus at the Five Points station located in downtown Atlanta MARTA trains are operated using the Automatic Train Control system with one human operator per train to make announcements operate doors and to operate the trains manually in case of a control system malfunction or an emergency Many of the suburban stations have free daily and paid long term parking in park and ride lots These stations also have designated Park and Ride passenger drop off areas close to the stations entrances br br br Streetcar br br The Atlanta Streetcar is a modern streetcar route that is powered by an overhead line and operates in mixed vehicle traffic The system was constructed by the City of Atlanta and was integrated into MARTA operations on July The streetcar operates on a mile km pinched loop system in Downtown Atlanta br br br Rolling stock br br The Atlanta Streetcar system uses Siemens S light rail vehicles LRVs A total of four S cars were purchased and were built at two different facilities the cars themselves were built in Sacramento California while most other major components like the propulsion system were assembled at a plant about miles km north of Atlanta in Alpharetta They were delivered in the first months of and are numbered br br br Bus br br MARTA s bus system serves a wider area than the rail system serving areas in Fulton Clayton and DeKalb counties such as the cities of Roswell and Alpharetta in North Fulton along with South DeKalb MARTA bus service for Clayton County became effective March As of MARTA has diesel and compressed natural gas buses that covers over bus routes that operated million annual vehicle miles million kilometers MARTA has one bus route providing limited service in Cobb County Route has been extended to Cobb County s Cumberland Boulevard Transfer Center As of June MARTA purchased New Flyer Industries Xcelsior XN which are primarily used on route Buford Highway the busiest bus route in the system All of the MARTA bus lines except for routes and feed into or intersect MARTA rail lines as well MARTA shuttle service is available to Six Flags Over Georgia during the park s summer season br In addition to the free parking adjacent to many rail stations MARTA also operates five park and ride lots serviced only by bus routes Windward Parkway Mansell Road Stone Mountain Barge Road and South Fulton br br br Route list br br br Paratransit br In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA MARTA provides the Mobility paratransit service for those persons defined as disabled by the ADA MARTA uses special lift equipped vehicles for this service and can either deliver passengers to their final destination curb to curb service or can deliver the passenger to the closest accessible bus stop or rail station feeder service Mobility is limited to existing rail and bus routes and cannot extend more than a mile km radius from any existing route Mobility service is only provided during the hours of the fixed route servicing the area An application for acceptance into the Mobility service is required reservations are required for each trip In fiscal year MARTA provided Mobility trips br The average cost to MARTA for providing a one way trip for an individual Mobility passenger is US This is much greater than the US fare the Mobility rider is required to pay The Americans with Disabilities Act forbids MARTA from charging a Mobility fare more than twice the normal fixed route fare br A federal civil lawsuit Martin v Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority was brought by several disabled riders who alleged MARTA was violating the ADA by failing to provide bus schedule and route information in an accessible format buses with working wheelchair lifts stop announcements on rail and bus routes and adequate staff to schedule and provide on time Mobility service The district court ruled in that MARTA had violated the ADA and granted the plaintiffs an injunction requiring MARTA to improve service to the disabled br br br Fare structure and operation br br Currently the one way full fare for MARTA costs US New Breeze cards are Breeze Tickets carry an extra fee of Passengers over passengers with disabilities and Medicare recipients are eligible to receive a discounted fare of A one way paratransit fare is Ten full fare one way trips can be purchased for and twenty full fare trips can be purchased at a discount for MARTA also offers unlimited travel through multiple transit pass options Hour pass day pass day pass day pass day pass and a day pass for Additional discounted pass programs allow for university students and staff to purchase calendar monthly passes Additional discounts are available to corporate partners who sell monthly MARTA passes to employees and also to groups and conventions visiting Atlanta Some employers at their own expense also provide reduced cost or free MARTA passes to employees to encourage the use of public transportation Children up to inches cm can ride for free with fare paying rider limit is br Free shuttles also operate within the MARTA area but are not part of MARTA The Buckhead Uptown Connection The BUC goes around Buckhead Atlanta s uptown section and its third major business district behind downtown and midtown This includes Lenox Square mall and the many high rises and skyscrapers built along Peachtree Road The Atlantic Station Shuttle offers service between the Arts Center MARTA Station and the Atlantic Station neighborhood of Midtown Georgia Tech operates the Tech trolley between central campus Technology Square and the Midtown MARTA Station as well as Stinger buses around its campus Emory University operates The Cliff shuttle buses in and around its campus The Clifton Corridor Transportation Management Association CCTMA operates a shuttle connecting Emory with downtown Decatur and the Decatur MARTA station br Due to the COVID outbreak in March MARTA introduced free fares to bus rides which ended early September The free fare modification did not apply to rail fares br br br Breeze Card br br MARTA finished implementing the Breeze smart card electronic fare collection system in September replacing the previous token based fare collection system The new Breeze Card allows riders to load money on the card for use over time and to add unlimited day passes that are not fixed to a calendar period The Breeze Card is for every passenger riding MARTA The new Breeze fare gates are designed to help prevent fare evasion with the older fare collection system fare evasion was much easier and was estimated to cost MARTA million per year Other connecting transit systems such as GRTA Xpress and CobbLinc also use the Breeze system br MARTA stopped selling tokens after the Breeze conversion Cards without fare were sent by mail for free to those who requested them when the system was first implemented br To protect against hacking problems experienced by the then current Breeze Card MARTA rolled out a new Breeze Card in January The new card costs br br br Hours of operation br br MARTA operates every day Rail service is provided from approximately am to am Monday to Friday and am to am on Saturday Sunday most holidays During certain events New Year s Eve trains run until a m Trains also run all night during winter storms though not in passenger service to prevent ice from forming on non underground lines On weekdays trains run every minutes on all rail lines from the beginning of service until am From am am and pm pm trains run every minutes on all rail lines From am pm and pm pm trains run every minutes on all rail lines From pm until the end of service trains run every minutes on all rail lines MARTA s Red Line rail service only operates between North Springs and Lindbergh Center stations after pm MARTA s Green Line rail service only operates between Bankhead and Vine City stations after pm Monday Friday with the exception of public holidays and track work performed by the authority On weekends and public holidays trains run every minutes on all rail lines Bus routes have varying frequencies dependent upon passenger demand br br br Fare reciprocity br Through formal fare reciprocity agreements MARTA riders are able to transfer for free to the three other metro Atlanta transit systems Ride Gwinnett CobbLinc and GRTA Xpress Some of these agreements require that neither system have significantly more transfers than the other MARTA has stated that this is the case that inbound to MARTA from another system and outbound from MARTA to another system transfers are approximately equal for second quarter daily passengers transferred inbound and transferred outbound Analysis of morning transfers to am to MARTA shows that Cobb County had inbound transfers but only outbound Gwinnett County had inbound and outbound and GRTA Xpress had inbound but outbound Some have suggested that more people from the other systems may benefit from free transfers than those living in the MARTA service area It has also been noted that workers traveling in the morning to Atlanta from another system will more than likely make the return trip home resulting in an equal number of transfers br br br Funding br br br Sales tax br In addition to fare collections the MARTA budget is funded by a sales tax in Fulton Clayton and DeKalb counties along with limited federal money In the City of Atlanta raised their sales tax for MARTA to to improve and expand MARTA For fiscal year MARTA had a farebox recovery ratio of By law funds from the sales tax must be split evenly between MARTA s operational and Capital expenditure budgets This restriction does not apply to other sources of revenue including passenger revenue The split was written into MARTA legislation at MARTA s formation with the rationale that MARTA should continue expanding and investing in the system Nonetheless MARTA has no active heavy rail construction projects Capital funds continue to decrease every year creating a shortfall The operations funds limit the amount of service MARTA provides The sales tax law was amended by the state legislature in to allow a temporary three year capital operations split This additional for operations expired in A bill to renew the split was tabled by the legislature s MARTA Oversight Committee forcing MARTA to pass a new budget with cuts in service The temporary capital operations split was renewed again in the state legislative session The capital funds surplus has resulted in projects such as a new US million Breeze Card fare collection system and US million automatic toilets in the MARTA Five Points station occurring at the same time that MARTA is struggling to pay for bus and rail operations In the Georgia General Assembly approved a new bill that no longer requires MARTA to split the Sales Tax Due to low Sales Tax Revenue and no source of funding from the State of Georgia MARTA was forced to eliminate bus routes eliminate shuttles Excluding the Six Flags Over Georgia and Braves Shuttle and reduce Rail Service frequencies and hours MARTA also closed the majority of its station restrooms There are station restrooms open to the public most of which are located at the terminus of each line and which include College Park Arts Center Peachtree Center West End Avondale Kensington and Lindbergh Center There are two Ridestores available located at the Airport and Five Points Rail Stations Despite the massive cuts MARTA predicted the system would still come up million dollars short for FY which was pulled from their Reserved Account A million addition was posted for This money was reinvested into the system by adding frequency to trains and bus routes br The current sales tax was set to be reduced to in In early MARTA made a request to the City of Atlanta DeKalb County and Fulton County to seek a year extension of the sales tax from to with a sales tax from to This is the fourth time in its history that MARTA sought the extension the most recent in MARTA said the commitment to the tax is needed for the agency to secure long term financing in the form of bonds to pay for any future expansions to the system The resolution called for four new routes bus rapid transit from H E Holmes station to Fulton Industrial Boulevard bus rapid transit from Garnett station to Stonecrest Mall transit for the BeltLine and a direct transit link from Lindbergh Center to Emory University formerly called the C Loop To approve the tax extension two of the three government agencies needed to agree to the extension In March the City of Atlanta voted to approve the extension In April the DeKalb County Commission also approved the sales tax extension Some Fulton county officials opposed the sales tax extension on the basis that the proposed service expansions did not include previously proposed expansion of the North Rail line to Roswell and Alpharetta in North Fulton County br br br State funding controversy br MARTA was formed through the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority Act of an act of the Georgia General Assembly In addition to allowing the formation of the agency and the collection of revenue from taxes the legislation previously placed restrictions on how the agency managed its funds In particular the legislation established that any funds raised from the sale of bonds and capital goods would be spent on capital expenditures and that any extra proceeds be put aside for paying off bond debt While the enabling legislation put restrictions on how MARTA could manage its money MARTA has never received any operational funding from the State of Georgia making it the largest public transportation agency in the United States and the second largest transit agency in Anglo America after the Toronto Transit Commission not to receive state or provincial funding for operational expenses The funding restrictions on MARTA were removed in with the passage of House Bill by the General Assembly br In early April MARTA experienced a budget crisis when the Georgia General Assembly failed to pass a bill that would allow MARTA to access its own capital reserve account in order to compensate for a severe drop in sales tax revenue during the late s recession MARTA stated that this could force the agency to discontinue operations one day out of the week possibly a weekday The agency s budget crisis forced MARTA to lay off employees Service cuts and other budget stabilizing measures began in fiscal year with the first affected service mark up in September Governor Sonny Perdue refused to call a special session as requested and did not issue an executive order as he stated it would not be legal to do so br br br Governance br MARTA is a joint powers authority that is governed by a board of directors consisting of representatives appointed from the city of Atlanta members and the remainder of the counties of Fulton members Clayton members and DeKalb members Additionally there is representative from the Georgia Department of Transportation and representative from Georgia Regional Transportation Authority who also serve as non voting members br Positions on the MARTA board are directly appointed by the organizations they represent Although the state of Georgia does not contribute to MARTA s operational funding it still has voting members on the MARTA board A similar situation existed for both Clayton and Gwinnett counties during most of MARTA s history as a consequence of passing the authorization referendum but not the funding referendum Gwinnett County have representation on the MARTA Board of Directors without paying into the system This situation became controversial in when Gwinnett s representative Mychal Walker was found to have accepted US from a lobbyist trying to secure a US million contract with MARTA Despite the controversy as well as a MARTA board ruling that Walker violated the MARTA ethics policy the Gwinnett County Commission initially failed to remove Mr Walker from his position on the MARTA Board Eventually the state legislature was called upon to change the law governing MARTA s Board to allow for the removal of a member whose appointing county did not act on a request for removal Before the new law could be used Mr Walker was arrested on an unrelated child support violation which resulted in his firing by the Gwinnett County Commission br The highest position at MARTA is the general manager and chief executive officer Below is a list of people that have held the position br br MARTA s General Manager was Richard McCrillis from to In October McCrillis retired after years of service at MARTA br In October Dr Beverly A Scott was named the new general manager Prior to joining MARTA Dr Scott served as GM CEO of the Sacramento Regional Transit District She has over years of experience in the transportation industry After years at MARTA she decided not to renew her contract with MARTA s board of directors Scott s last day was December br Keith Parker was MARTA s General Manager CEO from December October br Jeffrey A Parker served as MARTA s General Manager CEO position starting in until his death in br Collie Greenwood assumed responsibilities as interim MARTA CEO on January Prior to his role as interim CEO Greenwood was MARTA s deputy general manager for operations br The Georgia General Assembly has a standing committee that is charged with financial oversight of the agency During the legislative session Representative Jill Chambers the MARTOC chairperson at the time introduced a bill that would place MARTA under GRTA and permanently remove the requirement that MARTA split its expenditures between capital and operations This would allow MARTA to avoid service cuts at times when sales tax revenue is low due to recession without having to ask the state legislature for temporary exemptions typically a split as it has received before The bill was not passed but the funding restrictions were removed in br br br Performance and safety br During the fiscal year MARTA had a customer satisfaction rate of On time performance for rail service was The mean distance between rail service interruptions was miles km and the mean distance between bus failures was miles km br br MARTA has had two fatal accidents that resulted in a formal investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board On February a train near Avondale station struck two automatic train control technicians who were inspecting a relay box one was fatally injured and the other technician suffered serious injuries The workers had failed to apply for a safe clearance restriction for the track work In addition the rail system center controller who was aware of the workers failed to notify train drivers of the technicians presence A second accident occurred on April when a train struck a bucket lift containing two contract workers at Lenox station the workers were fatally injured Although the MARTA employee who was accompanying the workers notified the rail control center of the work over the track the control center employee failed to block off the section of the track in the automated rail control system and also failed to notify the unscheduled southbound train of the workers presence In MARTA settled with the families of the two killed workers for US million br In addition to these accidents MARTA trains have derailed five times in recent years The most recent incident occurred in January when an out of service train derailed between Airport station and College Park station The operator was not injured A previous derailment occurred on December Medical Center station when a train carrying passengers was moved over a rail switch No injuries were reported In July during Atlanta s hosting of the Olympics a paired car on a train that had developed mechanical problems was uncoupled from other cars at Indian Creek station the last station on the east line The train began rolling crashing through the bumper at the end of the rail line and running off of the track The train operator the only person on board received minor injuries In June a minor derailment occurred at the junction between the North and Northeast lines MARTA estimated people were aboard The derailment occurred when a rail supervisor told the train driver to reverse the train after realizing the train had gone the wrong way at a track split a MARTA investigation of the incident showed the derailment caused of damage to the train and track and caused injury to passengers And in August a minor derailment occurred at a switch between Candler Park and Inman Park Approximately passengers were on board and no one was injured br On December MARTA had three separate escalator accidents that injured at least people The incidents occurred as large crowds were going to the Chick fil A Bowl Two escalators failed at Five Points station and one escalator failed at Dome GWCC Philips Arena CNN Center station MARTA initially blamed the incidents on rowdy patrons jumping on the escalator A subsequent formal investigation showed that the braking systems and a weak motor were to blame for the incidents br In September a Fulton County jury awarded a woman for injuries received in an accident at the Peachtree Center station MARTA has been criticized for its escalator maintenance policies after recent injuries due to escalators overloading but has discussed plans to improve its policies and regulate passenger loads with posted station agents br br br Expansion plans br br br Previous expansion plans br MARTA was built with at least three stubs for rail lines that were never built The Northwest Line towards Cobb County has a stub tunnel east of Atlantic Station but that redevelopment has not been built with a MARTA station in mind and Cobb County would instead most likely get a light rail or commuter rail system neither of which have been studied or a bus rapid transit service see Northwest Corridor HOV BRT The Northwest line was reduced to two planned stations but was later dropped entirely br The South Line s branch to Hapeville was considered for extension into Clayton County as far away as Forest Park but this idea was also cut off when the voters of that county initially refused to approve tax funding for the line Another idea for a rail spur line spur was for an above ground line from near the International Airport for a spur line to the town of Hapeville but no work has been initiated The idea to revive expansion plans in the form of heavy rail and bus was approved to go once again before voters in November by the Clayton county commissioners in July with a sales tax providing the funding for said expansion This time the referendum was approved and Clayton County voted to join MARTA the system s first ever expansion outside of Fulton Dekalb and the city of Atlanta br Yet another proposed spur line would have branched off the Blue Line in DeKalb County Called the Tucker North Dekalb Line it would have run northeast to the area of North Druid Hills Emory University and the town of Tucker Now under consideration is an idea for light rail line rather than heavy rail from Avondale Station to Lindbergh Center via Emory CDC br The Northeast Line of the rail system which has ended in Doraville for two decades was considered for extension into Gwinnett County as far as northeast as Norcross Georgia but this idea was cut off when the voters of that county declined to approve sales tax funding for it br The Proctor Creek branch was also projected to go one more station northwestward to the West Highlands neighborhood but no work has been done on that one either br Expansion westward to Fulton Industrial Boulevard through the use of either heavy rail extension or bus rapid transit has been proposed as an extension of the West Line since the system was originally planned br The final three MARTA rail stations to be built Dunwoody Sandy Springs and North Springs all north of the Interstate Perimeter were opened in The tracks to those stations were run on the surface of the median strip of Georgia which was constructed just east of the Buckhead area as a tollway during the early s This is one of just two places at which the MARTA rail system extends outside of Interstate The other is at the Indian Creek Station in eastern DeKalb County br Since there have been no active railway expansion projects in the MARTA system due to lack of additional sales tax funding the need to spend its limited capital budget on refurbishing its older rolling stock replacing the fare collection system repairing the tracks and their electrical systems and other long term maintenance repair and operations requirements br br br Mall at Stonecrest Expansion br Eastward expansion focuses on bus rapid transit from downtown Atlanta along I and extension of heavy rail transit from Indian Creek station south along I to I then east along the I corridor to the Mall at Stonecrest The current Green Line would also be extended east from its current terminus at Edgewood Candler Park station to Mall at Stonecrest This proposed extension has not been studied further since br br br Memorial Drive BRT br Currently the only recent expansion in the entire MARTA system was the development of bus rapid transit along Memorial Drive from Kensington Station to the Goldsmith Road MARTA park and ride lot in Stone Mountain and Ponce De Leon Avenue Bus Service started operating on September The bus had two routes The Q Express runs between MARTA s Kensington Station and a free car Park and Ride lot at Goldsmith Road Memorial Drive The Express only stops twice along the way at North Hairston Road and again at Georgia Perimeter College br The Q Limited also ran north along Memorial Drive from Kensington Station but branched off at North Hairston Road on the way to East Ponce de Leon Avenue The Q Limited had four stops along the way in addition the same stops for the Express The implementation of revenue collecting service had initially been planned for early br Due to low ridership BRT service was discontinued br br br Atlanta BeltLine br br Additionally several traffic corridors are currently being studied by MARTA for possible system expansion The BeltLine is a current proposal for the use of light rail and possibly bus or streetcar service on existing railroad rights of way around Atlanta s central business districts The conversion of existing rail right of way to the proposed BeltLine also calls for the creation of three additional MARTA rapid transit stations where existing lines intersect the Belt Line at Simpson Road Hulsey Yard and Murphy Crossing br br br Clifton Corridor br br Rapid transit alternatives are as of October under consideration for the Clifton Corridor from Lindbergh Center following the CSX rail corridor to Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control with possible continuation along the northern edge of Decatur on to Avondale MARTA station Bus light rail and heavy rail rapid transit options had been considered with light rail being selected as the preferred option br br br Connect br The Georgia Transit Initiative also known as Connect is a MARTA project to study options for expanding high capacity transit along the Georgia State Route corridor into the northern reaches of Fulton county The initiative kicked off in December envisages an mile extension of rapid transit service starting in the south at North Springs Transit Station the current terminus of the existing MARTA Red Line From there such an extension would continue northward through the cities of Sandy Springs Roswell and Alpharetta terminating in the vicinity of Windward Parkway br As of the fifth public meeting on the subject on September the study had narrowed the field of transit technology alternatives to three all using existing right of way along SR heavy rail transit HRT extending the Red Line northward light rail transit LRT or bus rapid transit BRT Early designs for all three options include stations near Northridge Road Holcomb Bridge Road Mansell Road North Point Mall and Windward Parkway initial sketches of the LRT and BRT options also include a station near Old Milton Parkway br As of June the project is moving into the Environmental Impact study stage of the planning process According to MARTA Representatives at the April meetings the expansion could open in at the earliest assuming a best case scenario Federal funding is still not approved the Environmental Impact study must be complete By the April meeting the LRT option has been discarded The HRT option has been approved as the Locally Preferred Alternative though two BRT options exist one that would run in a dedicated bus guideway and the other to integrate with Georgia DOT s planned work for the corridor The GDOT integrated option would include sharing normal traffic lanes at least in some parts of the route The plans for stations at Mansell Rd and Haynes Bridge Rd have been merged into one station at North Point Mall br As of June the project s adopted alternative is bus rapid transit BRT style bus service utilizing express lanes along new toll lanes Heavy rail expansion will not be considered according to the signed House Bill HB br br br Proposed new infill stations br Adding another station to the existing line near Armour Yard MARTA s main railyard opened has also been discussed as the Red and Gold MARTA lines the northeast BeltLine light rail proposed commuter rail lines to points northeast such as Athens the Brain Train and Gainesville would all pass through Armour Yard Other stations that have been proposed are Mechanicsville Boone Murphy Crossing and Krog br The proposed Atlanta Multimodal Passenger Terminal MMPT would be built next to Five Points station connecting MARTA to surface passenger rail including commuter rail future intercity rail Amtrak and possible high speed rail in the Southeast Corridor br Additional expansion plans for MARTA and other metro Atlanta transportation agencies are detailed in Mobility a timeline by the Atlanta Regional Commission for improving transit through the year br In March Mayor Andre Dickens announced that four new infill stations would be constructed across the network including at Murphy Crossing intersecting with the BeltLine as well as at Krog Street Joseph E Boone and Armour Yards br br br Clayton County br br On July the Clayton County Board of Commissioners by a margin of Jeff Turner Shana Rooks and Sonna Gregory voting in favor approved a contract with MARTA to extend service to the county financed by a percent sales tax Fulton and DeKalb county leaders approved the expansion On November Clayton County residents approved the sales tax to join MARTA Bus Service was implemented on March The contract also includes provisions for future rail transit to the county by br One high capacity rail proposal calls for stations at Hapeville Mountain View ATL Hartsfield International Terminal Forest Park Fort Gillem Clayton State Morrow Morrow Southlake and Jonesboro by A station at Lovejoy is also proposed which would open as a later phase In commuter rail was selected as the locally preferred alternative of transit mode along the corridor br As of this project is defunct and there are no plans to implement rail service in Clayton County Additional bus service is proposed br br br Gwinnett County br In September MARTA s board of directors and the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners gave conditional approval to an agreement that would see MARTA assume and significantly expand operations of Gwinnett s bus system in operation since and clear the way for the long sought after extension of MARTA s rail system into the county from its current terminus at Doraville The population of Gwinnett County has significantly increased and become more racially and ethnically diverse since the last time the county rejected joining MARTA Whereas white business elites were the initial demographic to support the MARTA in most black voters had voted to fund transit Large communities of rural white Georgians opposed MARTA br The original plan in includes a detailed multi year plan to expand heavy rail rapid transit in Gwinnett County Some aspects of the Connect Gwinnett plan will include a train that runs every ten minutes and also get more buses to take people to the MARTA station This was possible because Georgia Legislature permitted counties to raise taxes to fund transit which before was not allowed The contract with MARTA would go into effect only if a public vote that was scheduled for March succeeded The agreement called for a new one cent sales tax that would be collected in Gwinnett County until On March the third transit referendum failed with of the vote being No to expand A fourth transit referendum was added to the ballot during the presidential election which failed by a margin of slightly more than voters as of voters chose to vote against the referendum br br br Criticism and concern br Criticism of MARTA has originated from many different groups Opponents of MARTA are critical of MARTA s perceived inefficiency and alleged wasteful spending Supporters of MARTA are critical of the almost complete lack of state and regional support of MARTA In recent years additional concerns have been raised regarding the reliability of service as well as the governing structure of MARTA br br br Lack of regional financial support br Since the formation of MARTA the Georgia state government has never contributed to MARTA operational funding Currently MARTA is the largest mass transportation system in the United States not to receive state funding Revenue from the Georgia motor fuel tax is currently restricted to roads and bridges and cannot be used for public transportation further complicating potential sources of state funding for MARTA In addition the other largest two suburban counties Gwinnett and Cobb counties have refused to join or fund MARTA Both Gwinnett and Clayton counties initially agreed to join MARTA but refused MARTA rail and bus service when voters in their respective counties voted against paying to help fund the system Clayton County finally joined MARTA in November Gwinnett along with Cobb County created independent bus transit Cobb Community Transit on July Gwinnett County Transit on November A separate regional bus transit service Xpress is operated by the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority in partnership with metro Atlanta counties including Fulton and DeKalb and began service on June br The MARTA Board members are criticized for not being regular users of MARTA and thus are not actually aware of the concerns of MARTA commuters Former CEO Keith Parker was known for commuting daily from Dunwoody to the headquarters using the Red Line br Due to no funding from the state of Georgia and its limited funding from Fulton Clayton and DeKalb counties MARTA has struggled for many years to provide adequate service to the metropolitan area As a result MARTA has gained a notorious reputation throughout the metro Atlanta area for being ineffective and inconvenient Many people who own cars avoid using the system altogether while residents in suburban areas usually drive their car to a MARTA rail station instead of using bus service if their job is near an adjacent one MARTA s financial structure being tied to a sales tax has forced the agency to cut services during times of economic depression further resulting in complaints about the inconvenience and inadequacy of MARTA services br Although surrounding counties do not pay for MARTA many of their residents use MARTA by driving directly to a MARTA station or by using a county or regional bus system that connects to MARTA A license plate study from to showed that of the cars parked in MARTA park and ride lots were from outside of Fulton and DeKalb counties Current fare reciprocity agreements also allow non paying counties to provide bus service for their residents that provide free connections to MARTA see Fare reciprocity According to a MARTA ridership study of MARTA riders live outside of MARTA s service area br br br Effects of race on expansion and funding br It is often argued that racial politics also play a role in the operation and future service planning for MARTA Opponents of Georgia s transportation policies have alleged a race based two tiered system where billions are spent by the state on highway expansion to aid the automobile commutes of mostly White residents of the suburbs and rural areas like GRIP while service cuts at MARTA have hurt mostly African Americans in low income areas where residents cannot afford automobile ownership Proponents contest that a portion of state funding for highways comes from the gasoline tax a user fee analogous to the fare MARTA riders pay Supporters of MARTA have alleged that the lack of participation by other metro Atlanta counties is rooted in racism and classism In David Chesnut then chairman of MARTA stated The development of a regional transit system in the Atlanta area is being held hostage to race and I think it s high time we admitted it and talked about it As part of its Title VI plan MARTA data revealed that percent of MARTA riders were Black in MARTA is sometimes sarcastically said to stand for Moving Africans Rapidly Through Atlanta a replacement backronym due to the relatively low number of white riders particularly outside of rush hours br br br Criminal activity br Despite a strong safety record throughout MARTA s history there have been continued concerns regarding criminal activity on MARTA trains and in and around MARTA train stations In the aftermath of a aggravated assault against the daughter of a Georgia State University professor complaints were made that MARTA was underreporting its annual crime statistics A review of the previous year s records by MARTA s audit office and the state legislature s MARTA Oversight Committee MARTOC showed no deliberate underreporting of crime but rather over reporting of crime because MARTA included crimes not related to the rail line and did not adhere to the Uniform Crime Reporting system reporting multiple crimes by the same person instead of only the most serious crime br According to Federal Transit Administration records MARTA s crime statistics are in line with those of similar sized systems such as Bay Area Rapid Transit in the San Francisco Bay area Nonetheless high profile crimes on or near MARTA have created the impression with some that MARTA is unsafe and lacks a strong police presence even though it has its own police department From to two homicides and one rape were reported on MARTA property The most common crime reported was larceny The most common area for crime was MARTA s rail service followed by MARTA s parking lots For fiscal year MARTA had a crime rate of per million riders with crimes reported during the entire year br Suburban counties have opposed expanding MARTA on the basis that it would lead to increased crime as well as the cost of expansion and the lack of perceived necessity to areas currently outside MARTA transit It is alleged that because MARTA s service area includes some of Atlanta s most economically depressed and high crime neighborhoods expansion of MARTA would supposedly allow crime to spread to suburban areas Then MARTA CEO Dr Scott acknowledged that assumption and cites a study that did not find transit systems to nucleate crime Other counterarguments often cite the case of the Washington Metro which provides services in economically depressed areas with limited problems in suburban Washington D C stops br br br Reliability of service br br As is typical of rail transit in the United States MARTA s rail lines have two parallel tracks Any train failure or track work results in shared use of the other track by trains going opposite directions a situation known as single tracking There are no plans at this time to expand the number of tracks MARTA is currently nearing the end of a complete replacement of tracks on all rail lines Over the past few years this replacement work has caused the agency to implement single tracking on the weekends which in turn has caused weekend patrons to experience less frequent service br In the summer of as a result of unusually high summertime temperatures many MARTA rail cars became overheated damaging on board propulsion equipment As a result many trains broke down and had to be taken out of service for repair This was further compounded by the fact that at any given time up to older rail cars were out of service as part of MARTA s rail car rehabilitation project To compensate for the reduced number of operating rail cars MARTA shortened trains from six to four cars in length This sometimes resulted in almost half of the trains being shortened creating crowded conditions for passengers br br br Misuse of funds by employees for personal expenses br In internal and external audits of MARTA corporate spending revealed personal charges on a pair of MARTA credit cards used by former General Manager and CEO Nathaniel Ford and two of his secretaries Ford s charges included at a golf pro shop in clothing from Men s Wearhouse and a visit to the dentist In response to the audit Ford sent MARTA a check for as reimbursement for the charges An additional credit card with charges involving two of his secretaries Iris Anthony and Stephannie Smart was also uncovered Smart used the cards to pay approximately in private expenses and subsequently agreed to repay this amount to MARTA br br br Incidents br br On April two MARTA contract workers repairing the ceiling of MARTA s Lenox Station were killed when an unscheduled MARTA train struck the bucket of the self propelled lift they were in As a result the Georgia Department of Transportation GDOT audited MARTA operations and enforced changes to rule compliance by MARTA employees br On October year old Joetavius Stafford was killed by a MARTA police officer at the Vine City rail station MARTA claims that Stafford was armed while his brother said he was unarmed After a full investigation there was evidence that Stafford was armed and the MPO was cleared br In June a MARTA contractor died after being struck by a train while working on the tracks between Buckhead and North Springs stations br On January MARTA CEO Jeffrey Parker committed suicide by stepping in
