title: Telephone numbering plan
id: 627405
A telephone numbering plan is a type of numbering scheme used in telecommunication to assign telephone numbers to subscriber telephones or other telephony endpoints Telephone numbers are the addresses of participants in a telephone network reachable by a system of destination code routing Telephone numbering plans are defined in each of the administrative regions of the public switched telephone network PSTN and in private telephone networks br For public numbering systems geographic location typically plays a role in the sequence of numbers assigned to each telephone subscriber Many numbering plan administrators subdivide their territory of service into geographic regions designated by a prefix often called an area code or city code which is a set of digits forming the most significant part of the dialing sequence to reach a telephone subscriber br Numbering plans may follow a variety of design strategies which have often arisen from the historical evolution of individual telephone networks and local requirements A broad division is commonly recognized between closed and open numbering plans A closed numbering plan as found in North America features fixed length area codes and local numbers while an open numbering plan has a variance in the length of the area code local number or both of a telephone number assigned to a subscriber line The latter type developed predominantly in Europe br The International Telecommunication Union ITU has established a comprehensive numbering plan designated E for uniform interoperability of the networks of its member state or regional administrations It is an open numbering plan however imposing a maximum length of digits to telephone numbers The standard defines a country code for each member region which is prefixed to each national telephone number for international destination routing br Private numbering plans exist in telephone networks that are privately operated in an enterprise or organizational campus Such systems may be supported by a private branch exchange PBX which provides a central access point to the PSTN and also controls internal calls between telephone extensions br In contrast to numbering plans which determine telephone numbers assigned to subscriber stations dialing plans establish the customer dialing procedures i e the sequence of digits or symbols to be dialed to reach a destination It is the manner in which the numbering plan is used Even in closed numbering plans it is not always necessary to dial all digits of a number For example an area code may often be omitted when the destination is in the same area as the calling station br br br Telephone number structure br National or regional telecommunication administrations that are members of the International Telecommunication Union ITU use national telephone numbering plans that conform to international standard E br E specifies that a telephone number consist of a country code and a national telephone number National telephone numbers are defined by national or regional numbering plans such as the European Telephony Numbering Space the North American Numbering Plan NANP or the UK number plan br Within a national numbering plan a complete destination telephone number is typically composed of an area code and a subscriber telephone number br Many national numbering plans have developed from local historical requirements and progress or technological advancements which resulted in a variety of structural characteristics of the telephone numbers assigned to telephones In the United States the industry decided in to unite all local telephone networks under one common numbering plan with a fixed length of ten digits for the national telephone number of each telephone of which the last seven digits were known as the local directory number or subscriber number Such a numbering plan became known as a closed numbering plan In several European countries a different strategy prevailed known as the open numbering plan which features a variance in the length of the area code the local number or both br br br Subscriber number br The subscriber number is the address assigned to a telephone line or wireless communication channel terminating at the customer equipment The first few digits of the subscriber number may indicate smaller geographical scopes such as towns or districts based on municipal aspects or individual telephone exchanges central office code such as a wire centers In mobile networks they may indicate the network provider Callers in a given area sometimes do not need to include area prefixes when dialing within the same area but devices that dial telephone numbers automatically may include the full number with area and access codes br The subscriber number is typically listed in local telephone directories and is therefore often referred to as the directory number br br br Area code br br Telephone administrations that manage telecommunication infrastructure of extended size such as a large country often divide the territory into geographic areas This benefits independent management by administrative or historical subdivisions such as states and provinces of the territory or country Each area of subdivision is identified in the numbering plan with a routing code This concept was first developed in the planning for a nationwide numbering plan for Operator Toll Dialing and direct distance dialing DDD in the Bell System in the United States in the s a system that resulted in the North American Numbering Plan for World Zone AT T divided the United States and Canada into numbering plan areas NPAs and assigned to each NPA a unique three digit prefix the numbering plan area code which became known in short form as NPA code or simply area code The area code is prefixed to each telephone number issued in its service area br Other national telecommunication authorities use various formats and dialing rules for area codes The size of area code prefixes may either be fixed or variable Area codes in the NANP have three digits while two digits are used in Brazil one digit in Australia and New Zealand Variable length formats exist in multiple countries including Argentina Austria to Germany to digits Japan to Mexico or digits Peru or Syria or and the United Kingdom In addition to digit count the format may be restricted to certain digit patterns For example the NANP had at times specific restrictions on the range of digits for the three positions and required assignment to geographical areas avoiding nearby areas receiving similar area codes to avoid confusion and misdialing br Some countries such as Denmark and Uruguay have merged variable length area codes and telephone numbers into fixed length numbers that must always be dialed independently of location In such administrations the area code is not distinguished formally in the telephone number br In the UK area codes were first known as subscriber trunk dialling STD codes Depending on local dialing plans they are often necessary only when dialed from outside the code area or from mobile phones In North America ten digit dialing is required in areas with overlay numbering plans in which multiple area codes are assigned to the same area br The strict correlation of a telephone number to a geographical area has been broken by technical advances such as local number portability in the North American Numbering Plan and voice over IP services br When dialing a telephone number the area code may have to be preceded by a trunk prefix or national access code for domestic calls and for international calls by the international access code and country code br Area codes are often quoted by including the national access code For example a number in London may be listed as Users must correctly interpret as the code for London If they call from another station within London they may merely dial or if dialing from another country the initial should be omitted after the country code br br br International numbering plan br The E standard of the International Telecommunication Union is an international numbering plan and establishes a country calling code country code for each member organization Country codes are prefixes to national telephone numbers that denote call routing to the network of a subordinate number plan administration typically a country or group of countries with a uniform numbering plan such as the NANP E permits a maximum length of digits for the complete international phone number consisting of the country code the national routing code area code and the subscriber number E does not define regional numbering plans however it does provide recommendations for new implementations and uniform representation of all telephone numbers br br br Country code br Country codes are necessary only when dialing telephone numbers in other countries than the originating telephone but many networks permit them for all calls These are dialed before the national telephone number br Following ITU T specification E international telephone numbers are commonly indicated in listings by prefixing the country code with a plus sign This reminds the subscriber to dial the international access code of the country from which the call is placed For example the international dialing prefix or access code in all NANP countries is and in most other countries On modern mobile telephones and many voice over IP services the plus sign can usually be dialed and functions directly as the international access code Peer to peer SIP uses Dynamic Delegation Discovery System to perform endpoint discovery and therefore E numbers br br br Special services br Within the system of country calling codes the ITU has defined certain prefixes for special services and assigns such codes for independent international networks such as satellite systems spanning beyond the scope of regional authorities br Some special service codes are the following br br shared code for groups of nations br European Telephony Numbering Space Europe wide services discontinued br International Freephone UIFN br reserved for Shared Cost Services br Universal Personal Telecommunications services br Global Mobile Satellite System br and International Networks br international disaster relief operations br International Premium Rate Service br International Telecommunications Public Correspondence Service trial ITPCS br reserved for future global service br br br Satellite telephone systems br Satellite phones are typically issued with telephone numbers with a special country calling code for example br br Inmarsat SNAC Single Network Access Code br ICO Global br Ellipso br Iridium br Globalstar br Emsat br Thuraya br ACeS br Some satellite telephones are issued with telephone numbers from a national numbering plan for example Globalstar issues NANP telephone numbers br br br Private numbering plan br Like a public telecommunications network a private telephone network in an enterprise or within an organizational campus may implement a private numbering plan for the installed base of telephones for internal communication Such networks operate a private switching system or a private branch exchange PBX within the network The internal numbers assigned are often called extension numbers as the internal numbering plan extends an official published main access number for the entire network A caller from within the network only dials the extension number assigned to another internal destination telephone br A private numbering plan provides the convenience of mapping station telephone numbers to other commonly used numbering schemes in an enterprise For example station numbers may be assigned as the room number of a hotel or hospital Station numbers may also be strategically mapped to certain keywords composed from the letters on the telephone dial such as help to reach a help desk br The internal number assignments may be independent of any direct inward dialing DID services provided by external telecommunication vendors For numbers without DID access the internal switch relays externally originated calls via an operator an automated attendant or an electronic interactive voice response system Telephone numbers for users within such systems are often published by suffixing the official telephone number with the extension number e g x br Some systems may automatically map a large block of DID numbers differing only in a trailing sequence of digits to a corresponding block of individual internal stations allowing each of them to be reached directly from the public switched telephone network In some of these cases a special shorter dial in number can be used to reach an operator who can be asked for general information e g help looking up or connecting to internal numbers For example individual extensions at Universit t des Saarlandes can be dialed directly from outside via their four digit internal extension xxxx whereas the university s official main number is is the country code for Germany is the area code for Saarbr cken the prefix for the university br Callers within a private numbering plan often dial a trunk prefix to reach a national or international destination outside line or to access a leased line or tie line to another location within the same enterprise A large manufacturer with factories and offices in multiple cities may use a prefix such as followed by an internal routing code to indicate a city or location then an individual four or five digit extension number at the destination site A common trunk prefix for an outside line on North American systems is the digit followed by the outside destination number br Additional dial plan customisations such as single digit access to a hotel front desk or room service from an individual room are available at the sole discretion of the PBX owner br br br Numbering plan indicator br Signaling in telecommunication networks is specific to the technology in use for each link During signaling it is common that additional information is passed between switching systems that is not represented in telephone numbers which serve only as network addresses of endpoints One such information element is the numbering plan indicator NPI It is a number defined in the ITU standard Q paragraph indicating the numbering plan of the attached telephone number NPIs can be found in Signalling Connection Control Part SCCP and short message service SMS messages As of the following numbering plans and their respective numbering plan indicator values have been defined br br br Subscriber dialing procedures br While a telephone numbering plan specifies the digit sequence assigned to each telephone or wire line establishing the network addresses needed for routing calls numbering plan administrators may define certain dialing procedures for placing calls This may include the dialing of additional prefixes necessary for administrative or technical reasons or it may permit short code sequences for convenience or speed of service such as in cases of emergency The body of dialing procedures of a numbering plan administration is often called a dial plan br A dial plan establishes the expected sequence of digits dialed on subscriber premises equipment such as telephones in private branch exchange PBX systems or in other telephone switches to effect access to the telephone networks for the routing of telephone calls or to effect or activate specific service features by the local telephone company such as or service br br br Variable length dialing br Within the North American Numbering Plan NANP the administration defines standard and permissive dialing procedures specifying the number of mandatory digits to be dialed for local calls within a single numbering plan area NPA as well as alternate optional sequences such as adding the prefix before the telephone number br Despite the closed numbering plan in the NANP different dialing procedures exist in many of the territories for local and long distance telephone calls This means that to call another number within the same city or area callers need to dial only a subset of the full telephone number For example in the NANP only the seven digit number may need to be dialed but for calls outside the local numbering plan area the full number including the area code is required In these situations ITU T Recommendation E suggests to list the area code in parentheses signifying that in some cases the area code is optional or may not be required br Internationally an area code is typically prefixed by a domestic trunk access code usually when dialing from inside a country but is not necessary when calling from other countries there are exceptions such as for Italian land lines br To call a number in Sydney Australia for example br br xxxx xxxx within Sydney and other locations within New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory no area code required br xxxx xxxx outside New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory but still within Australia the area code is required br xxxx xxxx outside Australia br The plus character in the markup signifies that the following digits are the country code in this case Some phones especially mobile telephones allow the to be entered directly For other devices the user must replace the with the international access code for their current location In the United States most carriers require the caller to dial before the destination country code br New Zealand requires the area code to be dialed when calling between two local calling areas During the s and s each local calling area had its own area code For example Christchurch and Nelson in the late s br br xxx xxx to call Christchurch from Nelson br xx xxx to call Nelson from Christchurch br During the early s the numbering plan was reorganised with the numerous area codes merged into just five but the requirement to dial the area code between local calling areas remained This means even though Christchurch and Nelson are now both in the same area code the area code has to be dialed for calls between the two cities br br xx xxxx to call Christchurch from Nelson br x xxxx to call Nelson from Christchurch br In many areas of the NANP the domestic trunk code long distance access code must also be dialed along with the area code for long distance calls even within the same numbering plan area For example to call a number in Regina in area code br br xxx xxxx within Regina Lumsden and other local areas br xxx xxxx within Saskatchewan but not within the Regina local calling area e g Saskatoon br xxx xxxx anywhere within the NANP outside Saskatchewan br In many parts of North America especially in area code overlay complexes dialing the area code or and the area code is required even for local calls Dialing from mobile phones does not require the trunk code in the US although it is still necessary for calling all long distance numbers from a mobile phone in Canada Many mobile handsets automatically add the area code of the set s telephone number for outbound calls if not dialed by the user br In some parts of the United States especially northeastern states such as Pennsylvania served by Verizon Communications the ten digit number must be dialed If the call is not local the call fails unless the dialed number is preceded by digit Thus br br xxx xxxx local calls within the area code and its overlay as well as calls to or from the neighboring area code and its overlay Area code is required one of two completion options for mobile phones within the U S br xxx xxxx calls from numbers outside the and area codes second of two completion options for mobile phones within the U S br In California and New York because of the existence of both overlay area codes where an area code must be dialed for every call and non overlay area codes where an area code is dialed only for calls outside the subscriber s home area code permissive home area code dialing of the area code within the same area code even if no area code is required has been permitted since the mid s For example in the area code a non overlay area code calls may be dialed as seven digits XXX XXXX or digits The manner in which a call is dialed does not affect the billing of the call This permissive home area code dialing helps maintain uniformity and eliminates confusion given the different types of area code relief that has made California the nation s most area code intensive State Unlike other states with overlay area codes Texas Maryland Florida and Pennsylvania and others the California Public Utilities Commission and the New York State Public Service Commission maintain two different dial plans Landlines must dial area code whenever an Area Code is part of the dialed digits while cellphone users can omit the and just dial digits br Many organizations have private branch exchange systems which permit dialing the access digit s for an outside line usually or a and finally the local area code and xxx xxxx in areas without overlays This aspect is unintentionally helpful for employees who reside in one area code and work in an area code with one two or three adjacent area codes dialing to any area code by an employee can be done quickly with all exceptions processed by the private branch exchange and passed onto the public switched telephone network br br br Full number dialing br In small countries or areas the full telephone number is used for all calls even in the same area This has traditionally been the case in small countries and territories where area codes have not been required However there has been a trend in many countries towards making all numbers a standard length and incorporating the area code into the subscriber s number This usually makes the use of a trunk code obsolete br For example to call someone in Oslo in Norway before it was necessary to dial br br xxx xxx within Oslo no area code required br xxx xxx within Norway outside Oslo br xxx xxx outside Norway br After this changed to a closed eight digit numbering plan e g br br xx xxxx within Norway including Oslo br xx xxxx outside Norway br However in other countries such as France Belgium Japan Switzerland South Africa and some parts of North America the trunk code is retained for domestic calls whether local or national e g br br Paris xx xx xx xx outside France xxxx xxxx br Brussels xxx xxxx outside Belgium xxx xxxx br Geneva xxx xxxx outside Switzerland xxx xxxx br Cape Town xxx xxxx outside South Africa xxx xxxx br New York xxx xxxx outside the North American Numbering Plan xxx xxxx br Fukuoka xxx xxxx outside the Japanese Numbering Plan xxx xxxx br India Digit Number outside India XXXXXXXXXX In India due to the availability of multiple operators the metro cities have short codes which range from to digits br While some like Italy require the initial zero to be dialed even for calls from outside the country e g br br Rome xxxxxxxx outside Italy xxxxxxxx br While dialing of full national numbers takes longer than a local number without the area code the increased use of phones that can store numbers means that this is of decreasing importance It also makes it easier to display numbers in the international format as no trunk code is required hence a number in Prague Czech Republic can now be displayed as br br xx xxx xxx inside Czech Republic br xx xxx xxx outside Czech Republic br as opposed to before September br br xx xx xx xx inside Czech Republic br xx xx xx xx outside Czech Republic br Some countries already switched but trunk prefix re added with the closed dialing plan for example in Bangkok Thailand before br br xxx xxxx inside Bangkok br xxx xxxx inside Thailand br xxx xxxx outside Thailand br This was changed in br br xxx xxxx inside Thailand br xxx xxxx outside Thailand br Trunk prefix was re added in br br xxx xxxx inside Thailand br xxx xxxx outside Thailand br br br See also br br
