History br br br Before br On November the Atlanta City Council passed an ordinance establishing the Atlanta Public Schools On January the first three grammar schools for white students Crew Street School Ivy Street School Walker Street School opened and the existing grammar schools for black students Summer Hill School and Storr s School established by the Freedman s Bureau in and supported by the Northern Missionary Societies were merged into the holdings of the Atlanta Public Schools The capacity of each school was students although the inaugural registration was students students over the capacity In addition two high schools divided by sex were formed for white students Boys High and Girls High These initial schools were based on a census of school aged ages children called for by the inaugural Board of Education That survey reported in October that there were white children boys and girls and black children boys and girls for a total potential student body of br the districts for the white grammar schools were divided as follows br br Crew Street School The second and third wards including that portion of the city lying between Whitehall street and the Georgia Railroad br Ivy Street School the fourth fifth and seventh wards bounded by the Georgia Railroad and the Western Atlantic Railroad br Walker Street School first and sixth wards including that portion of the city west of Whitehall street and the Western Atlantic railroad br The initial monetary support from the Atlanta City Council was limited Although a bond had been called for and approved through vote by the residents there were not yet funds and so the Board of Education had to approach the City Council to cover the purchase of the land the construction of the buildings the salaries of the teachers as well as books to teach from The first salary budget dated December was for twenty seven teachers and totaled Grade school teachers were paid a year while principals were paid and the superintendent was paid br The organization of the schools was a traditional arrangement which consisted of years of grammar school for students aged to and years of high school for students aged The grades began at eighth for first year students and students progressed through to the first grade as year eight students of grammar school The established curriculum for grammar school was Spelling Reading Writing Geography Arithmetic Mental and Written Natural History Natural Science English Grammar Vocal Music it was later decided not offer this Drawing Composition History Elocution High school curriculum was Orthography Elocution Grammar Physical Geography Natural Philosophy Latin Greek boys only Algebra Geometry Composition Rhetoric English Literature French or German Physiology Chemistry and a review of grammar school studies br During three additional grammar schools for white students Luckie Street Decatur Street and Marietta Street and an additional grammar school for black students Markham Street School were instituted to meet demand This first year saw students served by the schools br By there were a total of twenty two schools fifteen grammar schools for white students five grammar schools for black students and two high schools for white students br br br Expansion br On January thirty eight schools that began under Fulton County Schools came under the authority of Atlanta Public Schools following the Plan of Improvement annexation executed by Atlanta Mayor William B Hartsfield These schools included five segregated high schools Henry McNeal Turner and Hapeville which served black students and Fulton North Fulton Northside Southwest and West Fulton which served white students The primary schools added on this date were Anderson Park Benton Blanton Bolton Brandon Morris

Philadelphia E Rivers Rockdale Rock Spring West Haven William Scott South Atlanta and Thomasville br br br Integration br On August nine students Thomas Franklin Welch Madelyn Patricia Nix Willie Jean Black Donita Gaines Arthur Simmons Lawrence Jefferson Mary James McMullen Martha Ann Holmes and Rosalyn Walton became the first African American students to attend several of APS s all white high schools br On September Time magazine reported br br Last week the moral siege of Atlanta pop ended in spectacular fashion with the smoothest token school integration ever seen in the Deep South Into four high schools marched nine Negro students without so much as a white catcall Teachers were soon reporting no hostility no demonstrations the most normal day we ve ever had In the lunchrooms white children began introducing themselves to Negro children At Northside High a biology class was duly impressed when Donita Gaines a Negro was the only student able to define the difference between anatomy and physiology Said she crisply Physiology has to do with functions br In a news story Time would say The Atlanta decision was a gentle attempt to accelerate one of the South s best publicized plans for achieving integration without revolution br By May transfer forms had been given to black students interested in transferring out of their high schools students actually applied of those were chosen and braved the press onlookers and insults to integrate Atlanta s all white high schools br Brown vs the Board of Education of Topeka had established the right of African American students to have equal opportunities in education but it was not until when a group of African American parents challenged the segregated school system in federal court that integration became a tangible reality for students of color in Atlanta br Adding to the accolades for the students and the city President Kennedy publicly congratulated residents during an evening address and asked other cities to look closely at what Atlanta has done and to meet their responsibility with courage tolerance and above all respect for the law br In Atlanta Public Schools produced a documentary to honor the th anniversary of the district s desegregation efforts In January in order to settle several federal discrimination and desegregation lawsuits filed on behalf of minority students faculty and employees and reach satisfactory agreement with Atlanta civil rights leaders who had worked over a decade for a peaceful integration plan Atlanta Public Schools entered into a voluntary agreement called the Compromise Plan with the U S Department of Justice along with approval and oversight from the U S Department of Education in an attempt to desegregate Atlanta Public Schools In the late s and early s a majority of Atlanta Northside public schools had either token integration or none at all Faculty and staff assignments to schools had remained mostly segregated as well br The Justice department reviewed the school system plan consisting of partial district busing for the Northside area Voluntary and M to M Minority to Majority transfers Redrawing attendance zones Closing outdated and underutilized schools Building new schools Mandating and implementing equal employment opportunity guidelines for hiring training promotion assignment staffing compensation vendor selection bidding contracting construction procurement and purchasing The school system was also converted from a K elementary and high school grade system into a middle school grade program beginning with the school year The curriculum was also updated to have studies more balanced inclusive and diverse with content culturally and historically significant to racial minorities On April th after final review authorization orders were issued from the Federal Courts clearing the way for the Compromise Plan of to be immediately implemented bringing full integration to APS br With strict guidelines oversight and timeline implementation of the voluntary desegregation plan the federal courts agreed not to order and enforce system wide a mandatory busing desegregation program for APS that had been federally enforced in other cities up to that time most notably Boston and Philadelphia which resulted in widespread anti busing violence in that Atlanta civil rights leaders desired to avoid Along with the Compromise program for racial balance the school system s first African American Superintendent Dr Alonzo A Crim was Appointed taking leadership of Atlanta Public Schools in August He remained superintendent until his retirement in br br br st century br br The City of Atlanta in agreed to annex territory in DeKalb County including the Centers for Disease Control and Emory University effective January In Emory University made a statement that Annexation of Emory into the City of Atlanta will not change school districts since neighboring communities like Druid Hills will still be self determining regarding annexation By the city agreed to include the annexed property in the boundaries of APS a move decried by the leadership of the DeKalb County School District as it would take taxable property away from that district In the number of children living in the annexed territory who attended public schools was nine The area ultimately went to APS students in the area will be rezoned to APS effective they will be zoned to DeKalb schools before then br In APS increased its budget to a record billion and its spending per student amount to which is about double the state and national public school average br br br Cheating scandal br br During the year tenure of former superintendent Beverly Hall the APS experienced unusually high gains in standardized test scores such as the Criterion Referenced Competency Test In Hall won the National Superintendent of the Year Award Around this time the Atlanta Journal Constitution began investigating the score increases and suggested evidence of cheating A state report found numerous erased answers in an analysis of the test scores Tests were administered under much higher scrutiny in and the scores dropped dramatically br The state of Georgia launched a major investigation as cheating concerns intensified The investigation s report published in July found evidence of a widespread cheating scandal At least teachers and principals at APS schools were alleged to have corrected students tests to increase scores in some cases holding cheating parties to revise large quantities of tests Hall who had retired in June expressed regret but denied any prior knowledge of or participation in the cheating The new superintendent Erroll Davis demanded the resignation of the APS employees or else they would be fired The revelation of the scandal left many Atlantans feeling outraged and betrayed with Mayor Kasim Reed calling it a dark day for the Atlanta public school system The scandal attracted national media
