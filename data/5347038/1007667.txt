Hispanic and Latino Americans Spanish Estadounidenses hispanos y latinos Portuguese Estadunidenses hisp nicos e latinos are Americans of full or partial Spanish and or Latin American background culture or family origin These demographics include all Americans who identify as Hispanic or Latino regardless of race As of the Census Bureau estimated that there were almost million Hispanics and Latinos living in the United States and its territories br Origin can be viewed as the ancestry nationality group lineage or country of birth of the person or the person s parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States of America People who identify as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race because similar to what occurred during the colonization and post independence of the United States Latin American countries had their populations made up of descendants of white European colonizers in this case Portuguese and Spaniards Native peoples of the Americas descendants of African slaves post independence immigrants coming from Europe Middle East and East Asia as well as descendants of multiracial unions between these different ethnic groups As one of the only two specifically designated categories of ethnicity in the United States Hispanics and Latinos form a pan ethnicity incorporating a diversity of inter related cultural and linguistic heritages the use of the Spanish and Portuguese languages being the most important of all Most Hispanic and Latino Americans are of Mexican Puerto Rican Cuban Salvadoran Dominican Colombian Guatemalan Honduran Ecuadorian Peruvian Venezuelan or Nicaraguan origin The predominant origin of regional Hispanic and Latino populations varies widely in different locations across the country In Hispanic Americans were the second fastest growing ethnic group by percentage growth in the United States after Asian Americans br Multiracial Hispanics Mestizo of Indigenous descent and Spanish descent are the second oldest ethnic groups after the Native Americans to inhabit much of what is today the United States Spain colonized large areas of what is today the American Southwest and West Coast as well as Florida Its holdings included present day California Texas New Mexico Nevada Utah Arizona and Florida all of which constituted part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain based in Mexico City Later this vast territory became part of Mexico after its independence from Spain in and until the end of the Mexican American War in Hispanic immigrants to the New York New Jersey metropolitan area derive from a broad spectrum of Hispanic countries br br br Terminology br br The terms Hispanic and Latino refer to an ethnicity Hispanic first came into popular use to refer to individuals with origins in Spanish speaking countries after the Office of Management and Budget created the classification in as proposed by a subcommittee composed of three government employees a Cuban Mexican and Puerto Rican American The U S Census Bureau defines being Hispanic as being a member of an ethnicity rather than being a member of a particular race and thus people who are members of this group may also be members of any race In a national survey of self identified Hispanics said that being Hispanic is part of both their racial and ethnic background while smaller numbers considered it part of their ethnic background only or racial background only Hispanics may be of any linguistic background in a survey of American Hispanics agreed that it is not necessary for a person to speak Spanish to be considered Hispanic Latino Hispanic and Latino people may share some commonalities in their language culture history and heritage According to the Smithsonian Institution the term Latino includes peoples with Portuguese roots such as Brazilians as well as those of Spanish language origin The difference between the terms Hispanic and Latino is ambiguous to some people The US Census Bureau equates the two terms and defines them as referring to anyone from Spain or the Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries of the Americas After the Mexican American War concluded in term Hispanic or Spanish American was primarily used to describe the Hispanos of New Mexico within the American Southwest The United States census controversially broadened the definition to a person of Mexican Puerto Rican Cuban Dominican South or Central American or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race This is now the common formal and colloquial definition of the term within the United States outside of New Mexico This definition is consistent with the st century usage by the US Census Bureau and OMB as the two agencies use both terms Hispanic and Latino interchangeably The Pew Research Center believes that the term Hispanic is strictly limited to Spain Puerto Rico and all countries where Spanish is the only official language whereas Latino includes all countries in Latin America even Brazil regardless of the fact that Portuguese is its only official language but it does not include Spain and Portugal br br The terms Latino and Latina are loan words from Italy and are ultimately from ancient Rome In English the term Latino is a condensed form of latinoamericano the Spanish term for a Latin American or someone who comes from Latin America The term Latino has developed a number of definitions This definition as a male Latin American inhabitant of the United States is the oldest definition which is used in the United States it was first used in Under this definition a Mexican American or Puerto Rican for example is both a Hispanic and a Latino A Brazilian American is also a Latino by this definition which includes those of Portuguese speaking origin from Latin America In English Italian Americans are not considered Latino as they are for the most part descended from immigrants from Europe rather than Latin America unless they happen to have had recent history in a Latin American country br Preference of use between the terms among Hispanics in the United States often depends on where users of the respective terms reside Those in the Eastern United States tend to prefer the term Hispanic whereas those in the West tend to prefer Latino br The US ethnic designation Latino is abstracted from the longer form latinoamericano The element latino is actually an indeclinable compositional form in o i e an elemento compositivo that is employed to coin compounded formations similar as franco in francocanadiense French Canadian or ibero in iberorrom nico etc br br The term Latinx and similar neologism Xicanx have gained some usage The adoption of the X would be r eflecting new consciousness inspired by more recent work by LGBTQI and feminist movements some Spanish speaking activists are increasingly using a yet more inclusive x to replace the a and o in a complete break with the gender binary Among the advocates of the term LatinX one of the most frequently cited complaints of gender bias in the Spanish language is that a group of mixed or unknown gender would be referred to as Latinos whereas Latinas refers to a group of women only but this is changed immediately to Latinos if even a single man joins this female group A Pew Research Center survey found that about of Hispanics use the term mostly women and only around have even heard of the term Of those said it should not be used to describe their ethnic group br Some have pointed out that the term Hispanic refers to a pan ethnic identity one that spans a range of races national origins and linguistic backgrounds Terms like Hispanic and Latino do not fully capture how we see ourselves says Geraldo Cadava an associate professor of history and Hispanic studies at Northwestern University br According to American Community Survey data a small minority of immigrants from Brazil Portugal and the Philippines self identified as Hispanic br br br History br br br th and th centuries br br Spanish explorers were pioneers in the territory of the present day United States The first confirmed European landing in the continental United States was by Juan Ponce de Le n who landed in at a lush shore he christened La Florida In the next three decades the Spanish became the first Europeans to reach the Appalachian Mountains the Mississippi River the Grand Canyon and the Great Plains Spanish ships sailed along the Atlantic Coast penetrating to present day Bangor Maine and up the Pacific Coast as far as Oregon From to lvar N ez Cabeza de Vaca and three fellows including an African named Estevanico from a Spanish expedition that foundered journeyed from Florida to the Gulf of California In Hernando de Soto undertook an extensive exploration of the present United States br br Also in Francisco V squez de Coronado led Spaniards and Mexican natives across today s Arizona Mexico border and traveled as far as central Kansas close to the exact geographic center of what is now the continental United States Other Spanish explorers of the US territory include among others Alonso Alvarez de Pineda Lucas V zquez de Ayll n P nfilo de Narv ez Sebasti n Vizca no Gaspar de Portol Pedro Men ndez de Avil s lvar N ez Cabeza de Vaca Trist n de Luna y Arellano and Juan de O ate and non Spanish explorers working for the Spanish Crown such as Juan Rodr guez Cabrillo In the Spanish created the first permanent European settlement in the continental United States at St Augustine Florida Spanish missionaries and colonists founded settlements including in the present day Santa Fe New Mexico El Paso San Antonio Tucson Albuquerque San Diego Los Angeles and San Francisco br Spanish settlements in the Americas were part of a broader network of trade routes that connected Europe Africa and the Americas The Spanish established trade connections with indigenous peoples exchanging goods such as furs hides agricultural products and manufactured goods These trade networks contributed to the economic development of Spanish colonies and facilitated cultural exchange between different groups br br br th and th centuries br As late as at the end of the American Revolutionary War a conflict in which Spain aided and fought alongside the rebels Spain held claim to roughly half the territory of today s continental United States From to the United States increased its area by roughly a third at Spanish and Mexican expense acquiring the present day U S states of California Texas Nevada Utah most of Colorado New Mexico and Arizona and parts of Oklahoma Kansas and Wyoming through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo after the Mexican American War as well as Florida through the Adams On s treaty and the U S territory of Puerto Rico through the Spanish American War in Many Latinos residing in those regions during that period gained U S citizenship Nonetheless many long established Latino residents faced significant difficulties post citizenship With the arrival of Anglo Americans in these newly incorporated areas Latino inhabitants struggled to maintain their land holdings political influence and cultural traditions br The discovery of gold in California in attracted people from diverse backgrounds including Hispanic and Latino miners merchants and settlers The Gold Rush led to a population boom and rapid economic growth in California transforming the social and political landscape of the region br Many Hispanic natives lived in the areas that the United States acquired and a new wave of Mexican Central American Caribbean and South American immigrants had moved to the United States for new opportunities This was the beginning of a demographic that would rise dramatically over the years br br br th and st centuries br br During the th and st centuries Hispanic immigration to the United States increased markedly following changes to the immigration law in During the World Wars Hispanic Americans and immigrants had helped stabilize the American economy from falling due to the industrial boom in the Midwest in states such as Michigan Ohio Indiana Illinois Iowa Wisconsin and Minnesota While a percentage of Americans had fled their jobs for the war Hispanics had taken their jobs in the Industrial world This can explain why there is such a high concentration of Hispanic Americans in Metro Areas such as the Chicago Elgin Naperville Detroit Warren Dearborn and Cleveland Elyria areas br Hispanic and Latino Americans were actively involved in the broader civil rights movement of the th century advocating for equal rights social justice and an end to discrimination and segregation Organizations such as the League of United Latin American Citizens LULAC and the United Farm Workers UFW fought for the rights of Hispanic and Latino workers and communities br Hispanic contributions in the historical past and present of the United States are addressed in more detail below See Notables and their contributions To recognize the current and historic contributions of Hispanic Americans on September President Lyndon B Johnson designated a week in mid September as National Hispanic Heritage Week with Congress s authorization In President Ronald Reagan extended the observance to a month designated National Hispanic Heritage Month Hispanic Americans became the largest minority group in br Hispanic and Latino Americans increasingly sought political representation and empowerment during the th century The election of individuals such as Edward Roybal Henry B Gonz lez and Dennis Ch vez to Congress marked significant milestones in Hispanic political representation Additionally the appointment of individuals like Lauro Cavazos and Bill Richardson to cabinet positions highlighted the growing influence of Hispanic and Latino leaders in government br Hispanic and Latino Americans became the largest minority group in the United States contributing significantly to the country s population growth Efforts to preserve and promote Hispanic and Latino culture and heritage continued in the st century including initiatives to support bilingual education celebrate cultural traditions and festivals and recognize the contributions of Hispanic and Latino individuals and communities to American society br br br Demographics br br As of Hispanics accounted for of the US population or million people The US Census Bureau later estimated that Hispanics were under counted by or million persons in the US census which explains the million range in the number above In contrast Whites were over counted by about million The Hispanic growth rate over the April to July period was about four times the rate of the nation s total population growth at The growth rate from July to July alone was about three and a half times the rate of the nation s total population growth at Based on the census Hispanics are now the largest minority group in out of metropolitan areas in the United States The projected Hispanic population of the United States for July is million people or of the nation s total projected population on that date br br br Geographic distribution br br Hispanic and Latino American population distribution over time br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br US Metropolitan Statistical Areas with over million Hispanics br br States and territories with the highest proportion of Hispanics br br Of the nation s total Hispanic population million live in California or Texas In New York City and Washington D C began receiving significant numbers of Latino migrants from the state of Texas mostly originating from Venezuela Ecuador Colombia and Honduras br Over half of the Hispanic population is concentrated in the Southwest region mostly composed of Mexican Americans California and Texas have some of the largest populations of Mexicans and Central American Hispanics in the United States The Northeast region is dominated by Dominican Americans and Puerto Ricans having the highest concentrations of both in the country In the Mid Atlantic region centered on the DC Metro Area Salvadoran Americans are the largest of Hispanic groups Florida is dominated by Cuban Americans and Puerto Ricans In both the Great Lakes states and the South Atlantic states Mexicans and Puerto Ricans dominate Mexicans dominate in the rest of the country including the West South Central and Great Plains states br br br National origin br br As of approximately of the nation s Hispanic population were of Mexican origin see table Another were of Puerto Rican origin and with about each of Cuban and Salvadoran and about Dominican origins The remainder were of other Central American or of South American origin or of origin directly from Spain Two thirds of all Hispanic Americans were born in the United States br There are few immigrants directly from Spain since Spaniards have historically emigrated to Hispanic America rather than to English speaking countries Because of this most Hispanics who identify themselves as Spaniard or Spanish also identify with Hispanic American national origin In the Census estimate approximately million Americans reported some form of Spanish as their ancestry whether directly from Spain or not br In northern New Mexico and southern Colorado there is a large portion of Hispanics who trace their ancestry to settlers from New Spain Mexico and sometimes Spain itself in the late th century through the th century People from this background often self identify as Hispanos Spanish or Hispanic Many of these settlers also intermarried with local Native Americans creating a mestizo population Likewise southern Louisiana is home to communities of people of Canary Islands descent known as Isle os in addition to other people of Spanish ancestry br Californios Nuevomexicanos and Tejanos are Americans of Spanish and or Mexican descent with subgroups that sometimes call themselves Chicanos Nuevomexicanos and Tejanos are distinct southwest Hispanic cultures with their own cuisines dialects and musical traditions br Nuyoricans are Americans of Puerto Rican descent from the New York City area There are close to two million Nuyoricans in the United States Prominent Nuyoricans include Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez US Supreme Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor and singer Jennifer Lopez br br br Race and ethnicity br br Hispanics come from multi racial and multi ethnic countries with diversity of origins therefore a Hispanic can be from any race or mix of races The most common ancestries are Native American European and African Many also have colonial era New Christian Sephardic Jewish ancestry As a result of their racial diversity Hispanics form an ethnicity sharing a language Spanish and cultural heritage rather than a race br br Hispanic origin is independent of race and is termed ethnicity by the United States Census Bureau br On the United States census of Hispanics selected White as their race This marked a large drop when compared to the United States census in which of Hispanics identified as White These Hispanics make up people or of the population br Over of Hispanic Americans identify as some other race Of all Americans who checked the box Some Other Race percent were Hispanic These Hispanics make up people or of the Hispanic population br Almost one third of the two or more races respondents were Hispanics These Hispanics make up people or of the Hispanic population br The largest numbers of Black Hispanics are from the Spanish Caribbean islands including the Cuban Dominican Panamanian and Puerto Rican communities br br In Puerto Rico people have some Native Indigenous American ancestry as well as European and Canary Islander ancestry There s also a population of predominantly African descent as well as populations of Native American descent as well as those with intermixed ancestries Cubans are mostly of Iberian and Canary Islander ancestry with some heritage from Native Indigenous Caribbean There are also populations of Black Sub Saharan ancestry and multi racial people The race and culture of each Hispanic country and their United States diaspora differs by history and geography br Welch and Sigelman found as of the year lower interaction between Latinos of different nationalities such as between Cubans and Mexicans than between Latinos and non Latinos This is a reminder that while they are often treated as such Latinos in the United States are not a monolith and often view their own ethnic or national identity as vastly different from that of other Latinos br br br Age br As of one third or million of the Hispanic population was younger than and a quarter million were Millennials This makes them more than half of the Hispanic population within the United States br br br Education br br br Hispanic K education br br With the increasing Hispanic population in the United States Hispanics have had a considerable impact on the K system In Hispanics comprised of all enrollments in the United States including and of enrollment in California and Texas respectively Further research shows the Hispanic population will continue to grow in the United States implicating that more Hispanics will populate US schools br br The state of Hispanic education shows some promise First Hispanic students attending pre K or kindergarten were more likely to attend full day programs Second Hispanics in elementary education were the second largest group represented in gifted and talented programs Third Hispanics average NAEP math and reading scores have consistently increased over the last years Finally Hispanics were more likely than other groups including White people to go to college br However their academic achievement in early childhood elementary and secondary education lag behind other groups For instance their average math and reading NAEP scores were lower than every other group except African Americans and have the highest dropout rate of any group despite decreasing from br To explain these disparities some scholars have suggested there is a Hispanic Education Crisis due to failed school and social policies To this end scholars have further offered several potential reasons including language barriers poverty and immigrant nativity status resulting in Hispanics not performing well academically br br br English language learners br br Currently Hispanic students make up of English language learners in the United States In million students were classified as English Language Learners ELLs in pre K to th grade This is a result of many students entering the education system at different ages although the majority of ELLs are not foreign born In order to provide English instruction for Hispanic students there have been a multitude of English Language programs Schools make demands when it comes to English fluency There are test requirements to certify students who are non native English speakers in writing speaking reading and listening for example They take an ELPAC test which evaluates their English efficiency This assessment determines whether they are considered ELL students or not For Hispanic students being an ELL student will have a big impact because it s additional pressure to pass an extra exam apart from their own original classes Furthermore if the exam is not passed before they attend high school the student will fall behind in their courses due to the additional ELD courses instead of taking their normal classes in that year However the great majority of these programs are English Immersion which arguably undermines the students culture and knowledge of their primary language As such there continues to be great debate within schools as to which program can address these language disparities br br br Immigration status br There are more than five million ELLs from all over the world attending public schools in the United States and speaking at least different languages Undocumented immigrants have not always had access to compulsory education in the United States However since the landmark Supreme Court case Plyler v Doe in immigrants have received access to K education This significantly impacted all immigrant groups including Hispanics However their academic achievement is dependent upon several factors including but not limited to time of arrival and schooling in country of origin When non native speakers arrive to the United States the student not only enters a new country language or culture but they also enter a testing culture to determine everything from their placements to advancement into the next grade level in their education Moreover Hispanics immigration nativity status plays a major role regarding their academic achievement For instance first and second generation Hispanics outperform their later generational counterparts Additionally their aspirations appear to decrease as well This has major implications on their postsecondary futures br br br Simultaneous bilingualism br There is a term simultaneous bilinguals it is emerged on the research from Guadalupe Valdez she states that it is used by individuals who acquire two languages as a first language that most American circumstantial bilinguals acquire their ethnic or immigrant language first and then acquire English The period of acquisition of the second language is known as incipient bilingualism br br br Hispanic higher education br br Those with a bachelor s degree or higher ranges from of Venezuelans compared to for Ecuadorians years and older Amongst the largest Hispanic groups those with a bachelor s or higher was for Cubans of Puerto Ricans of Dominicans and for Mexicans Over of all second generation Dominican Americans have college degrees slightly below the national average but significantly higher than US born Mexican Americans and US born Puerto Rican Americans br Hispanics make up the second or third largest ethnic group in Ivy League universities considered to be the most prestigious in the United States Hispanic enrollment at Ivy League universities has gradually increased over the years Today Hispanics make up between of students at Yale University to at Columbia University For example of students in the Harvard University Class of are Hispanic br Hispanics have significant enrollment in many other top universities such as University of Texas at El Paso of students Florida International University University of Miami and MIT UCLA and UC Berkeley at each At Stanford University Hispanics are the third largest ethnic group behind non Hispanic White people and Asians at of the student population br br br Hispanic university enrollments br br While Hispanics study in colleges and universities throughout the country some choose to attend federally designated Hispanic serving institutions institutions that are accredited degree granting public or private nonprofit institutions of higher education with percent or more total undergraduate Hispanic full time equivalent FTE student enrollment There are over institutions of higher education that have been designated as an HSI br br br Health br br br Longevity br br As of life expectancy for Hispanic Americans is years which is higher than the life expectancy for White Americans years Research on the Hispanic paradox the well established apparent mortality advantage of Hispanic Americans compared to White Americans despite the latter s more advantaged socioeconomic status has been principally explained by health related migration to and from the US and social and cultural protection mechanisms such as maintenance of healthy lifestyles and behaviors adopted in the countries of origin and availability of extensive social networks in the US The salmon bias hypothesis which suggests that the Hispanic health advantage is attributable to higher rates of return migration among less healthy migrants has received some support in the scholarly literature A study examining the comparatively better health of foreign born American Hispanics challenged the hypothesis that a stronger orientation toward the family familism contributed to this advantage Some scholars have suggested that the Hispanic mortality advantage is likely to disappear due to the higher rates of obesity and diabetes among Hispanics relative to White people although lower rates of smoking and thus smoking attributable mortality among Hispanics may counteract this to some extent br br br Healthcare br As of about of Hispanic Americans lack health insurance coverage which is the highest of all ethnic groups except for Indigenous Americans and Alaska Natives In terms of extending health coverage Hispanics benefited the most among US ethnic groups from the Affordable Care Act ACA among non elderly Hispanics the uninsured rate declined from in to in Among the population of non elderly uninsured Hispanic population in about were non citizens about were US born citizens and about were naturalized citizens The ACA does not help undocumented immigrants or legal immigrants with less than five years residence in the United States gain coverage br According to a study Mexican women have the highest uninsured rate as compared to other immigrants Black and White According to the study Mexican women are the largest female immigrant group in the United States and are also the most at risk for developing preventable health conditions Multiple factors such as limited access to health care legal status and income increase the risk of developing preventable health conditions because many undocumented immigrants postpone routine visits to the doctor until they become seriously ill br br br Mental health br br br Family separation br Some families who are in the process of illegally crossing borders can suffer being caught and separated by border patrol agents Migrants are also in danger of separation if they do not bring sufficient resources such as water for all members to continue crossing Once illegal migrants have arrived to the new country they may fear workplace raids where illegal immigrants are detained and deported br Family separation puts US born children undocumented children and their illegal immigrant parents at risk for depression and family maladaptive syndrome The effects are often long term and the impact extends to the community level Children may experience emotional traumas and long term changes in behaviors Additionally when parents are forcefully removed children often develop feelings of abandonment and they might blame themselves for what has happened to their family Some children that are victims to illegal border crossings that result in family separation believe in the possibility of never seeing their parents again These effects can cause negative parent child attachment Reunification may be difficult because of immigration laws and re entry restrictions which further affect the mental health of children and parents Parents who leave their home country also experience negative mental health experiences According to a study published in of Mexican migrant men who participated in the study reported elevated levels of depressive symptoms In recent years the length of stay for migrants has increased from years to nearly a decade Migrants who were separated from their families either married or single experienced greater depression than married men accompanied by their spouses Furthermore the study also revealed that men who are separated from their families are more prone to harsher living conditions such as overcrowded housing and are under a greater deal of pressure to send remittance to support their families These conditions put additional stress on the migrants and often worsen their depression Families who migrated together experience better living conditions receive emotional encouragement and motivation from each other and share a sense of solidarity They are also more likely to successfully navigate the employment and health care systems in the new country and are not pressured to send remittances back home br br br Vulnerabilities br br The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of significantly changed how the United States dealt with immigration Under this new law immigrants who overstayed their visas or were found to be in the United States illegally were subject to be detained and or deported without legal representation Immigrants who broke these laws may not be allowed back into the country Similarly this law made it more difficult for other immigrants who want to enter the United States or gain legal status These laws also expanded the types of offenses that can be considered worthy of deportation for documented immigrants Policies enacted by future presidents further limit the number of immigrants entering the country and their expedited removal br Many illegal immigrant families cannot enjoy doing everyday activities without exercising caution because they fear encountering immigration officers which limits their involvement in community events Undocumented families also do not trust government institutions and services Because of their fear of encountering immigration officers illegal immigrants often feel ostracized and isolated which can lead to the development of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety The harmful effects of being ostracized from the rest of society are not limited to just that of undocumented immigrants but it affects the entire family even if some of the members are of legal status Children often reported having been victims of bullying in school by classmates because their parents are undocumented This can cause them to feel isolated and develop a sense of inferiority which can negatively impact their academic performance br br br Stress br br Despite the struggles Hispanic families encounter they have found ways to keep motivated Many immigrants use religion as a source of motivation Mexican immigrants believed that the difficulties they face are a part of God s bigger plan and believe their life will get better in the end They kept their faith strong and pray every day hoping that God will keep their families safe Immigrants participate in church services and bond with other immigrants that share the same experiences Undocumented Hispanics also find support from friends family and the community that serve as coping mechanisms Some Hispanics state that their children are the reason they have the strength to keep on going They want their children to have a future and give them things they are not able to have themselves The community is able to provide certain resources that immigrant families need such as tutoring for their children financial assistance and counseling services Some identified that maintaining a positive mental attitude helped them cope with the stresses they experience Many immigrants refuse to live their life in constant fear which leads to depression in order to enjoy life in the United States Since many immigrants have unstable sources of income many plan ahead in order to prevent future financial stress They put money aside and find ways to save money instead of spend it such as learning to fix appliances themselves br br br Poverty br br Many Hispanic families migrate to find better economic opportunities in order to send remittances back home Being undocumented limits the possibilities of jobs that immigrants undertake and many struggle to find a stable job Many Hispanics report that companies turned them down because they do not have a Social Security number If they are able to obtain a job immigrants risk losing it if their employer finds out they are unable to provide proof of residency or citizenship Many look towards agencies that do not ask for identification but those jobs are often unreliable In order to prevent themselves from being detained and deported many have to work under exploitation In a study a participant reported If someone knows that you don t have the papers that person is a danger Many people will con them if they know you don t have the papers with everything they say hey I m going to call immigration on you These conditions lower the income that Hispanic families bring to their household and some find living each day very difficult When an undocumented parent is deported or detained income will be lowered significantly if the other parent also supports the family financially The parent who is left has to look after the family and might find working difficult to manage along with other responsibilities Even if families are not separated Hispanics are constantly living in fear that they will lose their economic footing br Living in poverty has been linked to depression low self esteem loneliness crime activities and frequent drug use among youth Families with low incomes are unable to afford adequate housing and some of them are evicted The environment in which the children of undocumented immigrants grow up in is often composed of poor air quality noise and toxins which prevent healthy development Furthermore these neighborhoods are prone to violence and gang activities forcing the families to live in constant fear which can contribute to the development of PTSD aggression and depression br br br Economic outlook br br br Median income br In the US Census reported the median household incomes of Hispanic Americans to be This is the third consecutive annual increase in median household income for Hispanic origin households br br br Poverty br According to the US Census the poverty rate Hispanics was percent in down from percent in Hispanics accounted for million individuals in poverty In comparison the average poverty rates in for non Hispanic White Americans was percent with million individuals in poverty Asian Americans was percent with million individuals in poverty and African Americans was percent with million individuals in poverty br Among the largest Hispanic groups during was Honduran Americans Dominican Americans Guatemalan Americans Puerto Ricans Mexican Americans Salvadoran Americans Cuban Americans and Venezuelan Americans Ecuadorian Americans Nicaraguan Americans Colombian Americans Argentinian Americans and Peruvian Americans br Poverty affects many underrepresented students as racial ethnic minorities tend to stay isolated within pockets of low income communities This results in several inequalities such as school offerings teacher quality curriculum counseling and all manner of things that both keep students engaged in school and prepare them to graduate In the case of Hispanics the poverty rate for Hispanic children in was percent Moreover with this lack of resources schools reproduce these inequalities for generations to come In order to assuage poverty many Hispanic families can turn to social and community services as resources br br br Cultural matters br br The geographic political social economic and racial diversity of Hispanic Americans makes all Hispanics very different depending on their family heritage and or national origin Many times there are many cultural similarities between Hispanics from neighboring countries than from more distant countries i e Spanish Caribbean Southern Cone Central America etc Yet several features tend to unite Hispanics from these diverse backgrounds br br br Language br br br Spanish br br As one of the most important uniting factors of Hispanic Americans Spanish is an important part of Hispanic culture Teaching Spanish to children is often one of the most valued skills taught amongst Hispanic families Spanish is not only closely tied with the person s family heritage and overall culture but valued for increased opportunities in business and one s future professional career A Pew Research survey showed that of Hispanics adults said it s important that future generations of Hispanics speak Spanish Given the United States proximity to other Spanish speaking countries Spanish is being passed on to future American generations Amongst second generation Hispanics speak fluent Spanish and amongst third generation Hispanics speak fluent Spanish Spanish is also the most popular language taught in the United States br br Hispanics have revived the Spanish language in the United States first brought to North America during the Spanish colonial period in the th century Spanish is the oldest European language in the United States spoken uninterruptedly for four and a half centuries since the founding of Saint Augustine Florida in Today of all Hispanics speak English and at least speak fluent Spanish Additionally million non Hispanic Americans also speak Spanish at home for a total of million br With of Hispanic Americans being immigrants and with many of the who are US born being the children or grandchildren of immigrants bilingualism is the norm in the community at large At home at least of all Hispanics over the age of five are bilingual in English and Spanish whereas up to are monolingual English speakers and are monolingual Spanish speakers Another speak a language other than English and Spanish at home br br br American Spanish dialects br br The Spanish dialects spoken in the United States differ depending on the country of origin of the person or the person s family heritage However generally Spanish spoken in the Southwest is Mexican Spanish or Chicano Spanish A variety of Spanish native to the Southwest spoken by descendants of the early Spanish colonists in New Mexico and Colorado is known as Traditional New Mexican Spanish One of the major distinctions of Traditional New Mexican Spanish is its use of distinct vocabulary and grammatical forms that make New Mexican Spanish unique amongst Spanish dialects The Spanish spoken in the East Coast is generally Caribbean Spanish and is heavily influenced by the Spanish of Cuba the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico Isle o Spanish descended from Canarian Spanish is the historic Spanish dialect spoken by the descendants of the earliest Spanish colonists beginning in the th century in Louisiana Spanish spoken elsewhere throughout the country varies although is generally Mexican Spanish br Heritage Spanish speakers tend to speak Spanish with near native level phonology but a more limited command of morphosyntax Hispanics who speak Spanish as a second language often speak with English accents br br br Spanglish and English dialects br br Hispanics have influenced the way Americans speak with the introduction of many Spanish words into the English language Amongst younger generations of Hispanics Spanglish a term for any mix of Spanish and English is common in speaking As they are fluent in both languages speakers will often switch between Spanish and English throughout the conversation Spanglish is particularly common in Hispanic majority cities and communities such as Miami Hialeah San Antonio Los Angeles and parts of New York City br Hispanics have also influenced the way English is spoken in the United States In Miami for example the Miami dialect has evolved as the most common form of English spoken and heard in Miami today This is a native dialect of English and was developed amongst second and third generations of Cuban Americans in Miami Today it is commonly heard everywhere throughout the city Gloria Estefan and Enrique Iglesias are examples of people who speak with the Miami dialect Another major English dialect is spoken by Chicanos and Tejanos in the Southwestern United States called Chicano English George Lopez and Selena are examples of speakers of Chicano English An English dialect spoken by Puerto Ricans and other Hispanic groups is called New York Latino English Jennifer Lopez and Cardi B are examples of people who speak with the New York Latino dialect br When speaking in English American Hispanics may often insert Spanish tag and filler items such as t sabes este and rale into sentences as a marker of ethnic identity and solidarity The same often occurs with grammatical words like pero br br br Religion br br According to a Pew Center study which was conducted in the majority of Hispanic Americans are Christians Among American Hispanics as of are Catholic are Protestant are Mormon less than are Orthodox Christian are members of non Christian faiths and are unaffiliated The proportion of Hispanics who are Catholic has dropped from when it was while the proportion of unaffiliated Hispanics has increased since when it was Among Hispanic Protestant community most are evangelical but some belong to mainline denominations Compared to Catholic unaffiliated and mainline Protestant Hispanics Evangelical Protestant Hispanics are substantially more likely to attend services weekly pray daily and adhere to biblical liberalism As of about of Hispanic Protestants and about of Hispanic Catholics were renewalist meaning that they described themselves as Pentecosal or charismatic Christians in the Catholic tradition called Catholic charismatic renewal br Catholic affiliation is much higher among first generation Hispanic immigrants than it is among second and third generation Hispanic immigrants who exhibit a fairly high rate of conversion to Protestantism or the unaffiliated camp According to Andrew Greeley as many as American Hispanics leave Catholicism for Protestant churches every year and this figure is much higher in Texas and Florida Hispanic Catholics are developing youth and social programs to retain members br Hispanics make up a substantial proportion almost of Catholics in the United States although the number of American Hispanic priests is low relative to Hispanic membership in the church In Jos Horacio G mez Archbishop of Los Angeles and a naturalized American citizen born in Mexico was elected as president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops br br br Media br br The United States is home to thousands of Spanish language media outlets which range in size from giant commercial and some non commercial broadcasting networks and major magazines with circulations numbering in the millions to low power AM radio stations with listeners numbering in the hundreds There are hundreds of Internet media outlets targeting US Hispanic consumers Some of the outlets are online versions of their printed counterparts and some online exclusively br Increased use of Spanish language media leads to increased levels of group consciousness according to survey data The differences in attitudes are due to the diverging goals of Spanish language and English language

sales and plantain chips popular in Caribbean cuisines have continued to increase sales The avocado has been described as America s new favorite fruit its largest market within the US is among

today a caf con leche or a cortadito is commonly had at one of the city s numerous coffee shops The Cuban sandwich developed in Miami is now a staple and icon of the city s cuisine and culture br br br Familial situations br br br Family life and values br Hispanic culture places a strong value on family and is commonly taught to Hispanic children as one of the most important values in life Statistically Hispanic families tend to have larger and closer knit families than the American average Hispanic families tend to prefer to live near other family members This may mean that three or sometimes four generations may be living in the same household or near each other although four generations is uncommon in the United States The role of grandparents is believed to be very important in the upbringing of children br Hispanics tend to be very group oriented and an emphasis is placed on the well being of the family above the individual The extended family plays an important part of many Hispanic families and frequent social family gatherings are common Traditional rites of passages particularly Roman Catholic sacraments such as baptisms birthdays first Holy Communions quincea eras Confirmations graduations and weddings are all popular moments of family gatherings and celebrations in Hispanic families br Education is another important priority for Hispanic families Education is seen as the key towards continued upward mobility in the United States among Hispanic families A study by the Associated Press showed that Hispanics place a higher emphasis on education than the average American Hispanics expect their children to graduate university br Hispanic youth today stay at home with their parents longer than before This is due to more years spent studying and the difficulty of finding a paid job that meets their aspirations br br br Intermarriage br br Hispanic Americans like many immigrant groups before them are out marrying at high rates Out marriages comprised of all existing Hispanic marriages in The rate was higher for newlyweds which excludes immigrants who are already married Among all newlyweds in of all Hispanics married a non Hispanic this compares to out marriage rates of of White people of Black people and of Asians The rate was larger for native born Hispanics with of native born Hispanics both men and women out marrying compared to of foreign born Hispanics The difference is attributed to recent immigrants tending to marry within their immediate immigrant community due to commonality of language proximity familial connections and familiarity br In of Hispanics who married out married non Hispanic White people married non Hispanic Black people non Hispanic Asians and the remainder married non Hispanic multi racial partners br br Of approximately new interracial or interethnic marriages in were White Hispanic compared to White Asian at White Black at and other combinations at other combinations consists of pairings between different minority groups and multi racial people Unlike those for marriage to Black people and Asians intermarriage rates of Hispanics to White people do not vary by gender The combined median earnings of White Hispanic couples are lower than those of White White couples but higher than those of Hispanic Hispanic couples of Hispanic men who married White women have a college degree compared to only of Hispanic men who married a Hispanic woman of Hispanic women who married a White husband are college educated compared to of Hispanic women who married a Hispanic man br Attitudes among non Hispanics toward intermarriage with Hispanics are mostly favorable with of White people of Asians and of Black people being fine with a member of their family marrying a Hispanic and an additional of White people of Asians and of Black people being bothered but accepting of the marriage Only of White people of Asians and of Black people would not accept a marriage of their family member to a Hispanic br Hispanic attitudes toward intermarriage with non Hispanics are likewise favorable with being fine with marriages to White people and being fine with marriages to Black people A further admitted to being bothered but accepting of a marriage of a family member to a White and admitted to being bothered but accepting of a marriage of a family member to a Black Only of Hispanics objected outright marriage of a family member to a non Hispanic Black and to a non Hispanic White br Unlike intermarriage with other racial groups intermarriage with non Hispanic Black people varies by nationality of origin Puerto Ricans have by far the highest rates of intermarriage with Black people of all major Hispanic national groups who also has the highest overall intermarriage rate among Hispanics Cubans have the highest rate of intermarriage with non Hispanic White people of all major Hispanic national groups and are the most assimilated into White American culture br br br Cultural adjustment br br As Hispanic migrants become the norm in the United States the effects of this migration on the identity of these migrants and their kin becomes most evident in the younger generations Crossing the borders changes the identities of both the youth and their families Often one must pay special attention to the role expressive culture plays as both entertainment and as a site in which identity is played out empowered and reformed because it is sometimes in opposition to dominant norms and practices and sometimes in conjunction with them The exchange of their culture of origin with American culture creates a dichotomy within the values that the youth find important therefore changing what it means to be Hispanic in the global sphere br br br Transnationalism br Along with feeling that they are neither from the country of their ethnic background nor the United States a new identity within the United States is formed called latinidad This is especially seen in cosmopolitan social settings like New York City Chicago Houston Los Angeles and San Francisco Underway is the intermeshing of different Latino subpopulations has laid the foundations for the emergence and ongoing evolution of a strong sense of latinidad which establishes a sense of cultural affinity and identity deeply rooted in what many Hispanics perceive to be a shared historical spiritual aesthetic and linguistic heritage and a growing sense of cultural affinity and solidarity in the social context of the United States This unites Hispanics as one creating cultural kin with other Hispanic ethnicities br br br Gender roles br In a study of Mexican Americans it was found that males were more likely to endorse the notion than men should be the sole breadwinners of the family while Mexican American women did not endorse this notion br br Prior to the s countercultural movement Mexican men often felt an exaggerated need to be the sole breadwinner of their families There are two sides to machismo the man who has a strong work ethic and lives up to his responsibilities or the man who heavily drinks and therefore displays acts of unpleasant behavior towards his family br br The traditional roles of women in a Hispanic community are of housewife and mother a woman s role is to cook clean and care for her children and husband putting herself and her needs last The typical structure of a Hispanic family forces women to defer authority to her husband allowing him to make the important decisions that both the woman and children must abide by In traditional Hispanic households women and young girls are homebodies or muchachas de la casa girls of the house showing that they abide by the cultural norms of respectability chastity and family honor as valued by the Hispanic community br Migration to the United States can change the identity of Hispanic youth in various ways including how they carry their gendered identities However when Hispanic women come to the United States they tend to adapt to the perceived social norms of this new country and their social location changes as they become more independent and able to live without the financial support of their families or partners The unassimilated community views these adapting women as being de la calle of or from the street transgressive and sexually promiscuous A women s motive for pursuing an education or career is to prove she can care and make someone of herself breaking the traditional gender role that a Hispanic woman can only serve as a mother or housewife thus changing a woman s role in society Some Hispanic families in the United States deal with young women s failure to adhere to these culturally prescribed norms of proper gendered behavior in a variety of ways including sending them to live in the sending country with family members regardless of whether or not the young women are sexually active Now there has been a rise in the Hispanic community where both men and women are known to work and split the household chores among themselves women are encouraged to gain an education degree and pursue a career br br br Sexuality br br According to polling data released in of Hispanic American adults identify as gay lesbian bisexual or transgender This is more than twice the rate of White Americans or African Americans Over of Hispanic Millennials and Gen Z claimed an LGBT identity The growth of the young Hispanic population is driving an increase of the LGBT community in the United States Studies have shown that Hispanic Americans are over represented among transgender people in the United States br According to Gattamorta et al the socially constructed notion of machismo reinforces male gender roles in Hispanic culture which can lead to internalized homophobia in Hispanic gay men and increase mental health issues and suicidal ideation However according to Reyes Salinas more recent research shows that there has been an explosive growth of LGBT self identification among young Hispanic Americans which may signal that the Hispanic attitudes towards LGBT have broken down According to Marina Franco polling conducted in suggests that the Hispanic community in America is largely accepting of LGBT people and gay marriage which is significant in light of the rapid growth of LGBT self identification among Hispanics br br br Relations with other minority groups br br As a result of the rapid growth of the Hispanic population there has been some tension with other minority populations especially the African American population as Hispanics have increasingly moved into once exclusively Black areas There has also been increasing cooperation between minority groups to work together to attain political influence br br A UCLA study reported that of Black people felt that Hispanics were taking jobs and political power from them and of Hispanics said they feared African Americans identifying them African Americans with high crime rates That said large majorities of Hispanics credited American Black people and the civil rights movement with making life easier for them in the United States br A Pew Research Center poll from showed that Black people overwhelmingly felt that Hispanic immigrants were hard working and had strong family values believed that immigrants took jobs from Americans of Black people believed that they had directly lost a job to an immigrant and of Black people wanted immigration to be curtailed The report also surveyed three cities Chicago with its well established Hispanic community Washington D C with a less established but quickly growing Hispanic community and Raleigh Durham with a very new but rapidly growing Hispanic community The results showed that a significant proportion of Black people in those cities wanted immigration to be curtailed Chicago Raleigh Durham and Washington DC br Per a University of California Berkeley Law School research brief a recurring theme to Black Hispanic tensions is the growth in contingent flexible or contractor labor which is increasingly replacing long term steady employment for jobs on the lower rung of the pay scale which had been disproportionately filled by Black people The transition to this employment arrangement corresponds directly with the growth in the Hispanic immigrant population The perception is that this new labor arrangement has driven down wages removed benefits and rendered temporary jobs that once were stable but also benefiting consumers who receive lower cost services while passing the costs of labor healthcare and indirectly education onto the community at large br A Gallup poll indicated that of Hispanics and of Black people believe that good relations exist between US Black people and Hispanics while only of Black people of Hispanics and of White people say Black Hispanic relations are bad br In in Los Angeles County Hispanics committed of the hate crimes against Black victims and Black people committed of the hate crimes against Hispanics br br br Politics br br br Political affiliations br br Hispanics differ on their political views depending on their location and background The majority either identify as or support the Democrats and identify as Republicans This point gap as of December was an increase from the gap of points months earlier While traditionally a key Democratic Party constituency at large beginning in the early s Hispanics have begun to split between the Democrats and the Republican Party In a study it was found that of Latinos surveyed had positive attitudes towards President Obama s executive actions on immigration which was notably four percentage points lower than that of non Hispanic Black respondents It was also noted that support for undocumented immigrants was lowest among Latinos living in developing bedroom communities or newly built suburbs designed for commuters This was also the case for Latinos of affluent income levels however they were still most likely to display a positive attitude towards undocumented immigrants especially when compared to their non Hispanic White counterparts br Cuban Americans Colombian Americans Chilean Americans and Venezuelan Americans tend to favor conservative political ideologies and support the Republicans Mexican Americans Puerto Ricans and Dominican Americans tend to favor progressive political ideologies and support the Democrats However because the latter groups are far more numerous as again Mexican Americans alone are of Hispanics the Democratic Party is considered to be in a far stronger position with the ethnic group overall br Some political organizations associated with Hispanic Americans are League of United Latin American Citizens LULAC the National Council of La Raza NCLR the United Farm Workers the Cuban American National Foundation and the National Institute for Latino Policy br br br Political impact br br The United States has a population of over million of Hispanic Americans of whom million are citizens eligible to vote of total eligible voters therefore Hispanics have a very important effect on presidential elections since the vote difference between two main parties is usually around br br br Elections of br br In the presidential election of Hispanics backed President Bill Clinton In the Democratic total fell to and went down again in with Democrat John Kerry winning Hispanics against Bush Hispanics in the West especially in California were much stronger for the Democratic Party than in Texas and Florida California Hispanics voted for Kerry in and both Arizona and New Mexico Hispanics by a smaller margin Texas Hispanics were split nearly evenly favoring Kerry over their favorite son candidate and Florida Hispanics who are mostly Cuban American backed Bush by a margin br In the midterm election however due to the unpopularity of the Iraq War the heated debate concerning illegal Hispanic immigration and Republican related Congressional scandals Hispanics went as strongly Democratic as they have since the Clinton years Exit polls showed the group voting for Democrats by a lopsided margin with Florida Hispanics for the first time split evenly br The runoff election in Texas rd congressional district was seen as a bellwether of Hispanic politics Democrat Ciro Rodriguez s unexpected and unexpectedly decisive defeat of Republican incumbent Henry Bonilla was seen as proof of a leftward lurch among Hispanic voters majority Hispanic counties overwhelmingly backed Rodriguez and majority European American counties overwhelmingly backed Bonilla br br br Elections br br In the Presidential election s Democratic primary Hispanics participated in larger numbers than before with Hillary Clinton receiving most of the group s support Pundits discussed whether Hispanics would not vote for Barack Obama because he was African American Hispanics voted to for Mrs Clinton even among the younger demographic In other groups younger voters went overwhelmingly for Obama Among Hispanics said race was involved in their decision as opposed to for non Hispanic White people Obama defeated Clinton br In the matchup between Obama and Republican candidate John McCain Hispanics supported Obama with to McCain s in the June Gallup tracking poll This was higher than expected since McCain had been a leader of the comprehensive immigration reform effort John McCain was born in Panama to parents who were serving in the US Navy but raised in the United States However McCain had retreated from reform during the Republican primary damaging his standing among Hispanics Obama took advantage of the situation by running ads in Spanish highlighting McCain s reversal br br In the general election of Hispanics voted for Obama with a relatively strong turnout in states such as Colorado New Mexico Nevada and Virginia helping Obama carry those formerly Republican states Obama won of non Cuban Hispanics and of the traditionally Republican Cuban Americans who have a strong presence in Florida The relative growth of non Cuban vs Cuban Hispanics also contributed to his carrying Florida s Hispanics with of the vote br While employment and the economy were top concerns for Hispanics almost of Hispanic voters rated immigration as somewhat important or very important in a poll taken after the election Republican opposition to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of had damaged the party s appeal to Hispanics especially in swing states such as Florida Nevada and New Mexico In a Gallup poll of Hispanic voters taken in the final days of June only of participants identified as Republicans br Hispanics voted even more heavily for Democrats in the election with the Democratic incumbent Barack Obama receiving and the Republican challenger Mitt Romney receiving about of the vote Some Hispanic leaders were offended by remarks Romney made during a fundraiser when he suggested that cultural differences and the hand of providence help explain why Israelis are more economically successful than Palestinians and why similar economic disparities exist between other neighbors such as the United States and Mexico or Chile and Ecuador A senior aide to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called the remarks racist as did American political scientist Angelo Falc n president of the National Institute of Latino Policy Mitt Romney s father was born to American parents in a Mormon colony in Chihuahua Mexico br br br Elections present br br More convincing data from the United States presidential election from the polling firm Latino Decisions indicates that Clinton received a higher share of the Hispanic vote and Trump a lower share than the Edison exit polls showed Using wider more geographically and linguistically representative sampling Latino Decisions concluded that Clinton won of Hispanic voters also an improvement over Obama s share in and while Trump won only lower than previous Republicans such as Romney and McCain Additionally the Cooperative Congressional Election Study found that Clinton s share of the Hispanic vote was one percentage point higher than Obama s in while Trump s was seven percentage points lower than Romney s br br On June Alexandria Ocasio Cortez a millennial won the Democratic primary in New York s th congressional district covering parts of The Bronx and Queens in New York City defeating the incumbent Democratic Caucus Chair Joe Crowley in what has been described as the biggest upset victory in the midterm election season and at the age of years became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress She is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and has been endorsed by various politically progressive organizations and individuals According to a Pew Research Center report the election will be the first one when Hispanics are the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the electorate A record million Hispanics were projected to be eligible to vote in the presidential election many of them first time voters On September President Donald J Trump announced his intent to nominate and appoint Eduardo Verastegui to be a member of the President s Advisory Commission on Hispanic Prosperity if re elected after days of the Democratic convention br br Hispanic communities across the United States were long held as a single voting bloc but economic geographic and cultural differences show stark divides in how Hispanic Americans have cast their ballots in Hispanics helped deliver Florida to Donald Trump in part because of Cuban Americans and Venezuelan Americans along with smaller populations such as Nicaraguan Americans and Chilean Americans President Trump s reelection campaign ran pushing a strong anti socialism message as a strategy in Florida to their success However the perceived anti immigrant rhetoric resonated with Arizona and the COVID pandemic Arizona being one of the states hardest hit by the COVID pandemic in the United States The takeaway may be this may be the last election cycle that the Hispanic vote as a whole is more talked about instead of particular communities within it such as Cubans Puerto Ricans Mexican Americans and so on In Texas like in Arizona the Hispanic community mainly being Mexican American one in three Texan voters is now Hispanic Biden did win the Hispanic vote in those states But in Texas percent to percent of Hispanic voters backed Trump in several heavily Hispanic border counties in the Rio Grande Valley region a Democratic stronghold In Florida Trump won percent of the Hispanic vote an point improvement from his performance reported NBC News Recognizing Hispanics as a population that can not only make a differences in swing states like Arizona and Texas or Florida but also really across the country even in places like Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania the number of Hispanic eligible voters may be the reason for the thin margins In percent of Hispanics voted for Ronald Reagan and percent voted for George W Bush in br br In Florida even though Trump won Florida and gained Hispanic voters Biden kept of the Hispanic vote and Trump According to NBC News exit polls of Cuban Americans of Puerto Ricans and of other Hispanics voted for Trump br Subsections of Hispanic voters have a range of historical influences vying to affect their votes Cuban American voters mostly concentrated in south Florida tend to vote Republican in part because of their anathema for socialism the party of Fidel Castro s government that many of their families fled Mexican Americans however have no such historical relationship with either party Puerto Rican voters who have left the island might be influenced by the territory s move towards statehood as a referendum for Trump s relief effort after Hurricane Maria or regarding how it is taxed br Nationwide Hispanics cast million votes in an increase of over
