title: Daylight saving time
id: 47548
Daylight saving time DST also referred to as daylight saving s daylight savings time daylight time United States and Canada or summer time United Kingdom European Union and others is the practice of advancing clocks to make better use of the longer daylight available during summer so that darkness falls at a later clock time The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in spring or late winter and to set clocks back by one hour to standard time in the autumn or fall in North American English hence the mnemonic spring forward and fall back br DST is not usually observed near the Equator where sunrise and sunset times do not vary enough to justify it conversely it is often not observed in places at high latitudes where a one hour clock shift would provide little benefit because of the wide variations in sunrise and sunset times Consequently only a minority of the world s population uses DST Some countries observe it only in some regions for example it is observed only by some Australian states depending on latitude and by all states in the United States except for Hawaii and Arizona within the latter however the Navajo Nation does observe it conforming to federal practice br Historically several ancient societies adopted seasonal changes to their timekeeping to make better use of daylight Roman timekeeping even included changes to water clocks to accommodate this However these were changes to the time divisions of the day rather than setting the whole clock forward In a satirical letter to the editor of the Journal de Paris in Benjamin Franklin suggested that if Parisians could only wake up earlier in the summer they would economize on candle and oil usage but he did not propose changing the clocks In New Zealand entomologist and astronomer George Hudson made the first realistic proposal to change clocks by two hours every spring to the Wellington Philosophical Society but this was not implemented until and in another form In William Willett proposed the adoption of British Summer Time as a way to save energy but although seriously considered by Parliament it was not implemented until br The first implementation of DST was by Port Arthur today merged into Thunder Bay in Ontario Canada in but only locally not nationally The first nation wide implementations were by the German and Austro Hungarian Empires both starting on April Since then many countries have adopted DST at various times particularly since the s energy crisis br br br Rationale br br Industrialized societies usually follow a clock based schedule for daily activities that do not change throughout the course of the year The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school and the coordination of mass transit for example usually remain constant year round In contrast an agrarian society s daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time which change seasonally because of the Earth s axial tilt North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter with the effect becoming greater the farther one moves away from the equator DST is of little use for locations near the Equator because these regions see only a small variation in daylight over the course of the year br After synchronously resetting all clocks in a region to one hour ahead of standard time in spring in anticipation of longer daylight hours individuals following a clock based schedule will be awakened an hour earlier in the solar day than they would have otherwise They will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier in most cases they will have an extra hour of daylight available to them after their workday activities br Proponents of daylight saving time argue that most people prefer a greater increase in daylight hours after the typical nine to five workday Supporters have also argued that DST decreases energy consumption by reducing the need for lighting and heating but the actual effect on overall energy use is heavily disputed br The clock shift is also motivated by practicality In American temperate latitudes for example the sun rises around at the summer solstice and sets around Since most people are asleep at it is seen as more practical to treat as if it is thereby allowing people to wake closer to the sunrise and be active in the evening light br br br Variation within a time zone br The effect of daylight saving time also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone In spite of a width spanning thousands of kilometers all of China is located within a single time zone per government mandate minimizing any potential benefit of daylight saving time there br br br History br Ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does often dividing daylight into hours regardless of daytime so that each daylight hour became progressively longer during spring and shorter during autumn For example the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year at Rome s latitude the third hour from sunrise hora tertia started at solar time and lasted minutes at the winter solstice but at the summer solstice it started at and lasted minutes From the th century onward equal length civil hours supplanted unequal ones so civil time no longer varied by season Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings such as monasteries of Mount Athos and in Jewish ceremonies br Benjamin Franklin published the proverb early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise and published a letter in the Journal de Paris when he was an American envoy to France suggesting that Parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight This satire proposed taxing window shutters rationing candles and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise Despite common misconception Franklin did not actually propose DST th century Europe did not even keep precise schedules However this changed as rail transport and communication networks required a standardization of clocks unknown in Franklin s day br In the Spanish National Assembly Cortes of C diz issued a regulation that moved certain meeting times forward by one hour from May to September in recognition of seasonal changes but it did not change the clocks It also acknowledged that private businesses were in the practice of changing their opening hours to suit daylight conditions but they did so of their volition br br br New Zealand entomologist George Hudson first proposed modern DST His shift work job gave him spare time to collect insects and led him to value after hours daylight In he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two hour daylight saving shift and considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch he followed up with an paper Many publications credit the DST proposal to prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett who independently conceived DST in during a pre breakfast ride when he observed how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer day Willett also was an avid golfer who disliked cutting short his round at dusk His solution was to advance the clock during the summer and he published the proposal two years later Liberal Party member of parliament Robert Pearce took up the proposal introducing the first Daylight Saving Bill to the British House of Commons on February A select committee was set up to examine the issue but Pearce s bill did not become law and several other bills failed in the following years Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in br br Port Arthur Ontario Canada was the first city in the world to enact DST on July This was followed by Orillia Ontario introduced by William Sword Frost while mayor from to The first states to adopt DST German Sommerzeit nationally were those of the German Empire and its World War I ally Austria Hungary commencing on April as a way to conserve coal during wartime Britain most of its allies and many European neutrals soon followed Russia and a few other countries waited until the next year and the United States adopted daylight saving in Most jurisdictions abandoned DST in the years after the war ended in with exceptions including Canada the United Kingdom France Ireland and the United States It became common during World War II some countries adopted double summer time and was standardized in the US by federal law in and widely adopted in Europe from the s as a result of the s energy crisis Since then the world has seen many enactments adjustments and repeals br It is a common myth in the United States that DST was first implemented for the benefit of farmers In reality farmers have been one of the strongest lobbying groups against DST since it was first implemented The factors that influence farming schedules such as morning dew and dairy cattle s readiness to be milked are ultimately dictated by the sun so the clock change introduces unnecessary challenges br DST was first implemented in the US with the Standard Time Act of a wartime measure for seven months during World War I in the interest of adding more daylight hours to conserve energy resources Year round DST or War Time was implemented again during World War II After the war local jurisdictions were free to choose if and when to observe DST until the Uniform Time Act which standardized DST in Permanent daylight saving time was enacted for the winter of but there were complaints of children going to school in the dark and working people commuting and starting their work day in pitch darkness during the winter and it was repealed a year later br br br Procedure br br The relevant authorities usually schedule clock changes to occur at or soon after midnight and on a weekend in order to lessen disruption to weekday schedules A one hour change is usual but twenty minute and two hour changes have been used in the past Notable exceptions today include Lord Howe Island with a thirty minute change and Troll research station that shifts two hours directly between CEST and GMT since br In all countries that observe daylight saving time seasonally i e during summer and not winter the clock is advanced from standard time to daylight saving time in the spring and it is turned back from daylight saving time to standard time in the autumn br For a midnight change in spring a digital display of local time would appear to jump from to For the same clock in autumn the local time would appear to repeat the hour preceding midnight i e it would jump from to br In most countries that observe seasonal daylight saving time clocks revert in winter to standard time An exception exists in Ireland where its winter clock has the same offset UTC and legal name as that in Britain Greenwich Mean Time but while its summer clock also has the same offset as Britain s UTC its legal name is Irish Standard Time as opposed to British Summer Time br Since Morocco observes daylight saving time every month but Ramadan During the holy month the date of which is determined by the lunar calendar and thus moves annually with regard to the Gregorian calendar the country s civil clocks observe Western European Time UTC which geographically overlaps most of the nation At the close of that month its clocks are turned forward to Western European Summer Time UTC br The time at which to change clocks differs across jurisdictions Members of the European Union conduct a coordinated change changing all zones at the same instant at Coordinated Universal Time UTC which means that it changes at Central European Time CET equivalent to Eastern European Time EET As a result the time differences across European time zones remain constant North America coordination of the clock change differs in that each jurisdiction changes at each local clock s which temporarily creates an imbalance with the next time zone until it adjusts its clock one hour later at am there For example Mountain Time is for one hour in the spring two hours ahead of Pacific Time instead of the usual one hour ahead and instead of one hour in the autumn briefly zero hours ahead of Pacific Time br The dates on which clocks change vary with location and year consequently the time differences between regions also vary throughout the year For example Central European Time is usually six hours ahead of North American Eastern Time except for a few weeks in March and October November while the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could be five hours apart during the northern summer three hours during the southern summer and four hours for a few weeks per year Since European Summer Time has been observed from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union Starting in most of the United States and Canada observed DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November almost two thirds of the year Moreover the beginning and ending dates are roughly reversed between the northern and southern hemispheres because spring and autumn are displaced six months For example mainland Chile observes DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March with transitions at the local clock s In some countries clocks are governed by regional jurisdictions within the country such that some jurisdictions change and others do not this is currently the case in Australia Canada and the United States br From year to year the dates on which to change clock may also move for political or social reasons The Uniform Time Act of formalized the United States period of daylight saving time observation as lasting six months it was previously declared locally this period was extended to seven months in and then to eight months in The extension was motivated in part by lobbyists from the candy industry seeking to increase profits by including Halloween October within the daylight saving time period In recent history Australian state jurisdictions not only changed at different local times but sometimes on different dates For example in most states there that observed daylight saving time changed clocks forward on October but Western Australia changed on October br br br Politics religion and sport br The concept of daylight saving has caused controversy since its early proposals Winston Churchill argued that it enlarges the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people who live in this country and pundits have dubbed it Daylight Slaving Time Retailing sports and tourism interests have historically favored daylight saving while agricultural and evening entertainment interests and some religious groups have opposed it energy crises and war prompted its initial adoption br Willett s proposal illustrates several political issues It attracted many supporters including Arthur Balfour Churchill David Lloyd George Ramsay MacDonald King Edward VII who used half hour DST or Sandringham time at Sandringham the managing director of Harrods and the manager of the National Bank Ltd However the opposition proved stronger including Prime Minister H H Asquith William Christie the Astronomer Royal George Darwin Napier Shaw director of the Meteorological Office many agricultural organizations and theatre owners After many hearings a parliamentary committee vote narrowly rejected the proposal in Willett s allies introduced similar bills every year from through to no avail People in the US demonstrated even more skepticism Andrew Peters introduced a DST bill to the House of Representatives in May but it soon died in committee br br Germany and its allies led the way in introducing DST German Sommerzeit during World War I on April aiming to alleviate hardships due to wartime coal shortages and air raid blackouts The political equation changed in other countries the United Kingdom used DST first on May US retailing and manufacturing interests led by Pittsburgh industrialist Robert Garland soon began lobbying for DST but railroads opposed the idea The US entry into the war overcame objections and DST started in br The end of World War I brought a change in DST use Farmers continued to dislike DST and many countries repealed it like Germany itself which dropped DST from to and from to Britain proved an exception it retained DST nationwide but adjusted transition dates over the years for several reasons including special rules during the s and s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings As of summer time began annually on the last Sunday in March under a European Community directive which may be Easter Sunday as in In the US Congress repealed DST after President Woodrow Wilson an avid golfer like Willett vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden Only a few US cities retained DST locally including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London and Chicago and Cleveland to keep pace with New York Wilson s successor as president Warren G Harding opposed DST as a deception reasoning that people should instead get up and go to work earlier in the summer He ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at am rather than am during the summer of Some businesses followed suit though many others did not the experiment was not repeated br Since Germany s adoption of DST in the world has seen many enactments adjustments and repeals of DST with similar politics involved The history of time in the United States features DST during both world wars but no standardization of peacetime DST until St Paul and Minneapolis Minnesota kept different clocks for two weeks in May the capital city decided to switch to daylight saving time while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law In the mid s Clorox and Eleven provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the extension to US DST Both senators from Idaho Larry Craig and Mike Crapo voted for it based on the premise that fast food restaurants sell more French fries made from Idaho potatoes during DST br A referendum on the introduction of daylight saving took place in Queensland Australia in after a three year trial of daylight saving It was defeated with a no vote with regional and rural areas strongly opposed and those in the metropolitan southeast in favor br In the United Kingdom s Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents supported a proposal to observe year round daylight saving time but it has been opposed by some industries by some postal workers and farmers and particularly by those living in the northern regions of the UK br In the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the extension to US DST br In December the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland DS SEQ political party was officially registered in Queensland advocating the implementation of a dual time zone arrangement for daylight saving in South East Queensland while the rest of the state maintained standard time DS SEQ contested the March Queensland state election with candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote equating to around across the electorates contested After a three year trial more than of Western Australians voted against DST in with rural areas strongly opposed Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington introduced the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill into the Queensland parliament on April after being approached by the DS SEQ political party calling for a referendum at the next state election on the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland under a dual time zone arrangement The Queensland parliament rejected Wellington s bill on June br Russia declared in that it would stay in DST all year long UTC and Belarus followed with a similar declaration The Soviet Union had operated under permanent summer time from to at least Russia s plan generated widespread complaints due to the dark of winter time mornings and thus was abandoned in The country changed its clocks to standard time UTC on October intending to stay there permanently br In the United States Arizona with the exception of the Navajo Nation Hawaii and the five populated territories American Samoa Guam Puerto Rico the Northern Mariana Islands and the US Virgin Islands do not participate in daylight saving time Indiana only began participating in daylight saving time as recently as Since Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio has repeatedly filed bills to extend daylight saving time permanently into winter without success br Mexico observed summertime daylight saving time starting in In late the nation s clocks fell back for the last time in restoration of permanent standard time br br br Religion br br Some religious groups and individuals have opposed DST on religious grounds For religious Muslims and Jews it makes religious practices such as prayer and fasting more difficult or inconvenient br Some Muslim countries such as Morocco have temporarily abandoned DST during Ramadan br In Israel DST has been a point of contention between the religious and secular resulting in fluctuations over the years and a shorter DST period than in the EU and US Religious Jews prefer a shorter DST due to DST delaying scheduled morning prayers thus conflicting with standard working and business hours Additionally DST is ended before Yom Kippur a hour fast day starting and ending at sunset much of which is spent praying in synagogue until the fast ends at sunset since DST would result in the day ending later which many feel makes it more difficult br In the US Orthodox Jewish groups have opposed extensions to DST as well as a bipartisan bill that would make DST permanent saying it will interfere with the ability of members of our community to engage in congregational prayers and get to their places of work on time br br br Effects br br br Effects on electricity consumption br br Proponents of DST generally argue that it saves energy promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening in summer and is therefore good for physical and psychological health reduces traffic accidents reduces crime or is good for business Opponents argue the actual energy savings are inconclusive br Although energy conservation goals still remain energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then Electricity use is greatly affected by geography climate and economics so the results of a study conducted in one place may not be relevant to another country or climate br A meta analysis of studies found that DST leads to electricity savings of during the days when DST applies Several studies have suggested that DST increases motor fuel consumption but a United States Department of Energy report found no significant increase in motor gasoline consumption due to the United States extension of DST An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting once a primary use of electricity br br br Economic effects br It has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency and that in the daylight saving effect implied an estimated one day loss of billion on US stock exchanges Others have asserted that the observed results depend on methodology and disputed the findings though the original authors have refuted points raised by disputers br br br Effects on health br There are measurable adverse effects of clock shifts on human health It has been shown to disrupt human circadian rhythms negatively affecting human health in the process and that the yearly DST clock shifts can increase health risks such as heart attack and traffic accidents br A study in the American Economic Journal Applied Economics estimated that the transition into DST caused over deaths at a social cost of million annually primarily by increasing sleep deprivation br A correlation between clock shifts and increase in traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden Four reports have found that this effect is smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities In the European Parliament reviewing a possible abolition of DST approved a more in depth evaluation examining the disruption of the human body s circadian rhythms which provided evidence suggesting the existence of an association between DST clock shifts and a modest increase of occurrence of acute myocardial infarction especially in the first week after the spring shift However a Netherlands study found against the majority of investigations contrary or minimal effect Year round standard time not year round DST is proposed by some to be the preferred option for public health and safety Clock shifts were found to increase the risk of heart attack by percent and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks br br br Effects on social relations br DST hurts prime time television broadcast ratings drive ins and other theaters Artificial outdoor lighting has a marginal and sometimes even contradictory influence on crime and fear of crime br Later sunsets from DST are thought to affect behavior for example increasing participation in after school sports programs or outdoor afternoon sports such as golf and attendance at professional sporting events Advocates of daylight saving time argue that having more hours of daylight between the end of a typical workday and evening induces people to consume other goods and services br In a publication of three replicating studies of individuals between individuals and transecting societies demonstrated that sleep loss affects the human motivation to help others which in its fMRI findings is associated with deactivation of key nodes within the social cognition brain network that facilitates prosociality Furthermore they detected through analysis of over three million real world charitable donations that the loss of sleep inflicted by the transition to daylight saving time reduces altruistic giving compared to controls being states not implementing DST They conclude that the effects on civil society are non trivial br Another study which also examined sleep manipulation due to the shift to daylight saving time in the spring analyzed archival data from judicial punishment imposed by US federal courts which showed sleep deprived judges exact more severe penalties br br br Inconvenience br DST s clock shifts have the disadvantage of complexity People must remember to change their clocks this can be time consuming particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely People who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of multiple DST rules as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way The length of the calendar day becomes variable it is no longer always hours Disruption to meetings travel broadcasts billing systems and records management is common and can be expensive During an autumn transition from to a clock shows local times from through twice possibly leading to confusion br Many farmers oppose DST particularly dairy farmers as the milking patterns of their cows do not change with the time and others whose hours are set by the sun There is concern for schoolchildren who are out in the darkness during the morning due to late sunrises br br br Remediation br Some clock shift problems could be avoided by adjusting clocks continuously or at least more gradually for example Willett at first suggested weekly minute transitions but this would add complexity and has never been implemented DST inherits and can magnify the disadvantages of standard time For example when reading a sundial one must compensate for it along with time zone and natural discrepancies Also sun exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect br Andrew D Huberman a professor of neurobiology at Stanford University suggests viewing sunlight before the sun is overhead exercise ideally outside before pm the day following the clock adjustment This applies regardless of if the sky were to be covered by clouds br br br Terminology br As explained by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the American National Council of Teachers of English the form daylight savings time with an s was already much more common than the older form daylight saving time in American English the change has been virtually accomplished in Nevertheless dictionaries such as Merriam Webster s American Heritage and Oxford which typically describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage and therefore also list the newer form still list the older form first This is because the older form is still very common in print and is preferred by many editors Although daylight saving time is considered correct daylight savings time with an s is commonly used The first two words are sometimes hyphenated daylight saving s time Merriam Webster s also lists the forms daylight saving without time daylight savings without time and daylight time The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style explains the development and current situation as follows Although the singular form daylight saving time is the original one dating from the early th century and is preferred by some usage critics the plural form is now extremely common in AmE The rise of daylight savings time appears to have resulted from the avoidance of a miscue when saving is used readers might puzzle momentarily over whether saving is a gerund the saving of daylight or a participle the time for saving Using savings as the adjective as in savings account or savings bond makes perfect sense More than that it ought to be accepted as the better form In Britain Willett s proposal used the term daylight saving but by the term summer time replaced daylight saving time in draft legislation The same or similar expressions are used in many other languages Sommerzeit in German zomertijd in Dutch kes aika in Finnish horario de verano or hora de verano in Spanish and heure d t in French br The name of local time typically changes when DST is observed American English replaces standard with daylight for example Pacific Standard Time PST becomes Pacific Daylight Time PDT In the United Kingdom the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is British Summer Time BST and British English typically inserts summer into other time zone names e g Central European Time CET becomes Central European Summer Time CEST br br The North American English mnemonic spring forward fall back also spring ahead spring up and fall behind helps people remember in which direction to shift the clocks br br br Computing br br Changes to DST rules cause problems in existing computer installations For example the change to DST rules in North America required that many computer systems be upgraded with the greatest onus on e mail and calendar programs The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate information technologists br Some applications standardize on UTC to avoid problems with clock shifts and time zone differences Likewise most modern operating systems internally handle and store all times as UTC and only convert to local time for display However even if UTC is used internally the systems still require external leap second updates and time zone information to correctly calculate local time as needed Many systems in use today base their date time calculations from data derived from the tz database also known as zoneinfo br br br IANA time zone database br The tz database maps a name to the named location s historical and predicted clock shifts This database is used by many computer software systems including most Unix like operating systems Java and the Oracle RDBMS HP s tztab database is similar but incompatible When temporal authorities change DST rules zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance In Unix like systems the TZ environment variable specifies the location name as in TZ America New York In many of those systems there is also a system wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set this setting is controlled by the contents of the etc localtime file which is usually a symbolic link or hard link to one of the zoneinfo files Internal time is stored in time zone independent Unix time the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display br Older or stripped down systems may support only the TZ values required by POSIX which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value For example TZ EST EDT M M specifies time for the eastern United States starting in Such a TZ value must be changed whenever DST rules change and the new value applies to all years mishandling some older timestamps br br br Opposition to clock changes br br A move to permanent daylight saving time staying on summer hours all year with no clock shifts is sometimes advocated and is currently implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina Belarus Iceland Kyrgyzstan Morocco Namibia Saskatchewan Singapore Syria Turkey Turkmenistan Uzbekistan and Yukon Although Saskatchewan follows Central Standard Time its capital city Regina experiences solar noon close to in effect putting the city on permanent daylight time Similarly Yukon is classified as being in the Mountain Time Zone though in effect it observes permanent Pacific Daylight Time to align with the Pacific time zone in summer but local solar noon in the capital Whitehorse occurs nearer to in effect putting Whitehorse on double daylight time br The United Kingdom and Ireland put clocks forward by an extra hour during World War II and experimented with year round summer time between and Russia switched to permanent DST from to but the move proved unpopular because of the extremely late winter sunrises in Russia switched permanently back to standard time However the change to permanent DST has proven popular in Turkey with the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources saying the practice saves millions in energy costs and reduces depression and anxiety levels associated with short exposure to daylight br In September the European Commission proposed to end seasonal clock changes as of Member states would have the option of observing either daylight saving time all year round or standard time all year round In March the European Parliament approved the commission s proposal while deferring implementation from until In response to this proposition the European Sleep Research Society stated installing permanent Central European Time CET standard time or wintertime is the best option for public health As of October the decision has not been confirmed by the Council of the European Union The council has asked the commission to produce a detailed assessment of its effects but the Commission considers that the onus is on the Member States to find a common position in Council As a result progress on the issue is effectively blocked br In the United States several states have enacted legislation to implement permanent DST but the bills would require Congress to change federal law in order to take effect The Uniform Time Act of permits states to opt out of DST and observe permanent standard time but it does not permit permanent DST Florida senator Marco Rubio in particular has promoted changing the federal law to implement permanent DST with the support of the Florida Chamber of Commerce seeking to boost evening revenue In Rubio s Sunshine Protection Act passed the United States Senate without committee review by way of voice consent with many senators afterward stating they were unaware of the vote or its topic The bill was stopped in the US House where questions were raised as to whether permanent DST or standard time would be more beneficial br Advocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice yearly clock shifts Additional benefits have also been cited including safer roadways boosting the tourism industry and energy savings Detractors cite the relatively late sunrises particularly in winter that year round DST entails br Some experts in circadian rhythms and sleep health recommend year round standard time as the preferred option for public health and safety Several chronobiology societies have published position papers against adopting DST permanently A paper by the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms states based on comparisons of large populations living in DST or ST or on western versus eastern edges of time zones the advantages of permanent ST outweigh switching to DST annually or permanently The World Federation of Societies for Chronobiology stated that the scientific literature strongly argues against the switching between DST and Standard Time and even more so against adopting DST permanently The American Academy of Sleep Medicine AASM holds the position that seasonal time changes should be abolished in favor of a fixed national year round standard time and that standard time is a better option than daylight saving time for our health mood and well being The AASM s position is endorsed by other nonprofits including the American College of Chest Physicians National Safety Council and National PTA br Current public opinion polls show mixed results Surveys reported between and by the National Sleep Foundation YouGov CBS and Monmouth University indicate more Americans would prefer permanent DST A survey by the National Opinion Research Center and a survey by the Associated Press indicate more Americans would prefer permanent Standard Time The National Sleep Foundation YouGov and Monmouth University polls leaned significantly in favor of seeing daylight saving time made permanent The Monmouth University poll reported preferring year round DST and preferring year round standard time In and NORC found of Americans to be in favor of permanent DST before its implementation during the Oil Crisis and only to support permanent DST the following February br In March the company Titan Casket and actor Ryan Reynolds team up to release a satirical commercial starring David Dastmalchian that pokes fun at DST Working together they launch a website BuryDaylightSavings com The website provides a place for Americans to find the email addresses of their local legislators and send them an email about ending daylight saving time According to data shared by Titan hospitals see a increase in heart attacks and a increase in fatal crashes each year when the time
