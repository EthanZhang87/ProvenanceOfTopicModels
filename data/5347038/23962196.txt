census recorded a resident population of in the states and the national capital of Washington D C reflecting an increase of percent or over that of The growth rate was the second lowest ever recorded and the net increase was the sixth highest in history This was the first census where the most populous states each surpassed million residents and the first census where the most populous cities each

undercounts in several minority populations and in several states br br br Background br br As required by the United States Constitution the U S census has been conducted every years since The United

boundaries for districts such as congressional districts redistricting state legislative districts and school districts br br br Federal funding distribution br Dozens of federal programs use census data to help direct funding to state and local areas Census results help determine how more than billion in federal funding are allocated to states and communities each year for roads schools hospitals health clinics emergency services and more br br br Major design changes br The census was the st U S census to offer a full internet response option and the st to extensively use technology instead of paper to manage and conduct fieldwork br Key design changes included br br Three response options internet paper and phone Ultimately every household that didn t respond online was sent a paper form Households in areas with low internet access received a paper form from the start br Multiple languages In addition to English respondents were able to complete the census in other languages online or by phone in addition language guides language glossaries and language identification cards were provided in non English languages br In office address canvassing In the and earlier censuses census workers walked every street in the United States to verify addresses on the ground The census used satellite imagery and GPS to identify areas where housing had changed and assigned workers to verify those addresses in person br Digital case management Census takers used secure iPhone smartphones to receive daily assignments navigate to interviews communicate with supervisors and submit timesheets Special software was designed to optimize assignments streamline management flag issues immediately and reduce unnecessary follow up visits br Streamlined follow up visits using existing data sources The census used existing government and third party data to identify vacant households to predict the best time of day to visit a particular household and to count and provide characteristics for the people in the household after multiple attempts using existing high quality data from trusted sources br br br Questions and data uses br br As required by the Census Act the U S Census Bureau submitted a list of questions to Congress on March The U S census will not share any participant s information with any government agency as it is prohibited by Title United States code It has been challenged but the Supreme Court has always prevailed in reference to Title to protect the confidentiality and privacy of information provided Based on those questions and a subsequent executive order the census asked br br The number of people living or staying at the respondent s home on April br Used for the total count and to ensure everyone is counted once only once

the census takers who work all over the country to conduct the census br August The Census Bureau conducts the in field address canvassing operation Census takers visit areas that have added or lost housing in recent years to ensure the Bureau s address list is up to date The census was the first modern census that did not verify every address in person on the ground Instead satellite imagery U S

postmarked on or before October would be processed as long as they arrived at the processing center by October br br br Marketing and partnerships br br As in previous censuses the census relied on a network of trusted voices nationwide to help raise awareness answer questions and encourage community members to participate Hundreds of local complete count committees are dedicating resources to the efforts nationwide br VMLY R formerly Young Rubicam secured the Integrated Communications Contract for the census campaign in August As the contract s primary agency of record VMLY R created an integrated team for this project Team Y R which includes subcontractors specializing in minority outreach digital media earned media and more br In March the campaign unveiled the census tagline Shape your future START HERE The tagline was based on research that demonstrated which types of messages will reach and motivate all populations including segments of the population who are historically hard to count br br br Implementation problems br br The printing company Cenveo won the million contract in October to produce census forms and reminders but went bankrupt less than four months later The inspector general of the U S Government Publishing Office said the agency failed to check the company s financial status and improperly allowed the company to lower its bid after other bids were unsealed br The coronavirus pandemic caused delays to census field operations and counts of the homeless and people living in group quarters As of April Census Day the Census Bureau still planned to complete the count by the end of the year br br br COVID pandemic emergency br On March the U S Census Bureau issued a press release by Director Steven Dillingham announcing that census field operations would be suspended for two weeks until April due to the COVID pandemic On March the agency announced it would temporarily suspend in person interviews for its on going surveys The agency claimed that staffing adjustments at its call centers due to implementing health guidance had led to increases in call wait times affecting different languages at different times According to its own documentation the U S Census Bureau continued to pay census employees even though field operations were supposed to be suspended br On March the U S Census Bureau issued another press release announcing census field operations would be suspended for an additional two weeks through April Census Bureau officials communicated to the media that on March they learned an employee had tested positive for COVID at the agency s National Processing Center in Jeffersonville Indiana which the agency kept open during the suspension claiming they would transition to the minimum number of on site staff necessary to continue operations The agency announced on April that it took steps to make more employees available to respond to requests at the call centers br In a joint statement on April U S Department of Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and U S Census Bureau director Steven Dillingham announced further operational adjustments to the census due to COVID health and safety concerns In the statement it was explained that steps were being taken to reactivate field offices beginning June in person activities including all interaction with the public enumeration office work and processing activities would incorporate the most current guidance to promote the health and safety of staff and the public including personal protective equipment PPE and social distancing practices This release stated in order to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the census the Census Bureau is seeking statutory relief from Congress of additional calendar days to deliver final apportionment counts due to the COVID emergency and that under this plan the Census Bureau would extend the window for field data collection and self response to October which will allow for apportionment counts to be delivered to the president by April and redistricting data to be delivered to the states no later than September br On April U S Census Bureau director Steven Dillingham wrote to Department of Commerce inspector general Peggy E Gustafson responding to a March memo sent by the Office of the Inspector General requesting information about the Census Bureau s plans to respond to the COVID emergency by March The inspector general s memo asked how the Bureau would address staff and enumerator safety Dillingham s April letter br br The Census Bureau is closely coordinating the acquisition of needed PPE materials for field and office staff through the Department of Commerce s Coronavirus Taskforce Federal partners include the Department of Homeland Security and the Centers for Disease Control We have generated and submitted estimates for equipment needs On April the Agency s internal task force met and discussed our estimates for needed equipment potential delivery dates and budget implications We continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary br br To ensure the completeness and accuracy of the census the Census Bureau is seeking statutory relief from Congress of additional calendar days to deliver final apportionment counts br Under this plan the Census Bureau would extend the window for field data collection and self response to October which will allow for apportionment counts to be delivered to the President by April and redistricting data to be delivered to the states no later than September br On April Dillingham and other Census Bureau officials briefed the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on the agency s response to the COVID emergency This briefing came after many requests from the committee since March including a last minute cancellation on April In the briefing Albert E Fontenot Jr the associate director for decennial census programs explained that the bureau was planning a phased start to many of our census operations rather than beginning field operations nationwide on June as previously announced and said operations would resume at different times in different areas of the country based on federal state and local public health guidance as well as the availability of personal protective equipment prioritizing reopening mail processing centers and census offices and said the bureau would notify Congress as it begins to restart operations However the National Processing Center and Area Census Offices had remained open br Starting on May the U S Census Bureau began publishing dates as it claimed to begin a phased restart of some census field operations in select geographic areas and said they had ordered personal protective equipment PPE for all field staff including those that work in a field office These materials will be secured and provided to staff prior to restarting operations Publicly published procurement data shows that an award was signed on April for non medical reusable face masks for area census offices in a contract awarded to Industries for the Blind and Visually Impaired Inc Around that time two contracts for hand sanitizer were awarded to Travis Association for the Blind one signed on May in a contract and the other signed on May in a contract with both contracts listing the place of principal performance as Jeffersonville Indiana The agency decided that face shields were necessary to protect employees from COVID exposure but provided them only to personnel at the headquarters and national processing centers An OSHA complaint was made from Oklahoma City on May complaining that employees were not able to practice social distancing and were not provided with adequate personal protective equipment such as gloves and masks showing the office was open prior to the Census Bureau s published office restart date of May br Additional restart dates starting May were published on May for other geographic areas in eleven states An OSHA complaint was recorded that same day from St Louis that desks remained close together with no physical dividers improper sanitation practices were being used and no remote work for high risk employees The published restart date for the St Louis Area Census Office was May br On May procurement information for two contracts was entered into the Federal Procurement Data System One contract was for awarded to Industries for the Blind and Visually Impaired Inc for hand sanitizer and a contract for for four ounce ml hand sanitizers awarded to NewView Oklahoma Inc both with the place of principal performance listed as Jeffersonville Indiana br May saw two additional contracts one was a disinfectant wipes contract for awarded to Industries for the Blind and Visually Impaired Inc and the other was a contract for awarded to NewView Oklahoma for blue nitrile gloves both with a place of principal performance listed as Jeffersonville Indiana br A press release on May announced May restart dates for ten more states An OSHA complaint was made from Concord California on April that there were at least two confirmed cases of COVID unrecorded on OSHA logs and that employees were working in close quarters with no disinfection of shared equipment such as headsets laptops and tablets The published restart date for the Concord California Area Census Office was May br Offices were reopened in the areas of American Samoa the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Guam and the U S Virgin Islands in preparation for resuming operations for the Island Areas Censuses on May br On May a press release was published announcing restart of operations in seven additional states and the Washington D C area starting from the week of June An OSHA complaint was made from Austin Texas on May complaining that CDC guidelines were not being followed that employees were unable to practice social distancing and that employees experiencing flu like symptoms and positive COVID test results continued to come to work showing the office was open prior to the Census Bureau s published office restart date of June br In a June press release the U S Census Bureau announced additional area census offices ACOs would restart on June saying that with these additions field activities have restarted in of area census offices stateside all ACOs in Puerto Rico and the island areas and of the nation s update leave workload will have resumed The June press release was reissued on June which included the addition of a June restart at the Window Rock Arizona Area Census Office Days later the Navajo Nation began reinstating lockdown restrictions and curfews due to a surge in new cases br A June press release shared that the update leave UL operation had resumed as well as fingerprinting of selected applicants The agency announced that the update enumerate UE operation would restart on June in remote parts of northern Maine and southeast Alaska where employees update the Census Bureau s address list and interview households for the census claiming all census takers have been trained on social distancing protocols and will be issued personal protective equipment PPE and will follow local guidelines for their use The June press release also shared that the communications campaign had been adapted due to the pandemic and would continue through October the end of census data collection operations with additional paid media planned for July August and September though a July list of media vendors showed only plans through the end of July br On August the Census Bureau announced that field collection would end on September rather than October as planned in April In a leaked internal document Census Bureau career officials determined that starting Nonresponse Followup Operations in this Replan would put the health and safety of employees at risk stating These ACOs will have to deploy staff regardless of the COVID risk in those areas to open on these dates On September Mark H Zabarsky Principal Assistant Inspector General for Audit and Evaluation published an alert on behalf of the Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General which stated that the number of COVID related safety issues raised by hotline complaints tripled between July and August br br br State rankings br br br City rankings br br br Citizenship question debate br The U S decennial census is used to determine federal funds grants and support to states The Census Bureau had included a citizenship question until when it was removed though it continued to include a question asking about place of birth In a January memo an initial evaluation by Census Bureau officials advised against such a question saying that compiling citizenship data from existing administrative records is more accurate and far less expensive However Wilbur Ross secretary of the United States Department of Commerce which oversees the Census Bureau decided the administrative approach alone would not be sufficient The Census Bureau announced in March its plan to add a question related to citizenship for the census Is this person a citizen of the United States For the census Ross told Congress the citizenship numbers were necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act s protection against voting discrimination Ross was accused by Democrats in Congress of lying that the citizenship question was requested by the Justice Department and approved by him br Upon the bureau s announcement several state and city officials criticized the decision reiterating the concern about discouraging participation from immigrants resulting in undercounting and questioning the motives of Secretary Ross in adding the question Three simultaneous separate federal lawsuits came out of this discovery occurring at the district courts of New York Maryland and California During the controversy over the census question the Census Bureau ran a test census in June on about households to determine what effects adding the census question would have on participation and to prepare the bureau its staffing and its counting measurements to handle the potential lack of responses due to the citizenship question br During these trials documents released in May showed that the late Thomas B Hofeller an architect of Republican gerrymandering had found that adding the census question could help to gerrymander maps that would be advantageous to Republicans and non Hispanic whites Hofeller later wrote the DOJ letter which justified the policy by claiming it was needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act Following this discovery the United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform issued subpoenas for the Department of Justice to provide materials related to the census question and to question both Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and United States Attorney General William Barr seeking action to judge if they are in contempt The Trump administration on June asserted executive privilege over portions of the requested documents As a result the House committee subsequently voted along party lines to hold both Ross and Barr in contempt that day The full House voted to hold Ross and Barr in contempt on July in a vote along party lines br br br New York District Court and subsequent Supreme Court case br br A lawsuit led by New York state s attorney general Barbara Underwood and joined by seventeen other states fifteen cities and other civil rights groups was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York During the discovery phase of the trial new information came to light that Ross had had previous discussions with Steve Bannon before March with the intent to add the citizenship question contradicting statements he had made to Congress in March This led district judge Jesse M Furman in September to ask that Ross clear a day in his schedule to give a deposition to the court related to the addition of the census question prior to the planned start of the trial in November br The Trump administration filed a writ of mandamus to the United States Supreme Court requesting that they postpone the trial and also to defer any involvement with Ross until the start of the trial The Supreme Court issued an order that allowed the trial United States Census Bureau v State of New York to go forward but agreed to postpone Ross s deposition until after the start of the trial The Supreme Court also agreed to treat the writ of mandamus as a writ of petition and granted certiorari to review the question raised by the government of whether a district court can request deposition of a high ranking executive branch official on a matter related to a trial before evidence has been presented br Judge Furman ruled in January that the addition of the citizenship question to the census was unlawful saying the decision to add a citizenship question to the census even if it did not violate the Constitution itself was unlawful for a multitude of independent reasons and must be set aside The Justice Department filed a petition for writ of certiorari before judgment to have the case directly heard by the Supreme Court and bypass the normal appeal which would have been heard by the Second Circuit given the pending deadline of June to publish the census forms The Supreme Court accepted the petition related to Furman s ruling on February a separate matter from the question of Ross s deposition and the case s oral arguments were heard on April br The Supreme Court issued its decision on June rejecting the Trump administration s stated rationale for including the question While the Court majority agreed that the question was allowable under the Enumeration Act they also agreed with the ability of the District Court to ask Commerce for further explanation for the question under the Administrative Procedures Act APA They also agreed that the answers Commerce had provided at the time appeared to be contrived and pretextual leaving open the possibility that Commerce could offer a better rationale The case was remanded back to the District Court to allow Commerce to provide a better explanation for the rationale of the question to the District Court who would deem if that was sufficient before allowing the question on the census The question would be allowed on the census only if these steps can be completed before the self imposed form printing deadline On July the DOJ announced that it was replacing its entire legal team dealing with that question but on July Furman rejected the DOJ action saying reasons must be given for the withdrawal of each attorney and that the administration had been insisting for months the question needed to be settled by July br The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU has taken steps to introduce the Hofeller evidence into the New York case but it will not be heard until late after the census forms are to be published br br br California District Court case br The second suit over the census question came in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California under Judge Richard Seeborg raised by the state of California and several cities within it In March Seeborg similarly found as Furman had in New York that the addition of the census question was unconstitutional and issued an injunction to block its use The government appealed to the Ninth Circuit before the Supreme Court remanded the case br br br Maryland District Court case br A similar question related to the intent of the question was raised by several immigrants rights groups in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland The case was overseen by Judge George J Hazel in the District of Maryland Hazel had found for the pro immigration groups in April ruling that the addition of an immigration question to the census was unconstitutional The government issued its appeal to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals br The new Hofeller evidence was presented to Hazel as the case was being heard on appeal during June at the Fourth Circuit Hazel said the new evidence raises a substantial issue On June the Fourth Circuit remanded the case back to Hazel s District Court with the newly provided evidence and to review if the additional evidence showed discriminatory intent Should Hazel find such intent it would be possible for him to place an injunction on the addition of the census question during a new discovery phase regardless of the Supreme Court decision in Department of Commerce v New York This action would effectively render the question moot since the census forms would need to be published at this point without the citizenship question to meet the mailing deadlines br br br Subsequent actions br President Trump after the Supreme Court decision in Department of Commerce was announced stated his intent to find a way to delay the census as long as possible so the judicial matter could be resolved On July the Department of Justice DOJ announced that the citizenship question would not be included in the census and the Commerce Department began printing census forms without a citizenship question However the next day Trump insisted his administration was absolutely moving forward with the citizenship question and the Justice Department confirmed in court that it had been instructed to find a legal way to include it in the census br In response to an order from Judge Hazel the Justice Department affirmed on July that it will be seeking a route to add the citizenship question to the census though at the time did not know which route it would take Hazel had ordered this response as if the department was intending to add the question he could begin determining a schedule in coordination with Judge Furman in the New York court for further proceedings and discovery in both the New York and the Maryland lawsuits On July the DOJ announced its intention to replace its entire legal team on the case but Furman allowed the DOJ to dismiss only two of its eleven attorneys writing in the July rejection that the DOJ had provide d no reasons let alone satisfactory reasons for the substitution of counsel Furman pointed out that the case had already run past the DOJ s own previously requested deadline of July and replacing counsel would cause further delays br Separate from the events in the courts Trump has said he also considered using an executive order to place the citizenship question on the census However on July he issued Executive Order directing the Department of Commerce to obtain citizenship data from other federal agencies rather than via the census He added that we are not backing down in our effort to determine the citizenship status of the United States population and that data from other federal agencies would be far more accurate than a census question A spokesperson for the Department of Justice said that although the DOJ had agreed with Ross s plan to include the question Today s executive order represents an alternative path to collecting the best citizenship data now available which is vital for informed policymaking and numerous other reasons Accordingly the department will promptly inform the courts that the government will not include a citizenship question on the decennial census Besides federal agencies the Department of Commerce is obtaining citizenship data from state records br Joe Biden on his first day of his presidency on January issued an executive order that revoked both Trump s July executive order and Trump s July memo as to have the census follow the standard practice of including the counts of undocumented immigrants within the final numbers The order did not rescind a directive for the Census Bureau to use government records to produce block level citizenship data br br br Apportionment challenges br br br Alabama lawsuit br While the census question was in litigation the state of Alabama and one of its congressional representatives Mo Brooks filed a lawsuit against the Department of Commerce and the Census Bureau in May in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama asserting that the framers of the Constitution never intended for illegal immigrants to be included in the census count or apportionment base The state believed it would lose a congressional seat to other states that have had increased numbers of immigrants in the last decade The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund sought to intervene on behalf of Latino voters as well as the city of San Jose California and Santa Clara County California and King County Washington arguing that eliminating of illegal immigrants would affect federal funding for their cities and counties The motion was granted by the end of br As the census question case continued the Census Bureau spoke of other means to obtain immigration data and Barr referencing the Alabama suit said that for example there is a current dispute over whether illegal aliens can be included for apportionment purposes Depending on the resolution of that dispute this data may be relevant to those considerations We will be studying this issue Spurred by Barr s comments that the government would not defend itself in the case a coalition of fifteen states and other groups also moved to intervene which was granted by September br br br July memo br br On July President Trump signed a memo to the Department of Commerce Memorandum on Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base Following the Census with instructions not to include illegal immigrants in the census totals for purposes of apportionment The memo said the Constitution does not define which persons must be included in the apportionment base and past censuses have excluded some legal immigrants in the country temporarily justifying the change Law and census experts said this was an invalid interpretation as past case law has supported inclusion of whole persons including illegal immigrants and the ACLU immediately said they planned to file a lawsuit against the administration over the memo Common Cause the city of Atlanta and other groups and individuals filed the first suit seeking an injunction to prevent the government from executing on the memo a week after it was signed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia br On September a three judge panel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York unanimously rejected the order ruling that it was so obviously illegal a lawsuit challenging it was unnecessary Eight days later the Trump administration filed notice that it would appeal the decision directly to the Supreme Court bypassing the circuit court appeals process The Supreme Court accepted the petition on October and scheduled expedited oral arguments in the case on November The Court ruled in a per curiam decision on December that the case was premature due to lack of standing and ripeness but did not rule on any of the constitutional challenges at the time The decision vacated the District Court s ruling and remanded the case to the District Court to be dismissed br br br Early completion of count br The Trump administration sought to complete the census count earlier than originally scheduled In September federal district court judge Lucy Koh issued a preliminary injunction against the plan to end counting on September rather than the scheduled October saying the Commerce Department never articulated a satisfactory explanation She also blocked a plan to deliver the count results to the White House by December rather than the original April delivery date when Trump might be out of office On the next business day Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the count would end October as the administration appealed Koh s decision to the th circuit Koh ordered the government to produce documents to show the Commerce Department s reasoning The appeals court upheld Koh s ruling and the Census Bureau announced on October that the count would continue until October Also on October Koh threatened to hold Ross in contempt for repeated violations of her order br The th circuit decision was appealed to the Supreme Court On October in a ruling the court issued an unsigned order granting the request to end the count early Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the lone dissenter saying that meeting the deadline at the expense of the accuracy of the census is not a cost worth paying especially when the Government has failed to show why it could not bear the lesser cost of expending more resources to meet the deadline or continuing its prior efforts to seek an extension from Congress The count ultimately ended at a m Eastern Time on October br br br Biden changes br As one of his first acts in office President Joe Biden signed Executive Order on January to discontinue citizenship tabulations at the city block level using census data with administrative records He also revoked a Trump directive that would have excluded those in the country illegally from the figures used for apportioning congressional seats among the states br br br Differential privacy br Researchers widely criticized the Census Bureau for intentionally making block level data inaccurate by using differential privacy In order to purportedly prevent identification of individuals age gender race household relationships or homeownership disclosure avoidance noise was added to the data shifting individuals between blocks towns or other units This can result in substantial discrepancies in minority populations and the sizes of small places For example Monowi Nebraska known for being the country s smallest incorporated municipality was incorrectly reported to have two residents instead of one Redistricting data would also be corrupted making equal size districts and majority minority districts more difficult br br br Accuracy br On March the Census Bureau released estimates of total overcount and undercount by demographic characteristic The results found that the total Hispanic population had likely been undercounted by the Black population by and Some other race by Asians were estimated to have been overcounted by Non Hispanic Whites by and Pacific Islanders by Native Americans were estimated to have been undercounted by however those living on reservations were undercounted by while those living elsewhere were overcounted by br Additional data released on May found that six states Arkansas Florida Illinois Mississippi Tennessee and Texas had significant undercounts and eight states Delaware Hawaii Massachusetts Minnesota New York Ohio Rhode Island and Utah had significant overcounts of their populations br br br See also br Race and ethnicity in the United States census br br br br br br Further reading br Hillygus D Sunshine Lopez Jesse Easy as Challenges of the Census and
