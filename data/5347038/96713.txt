Mountains was sometimes called the Cherokee Mountains The early explorers and settlers divided the Cherokee people into three divisions depending on location and dialect the Lower Middle and Over the Hill At least four Cherokee settlements once were in what would later become Rabun County A Middle settlement called Stikayi Stiyaki Sticoa Stekoa was located on Stekoa Creek probably southeast of the present day Clayton An Over the Hill settlement called Tallulah was located on the upper portion of the Tallulah River Another two Cherokee settlements of unknown division also existed Chicherohe Chechero which was destroyed during the American Revolutionary War located along Warwoman Creek east of Clayton and Eastertoy Eastatowth Estatowee which was located near the present day Dillard br Despite the prominence of the Cherokee evidence exists that other Native Americans were in the region before them A mound similar to others across North Georgia including the famous Etowah Indian Mounds is located about one mile km east of Dillard Georgia and is likely a remnant of an earlier mound building Native American culture known as the Mississippian culture The mound location is listed

American Revolution The settlers were initially tolerated but tensions increased as displaced Cherokees moved in from other areas Eventually the white settlers were viewed as invaders who did not respect nature and killed the game and as a result raids between the clashing cultures became commonplace For the most part the hostilities ended a few years before the Cherokee ceded the land to Georgia in br The Georgia General Assembly passed an act to create the county on December becoming Georgia s forty seventh county The northern border of the county was established as latitude N which
