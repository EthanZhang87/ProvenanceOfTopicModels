The United States Census Bureau USCB officially the Bureau of the Census is a principal agency of the U S Federal Statistical System responsible for producing data about the American people and economy The Census Bureau is part of the U S Department of Commerce and its director is appointed by the President of the United States Currently Rob Santos is the Director of the U S Census Bureau and Ron Jarmin is the Deputy Director of the U S Census Bureau br The Census Bureau s primary mission is conducting the U S census every ten years which allocates the seats of the U S House of Representatives to the states based on their population The bureau s various censuses and surveys help allocate over billion in federal funds every year and it assists states local communities and businesses make informed decisions The information provided by the census informs decisions on where to build and maintain schools hospitals transportation infrastructure and police and fire departments br In addition to the decennial census the Census Bureau continually conducts over surveys and programs a year including the American Community Survey the U S Economic Census and the Current Population Survey The U S Economic Census occurs every five years and reports on American Business and the economy in order to plan business decisions Furthermore economic and foreign trade indicators released by the federal government typically contain data produced by the Census Bureau br br br Legal mandate br br Article One of the United States Constitution section II directs the population be enumerated at least once every ten years and the resulting counts used to set the number of members from each state in the House of Representatives and by extension in the Electoral College The Census Bureau now conducts a full population count every ten years in years ending with a zero and uses the term decennial to describe the operation Between censuses the Census Bureau makes population estimates and projections br In addition census data directly affects how more than billion per year in federal and state funding is allocated to communities for neighborhood improvements public health education transportation and more The Census Bureau is mandated with fulfilling these obligations the collecting of statistics about the nation its people and economy The Census Bureau s legal authority is codified in Title of the United States Code br The Census Bureau also conducts surveys on behalf of various federal government and local government agencies on topics such as employment crime health consumer expenditures and housing Within the bureau these are known as demographic surveys and are conducted perpetually between and during decennial year population counts The Census Bureau also conducts economic surveys of manufacturing retail service and other establishments and of domestic governments br Between and the census was taken by marshals of the judicial districts The Census Act of established a central office which became known as the Census Office Several acts followed that revised and authorized new censuses typically at the year intervals In the temporary Census Office was moved under the Department of Interior and in it was renamed the Census Bureau under the new Department of Commerce and Labor The department was intended to consolidate overlapping statistical agencies but Census Bureau officials were hindered by their subordinate role in the department br An act in changed the date and authorized manufacturing censuses every two years and agriculture censuses every years In a bill was passed mandating the House of Representatives be reapportioned based on the results of the census In various acts were codified into Title of the U S Code br By law the Census Bureau must count everyone and submit state population totals to the U S president by December of any year ending in a zero States within the Union receive the results in the spring of the following year br br br Data collection br br br Census regions and divisions br The United States Census Bureau defines four statistical regions with nine divisions The Census Bureau regions are widely used for data collection and analysis The Census Bureau definition is pervasive The territories are not included but the District of Columbia is br Regional divisions used by the United States Census Bureau br br Region Northeast br Division New England Connecticut Maine Massachusetts New Hampshire Rhode Island and Vermont br Division Mid Atlantic New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania br Region Midwest Prior to June the Midwest Region was designated as the North Central Region br Division East North Central Illinois Indiana Michigan Ohio and Wisconsin br Division West North Central Iowa Kansas Minnesota Missouri Nebraska North Dakota and South Dakota br Region South br Division South Atlantic Delaware the District of Columbia Florida Georgia Maryland North Carolina South Carolina Virginia and West Virginia br Division East South Central Alabama Kentucky Mississippi and Tennessee br Division West South Central Arkansas Louisiana Oklahoma and Texas br Region West br Division Mountain Arizona Colorado Idaho Montana Nevada New Mexico Utah and Wyoming br Division Pacific Alaska California Hawaii Oregon and Washington br br br History br The current system was introduced for the census but other ways of grouping states were used historically by the Census Bureau The first of these was introduced after the census by statistician and later census superintendent J D B De Bow He published a compendium where the states and territories were grouped into five great division namely the Middle New England the Northwestern the Southern and the Southwestern great divisions Unsatisfied with this system De Bow devised another one four years later with states and territories grouped into an Eastern Interior and Western great section each divided into a northern and southern half called divisions br In the following decades several other systems were used until the current one was introduced in This system has seen only minor changes New Mexico and Arizona were both added to the Mountain division upon statehood in the North region was divided into a Northeast and a North Central region in Alaska and Hawaii were both added to the Pacific division upon statehood in and the North Central region was renamed the Midwest in br br br Uses of census data br Many federal state local and tribal governments use census data to br br Decide the location of new housing and public facilities br Examine the demographic characteristics of communities states and the US br Plan transportation systems and roadways br Determine quotas and creation of police and fire precincts and br Create localized areas for elections schools utilities etc br Gathers population information every years br Census data is used to determine how seats of Congress are distributed to states Census data is not used to determine or define race genetically biologically or anthropologically The census data is also used by the Bureau to obtain a real time estimate in U S and World Population Clock Only peoples whose live in the states and within the District of Columbia are included in the estimation br br br Data stewardship br The United States Census Bureau is committed to confidentiality and guarantees non disclosure of any addresses or personal information related to individuals or establishments Title of the U S Code establishes penalties for the disclosure of this information All census employees must sign an affidavit of non disclosure prior to employment This non disclosure states I will not disclose any information contained in the schedules lists or statements obtained for or prepared by the Census Bureau to any person or persons either during or after employment The punishment for breaking the non disclosure is a fine up to or years in prison br The bureau cannot share responses addresses or personal information with anyone including the United States or foreign governments or law enforcement agencies such as the IRS or the FBI or Interpol Providing quality data for public good while respecting individual privacy and at the same time protecting confidentiality is the Census Bureau s core responsibility Keeping the public s trust is critical to the Census s ability to carry out the mission as the leading source of quality data about the Nation s people and economy Only after years does the information collected become available to other agencies or the general public Seventy two years was picked because usually by years since the census is taken most participants would be deceased br Despite these guarantees of confidentiality the Census Bureau has some history of disclosures to other government agencies In the Census Bureau released individual information regarding several hundred young men to the Justice Department and Selective Service system for the purpose of prosecutions for draft evasion During World War II the United States Census Bureau assisted the government s Japanese American internment efforts by providing confidential neighborhood information on Japanese Americans The bureau s role was denied for decades but was finally proven in br United States census data are valuable for the country s political parties Democrats and Republicans are highly interested in knowing the accurate number of persons in their respective districts These insights are often linked to financial and economic strategies that are central to federal state and city investments for locations of particular populations Such apportionments are designed to distribute political power across neutral spatial allocations however because so much is at stake the census also runs the risk of being politicized br Such political tensions highlight the complexity of identity and classification some argue that unclear results from the population data is due to distortions brought about by political pressures One frequently used example includes ambiguous ethnic counts which often involves underenumeration and or undercounting of minority populations Ideas about race ethnicity and identity have also evolved in the United States and such changes warrant examination of how these shifts have impacted the accuracy of census data over time br The United States Census Bureau began pursuing technological innovations to improve the precision of its census data collection in the s Robert W Marx the Chief of the Geography Division of the USCB teamed up with the U S Geological Survey and oversaw the creation of the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing TIGER database system Census officials were able to evaluate the more sophisticated and detailed results that the TIGER system produced furthermore TIGER data is also available to the public And while the TIGER system does not directly amass demographic data as a geographic information system GIS it can be used to merge demographics to conduct more accurate geospatial and mapping analysis br In July the Census Bureau stopped releasing new data via American FactFinder which was decommissioned in March after years of being the agency s primary tool for data dissemination The new platform is data census gov br br br Ongoing surveys br br Throughout the decade between censuses the bureau conducts surveys to produce a general view and comprehensive study of the United States social and economic conditions Staff from the Current Surveys Program conduct over ongoing and special surveys about people and their characteristics A network of professional field representatives gathers information from a sample of households responding to questions about employment consumer expenditures health housing and other topics br Surveys conducted between decades br br br Other surveys conducted br The Census Bureau also collects information on behalf of survey sponsors These sponsors include the Bureau of Justice Statistics BJS the Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD the National Center for Education Statistics NCES and the National Science Foundation NSF among others br br br Organizational structure br br Since the official census taking agency of the United States government has been the Bureau of the Census The Census Bureau is headed by a director assisted by a deputy director and an executive staff composed of the associate directors br The Census Bureau headquarters has been in Suitland Maryland since A new headquarters complex completed there in supports over employees br The bureau operates regional offices in cities br New York City Philadelphia Chicago Atlanta Denver and Los Angeles The National Processing Center is in Jeffersonville Indiana Additional temporary processing facilities facilitate the decennial census which employs more than a million people The cost of the census was billion During the years just prior to the decennial census parallel census offices known as Regional Census Centers are opened in the field office cities The decennial operations are carried out from these facilities The Regional Census Centers oversee the openings and closings of smaller Area Census Offices within their collection jurisdictions In Regional Census Centers oversaw the operation of Area Census Offices The estimated cost of the census is billion br On January the Census Bureau consolidated its twelve regional offices into six Increasing costs of data collection changes in survey management tools such as laptops and the increasing use of multi modal surveys i e internet telephone and in person led the Bureau to consolidate The six regional offices that closed were Boston Charlotte Dallas Detroit Kansas City and Seattle The remaining regional offices are New York City Philadelphia Chicago Atlanta Denver and Los Angeles br The Census Bureau also runs the Census Information Center cooperative program that involves national regional and local non profit organizations The CIC program aims to represent the interests of underserved communities br br br Computer equipment br br The census was the first to use the electric tabulating machines invented by Herman Hollerith For details see Truesdell Leon E The Development of Punch Card Tabulation in the Bureau of the Census With outlines of actual tabulation programs U S GPO In knowing of the bureau s funding of Hollerith and later Powers John Mauchly approached the bureau about early funding for UNIVAC development A UNIVAC I computer was accepted by the bureau in br br br Handheld computers br Historically the census information was gathered by census takers going door to door collecting information in a ledger Beginning in information was gathered via mailed forms To reduce paper usage reduce payroll expense and acquire the most comprehensive list of addresses ever compiled handheld computers HHCs specifically designed single purpose devices were used for the first time in during the address canvassing portion of the Decennial Census Project Projected savings were estimated to be over billion br br br Security precautions br br The HHC was manufactured by Harris Corporation an established Department of Defense contractor via a controversial contract with the Department of Commerce Secured access via a fingerprint swipe guaranteed only the verified user could access the unit A GPS capacity was integral to the daily address management and the transfer of gathered information Of major importance was the security and integrity of the populace s private information br br br Success and failure br Enumerators information gatherers that had operational problems with the device understandably made negative reports During the Senate confirmation hearings for Robert Groves President Obama s Census Director appointee there was much mention of problems but very little criticism of the units In rural areas the sparsity of cell phone towers caused problems with data transmission to and from the HHC Since the units were updated nightly with important changes and updates operator implementation of proper procedure was imperative br br br Research studies br Census Bureau stays current by conducting research studies to improve the work that they do Census researchers explore topics about survey innovations participation and data accuracy such as undercount overcount the use of technologies multilingual research and ways to reduce costs In addition the Bureau pretests surveys and digital products before they are fielded and then evaluates them after they have been conducted br br br Notable figures br br br See also br br List of U S states and territories by population br List of metropolitan statistical areas br List of United States cities by
