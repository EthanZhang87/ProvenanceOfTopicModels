fraction of its value After the sale the huge boiler on the property was sold for approximately easily covering the cost of the purchase even if the rest of the land had been valueless A low ball estimate of the value of storage in the grain silos was US million Critics argued that the deal should be investigated and speculated that ADM which spends millions of dollars on lobbying regardless used the property sale as a bribe for favorable treatment br Perdue s assets during his time as Secretary were placed in blind trusts as is common to prevent financial conflicts of interest The complex arrangements were criticized as breaking the spirit of the rule however and that Perdue and his family s ties to his corporation were not distanced as much as the law intended AGrowStar including the assets acquired as part of the Estill deal was sold by Perdue s trusts in for million dollars but due to the secretive nature of the trusts this was not widely disclosed br Regardless of whether the deal was intended to influence Perdue s actions and if it was if it actually had any impact the Perdue years were good ones for ADM The Washington Post detailed several wish list items
