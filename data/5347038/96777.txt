county s only incorporated city and county seat is Cumming br At the census the population was Forsyth was the fastest growing county in Georgia and the th fastest growing county in the United States between and br Forsyth County s rapid population growth can be attributed to its proximity to high income employment opportunities in nearby Alpharetta and northern Fulton County its equidistant location between the big city amenities of bustling Atlanta and the recreation offerings of the scenic Blue Ridge Mountains its plentiful supply of large relatively affordable new construction homes and its highly ranked public school system The influx of high income professionals and their families has increased the county s median annual household income dramatically in recent years at Forsyth

Guard protecting the event as thousands of marchers protested the segregation in the county br From to the county received national attention because of a severe drought Water supplies for the Atlanta

have been in a tri state water dispute since over apportionment of water flow from Lake Lanier which forms the eastern border of the county and is regulated by the Army Corps of Engineers as a federal project br br br History br br br Before European contact br For thousands of years varying indigenous cultures lived in this area along the Etowah River Starting near the end of the first millennium Mound Builders of the Mississippian culture settled in this area they built earthwork mound structures at nearby Etowah in present day Bartow County and large communities along the Etowah River in neighboring Cherokee County They disappeared about AD br Members of the Iroquoian speaking Cherokee Nation migrated into the area from the North possibly from the Great Lakes area They settled in the territory that would become Forsyth County and throughout upper Georgia and Alabama also having settlements or towns in present day Tennessee and western North Carolina br br br th century br After the discovery of gold by European Americans in the surrounding area in numerous settlers moved into the area They increased the pressure on the state and federal government to have the Cherokee and other Native Americans removed to west of the Mississippi River in order to extinguish their land claims and make land available for purchase The Cherokee were forced to relocate during what was called the Trail of Tears br Forsyth County was named after John Forsyth Governor of Georgia from to and Secretary of State under Presidents Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren For many years much of this hill country was farmed by yeomen farmers who owned few or no slaves br br br th century br br The county population of about was percent white in the early th century and residents still depended on agriculture Its more than blacks included persons classified as mixed race on the census indicating a continuing history of racial mixing that dated to slavery times br br br Lynching and other violence driving non white people from the county br After two different incidents in September in which black men were alleged to have assaulted white women tensions rose in the county br br In the first case a woman claimed she awoke to find two black men in her bedroom A black preacher was later assaulted by whites for making disparaging comments about the victim The sheriff gained support from the governor who sent more than National Guard troops to keep peace The suspects were never tried for lack of evidence In the second case a white woman was attacked and raped allegedly by black men she later died of her injuries A lynch mob stormed the Cumming county jail and dragged out one of the suspects Rob Edwards They shot him and hung his body in the town square At trial in early October two black youths under the age of were quickly convicted by an all white jury they were executed by hanging later that month br Afterward whites harassed and intimidated blacks in Forsyth and neighboring counties Within weeks they forced most of the blacks to leave the region in fear of their lives losing land and personal property that was never recovered br br Almost every single one of Forsyth s African Americans prosperous and poor literate and unlettered was driven out of the county It took only a few weeks Marauding residents wielded guns sticks of dynamite bottles of kerosene Then they stole everything from farmland to tombstones br Forsyth County remained white right through the th century A black man or woman couldn t so much as drive through without being run out During the s and s there were no colored water fountains in the courthouse or whites only diners in the county seat Cumming there was no black population to segregate br By the county was all white In African Americans numbered just in a population of br br br Later th century br During the s with the introduction of the poultry industry the county had steady economic growth but remained largely rural and all white in population Georgia State Route opened in and was eventually extended through the county and northward it stimulated population growth as residential housing was developed in the county and it became a bedroom community for people working in Atlanta which had expanding work opportunities The opening of Georgia State Route also spurred industrial growth in the South West portion of the county along the McFarland Parkway corridor starting in the early s br By the county population was growing to in While some blacks worked in the county in new industries none lived there The county gained more than new industries from and unemployment was low Such growth resulted in the median income formerly low rising faster than in any other county in Georgia A small civil rights march by African Americans in the county seat of Cumming in January was attacked by people throwing rocks dirt and bottles A week later another much larger march took place with civil rights activists going from Atlanta to Cumming protected by police and the National Guard Thousands of protesters joined a counter demonstration Local people said conditions had been improving for minorities but whites appeared to be reacting to the march out of fear br br br st century br Forsyth County continued to be developed for subdivisions industry and related businesses By it had been ranked for several years among the top ten fastest growing counties of the United States Many new subdivisions have been constructed several around top quality golf courses The county s proximity to Atlanta and the Blue Ridge mountains and bordering acre km Lake Sidney Lanier has attracted many new residents More than of the current population either lived elsewhere in or had not yet been born br The growth has put a strain on water supplies especially during area droughts in the st century Suburban growth has greatly increased water consumption in the area to maintain lawns and gardens and supply new households The region had severe droughts in that threatened downriver water supplies in Alabama and Florida in addition to Atlanta in and in Bans on outdoor use of water were put in place and the area has encouraged conversion of toilets and appliances to those that use less water A severe drought in southern Forsyth County was declared by the end of June Several county organizations work to plan growth that can sustain the high quality of life in the area br br br Racial history br br The changing dynamics between white and black citizens after the Civil War resulted in tensions across the southern United States as whites tried to maintain dominance They used violence to intimidate black voters and regain control of state legislatures ending Reconstruction At the turn of the th century white Democrats dominated the Georgia legislature and passed laws increasing barriers to voter registration and voting effectively disenfranchising most blacks in the state Unable to vote they were also excluded from juries The white legislators passed racial segregation and other Jim Crow laws Racial tensions increased as rural workers started to move to industrializing cities Whites rioted against blacks in the Atlanta in resulting in more than dead br Racial violence broke out in Forsyth County in September following allegations of sexual attacks by black men of white women br Forsyth County had a county population with a minority of ethnic African residents The census recorded white black and mulatto mixed race residents making the number of black citizens slightly more than as classified under the binary system of the South that classified all people of any African descent as Negro or black They tended to work as sharecroppers with some women working as domestic servants and struggled with poverty br In early September a white woman said she was the victim of an attempted rape by two black men but they left before she was hurt On September police arrested five black men in connection with the assault including Tony Howell and Isaiah Pirkle That same afternoon members of numerous area black churches gathered for a barbecue just outside the county seat of Cumming Preacher Grant Smith was heard to question the alleged victim s account saying that perhaps she had been caught and had lied about what was actually a consensual relationship with a black man The mixed race population in the county showed that whites and blacks had relationships most were between white men and black or mixed race women which the whites tried to treat as a secret Whites horse whipped Smith outside the courthouse where he was rescued by police and taken into custody for his safety br They locked him in the courthouse for safety Rumors spread on both sides whites said that the blacks threatened to dynamite the town White residents gathered a lynch mob of men when Cumming had only residents in total with men coming to join from surrounding areas They talked of lynching the black citizens held at the jail By p m the Sheriff deputized men and called the Governor for help who ordered in National Guardsmen from nearby Gainesville Georgia br The next day September Mae Crow a year old white woman was allegedly attacked in a nearby community while walking to her aunt s house She was allegedly pulled into the woods and assaulted According to later testimony she was allegedly raped by Ernest Knox a year old black boy who worked as a hired hand at a neighbor s farm Knox was said to have told friends about the incident Oscar Daniel his sister Trussie Jane Daniel and her live in boyfriend Rob Edwards who also went to the scene They left the girl thinking she had died and being afraid to get involved Crow was found the next day by a search party whites said later that she had regained consciousness briefly and named Knox as her attacker but no newspaper reported this A small hand mirror found at the scene was recognized as belonging to Knox police used it to connect him to the crime and arrested him that morning Police said he confessed fully Because of the trouble two days before in Cumming they took Knox to the jail in Gainesville Hearing threats of a lynch mob there officials moved him to a jail in Atlanta br The following day Knox s friends were arrested in connection with the Mae Crow assault Oscar Daniel and Rob Edwards were suspects in rape and Trussie Daniel was held for not reporting the crime and as an accomplice Ed Collins a black neighbor was picked up and held as a witness They were detained in the small Cumming jail The Atlanta Journal reported that Sheriff Reid drove through a mob of people to get the suspects to the jail br br Within a few hours on September the white mob increased to people who stormed the jail Sheriff Reid was not there having strategically left deputy Mitchell Lummus alone to protect the prisoners Deputy Lummus hid most of them but Rob Edwards was shot and killed by the mob while still in his cell They dragged him out mutilated him and dragged his body behind a wagon before hanging him from a telephone pole at the northwest corner of the Square The coroner s inquest held on September found the cause of death to be a gunshot by an unknown assailant br Crow died in the hospital two weeks later on September The cause of death was listed as pneumonia Knox and Daniel were indicted for rape and murder on September Trussie Daniel and Ed Collins were both charged as accomplices br br All five trials including Tony Howell for the Ellen Grice case were set for October in Cumming the county seat The prisoners were escorted by four companies of the state militia by train to the Buford Georgia station and walked the remaining miles km br The trial of Tony Howell was postponed due to the lack of evidence Howell had an alibi with Isaiah Pirkle as a witness The case would never go to trial and was eventually dismissed br As part of a plea bargain Trussie Daniel changed her story and agreed to turn state s witness Charges against her and Collins were dropped in exchange for her testimony against Knox her brother Oscar and Edwards The all white jury deliberated minutes and returned a verdict of guilty in Knox s case Although no confession or other evidence linked Oscar Daniel to the crime his sister s testimony was fatal The all white jury pronounced him guilty that night br On the following day October both teenagers were sentenced to death by hanging scheduled for October State law prohibited public hangings The scheduled execution was to be viewed only by the victim s family a minister and law officers Gallows were built off the square in Cumming A fence erected around the gallows was burned down the night before the execution A crowd estimated at between and gathered to watch the hanging of the two youths at a time when the total county population was around br In the following months a small group of men called Night Riders terrorized black citizens threatening them to leave in hours or be killed Those who resisted were subjected to further harassment including shots fired into their homes or livestock killed Some white residents tried to stop the Night Riders but were unsuccessful An estimated of black residents of Forsyth County left Some property owners were able to sell likely at a loss The renters and sharecroppers left to seek safer places Those who abandoned property and failed to continue paying property tax eventually lost it and whites took it over Many black properties ended up in white hands without a sale and without a legal transfer of title The anti black campaign spread across Northern Georgia with similar results of whites expelling blacks in many surrounding counties br In the Census more than black and mixed race people were recorded in Forsyth County with slightly more than whites By the Census only ethnic African Americans remained in the county br In the s and s Forsyth County experienced unprecedented growth partly due to white flight from north Fulton County as a result of the rapid increase of Asians settling in that area which borders the southern part of Forsyth County For example the highly rated Northview High School based in north Fulton County went from white and Asian in to Asian and white in Many white parents claimed north Fulton County public schools with a relatively high percentage of Asian students became overwhelmingly academically competitive which negatively impacted their children s mental health and social life br Since the s Forsyth County has become more racially and culturally diverse There are an increasing number of Asian Hispanic and African American families relocating to Forsyth County mainly due to the abundance of high performing and resource rich public schools in the county br br br Marches and demonstrations of the s br br More ethnically diverse citizens had begun in recent years to migrate to the county particularly in the affluent southern portion However racial tension continued to be a part of the county s image into the early s On January civil rights activists marched in Cumming and a counter demonstration was made by a branch of the Ku Klux Klan most of whom were not residents of the county as well as others who objected to the march According to a story published in The New York Times on January four marchers were slightly injured by stones and bottles thrown at them Eight people from the counter demonstration all white were arrested The charges included trespassing and carrying concealed weapons br White Forsyth resident Charles A Blackburn wanted to have a brotherhood march to celebrate the first annual celebration of national holiday Martin Luther King Jr Day He wanted to dispel the racist image of Forsyth County where he owned and operated a private school the Blackburn Learning Center Blackburn cancelled his plans after he received threatening phone calls Other whites in nearby counties as well as State Representative Billy McKinney of Atlanta and Hosea Williams who was on the Atlanta City Council took up the march plans instead br The following week January approximately participants marched in Cumming This occurrence produced no violence despite the presence of more than counter demonstrators summoned by the Forsyth County Defense League The county and state had mustered about peace officers and national guardsmen Forsyth County paid for police overtime during the political demonstration V S Naipaul s interview with Forsyth County Sheriff Wesley Walraven before the second march is referred to in his book A Turn in the South br The demonstration is thought to have been the largest civil rights demonstration in the U S since about The unexpected turnout of some counter demonstrators of whom were arrested for parading without a permit turned out to be the largest resistance opposed to civil rights since the s The counter demonstration was called by the Forsyth County Defense League and the Nationalist Movement newly organized in Cumming by local plumber Mark Watts br Marchers came for the second march from all over the country forming a caravan from Atlanta National Guard troops were assigned for protection on freeway overpasses along the route When marchers including John Lewis Andrew Young Julian Bond Coretta Scott King Joseph Lowery Sam Nunn Benjamin Hooks Gary Hart and Wyche Fowler arrived they discovered that most of the Cumming residents had left town for the day Some had boarded up their windows
