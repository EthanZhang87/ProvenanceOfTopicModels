id: 32070
The Republican Party also known as the GOP Grand Old Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States It emerged as the main political rival of the then dominant Democratic Party in the mid s and the two parties have dominated American politics ever since br The party was founded in by anti slavery activists who opposed the Kansas Nebraska Act an act which allowed for the potential expansion of chattel slavery into the western territories of Kansas and Nebraska It supported classical liberalism and economic reform while opposing the expansion of slavery into the free territories The party initially had a very limited presence in the South but was successful in the North By it had enlisted most former Whigs and former Free Soilers to form majorities in nearly every northern state White Southerners became alarmed at the threat to the slave trade With the election of Abraham Lincoln the first Republican president the deep Southern states seceded from the United States br Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress the Republican Party led the fight to defeat the Confederate States in the American Civil War preserving the Union and abolishing slavery Afterward the party largely dominated the national political scene until the Great Depression in the s when it lost its congressional majorities and the Democrats New Deal programs proved popular Dwight D Eisenhower s election was a rare break in between Democratic presidents and he presided over a period of increased economic prosperity after World War II His former vice president Richard Nixon carried states in with what he touted as his silent majority The election of Ronald Reagan realigned national politics bringing together advocates of free market economics social conservatives and Cold War foreign policy hawks under the Republican banner Since the Republican Party has faced significant factionalism within the party s ranks br In the st century the party receives its strongest support from rural voters evangelical Christians men senior citizens and white voters without college degrees On economic issues the party has maintained a pro business attitude since its inception It has a neoliberal outlook supporting low taxes and deregulation while opposing socialism labor unions and single payer healthcare The populist faction supports economic protectionism On social issues it advocates for restricting the legality of abortion discouraging and often prohibiting recreational drug use promoting gun ownership and easing gun restrictions and opposing the transgender rights movement In foreign policy the party establishment is neoconservative and supports tough stances against China and Russia while the populist faction is isolationist and supports non interventionism br br br History br br br th century br br In the Republican Party was founded in the Northern United States by forces opposed to the expansion of slavery ex Whigs and ex Free Soilers The Republican Party quickly became the principal opposition to the dominant Democratic Party and the briefly popular Know Nothing Party The party grew out of opposition to the Kansas Nebraska Act which repealed the Missouri Compromise and opened the Kansas and Nebraska Territories to slavery and future admission as slave states They denounced the expansion of slavery as a great evil but did not call for ending it in the Southern states While opposition to the expansion of slavery was the most consequential founding principle of the party like the Whig Party it replaced Republicans also called for economic and social modernization br At the first public meeting of the anti Nebraska movement on March at the Little White Schoolhouse in Ripon Wisconsin the name Republican was proposed as the name of the party The name was partly chosen to pay homage to Thomas Jefferson s Democratic Republican Party The first official party convention was held on July in Jackson Michigan br The party emerged from the great political realignment of the mid s united in pro capitalist stances with members often valuing Radicalism Historian William Gienapp argues that the great realignment of the s began before the Whigs collapse and was caused not by politicians but by voters at the local level The central forces were ethno cultural involving tensions between pietistic Protestants versus liturgical Catholics Lutherans and Episcopalians regarding Catholicism prohibition and nativism The Know Nothing Party embodied the social forces at work but its weak leadership was unable to solidify its organization and the Republicans picked it apart Nativism was so powerful that the Republicans could not avoid it but they did minimize it and turn voter wrath against the threat that slave owners would buy up the good farm lands wherever slavery was allowed The realignment was powerful because it forced voters to switch parties as typified by the rise and fall of the Know Nothings the rise of the Republican Party and the splits in the Democratic Party br At the Republican Party s first National Convention in held at Musical Fund Hall in Philadelphia the party adopted a national platform emphasizing opposition to the expansion of slavery into the free territories While Republican nominee John C Fr mont lost that year s presidential election to Democrat James Buchanan Buchanan managed to win only four of the fourteen northern states and won his home state of Pennsylvania only narrowly Republicans fared better in congressional and local elections but Know Nothing candidates took a significant number of seats creating an awkward three party arrangement Despite the loss of the presidency and the lack of a majority in the U S Congress Republicans were able to orchestrate a Republican speaker of the House of Representatives which went to Nathaniel P Banks Historian James M McPherson writes regarding Banks speakership that if any one moment marked the birth of the Republican party this was it br br The Republicans were eager for the elections Former Illinois U S representative Abraham Lincoln spent several years building support within the party campaigning heavily for Fr mont in and making a bid for the Senate in losing to Democrat Stephen A Douglas but gaining national attention from the Lincoln Douglas debates it produced At the Republican National Convention Lincoln consolidated support among opponents of New York U S senator William H Seward a fierce abolitionist who some Republicans feared would be too radical for crucial states such as Pennsylvania and Indiana as well as those who disapproved of his support for Irish immigrants Lincoln won on the third ballot and was ultimately elected president in the general election in a rematch against Douglas Lincoln had not been on the ballot in a single Southern state and even if the vote for Democrats had not been split between Douglas John C Breckinridge and John Bell the Republicans would have still won but without the popular vote This election result helped kickstart the American Civil War which lasted from until br The presidential election united War Democrats with the GOP in support of Lincoln and Tennessee Democratic senator Andrew Johnson who ran for president and vice president on the National Union Party ticket Lincoln was re elected By June slavery was dead in the ex Confederate States but remained legal in some border states Under Republican congressional leadership the Thirteenth Amendment to the U S Constitution which banned slavery except as punishment for a crime passed the Senate on April the House of Representatives on January and was ratified by the required of the then states on December br br br Reconstruction the gold standard and the Gilded Age br br Radical Republicans during Lincoln s presidency felt he was too moderate in his efforts to eradicate slavery and opposed his ten percent plan Radical Republicans passed the Wade Davis Bill in which sought to enforce the taking of the Ironclad Oath for all former Confederates Lincoln vetoed the bill believing it would jeopardize the peaceful reintegration of the ex Confederate states br Following the assassination of Lincoln Johnson ascended to the presidency and was deplored by Radical Republicans Johnson was vitriolic in his criticisms of the Radical Republicans during a national tour ahead of the elections Anti Johnson Republicans won a two thirds majority in both chambers of Congress following the elections which helped lead the way toward his impeachment and near ouster from office in the same year former Union Army general Ulysses S Grant was elected as the next Republican president br Grant was a Radical Republican which created some division within the party Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner and Illinois senator Lyman Trumbull opposed most of his Reconstructionist policies Others took issue with the large scale corruption present in the Grant administration with the emerging Stalwart faction defending Grant and the spoils system and the Half Breeds advocating reform of the civil service Republicans who opposed Grant branched off to form the Liberal Republican Party nominating Horace Greeley in the presidential election The Democratic Party attempted to capitalize on this divide in the GOP by co nominating Greeley under their party banner Greeley s positions proved inconsistent with the Liberal Republican Party that nominated him with Greeley supporting high tariffs despite the party s opposition Grant was easily re elected br The presidential election saw a contentious conclusion as both parties claimed victory despite three southern states still not officially declaring a winner at the end of election day Voter suppression had occurred in the South to depress the black and white Republican vote which gave Republican controlled returning officers enough of a reason to declare that fraud intimidation and violence had soiled the states results They proceeded to throw out enough Democratic votes for Republican Rutherford B Hayes to be declared the winner Still Democrats refused to accept the results and the Electoral Commission made up of members of Congress was established to decide who would be awarded the states electors After the Commission voted along party lines in Hayes favor Democrats threatened to delay the counting of electoral votes indefinitely so no president would be inaugurated on March This resulted in the Compromise of and Hayes finally became president br br Hayes doubled down on the gold standard which had been signed into law by Grant with the Coinage Act of as a solution to the depressed American economy in the aftermath of that year s panic He also believed greenbacks posed a threat greenbacks being money printed during the Civil War that was not backed by specie which Hayes objected to as a proponent of hard money Hayes sought to restock the country s gold supply which by January succeeded as gold was more frequently exchanged for greenbacks compared to greenbacks being exchanged for gold Ahead of the presidential election Republican James G Blaine ran for the party nomination supporting both Hayes gold standard push and his civil service reforms After both Blaine and opponent John Sherman failed to win the Republican nomination each of them backed James A Garfield for president Garfield agreed with Hayes move in favor of the gold standard but opposed his civil reform efforts br Garfield won the presidential election but was assassinated early in his term His death helped create support for the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act which was passed in the bill was signed into law by Republican president Chester A Arthur who succeeded Garfield br In Blaine once again ran for president He won the Republican nomination but lost the general election to Democrat Grover Cleveland Cleveland was the first Democrat to be elected president since James Buchanan Dissident Republicans known as Mugwumps had defected from Blaine due to the corruption which had plagued his political career Cleveland stuck to the gold standard policy but he came into conflict with Republicans regarding budding American imperialism br br Republican Benjamin Harrison defeated Cleveland in the election During his presidency Harrison signed the Dependent and Disability Pension Act which established pensions for all veterans of the Union who had served for more than days and were unable to perform manual labor Following his loss to Cleveland in the presidential election Harrison unsuccessfully attempted to pass a treaty annexing Hawaii before Cleveland could be inaugurated Most Republicans supported the proposed annexation but Cleveland opposed it br In the presidential election Republican William McKinley s platform supported the gold standard and high tariffs having been the creator and namesake for the McKinley Tariff of Though having been divided on the issue prior to that year s National Convention McKinley decided to heavily favor the gold standard over free silver in his campaign messaging but promised to continue bimetallism to ward off continued skepticism over the gold standard which had lingered since the Panic of Democrat William Jennings Bryan proved to be a devoted adherent to the free silver movement which cost Bryan the support of Democratic institutions such as Tammany Hall the New York World and a large majority of the Democratic Party s upper and middle class support McKinley defeated Bryan and returned the presidency to Republican control until the presidential election br br br First half of the th century br br br Progressives vs Standpatters br br The realignment cemented the Republicans as the party of big businesses while president Theodore Roosevelt added more small business support by his embrace of trust busting He handpicked his successor William Howard Taft in the election but they became enemies as the party split down the middle Taft defeated Roosevelt for the nomination so Roosevelt stormed out of the convention and started a new party Roosevelt ran on the ticket of his new Progressive Party He called for social reforms many of which were later championed by New Deal Democrats in the s He lost and when most of his supporters returned to the GOP they found they did not agree with the new conservative economic thinking leading to an ideological shift to the right in the Republican Party br The Republicans returned to the presidency in the s winning on platforms of normalcy business oriented efficiency and high tariffs The national party platform avoided mention of prohibition instead issuing a vague commitment to law and order The Teapot Dome scandal threatened to hurt the party under Warren G Harding He died in and Calvin Coolidge easily defeated the splintered opposition in The pro business policies of the decade produced an unprecedented prosperity until the Wall Street Crash of heralded the Great Depression br br br Roosevelt and the New Deal era br br The New Deal coalition forged by Democratic president Franklin D Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades excluding the presidency of Republican Dwight D Eisenhower in the s After Roosevelt took office in New Deal legislation sailed through Congress and the economy moved sharply upward from its nadir in early However long term unemployment remained a drag until In the elections Republican senators went down to defeat leaving the GOP with only senators against Democrats The House likewise had overwhelming Democratic majorities br The Republican Party factionalized into a majority Old Right based predominantly in the Midwest and a liberal wing based in the Northeast that supported much of the New Deal The Old Right sharply attacked the Second New Deal saying it represented class warfare and socialism Roosevelt was easily re elected president in however as his second term began the economy declined strikes soared and he failed to take control of the Supreme Court and purge the Southern conservatives from the Democratic Party Republicans made a major comeback in the House elections and had new rising stars such as Robert A Taft of Ohio on the right and Thomas E Dewey of New York on the left Southern conservatives joined with most Republicans to form the conservative coalition which dominated domestic issues in Congress until By the time of World War II both parties split on foreign policy issues with the anti war isolationists dominant in the Republican Party and the interventionists who wanted to stop German dictator Adolf Hitler dominant in the Democratic Party Roosevelt won a third term in and a fourth in Conservatives abolished most of the New Deal during the war but they did not attempt to do away with Social Security or the agencies that regulated business br br Historian George H Nash argues Unlike the moderate internationalist largely eastern bloc of Republicans who accepted or at least acquiesced in some of the Roosevelt Revolution and the essential premises of President Harry S Truman s foreign policy the Republican Right at heart was counterrevolutionary Anti collectivist anti Communist anti New Deal passionately committed to limited government free market economics and congressional as opposed to executive prerogatives the G O P conservatives were obliged from the start to wage a constant two front war against liberal Democrats from without and me too Republicans from within br After the internationalist wing of the GOP cooperated with Truman s Cold War foreign policy funded the Marshall Plan and supported NATO despite the continued isolationism of the Old Right br br br Second half of the th century br br br Post Roosevelt era br br Eisenhower had defeated conservative leader senator Robert A Taft for the Republican presidential nomination but conservatives dominated the domestic policies of the Eisenhower administration Voters liked Eisenhower much more than they liked the GOP and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate position br br br From Goldwater to Reagan br br Historians cite the presidential election and its respective National Convention as a significant shift which saw the conservative wing helmed by Arizona senator Barry Goldwater battle liberal New York governor Nelson Rockefeller and his eponymous Rockefeller Republican faction for the nomination With Goldwater poised to win Rockefeller urged to mobilize his liberal faction retorted You re looking at it buddy I m all that s left br Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of and Voting Rights Act of the southern states became more reliably Republican in presidential politics while northeastern states became more reliably Democratic br Though Goldwater lost the election in a landslide Ronald Reagan would make himself known as a prominent supporter of his throughout the campaign delivering his famous A Time for Choosing speech for Goldwater Reagan would go on to win the California governorship two years later br The GOP would go on to control the White House from to under th president Richard Nixon and when he resigned in due to the Watergate scandal Gerald Ford became the th president serving until Ronald Reagan would later go on to defeat incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter in the United States presidential election becoming the th president on January br br br Reagan era br br The Reagan presidency lasting from to constituted what is known as the Reagan Revolution It was seen as a fundamental shift from the stagflation of the s preceding it with the introduction of Reagan s economic policies intended to cut taxes prioritize government deregulation and shift funding from the domestic sphere into the military to check the Soviet Union by utilizing deterrence theory During a visit to then West Berlin in June he addressed Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during a speech at the Berlin Wall demanding that he Tear down this wall The remark was later seen as influential in the fall of the wall in November and was retroactively seen as a soaring achievement over the years The Soviet Union was dissolved in Following Reagan s presidency Republican presidential candidates frequently claimed to share Reagan s views and aimed to portray themselves and their policies as heirs to his legacy br Reagan s vice president George H W Bush won the presidency in a landslide in the presidential election However his term was characterized by division within the Republican Party Bush s vision of economic liberalization and international cooperation with foreign nations saw the negotiation and during the presidency of Democrat Bill Clinton in the s the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA and the conceptual beginnings of the World Trade Organization Independent politician and businessman Ross Perot decried NAFTA and predicted that it would lead to the outsourcing of American jobs to Mexico however Clinton agreed with Bush s trade policies br Bush lost his re election bid in receiving percent of the popular vote Clinton garnered a plurality of percent and Perot took third place with percent While there is debate about whether Perot s candidacy cost Bush re election Charlie Cook asserted that Perot s messaging carried weight with Republican and conservative voters Perot subsequently formed the Reform Party future Republican president Donald Trump was a member br br br Gingrich Revolution br br In the elections the Republican Party led by House minority whip Newt Gingrich who campaigned on the Contract with America won majorities in both chambers of Congress gained governorships and regained control of state legislatures However most voters had not heard of the Contract and the Republican victory was attributed to traditional mid term anti incumbent voting and Republicans becoming the majority party in Dixie for the first time since Reconstruction It was the first time the Republican Party had achieved a majority in the House since Gingrich was made speaker and within the first days of the Republican majority every proposition featured in the Contract was passed with the exception of term limits for members of Congress which did not pass in the Senate One key to Gingrich s success in was nationalizing the election which in turn led to his becoming a national figure during the House elections with many Democratic leaders proclaiming Gingrich was a zealous radical The Republicans maintained their majority for the first time since despite Bob Dole losing handily to Clinton in the presidential election However Gingrich s national profile proved a detriment to the Republican Congress which enjoyed majority approval among voters in spite of Gingrich s relative unpopularity br After Gingrich and the Republicans struck a deal with Clinton on the Balanced Budget Act of which included tax cuts the Republican House majority had difficulty convening on a new agenda ahead of the elections During the ongoing impeachment of Bill Clinton in Gingrich decided to make Clinton s misconduct the party message heading into the elections believing it would add to their majority The strategy proved mistaken and the Republicans lost five seats though whether it was due to poor messaging or Clinton s popularity providing a coattail effect is debated Gingrich was ousted from party power due to the performance ultimately deciding to resign from Congress altogether For a short time afterward it appeared Louisiana representative Bob Livingston would become his successor Livingston however stepped down from consideration and resigned from Congress after damaging reports of affairs threatened the Republican House s legislative agenda if he were to serve as speaker Illinois representative Dennis Hastert was promoted to speaker in Livingston s place serving in that position until br br br st century br br br George W Bush br br Republican George W Bush won the and presidential elections He campaigned as a compassionate conservative in wanting to better appeal to immigrants and minority voters The goal was to prioritize drug rehabilitation programs and aid for prisoner reentry into society a move intended to capitalize on President Clinton s tougher crime initiatives such as his administration s crime bill The platform failed to gain much traction among members of the party during his presidency br The Republican Party remained fairly cohesive for much of the s as both strong economic libertarians and social conservatives opposed the Democrats whom they saw as the party of bloated secular and liberal government This period saw the rise of pro government conservatives a core part of the Bush s base a considerable group of the Republicans who advocated for increased government spending and greater regulations covering both the economy and people s personal lives as well as for an activist and interventionist foreign policy Survey groups such as the Pew Research Center found that social conservatives and free market advocates remained the other two main groups within the party s coalition of support with all three being roughly equal in number However libertarians and libertarian leaning conservatives increasingly found fault with what they saw as Republicans restricting of vital civil liberties while corporate welfare and the national debt hiked considerably under Bush s tenure In contrast some social conservatives expressed dissatisfaction with the party s support for economic policies that conflicted with their moral values br The Republican Party lost its Senate majority in when the Senate became split evenly nevertheless the Republicans maintained control of the Senate due to the tie breaking vote of Bush s vice president Dick Cheney Democrats gained control of the Senate on June when Vermont Republican senator Jim Jeffords switched his party affiliation to Democrat The Republicans regained the Senate majority in the elections helped by Bush s surge in popularity following the September attacks and Republican majorities in the House and Senate were held until the Democrats regained control of both chambers in the elections largely due to increasing opposition to the Iraq War br In the presidential election Arizona Republican senator John McCain was defeated by Illinois Democratic senator Barack Obama br br br Tea Party movement br br The Republicans experienced electoral success in the elections The elections coincided with the ascendancy of the Tea Party movement an anti Obama protest movement of fiscal conservatives Members of the movement called for lower taxes and for a reduction of the national debt and federal budget deficit through decreased government spending The Tea Party movement was also described as a popular constitutional movement composed of a mixture of libertarian right wing populist and conservative activism br The Tea Party movement s electoral success began with Scott Brown s upset win in the January Senate special election in Massachusetts the seat had been held for decades by Democrat Ted Kennedy In November Republicans recaptured control of the House increased their number of seats in the Senate and gained a majority of governorships The Tea Party would go on to strongly influence the Republican Party in part due to the replacement of establishment Republicans with Tea Party style Republicans br When Obama was re elected president in defeating Republican Mitt Romney the Republican Party lost seven seats in the House but still retained control of that chamber However Republicans were unable to gain control of the Senate continuing their minority status with a net loss of two seats In the aftermath of the loss some prominent Republicans spoke out against their own party A election post mortem by the Republican Party concluded that the party needed to do more on the national level to attract votes from minorities and young voters In March Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus issued a report on the party s electoral failures in calling on Republicans to reinvent themselves and officially endorse immigration reform He proposed reforms including a million marketing campaign to reach women minorities and gay people the setting of a shorter more controlled primary season and the creation of better data collection facilities br Following the elections the Republican Party took control of the Senate by gaining nine seats With seats in the House and seats in the Senate the Republicans ultimately achieved their largest majority in the Congress since the st Congress in br br br Trump era br br In the presidential election Republican nominee Donald Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton The result was unexpected polls leading up to the election showed Clinton leading the race Trump s victory was fueled by narrow victories in three states Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that had been part of the Democratic blue wall for decades It was attributed to strong support amongst working class white voters who felt dismissed and disrespected by the political establishment Trump became popular with them by abandoning Republican establishment orthodoxy in favor of a broader nationalist message br After the elections Republicans maintained their majority in the Senate the House and governorships and wielded newly acquired executive power with Trump s election The Republican Party controlled of state legislative chambers in the most it had held in history The Party also held governorships the most it had held since The party had total control of government in states it had not held total control of this many states since The opposing Democratic Party held full control of only five states in In the elections Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives but strengthened their hold on the Senate br Over the course of his presidency Trump appointed three justices to the Supreme Court Neil Gorsuch Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett It was the most Supreme Court appointments for any president in a single term since Richard Nixon Trump appointed judges in total creating overall Republican appointed majorities on every branch of the federal judiciary except for the Court of International Trade by the time he left office shifting the judiciary to the right Other notable achievements during his presidency included the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the creation of the U S Space Force the first new independent military service since and the brokering of the Abraham Accords a series of normalization agreements between Israel and various Arab states Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives in on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress On February the Senate voted to acquit him br Trump lost the presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden He refused to concede the race claiming widespread electoral fraud and attempting to overturn the results On January the United States Capitol was attacked by Trump supporters following a rally at which Trump spoke After the attack the House impeached Trump for a second time on the charge of incitement of insurrection making him the only federal officeholder to be impeached twice Trump left office on January His impeachment trial continued into the early weeks of the Biden presidency and he was acquitted on February br In and Supreme Court justices appointed by Trump proved decisive in landmark decisions on gun rights abortion and affirmative action The party went into the elections confident and with analysts predicting a red wave but it ultimately underperformed expectations with voters in swing states and competitive districts joining Democrats in rejecting candidates who had been endorsed by Trump or who had denied the results of the election The party won control of the House with a narrow majority but lost the Senate and several state legislative majorities and governorships The results led to many Republicans and conservative thought leaders questioning whether Trump should continue as the party s main figurehead and leader br br br Current status br As of the GOP holds a majority in the U S House of Representatives It also holds state governorships state legislatures and state government trifectas Six of the nine current U S Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican presidents Its most recent presidential nominee was Donald Trump who served as the th president of the United States Trump is also the party s presumptive nominee for the presidential election There have been Republican presidents the most from any one political party br br br Name and symbols br The Republican Party s founding members chose its name as homage to the values of republicanism promoted by Democratic Republican Party which its founder Thomas Jefferson called the Republican Party The idea for the name came from an editorial by the party s leading publicist Horace Greeley who called for some simple name like Republican that would more fitly designate those who had united to restore the Union to its true mission of champion and promulgator of Liberty rather than propagandist of slavery The name reflects the republican values of civic virtue and opposition to aristocracy and corruption Republican has a variety of meanings around the world and the Republican Party has evolved such that the meanings no longer always align br The term Grand Old Party is a traditional nickname for the Republican Party and the abbreviation GOP is a commonly used designation The term originated in in the Congressional Record referring to the party associated with the successful military defense of the Union as this gallant old party The following year in an article in the Cincinnati Commercial the term was modified to grand old party The first use of the abbreviation is dated br The traditional mascot of the party is the elephant A political cartoon by Thomas Nast published in Harper s Weekly on November is considered the first important use of the symbol An alternate symbol of the Republican Party in states such as Indiana New York and Ohio is the bald eagle as opposed to the Democratic rooster or the Democratic five pointed star In Kentucky the log cabin is a symbol of the Republican Party br Traditionally the party had no consistent color identity After the presidential election the color red became associated with Republicans During and after the election the major broadcast networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map states won by Republican nominee George W Bush were colored red and states won by Democratic nominee Al Gore were colored blue Due to the weeks long dispute over the election results these color associations became firmly ingrained persisting in subsequent years Although the assignment of colors to political parties is unofficial and informal the media has come to represent the respective political parties using these colors The party and its candidates have also come to embrace the color red br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Factions br br br Civil War and Reconstruction era br br During the th century Republican factions included the Radical Republicans They were a major factor of the party from its inception in until the end of the Reconstruction Era in They strongly opposed slavery were hard line abolitionists and later advocated equal rights for the freedmen and women They were heavily influenced by religious ideals and evangelical Christianity many were Christian reformers who saw slavery as evil and the Civil War as God s punishment for it Radical Republicans pressed for abolition as a major war aim and they opposed the moderate Reconstruction plans of Abraham Lincoln as both too lenient on the Confederates and not going far enough to help former slaves who had been freed during or after the Civil War by the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment After the war s end and Lincoln s assassination the Radicals clashed with Andrew Johnson over Reconstruction policy Radicals led efforts after the war to establish civil rights for former slaves and fully implement emancipation After unsuccessful measures in resulted in violence against former slaves in the rebel states Radicals pushed the Fourteenth Amendment for statutory protections through Congress They opposed allowing ex Confederate officers to retake political power in the Southern U S and emphasized liberty equality and the Fifteenth Amendment which provided voting rights for the freedmen Many later became Stalwarts who supported machine politics br Moderate Republicans were known for their loyal support of President Abraham Lincoln s war policies and expressed antipathy towards the more militant stances advocated by the Radical Republicans According to historian Eric Foner congressional leaders of the faction were James G Blaine John A Bingham William P Fessenden Lyman Trumbull and John Sherman In contrast to Radicals Moderate Republicans were less enthusiastic on the issue of Black suffrage even while embracing civil equality and the expansive federal authority observed throughout the American Civil War They were also skeptical of the lenient conciliatory Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson Members of the Moderate Republicans comprised in part of previous Radical Republicans who became disenchanted with the alleged corruption of the latter faction Charles Sumner a Massachusetts senator who led Radical Republicans in the s later joined reform minded moderates as he later opposed the corruption associated with the Grant administration They generally opposed efforts by Radical Republicans to rebuild the Southern U S under an economically mobile free market system br br br th century br br The dawn on the th century saw the Republican party split into an Old Right and a moderate liberal faction in the Northeast that eventually became known as Rockefeller Republicans Opposition to Roosevelt s New Deal saw the formation of the conservative coalition The s saw fusionism of traditionalist and social conservatism and right libertarianism along with the rise of the First New Right to be followed in with a more populist Second New Right The rise of the Reagan coalition via the Reagan Revolution in the s began what has been called the Reagan era Regan s rise displaced the liberal moderate faction of the GOP and established Reagan style conservatism as the prevailing ideological faction of the Party for the next thirty years br br br st century br br Republicans began the st century with the election of George W Bush in the United States presidential election and saw the peak of a neoconservative faction that held significant influence over the initial American response to the September attacks through the War on Terror The election of Barack Obama saw the formation of the Tea Party movement in that coincided with a global rise in right wing populist movements from the s to s br Right wing populism became an increasingly dominant ideological faction within the GOP throughout the s and helped lead to the election of Donald Trump in Starting in the s and accelerating in the s American right wing interest groups invested heavily in external mobilization vehicles that led to the organizational weakening of the GOP establishment The outsize role of conservative media in particular Fox News led to it being followed and trusted more by the Republican base over traditional party elites The depletion of organizational capacity partly led to Trump s victory in the Republican primaries against the wishes of a very weak party establishment and traditional power brokers Trump s election exacerbated internal schisms within the GOP and saw the GOP move from a center coalition of moderates and conservatives to a solidly right wing party hostile to liberal views and any deviations from the party line br The Party has since faced intense factionalism and has also undergone a major decrease in influence of the traditional establishment conservative faction Trump s election split both the GOP and larger conservative movement into Trumpist and anti Trump factions These factions are particularly apparent in the U S House of Representatives On January after rounds of voting Kevin McCarthy was elected to the speakership It was the first multiple ballot speaker election since Subsequently he was ousted from his position on October by a vote led by members of the Trumpist faction along with House Democrats br br br Conservatives br br Ronald Reagan s presidential election in established Reagan style American conservatism as the dominant ideological faction of the Republican Party until the election of Donald Trump in Traditional modern conservatives combine support for free market economic policies with social conservatism and a hawkish approach to foreign policy Other parts of the conservative movement are composed of fiscal conservatives and deficit hawks Conservatives generally support policies that favor limited government individualism traditionalism republicanism and limited federal governmental power in relation to the states br In foreign policy neoconservatives are a small faction of the GOP that support an interventionist foreign policy and increased military spending They previously held significant influence in the early s in planning the initial response to the attacks through the War on Terror Since the election of Trump in neoconservatism has declined and non interventionism and isolationism has grown among elected federal Republican officeholders br Long term shifts in conservative thinking following the election of Trump have been described as a new fusionism of traditional conservative ideology and right wing populist themes These have resulted in shifts towards greater support for national conservatism protectionism cultural conservatism a more realist foreign policy a repudiation of neoconservatism reduced efforts to roll back entitlement programs and a disdain for traditional checks and balances There are significant divisions within the party on the issues of abortion and same sex marriage br Conservative caucuses include the Republican Study Committee and Freedom Caucus br br br Christian right br br Since the rise of the Christian right in the s the Republican Party has drawn significant support from traditionalists in the Catholic Church and evangelicals partly due to opposition to abortion after Roe v Wade The Christian right faction is characterized by strong support of socially conservative and Christian nationalist policies Christian conservatives seek to use the teachings of Christianity to influence law and public policy Compared to other Republicans the socially conservative Christian right faction of the party is more likely to oppose LGBT rights marijuana legalization and support significantly restricting the legality of abortion br The Christian right is strongest in the Bible Belt which covers most of the South In October a member of the social faction Louisiana representative Mike Johnson was elected the th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives br br br Libertarians br br The Republican Party has a prominent right libertarian faction This faction of the party tends to prevail in the Midwestern and Western United States Right libertarianism emerged from fusionism in the s and s Barry Goldwater had a substantial impact on the conservative libertarian movement of the s Compared to other Republicans they are more likely to favor the legalization of marijuana LGBT rights such as same sex marriage gun rights oppose mass surveillance and support reforms to current laws surrounding civil asset forfeiture Right wing libertarians are strongly divided on the subject of abortion Prominent libertarian conservatives within the Republican Party include Rand Paul a U S senator from Kentucky Kentucky s th congressional district congressman Thomas Massie Utah senator Mike Lee and Wyoming senator Cynthia Lummis br br br Moderates br br Moderates in the Republican Party are an ideologically centrist group that predominantly come from the Northeastern United States and are typically located in swing states or blue states Moderate Republican voters are typically highly educated affluent fiscally conservative socially moderate or liberal and often Never Trump While they sometimes share the economic views of other Republicans i e lower taxes deregulation and welfare reform moderate Republicans differ in that some are for affirmative action LGBT rights and same sex marriage legal access to and even public funding for abortion gun control laws more environmental regulation and action on climate change fewer restrictions on immigration and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants In the st century some former Republican moderates have switched to the Democratic Party br Notable moderate Republicans include Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine Nevada governor Joe Lombardo Vermont governor Phil Scott former Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker and former Maryland governor Larry Hogan br br br Right wing populists br br Right wing populism is a dominant political faction of the GOP Sometimes referred to as the MAGA or America First movement Republican populists have been described as consisting of a range of right wing ideologies including but not limited to right wing populism national conservatism neo nationalism and Trumpism They have been described as the American political variant of the far right br The Republican Party s populist and far right movements emerged in occurrence with a global increase in populist movements in the s and s coupled with entrenchment and increased partisanship within the party since fueled by the rise of the Tea Party movement which has also been described as far right The election of Trump in split the party into pro Trump and anti Trump factions br Despite producing no manifesto the far right faction supports cuts to spending In international relations populists support U S aid to Israel but not to Ukraine are generally supportive towards Russia and favor an isolationist America First foreign policy agenda They generally reject compromise within the party and with the Democrats and are willing to oust fellow Republican office holders they deem to be too moderate Compared to other Republicans the populist faction is more likely to oppose legal immigration free trade neoconservatism and environmental protection laws br The party s far right faction includes members of the Freedom Caucus as well as Lauren Boebert Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz who led the rebellion against then Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy br Joseph Lowndes a professor of political science at the University of Oregon argued that while current far right Republicans support Trump the faction rose before and will likely exist after Trump Julia Azari an associate professor of political science at Marquette University noted that not all Trumpist Republicans are public supporters of Donald Trump and that some Republicans endorse Trump policies while distancing themselves from Trump as a person According to sociologist Joe Feagin political polarization by racially extremist Republicans as well as their increased attention from conservative media has perpetuated the near extinction of moderate Republicans and created legislative paralysis at numerous government levels in the last few decades br br br Political positions br br br Economic policies br Republicans believe that free markets and individual achievement are the primary factors behind economic prosperity Reduction in income taxes is a core component of Republicans fiscal agenda br br br Taxes br Tax cuts have been at the core of Republican economic policy since At the national level and state level Republicans tend to pursue policies of tax cuts and deregulation Modern Republicans advocate the theory of supply side economics which holds that lower tax rates increase economic growth Many Republicans oppose higher tax rates for higher earners which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth They believe private spending is more efficient than government spending Republican lawmakers have also sought to limit funding for tax enforcement and tax collection br As per a study that measured Republicans congressional votes the modern Republican Party s economic policy positions tend to align with business interests and the affluent br br br Spending br Republicans frequently advocate in favor of fiscal conservatism during Democratic administrations however the party has a record of increasing federal debt during periods when it controls the government the implementation of the Bush tax cuts Medicare Part D and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of are examples of this record Republican administrations have since the late s sustained or increased previous levels of government spending br br br Entitlements br Republicans believe individuals should take responsibility for their own circumstances They also believe the private sector is more effective in helping the poor through charity than the government is through welfare programs and that social assistance programs often cause government dependency As of November all states that had not expanded Medicaid had Republican controlled state legislatures br br br Labor unions and the minimum wage br The Republican Party is generally opposed to labor unions Republicans believe corporations should be able to establish their own employment practices including benefits and wages with the free market deciding the price of work Since the s Republicans have generally been opposed by labor union organizations and members At the national level Republicans supported the Taft Hartley Act of which gives workers the right not to participate in unions Modern Republicans at the state level generally support various right to work laws br Most Republicans also oppose increases in the minimum wage believing that such increases hurt businesses by forcing them to cut and outsource jobs while passing on costs to consumers br br br Trade br br The Republican Party has taken widely varying views on international trade throughout its history It currently largely opposes free trade though it supports maintaining existing free trade agreements At its inception the Republican Party supported protective tariffs with the Morrill Tariff being enacted during the presidency of Abraham Lincoln In the presidential election Republican presidential candidate William McKinley campaigned heavily on high tariffs having been the creator and namesake for the McKinley Tariff of br In the early th century the Republican Party began splitting on tariffs with the great battle over the high Payne Aldrich Tariff Act in splitting the party and causing a realignment Democratic president Woodrow Wilson cut rates with the Underwood Tariff and the coming of World War I in radically revised trade patterns due to reduced trade Also the new revenues generated by the federal income tax due to the th amendment made tariffs less important in terms of economic impact and political rhetoric When the Republicans returned to power in they again imposed a protective tariff They raised it again with the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of to meet the Great Depression in the United States but the depression only worsened and Democrat Franklin D Roosevelt became president from to br The Reciprocal Tariff Act of marked a sharp departure from the era of protectionism in the United States American duties on foreign products declined from an average of in to by which included the presidency of Republican president Dwight D Eisenhower After World War II the U S promoted the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT established in to minimize tariffs and other restrictions and to liberalize trade among all capitalist countries br During the Reagan and George H W Bush administrations Republicans abandoned protectionist policies and came out against quotas and in favor of the GATT and the World Trade Organization policy of minimal economic barriers to global trade Free trade with Canada came about as a result of the Canada U S Free Trade Agreement of which led in to the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA based on Reagan s plan to enlarge the scope of the market for American firms to include Canada and Mexico President Bill Clinton with strong Republican support in pushed NAFTA through Congress over the vehement objection of labor unions br In the st century opinions on trade and protectionism have fluctuated more recently splitting roughly on partisan lines In only of Republicans agreed that free trade agreements are good for the United States compared to of Democrats When asked if free trade has helped respondents specifically the approval numbers for Democrats drop to however approval ratings among Republicans remain relatively unchanged at The election marked the beginning of the trend of returning to protectionism an ideology incorporated into Republican president Donald Trump s platform During his presidency Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans Pacific Partnership initiated a trade war with China and negotiated the USMCA as a successor to NAFTA br br br Environmental policies br br Historically progressive leaders in the Republican Party supported environmental protection Republican President Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist whose policies eventually led to the creation of the National Park Service While Republican President Richard Nixon was not an environmentalist he signed legislation to create the Environmental Protection Agency in and had a comprehensive environmental program However this position has changed since the s and the administration of President Ronald Reagan who labeled environmental regulations a burden on the economy Since then Republicans have increasingly taken positions against environmental regulation with many Republicans rejecting the scientific consensus on climate change br In then California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger broke from Republican orthodoxy to sign several bills imposing caps on carbon emissions in California Then President George W Bush opposed mandatory caps at a national level Bush s decision not to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant was challenged in the Supreme Court by states with the court ruling against the Bush administration in Bush also publicly opposed ratification of the Kyoto Protocols which sought to limit greenhouse gas emissions and thereby combat climate change his position was heavily criticized by climate scientists br The Republican Party rejects cap and trade policy to limit carbon emissions In the s Senator John McCain proposed bills such as the McCain Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act that would have regulated carbon emissions but his position on climate change was unusual among high ranking party members Some Republican candidates have supported the development of alternative fuels in order to achieve energy independence for the United States Some Republicans support increased oil drilling in protected areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge a position that has drawn criticism from activists br Many Republicans during the presidency of Barack Obama opposed his administration s new environmental regulations such as those on carbon emissions from coal In particular many Republicans supported building the Keystone Pipeline this position was supported by businesses but opposed by indigenous peoples groups and environmental activists br According to the Center for American Progress a non profit liberal advocacy group more than of congressional Republicans were climate change deniers in PolitiFact in May found relatively few Republican members of Congress accept the prevailing scientific conclusion that global warming is both real and man made The group found eight members who acknowledged it although the group acknowledged there could be more and that not all members of Congress have taken a stance on the issue br From to the Republican Party went from debating how to combat human caused climate change to arguing that it does not exist according to The New York Times In January the Republican led U S Senate voted to pass a resolution acknowledging that climate change is real and is not a hoax however an amendment stating that human activity significantly contributes to climate change was supported by only five Republican senators br br br Health care br The party opposes a single payer health care system describing it as socialized medicine It also opposes the Affordable Care Act and expansions of Medicaid Historically there have been diverse and overlapping views within both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party on the role of government in health care but the two parties became highly polarized on the topic during and onwards br Both Republicans and Democrats made various proposals to establish federally funded aged health insurance prior to the bipartisan effort to establish Medicare and Medicaid in No Republican member of Congress voted for the Affordable Care Act in and after it passed the party made frequent attempts to repeal it At the state level the party has tended to adopt a position against Medicaid expansion br According to a YouGov poll Republicans are slightly more likely to oppose intersex medical alterations than Democrats br br br Foreign policy br br The Republican Party has a persistent history of skepticism and opposition to multilateralism in American foreign policy Neoconservatism which supports unilateralism and emphasizes the use of force and hawkishness in American foreign policy has been a prominent strand of foreign policy thinking in all Republican presidential administration since Ronald Reagan s presidency Some including paleoconservatives call for non interventionism and an isolationist America First foreign policy agenda This faction gained strength starting in with the rise of Donald Trump demanding that the United States reset its previous interventionist foreign policy and encourage allies and partners to take greater responsibility for their own defense br br br Israel br During the s Republicans predominantly opposed the cause of an independent Jewish state due to the influence of conservatives of the Old Right In Democratic President Harry Truman became the first world leader to recognize an independent state of Israel br The rise of neoconservatism saw the Republican Party become predominantly pro Israel by the s and s although notable anti Israel sentiment persisted through paleoconservative figures such as Pat Buchanan As president Donald Trump generally supported Israel during most of his term but became increasingly critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu towards the end of it After the October Hamas terrorist attack on Israel Trump blamed Netanyahu for having failed to prevent the attack Trump previously criticized the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and expressed doubt about whether Netanyahu truly desired peace with the Palestinians According to i NEWS the s have seen declining support for Israel among nationalist Republicans led by individuals such as Tucker Carlson br br br Taiwan br In the party s platform its stance on Taiwan is We oppose any unilateral steps by either side to alter the status quo in the Taiwan Straits on the principle that all issues regarding the island s future must be resolved peacefully through dialogue and be agreeable to the people of Taiwan In addition if China were to violate those principles the United States in accord with the Taiwan Relations Act will help Taiwan defend itself br br br War on terror br br Since the terrorist attacks on September Neoconservatism in the party has supported the War on Terror including the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War The George W Bush administration took the position that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to unlawful combatants while other prominent Republicans such as Ted Cruz strongly oppose the use of enhanced interrogation techniques which they view as torture In the s Trumpist Republicans such as Matt Gaetz supported reducing U S military presence abroad and ending intervention in countries such as Somalia br br br Europe Russia and Ukraine br br The Republican platform eliminated references to giving weapons to Ukraine in its fight with Russia and rebel forces the removal of this language reportedly resulted from intervention from staffers to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump However the Trump administration approved a new sale of anti tank weapons to Ukraine in Republicans generally question European NATO members insufficient investment in defense funding and some are dissatisfied with U S aid to Ukraine Some Republican members of the U S Congress support foreign aid to Israel but not to Ukraine accused by U S media of being pro Russian br Amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine several prominent Republicans criticized some colleagues and conservative media outlets for echoing Russian propaganda Liz Cheney formerly the third ranking House Republican said a Putin wing of the Republican Party had emerged Republican Senator Mitt Romney characterized pro Putin sentiments expressed by some Republicans as almost treasonous Former vice president Mike Pence said There is no room in the Republican Party for apologists for Putin House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Michael McCaul asserted that Russian propaganda had infected a good chunk of my party s base attributing the cause to nighttime entertainment shows and conspiracy theory outlets that are just not accurate and they actually model Russian propaganda House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Turner confirmed McCaul s assessment asserting that some propaganda coming directly from Russia could be heard on the House floor Republican senator Thom Tillis characterized the influential conservative commentator Tucker Carlson who frequently expresses pro Russia sentiments as Russia s useful idiot br br br Foreign relations and aid br In a poll of Republicans favored doing less abroad and focusing on the country s own problems instead br Republicans have frequently advocated for restricting foreign aid as a means of asserting the national security and immigration interests of the United States br A survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs shows that Trump Republicans seem to prefer a US role that is more independent less cooperative and more inclined to use military force to deal with the threats they see as the most pressing br br br Social issues br The Republican Party is generally associated with social conservative policies although it does have dissenting centrist and libertarian factions The social conservatives support laws that uphold their traditional values such as opposition to same sex marriage abortion and marijuana The Republican Party s positions on social and cultural issues are in part a reflection of the influential role that the Christian right has had in the party since the s Most conservative Republicans also oppose gun control affirmative action and illegal immigration br br br Abortion and embryonic stem cell research br The Republican position on abortion has changed significantly over time During the s and early s opposition to abortion was concentrated among members of the political left and the Democratic Party most liberal Catholics which tended to vote for the Democratic Party opposed expanding abortion access while most conservative evangelical Protestants supported it br During this period Republicans generally favored legalized abortion more than Democrats although significant heterogeneity could be found within both parties Leading Republican political figures including Richard Nixon Gerald Ford Ronald Reagan and George H W Bush took pro choice positions until the early s However starting at this point both George H W Bush and Ronald Reagan described themselves as pro life during their presidencies br In the st century both George W Bush and Donald Trump described themselves as pro life during their terms However Trump stated that he supported the legality and ethics of abortion before his candidacy in br br Summarizing the rapid shift in the Republican and Democratic positions on abortion Sue Halpern writes in the late s and early s many Republicans were behind efforts to liberalize and even decriminalize abortion theirs was the party of reproductive choice while Democrats with their large Catholic constituency were the opposition Republican governor Ronald Reagan signed the California Therapeutic Abortion Act one of the most liberal abortion laws in the country in legalizing abortion for women whose mental or physical health would be impaired by pregnancy or whose pregnancies were the result of rape or incest The same year the Republican strongholds of North Carolina and Colorado made it easier for women to obtain abortions New York under Governor Nelson Rockefeller a Republican eliminated all restrictions on women seeking to terminate pregnancies up to twenty four weeks gestation Richard Nixon Barry Goldwater Gerald Ford and George H W Bush were all pro choice and they were not party outliers In a Gallup poll found that percent of Republicans believed abortion to be a private matter between a woman and her doctor The government they said should not be involved Since the s opposition to abortion has become strongest in the party among traditionalist Catholics and conservative Protestant evangelicals With the possible exception of the ordeal of the bitter water in Numbers the Bible does not mention the topic of abortion or explicitly take a position on the practice although several verses have been interpreted as supporting or opposing the ethics of abortion Initially evangelicals were relatively indifferent to the cause of abortion and overwhelmingly viewed it as a concern that was sectarian and Catholic Historian Randall Balmer notes that Billy Graham s Christianity Today published in a statement by theologian Bruce Waltke that God does not regard the fetus as a soul no matter how far gestation has progressed The Law plainly exacts If a man kills any human life he will be put to death Lev But according to Exodus the destruction of the fetus is not a capital offense Clearly then in contrast to the mother the fetus is not reckoned as a soul Typical of the time Christianity Today refused to characterize abortion as sinful and cited individual health family welfare and social responsibility as justifications for ending a pregnancy Similar beliefs were held among conservative figures in the Southern Baptist Convention including W A Criswell who is partially credited with starting the conservative resurgence within the organization who stated I have always felt that it was only after a child was born and had a life separate from its mother that it became an individual person and it has always therefore seemed to me that what is best for the mother and for the future should be allowed Balmer argues that evangelical American Christianity being inherently tied to opposition to abortion is a relatively new occurrence After the late s he writes opinion against abortion among evangelicals rapidly shifted in favor of its prohibition br Today opinion polls show that Republican voters are heavily divided on the legality of abortion although vast majority of the party s national and state candidates are anti abortion and oppose elective abortion on religious or moral grounds While many advocate exceptions in the case of incest rape or the mother s life being at risk in the party approved a platform advocating banning abortions without exception There were not highly polarized differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party prior to the Roe v Wade Supreme Court ruling which made prohibitions on abortion rights unconstitutional but after the Supreme Court ruling opposition to abortion became an increasingly key national platform for the Republican Party As a result Evangelicals gravitated towards the Republican Party Most Republicans oppose government funding for abortion providers notably Planned Parenthood This includes support for the Hyde Amendment br Until its dissolution in Republican Majority for Choice an abortion rights PAC advocated for amending the GOP platform to include pro abortion rights members br The Republican Party has pursued policies at the national and state level to restrict embryonic stem cell research beyond the original lines because it involves the destruction of human embryos br After the overturning of Roe v Wade in a majority of Republican controlled states passed near total bans on abortion rendering it largely illegal throughout much of the United States br br br Affirmative action br br Republicans generally oppose affirmative action often describing it as a quota system and believing that it is not meritocratic and is counter productive socially by only further promoting discrimination According to a ABC poll a majority of Americans and of Republicans supported the Supreme Court s decision in Students for Fair Admissions v Harvard prohibiting race as a factor in college admissions compared to only of Democrats br The Republican national platform stated We support efforts to help low income individuals get a fair chance based on their potential and individual merit but we reject preferences quotas and set asides as the best or sole methods through which fairness can be achieved whether in government education or corporate boardrooms Merit ability aptitude and results should be the factors that determine advancement in our society br br br Gun ownership br br Republicans generally support gun ownership rights and oppose laws regulating guns According to a Pew Research Center poll of Republicans and Republican leaning independents personally own firearms compared to for the general public and of Democrats and Democratic leaning independents br The National Rifle Association of America a special interest group in support of gun ownership has consistently aligned itself with the Republican Party Following gun control measures under the Clinton administration such as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of the Republicans allied with the NRA during the Republican Revolution in Since then the NRA has consistently backed Republican candidates and contributed financial support such as in the Colorado recall election which resulted in the ousting of two pro gun control Democrats for two anti gun control Republicans br In contrast George H W Bush formerly a lifelong NRA member was highly critical of the organization following their response to the Oklahoma City bombing authored by CEO Wayne LaPierre and publicly resigned in protest br br br Drug legalization br br Republican elected officials have historically supported the War on Drugs They generally oppose legalization or decriminalization of drugs such as marijuana br Opposition to the legalization of marijuana has softened significantly over time among Republican voters A Quinnipiac poll found that of Republicans supported the legalization of recreational marijuana use and that net support for the position was points br br br Immigration br br The Republican Party has taken widely varying views on immigration throughout its history In the period between and the Republican Party was more opposed to immigration than the Democrats The GOP s opposition was in part caused by its reliance on the support of anti Catholic and anti immigrant parties such as the Know Nothings In the decades following the Civil War the Republican Party grew more supportive of immigration as it represented manufacturers in the northeast who wanted additional labor during this period the Democratic Party came to be seen as the party of labor which wanted fewer laborers with which to compete Starting in the s the parties switched places again as the Democrats grew more supportive of immigration than Republicans br In the Republican led Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform that would eventually have allowed millions of illegal immigrants to become citizens Despite the support of Republican President George W Bush the House of Representatives also led by Republicans did not advance the bill After Republican Mitt Romney was defeated in the presidential election particularly due to a lack of support among Latinos several Republicans advocated a friendlier approach to immigrants that would allow for more migrant workers and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants The Border Security Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act of passed the Senate but was not brought to a vote in the House and died in the th Congress In a poll of Republicans supported the pathway to citizenship concept br In then candidate Donald Trump proposed to build a wall along the southern border of the United States Trump immigration policies during his administration included a travel ban from multiple Muslim majority countries a Remain in Mexico policy for asylum seekers a controversial family separation policy and attempting to end DACA During the tenure of Democratic President Joe Biden the Republican Party has continued to take a hardline stance against illegal immigration The Party largely opposes immigration reform although there are widely differing views on immigration within the Party br br br LGBT issues br br Similar to the Democratic Party the Republican position on LGBT rights has changed significantly over time with continuously increasing support among both parties on the issue The Log Cabin Republicans is a group within the Republican Party that represents LGBT conservatives and allies and advocates for LGBT rights and equality br From the early s to the mid s Republicans opposed same sex marriage while being divided on the issue of civil unions and domestic partnerships for same sex couples During the election George W Bush campaigned prominently on a constitutional amendment to prohibit same sex marriage many believe it helped Bush win re election In both and President Bush Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and House Majority Leader John Boehner promoted the Federal Marriage Amendment a proposed constitutional amendment which would legally restrict the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples In both attempts the amendment failed to secure enough votes to invoke cloture and thus ultimately was never passed As more states legalized same sex marriage in the s Republicans increasingly supported allowing each state to decide its own marriage policy As of most state GOP platforms expressed opposition to same sex marriage The GOP Platform defined marriage as natural marriage the union of one man and one woman and condemned the Supreme Court s ruling legalizing same sex marriages The platform which reused the platform retained the statements against same sex marriage br Following his election as president in Donald Trump stated that he had no objection to same sex marriage or to the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v Hodges but had previously promised to consider appointing a Supreme Court justice to roll back the constitutional right In office Trump was the first sitting Republican president to recognize LGBT Pride Month Conversely the Trump administration banned transgender individuals from service in the United States military and rolled back other protections for transgender people which had been enacted during the previous Democratic presidency br The Republican Party platform previously opposed the inclusion of gay people in the military and opposed adding sexual orientation to the list of protected classes since The Republican Party opposed the inclusion of sexual preference in anti discrimination statutes from to The and Republican Party platform supported anti discrimination statutes based on sex race age religion creed disability or national origin but both platforms were silent on sexual orientation and gender identity The platform was opposed to sex discrimination statutes that included the phrase sexual orientation The same platform rejected Obergefell v Hodges and was also used for the party s platform In the early s numerous Republican led states proposed or passed laws limiting or banning transgender care for minors public performances of drag shows and teaching schoolchildren about LGBT topics br On November RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel announced the creation of the RNC Pride Coalition in partnership with the Log Cabin Republicans to promote outreach to LGBTQ voters However after the announcement McDaniel apologized for not having communicated the announcement in advance and emphasized that the new outreach program does not alter the GOP Platform last adopted in br As of a majority of Republican voters support same sex marriage According to FiveThirtyEight as of Republican voters are consistently more open to same sex marriage than their representatives br br br Voting rights br br Virtually all restrictions on voting have in recent years been implemented by Republicans Republicans mainly at the state level argue that the restrictions such as the purging of voter rolls limiting voting locations and limiting early and mail in voting are vital to prevent voter fraud saying that voter fraud is an underestimated issue in elections Polling has found majority support for early voting automatic voter registration and voter ID laws among the general population br In defending their restrictions to voting rights Republicans have made false and exaggerated claims about the extent of voter fraud in the United States all existing research indicates that it is extremely rare and civil and voting rights organizations often accuse Republicans of enacting restrictions to influence elections in the party s favor Many laws or regulations restricting voting enacted by Republicans have been successfully challenged in court with court rulings striking down such regulations and accusing Republicans of establishing them with partisan purpose br After the Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v Holder rolled back aspects of the Voting Rights Act of Republicans introduced cuts to early voting purges of voter rolls and imposition of strict voter ID laws The Republican platform advocated proof of citizenship as a prerequisite for registering to vote and photo ID as a prerequisite when voting br After Donald Trump and his Republican allies made false claims of fraud during the presidential election Republicans launched a nationwide effort to impose tighter election laws at the state level Such bills are centered around limiting mail in voting strengthening voter ID laws shortening early voting eliminating automatic and same day voter registration curbing the use of ballot drop boxes and allowing for increased purging of voter rolls Republicans in at least eight states have also introduced bills that would give lawmakers greater power over election administration after they were unsuccessful in their attempts to overturn election results in swing states won by Biden br Supporters of the bills argue they would improve election security and reverse temporary changes enacted during the COVID pandemic they point to false claims of significant election fraud as well as the substantial public distrust of the integrity of the election those claims have fostered as justification Political analysts say that the efforts amount to voter suppression are intended to advantage Republicans by reducing the number of people who vote and would disproportionately affect minority voters br As part of their attempts to overturn the U S presidential election Trump and his allies repeatedly falsely claimed there had been massive election fraud and that Trump had won the election Their effort was characterized by some as an implementation of Hitler s big lie propaganda technique br br br Composition br br According to a Gallup poll of Americans identify as Republican and identify as leaning Republican In comparison identify as Democratic and identify as leaning Democratic The Democratic Party has typically held an overall edge in party identification since Gallup began polling on the issue in br In The New York Times stated that the party was strongest in the South most of the Midwestern and Mountain States and Alaska br As of the s the party derives its strongest support from rural voters evangelical Christians and Latter day Saints men senior citizens and white voters without college degrees The party has made significant gains among the white working class Hispanics and Orthodox Jews but has lost support among upper middle class and college educated whites br br br Demographics br br br Gender br Since a gender gap has seen stronger support for the Republican Party among men than among women Unmarried and divorced women were far more likely to vote for Democrat John Kerry than for Republican George W Bush in the presidential election In House races of women voted Republican while of men did so In the midterms the gender gap was reduced with women supporting Republican and Democratic candidates equally Exit polls from the elections revealed a continued weakness among unmarried women for the GOP a large and growing portion of the electorate Although women supported Obama over Mitt Romney by a margin of in Romney prevailed amongst married women Obama won unmarried women br However according to a December study White women are the only group of female voters who support Republican Party candidates for president They have done so by a majority in all but of the last elections br br br Education br br The Republican Party has steadily increased the percentage of votes it receives from white voters without college degrees since the s even as the educational attainment of the United States has steadily increased Since the s a similar trend in the opposite direction has been seen among white voters with college degrees who have been increasingly voting for the Democratic Party White voters without college degrees tend to be more socially conservative and more likely to live in rural areas In the United States presidential election Donald Trump won of white voters without a college degree compared to of white voters with a college degree br In the Pew Research Center conducted a study of registered voters with a Democrat to Republican gap They found that self described Democrats had an eight point advantage over Republicans among college graduates and a fourteen point advantage among all post graduates polled Republicans had an eleven point advantage among White men with college degrees Democrats had a ten point advantage among women with degrees Democrats accounted for of all respondents with an education of high school or less Republicans accounted for When isolating just White registered voters polled Republicans had a six point advantage overall and a nine point advantage among those with a high school education or less Following the presidential election exit polls indicated that Donald Trump attracted a large share of the vote from Whites without a college degree receiving percent of the White non college male vote and percent of the White non college female vote Overall of voters with college degrees voted for Hillary Clinton in while of voters without college degrees voted for Trump br br br Ethnicity br br Republicans have been winning under of the African American vote in national elections since The party abolished chattel slavery under Abraham Lincoln defeated the Slave Power and gave Black people the legal right to vote during Reconstruction in the late s Until the New Deal of the s Black people supported the Republican Party by large margins Black delegates were a sizable share of southern delegates to the national Republican convention from Reconstruction until the start of the th century when their share began to decline Black people shifted in large margins to the Democratic Party in the s when Black politicians such as Arthur Mitchell and William Dawson supported the New Deal because it would better serve the interest of Black Americans Black voters would become one of the core components of the New Deal coalition In the South after the Voting Rights Act to prohibit racial discrimination in elections was passed by a bipartisan coalition in Black people were able to vote again and ever since have formed a significant portion of the Democratic vote in that region br In the elections two African American Republicans Tim Scott and Allen West were elected to the House of Representatives As of January there are four African American Republicans in the House of Representatives and one African American Republican in the United States Senate In recent decades Republicans have been moderately successful in gaining support from Hispanic and Asian American voters George W Bush who campaigned energetically for Hispanic votes received of their vote in and in The party s strong anti communist stance has made it popular among some minority groups from current and former Communist states in particular Cuban Americans Korean Americans Chinese Americans and Vietnamese Americans The election of Bobby Jindal as Governor of Louisiana was hailed as pathbreaking Jindal became the first elected minority governor in Louisiana and the first state governor of Indian descent br Republicans have gained support among racial and ethnic minorities particularly among those who are working class Hispanic or Latino or Asian American since the s According to John Avlon in the Republican party was more ethnically diverse at the statewide elected official level than the Democratic Party was GOP statewide elected officials included Latino Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval and African American U S senator Tim Scott of South Carolina br In the presidential election Republican presidential candidate John McCain won of White votes of Asian votes of Hispanic votes and of African American votes In of Romney voters were White while of Obama voters were White In the U S House elections Republicans won of White voters of Asian voters of Hispanic voters and of African American voters br As of Republican candidates had lost the popular vote in seven out of the last eight presidential elections Since the only time they won the popular vote in a presidential election is the United States presidential election Demographers have pointed to the steady decline of its core base of older rural White voters as a percentage of the eligible voters However Donald Trump managed to increase non White support to of his total votes in the election the highest percentage for a GOP presidential candidate since br br br Religious communities br br Religion has always played a major role for both parties but in the course of a century the parties religious compositions have changed Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before with Catholics Jews and southern Protestants heavily Democratic and northeastern Protestants heavily Republican Most of the old differences faded away after the realignment of the s and s that undercut the New Deal coalition Voters who attended church weekly gave of their votes to Bush in those who attended occasionally gave him only and those who never attended gave him Fifty nine percent of Protestants voted for Bush along with of Catholics even though John Kerry was Catholic Since a large majority of evangelicals has voted Republican voted for Bush in and and for Republican House candidates in br Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints who reside predominantly in Utah and several neighboring states voted or more for George W Bush in Members of the Mormon faith had a mixed relationship with Donald Trump during his tenure despite of them voting for him in and of them supporting his presidency in disapproving of his personal behavior such as that shown during the Access Hollywood controversy In the United States presidential election Trump underperformed in heavily Mormon Utah by a margin of more than compared to Mitt Romney who is Mormon in and George W Bush in Their opinion on Trump had not affected their party affiliation however as of Mormons in expressed preference for generic Republican congressional candidates br Jews continue to vote

pro Israel foreign policy stance Over of Orthodox Jews identify as Republican or Republican leaning as of An exit poll conducted by the Associated Press for found of Muslims voted for Donald Trump The mainline traditional Protestants Methodists Lutherans Presbyterians Episcopalians and Disciples have dropped to about Republican in contrast to before Democrats have close links with the African

Church on subjects such as abortion contraception euthanasia and embryonic stem cell research they tend to differ on the death penalty and same sex marriage Pope Francis encyclical Laudato si sparked a discussion on the positions of Catholic Republicans in relation to the positions of the Church br The Pope s encyclical on behalf of the Catholic Church officially acknowledges a man made climate change caused by burning fossil fuels The Pope says the warming of the planet is rooted in a throwaway culture and the developed world s indifference to the destruction of the planet in pursuit of short term economic gains According to The New York Times Laudato si put pressure on the Catholic candidates in the election Jeb Bush Bobby Jindal Marco Rubio and Rick Santorum br With leading Democrats praising the encyclical James Bretzke a professor of moral theology at Boston College has said that both sides were being disingenuous I think it shows that both the Republicans and the Democrats like to use religious authority and in this case the Pope to support positions they have arrived at independently There is a certain insincerity hypocrisy I think on both sides While a Pew Research poll indicates Catholics are more likely to believe the Earth is warming than non Catholics of Catholic Republicans believe in global warming less than the general population and only of
