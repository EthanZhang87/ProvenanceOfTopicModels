Slavery in Georgia is known to have been practiced by European colonists During the colonial era the practice of slavery in Georgia soon became surpassed by industrial scale plantation slavery br The colony of the Province of Georgia under James Oglethorpe banned slavery in the only one of the thirteen colonies to have done so However it was legalized by royal decree in in part due to George Whitefield s support for the institution of slavery br br br Pre colonial period br Native Americans enslaved members of their own and other tribes before Europeans arrived and afterwards continuing into the s slaves might or might not be adopted eventually especially if enslaved as children and the enslavement might or might not be hereditary Native American slaves included captives from wars and slave raids captives bartered from other tribes sometimes at great distances children sold by their parents during famines and men and women who staked themselves in gambling when they had nothing else which put them into servitude in some cases for life However there were differences between the styles of slavery European slavery was specifically focused racism and the concept of racial inferiority something that had not been documented in Native American societies prior to contact br br br Colonial America br br The life of a slave in Colonial America differed greatly depending on the colony nature of work the size of the enslaved workforce temperament and the power of the enslaver Additionally there had been a variety of psychological experiences of those that experienced slavery from birth versus those born free and differences across the different ethnicities br The first enslaved Africans in Georgia arrived in with Lucas V zquez de Ayll n s establishment of San Miguel de Gualdape on the current Georgia coast after failing to establish the colony on the Carolina coast They rebelled and lived with indigenous people destroying the colony in less than two months br Two centuries later Georgia was the last of the Thirteen Colonies to be established and the furthest south Florida was not one of the Thirteen Colonies Founded in the s Georgia s powerful backers did not object to slavery as an institution but their business model was to rely on labor from Britain primarily England s poor and they were also concerned with security given the closeness of then Spanish Florida and Spain s regular offers to enemy slaves to revolt or escape Despite agitation for slavery it was not until a defeat of the Spanish by Georgia colonials in the s that arguments for opening the colony to slavery intensified To staff the rice plantations and settlements Georgia s proprietors relented in and African slavery grew quickly After becoming a royal colony in the s Georgia began importing slaves directly from Africa br br br Federalist Era br br br Birthplace of the cotton gin br Georgia figures significantly in the history of American slavery because of Eli Whitney s invention of the cotton gin in The gin was first demonstrated to an audience on Revolutionary War hero General Nathanael Greene s plantation near Savannah The cotton gin s invention led to both the burgeoning of cotton as a cash crop and to the revitalization of the agricultural slave labor system in the northern states The U S economy soon became dependent upon cotton production and the sale of cotton to northern and English textile manufacturers br br br Domestic slave trade br br Slave markets existed in several Georgia cities and towns including Albany Atlanta Augusta Columbus Macon Milledgeville and above all in Savannah In Savannah was the site of a slave sale colloquially known as the Weeping Time one of the largest slave sales in the history of the United States Historian E A Pollard wrote in Macon you must know is one of the principal marts for slaves in the South Some time ago I attended on the city s confines an extraordinarily large auction of slaves including a gang of sixty one from a plantation in southwestern Georgia The prices brought were comparatively low as there was no warranty of soundness and owing very much also to the fact that the slaves were all sold in families At the beginning of the American Civil War active traders in Atlanta included Robert M Clarke Solomon Cohen Crawford Frazer Co Fields and Gresham W H Henderson Inman Cole Co Zachariah A Rice A K Seago B D Smith and Whitaker and Turner br Importing slaves to Georgia was illegal from until the law was repealed in Despite these restrictions researchers estimate that Georgians transported approximately fifty thousand bonded African Americans from other slave states between and Some of these imports were legal transfers others were not Samuel Oakes the father of a Charleston slave trader named Ziba B Oakes was implicated in illegally importing slaves to Georgia in which resulted in a newspaper notice about the case from Savannah mayor William Thorne Williams that concluded The laws of our State are severe inflicting heavy fines and Penitentiary confinement on such as shall be convicted of these offences Our own safety requires us to be vigilant in preventing the outcasts and convicted felons of other communities from being brought into ours And all those entrusted with the administration of the laws are bound to use their utmost efforts to bring to just punishment such as shall be guilty of this nature br Slaves intended for personal use could be imported which resulted in a number of workarounds used by traders One described in the Anti Slavery Bugle in Hamburg South Carolina was built up just opposite Augusta for the purpose of furnishing slaves to the planters of Georgia Augusta is the market to which the planters of Upper and Middle Georgia bring their cotton and if they want to purchase negroes they step over into Hamburg and do so There are two large houses there with piazzas in front to expose the chattels to the public during the day and yards in rear of them where they are penned up at night like sheep so close that they can hardly breathe with bull dogs on the outside as sentinels They sometimes have thousands here for sale who in consequence of their number suffer most horribly br br br Killing of traders Jesse Kirby and John Kirby br Another example of slave importation to Georgia during this period is known from the killing of negro traders Jesse Kirby and John Kirby by enslaved men they were transporting overland to Georgia in a coffle The Kirbys had been to the slave markets of Baltimore one enslaved person was purchased at Chestertown and were traveling with a group of at least nine slaves through Virginia The Kirbys were killed by enslaved men named George and Littleton at an overnight campsite near Bill s Tavern around Prince Edward C House near Farmville Prince Edward County Virginia by between two and four enslaved men Such campsites were apparently typical to the transportation of slaves by overland coffle as a letter written from Georgia in described During this and other days I have passed by many negro traders who were crossing to Alabama These negro traders in order to save expense usually carry their own provisions and encamp out at night Passing many of these encampments early in the morning when they were just pitching tents I have observed groups of negroes hand cuffed probably to prevent them from running away The driver told us that a thousand negroes had gone on his road to Alabama the present spring Slaves working collectively to do violence to cruel owners was a comparative rarity in the history of antebellum violence by the enslaved in Virginia but Having left Maryland and their homes behind George Littleton and their allies likely believed that violence afforded them the last possible opportunity to escape whatever fate awaited them in Georgia Georgia offered fewer opportunities for escape than Maryland The movement south threw the slaves lives into flux br br br Civil War Era br Georgia voted to secede from the Union and join the Confederate States of America on January Years later in during his March to the Sea General William Tecumseh Sherman signed his Special Field Orders No distributing some acres km of confiscated land along the Atlantic coast from Charleston South Carolina to the St Johns River in Florida to the slaves freed by the Union Army Most of the settlers and their descendants are today known as the Gullah br Slavery was officially abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment which took effect on December Slavery had been theoretically abolished by President Abraham Lincoln s Emancipation Proclamation in which proclaimed that only slaves located in territories that were in rebellion from the United States were free Since the U S government was not in effective control of many of these territories until later in the war many of these slaves proclaimed to be free by the Emancipation Proclamation were still held in servitude until those areas came back under Union control br br br Modern day slavery br In November the U S Attorney s Office for the Southern District of Georgia announced an indictment of people following Operation Blooming Onion and alleged a variety of crimes including forced labor money laundering and mail fraud The prosecutors described the defendants actions as modern day slavery and that they forced more than people to work under threat of violence confiscated their passports and documents detained them in work camps surrounded by electric fencing or held in cramped living quarters including dirty trailers with raw sewage leaks br br br Commemoration br In the City of Savannah unveiled a bronze statue on River Street in commemoration of the Africans who were brought to this country as slaves through the city s port River Street had been an active port for exporting the commodity cotton overseas African American slaves carried cotton as well as rice from the warehouse areas to the boats and African American slaves laid the cobble stones to create River Street br In Wachovia Bank apologized to Georgia s African American community for its predecessor Georgia Railroad and Banking Company of Augusta s role in the use of at least slaves in the construction of the Georgia Railroad br br br See also br Indian slave trade in the American
