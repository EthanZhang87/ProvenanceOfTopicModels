id: 19792392
A humid subtropical climate is a temperate climate type characterized by hot and humid summers and cool to mild winters These climates normally lie on the southeast side of all continents except Antarctica generally between latitudes and and are located poleward from adjacent tropical climates and equatorward from either humid continental in North America and Asia or oceanic climates in other continents It is also known as warm temperate climate in some climate classifications br Under the K ppen climate classification Cfa and Cwa climates are either described as humid subtropical climates or warm temperate climates This climate features mean temperature in the coldest month between C F or C F and C F and mean temperature in the warmest month C F or higher However while some climatologists have opted to describe this climate type as a humid subtropical climate K ppen himself never used this term The humid subtropical climate classification was officially created under the Trewartha climate classification In this classification climates are termed humid subtropical when they have at least months with a mean temperature above C F br While many subtropical climates tend to be located at or near coastal locations in some cases they extend inland most notably in China and the United States where they exhibit more pronounced seasonal variations and sharper contrasts between summer and winter as part of a gradient between the hotter tropical climates of the southern coasts and the colder continental climates to the north and further inland As such the climate can be said to exhibit somewhat different features depending on whether it is found inland or in a maritime position br br br Characteristics br br In a humid subtropical climate summers are typically long hot and humid A deep current of tropical air dominates the humid subtropics at the time of high sun and daily intense but brief convective thundershowers are common Monthly mean temperatures in winter may be mild or slightly above freezing br Rainfall often shows a summer peak especially where storms reaching the level of monsoons are well developed as in Southeast Asia and South Asia Other areas have a more uniform or varying rainfall cycles but consistently lack any predictably dry summer months unlike Mediterranean climates which lie at similar latitudes but in most continents on opposite coasts Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms that build up due to the intense surface heating and strong subtropical sun angle Weak tropical lows that move in from adjacent warm tropical oceans as well as infrequent tropical storms often contribute to summer seasonal rainfall peaks Winter rainfall and occasional snowfall especially near the poleward margins is often associated with large storms in the westerlies that have fronts that reach down into subtropical latitudes br Under the Holdridge life zones classification the subtropical climates have a biotemperature between the frost or critical temperature line to C to F depending on locations in the world and C F and these climates are humid or even perhumid or superhumid when the potential evapotranspiration PET ratio PET Precipitation is less than In the Holdridge classification the humid subtropical climates coincide more or less with the warmest Cfa and Cwa climates and the less warm humid tropical K ppen climates Aw Am and Af br br br Breakdown of letters br Cfa C Mild temperate f Fully humid a Hot Summer br Cwa C Mild temperate w Dry Winter a Hot Summer br br br Locations br br br Africa br br In Africa humid subtropical climates are primarily found in the southern part of the continent The Cwa climate is found over a large portion of the interior of the Middle and Eastern African regions This area includes central Angola northeastern Zimbabwe the Niassa Manica and Tete provinces of Mozambique the southern Congo provinces southwest Tanzania and the majority of Malawi and Zambia Some lower portions of the Ethiopian Highlands also have this climate br The climate is also found in the narrow coastal sections of southern and eastern South Africa primarily in KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape provinces South Africa s version of this climate features heavy oceanic influences resulting in generally milder temperatures This is particularly evident in its winters when temperatures do not drop as low as in many other regions within the humid subtropical category br br br Asia br br br East Asia br br In East Asia this climate type is found in the southeastern quarter of mainland China from Hong Kong north to Nanjing the northern half of Taiwan north through southern and central Japan Kyushu Shikoku and half of Honshu and the most southern regions of Korea the south and east coasts Central and Southern Gyeongsang Province and Jeju island Cities near the equatorward boundary of this zone include Hong Kong and Taipei while Tokyo Busan Pohang Gangneung of Korea and Qingdao are near the northern boundary br The influence of the strong Siberian anticyclone in East Asia brings colder winter temperatures than in the humid subtropical zones in South America and Australia The C F isotherm reaches as far south as the valleys of the Yellow and Wei rivers roughly latitude N At Hainan Island and in Taiwan the climate transitions from subtropical into tropical In most of this region the winter monsoon is very well developed as such eastern Asian humid subtropical zones have a strong winter dry season and heavy summer rainfall br Only in inland areas below the Yangtze River and coastal areas between approximately the Huai River and the beginning of the coast of Guangdong is there sufficient winter rainfall to produce a Cfa climate even in these areas rainfall and streamflow display a highly pronounced summer peak unlike other regions of this climate type Drought can be severe and often catastrophic to agriculture in the Cwa zone br The only area where winter precipitation equals or even exceeds the summer rain is around the San in region at the western coast of Japan which during winter is on the windward side of the westerlies The winter precipitation in these regions is usually produced by low pressure systems off the east coast that develop in the onshore flow from the Siberian high Summer rainfall comes from the East Asian Monsoon and from frequent typhoons Annual rainfall is generally over millimetres in and in areas below the Himalayas can be much higher still br br br South Asia br br Humid subtropical climates can also be found in the Indian subcontinent However the humid subtropical climates exhibited here typically differ markedly from those in East Asia and for that matter a good portion of the globe Winters here are typically mild dry and relatively short They also tend to be foggy Summers tend to be long and very hot starting from mid April and peaking in May and early June with high temperatures often exceeding C F They also tend to be extremely dry complete with dust storms traits usually associated with arid or semi arid climates During this period many native trees defoliate to save water This is followed by the cooler monsoons where the region experiences heavy rains on almost a daily basis Average high temperatures decrease during the monsoon season but humidity increases This results in hot and humid conditions similar to summers in other humid subtropical climates Cities such as New Delhi Lucknow Kanpur and Patna exhibit this atypical version of the climate in India In Pakistan the cities of Islamabad Sialkot Gujranwala and Rawalpindi feature this weather pattern Lahore overlaps between being humid subtropical and semi arid The annual precipitation in Peshawar is slightly less than required for this classification br In Bangladesh cities like Rangpur Saidpur and Dinajpur in the northern region feature the monsoon variant Cwa where rainfall peaks at the monsoon season Like neighboring Northern Indian plains this region also shows a distinct three season pattern relatively dry and very hot summer March early June extremely wet cooler Monsoon season June September and mild foggy winter and autumn Late October February br Humid subtropical climates can also be found in Nepal However the Nepalese version of the climate generally does not feature the extreme hot spells that are commonplace for many other South Asian locations with this climate In Nepal cities such as Kathmandu Pokhara Butwal Birgunj and Biratnagar feature this iteration of the climate br In South Asia humid subtropical climates generally border on continental climates as altitude increases or on winter rainfall climates in western areas of Pakistan and northwestern India e g Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan or Srinagar in the Kashmir Valley in India where the primary precipitation peak occurs in March not July or August Further east in highland areas with lengthier monsoons such as Nepal seasonal temperature variation is lower than in the lowlands br br br Southeast Asia br In Southeast Asia about of the region has a tropical climate but humid subtropical climates can also be seen here such as in Northern Vietnam including Hanoi br Southeast Asian locations with these climates can feature cool temperatures with lows reaching C F during the months of December January and February Unlike a good portion of East Asian locations with this climate however most of Southeast Asia seldom experiences snowfall These areas tend to feature hot and humid summers and cool and wet winters with mean temperatures varying between and C and F in summer br br br Western Asia br br Although humid subtropical climates in Asia are mostly confined to the southeastern quarter of the continent there are two narrow areas along the coast of the Caspian Sea and Black Sea with humid subtropical climates Summers in these locations are cooler than typical humid subtropical climates and snowfall in winter is relatively common but is usually of a short duration br In Western Asia the climate is prevalent in the Gilan M zandar n and Golestan Provinces of Iran in parts of the Caucasus in Azerbaijan and in Georgia wedged between the Caspian and Black seas and coastal Black Sea Turkey albeit having more oceanic influence br Annual rainfall ranges from around millimetres in at Gorgan to over millimetres in at Bandar e Anzali and is heavy throughout the year with a maximum in October or November when Bandar e Anzali can average millimetres in in one month Temperatures are generally moderate in comparison with other parts of Western Asia During winter the coastal areas can receive snowfall which is usually of a short duration br In Rasht the average temperature in July and August is around C F but with near saturation humidity whilst in January and February it is around C F The heavy evenly distributed rainfall extends north into the Caspian coastal strip of Azerbaijan up to its northern border but this climate in Azerbaijan is however a Cfb Cfa Oceanic climate Humid subtropical climate borderline case br Western Georgia Batumi and Kutaisi in the Kolkheti Lowland and the northeast coast of Turkey Giresun have a climate similar to that of Gilan and Mazandaran in Iran and very similar to that of southeastern and northern Azerbaijan Temperatures range from C F in summer to C F in winter and rainfall is even heavier than in Caspian Iran up to millimetres in per year in Hopa Turkey These climates are a Cfb Cfa Oceanic climate Humid subtropical climate borderline case br br br North America br br In North America humid subtropical climates are found in the American Gulf and lower East Coast states including Texas Oklahoma Louisiana Arkansas Alabama Mississippi Tennessee North Carolina South Carolina Georgia and Florida On the Florida peninsula the humid subtropical climate gives way to the tropical climate of South Florida and the Florida Keys br Under K ppen s climate classification this zone includes locations further north primarily Virginia Kentucky the lower elevations of West Virginia Maryland Delaware Washington D C southeastern Pennsylvania central and southern portions of New Jersey and Downstate New York It can also be found in the lower Midwest primarily in the central and southern portions of Kansas and Missouri and the southern portions of Illinois Indiana and Ohio br In Mexico there are small areas of Cfa and Cwa climates The climate can be found in small areas scattered around the northeastern part of the country in proximity to the Gulf of Mexico Other areas where the climate can be found is in the high elevations of Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt and Sierra Madre Oriental Despite being located at higher elevations these locations have summers that are too warm to qualify as a subtropical highland climate Guadalajara s climate is a major example of this br Outside of isolated sections of Mexico the southernmost limits of this climate zone in North America lie just north of South Florida and around southern coastal Texas Cities at the southernmost limits such as Tampa and Orlando and along the Texas coast around Corpus Christi down toward Brownsville generally feature warm weather year round and minimal temperature differences between seasons In contrast cities at the northernmost limits of the climate zone such as New York Philadelphia and Louisville feature hot humid summers and chilly winters These areas have average winter temperatures at the coldest limit of climates classed as humid subtropical br Snowfall varies greatly in this climate zone In locations at the southern limits of this zone and areas around the Gulf Coast cities such as Orlando Tampa Houston New Orleans and Savannah rarely see snowfall which occurs at most a few times per generation In Southern cities farther north or inland such as Atlanta Charlotte Dallas Memphis Nashville and Raleigh snow only occasionally falls and is usually three inches or less However for the majority of the winter here temperatures remain above or well above freezing At the northernmost limits of this zone cities such as New York City Philadelphia Baltimore Washington D C and Louisville typically see snowfall during the winter with occasional heavy snowstorms Still average temperatures during a typical winter hover just above freezing at these locations br Precipitation is plentiful in North America s humid subtropical climate zone but with significant variations in terms of wettest driest months and seasons Much of the interior South including Tennessee Kentucky and the northern halves of Mississippi and Alabama tends to have a winter or spring not summer precipitation maximum Closer to the South Atlantic and Gulf coasts there is a summer maximum with July or August usually the wettest month such as in Jacksonville Charleston Mobile New Orleans and Virginia Beach A semblance of a monsoon pattern dry winters wet summers is evident along the Atlantic coast from the Chesapeake Bay region and the Outer Banks south to Florida The seasonal monsoon is much stronger on the Florida peninsula as most locations in Florida have dry winters and wet summers br In addition areas in Texas that are slightly inland from the Gulf of Mexico such as Austin and San Antonio that border the semi arid climate zone generally see a peak of precipitation in May a drought like nadir in mid summer and a secondary if not equal precipitation peak in September or October Areas further south along South Texas Gulf Coast Brownsville which closely border tropical climate classification typically have a strong September precipitation maximum and a tendency toward dry conditions in winter with rain increasing in spring with December or January often the driest months br br br South America br br Humid subtropical climates are found in a sizable portion of South America The climate extends over a few states of southern Brazil including Paran into sections of Paraguay all of Uruguay and central Argentina Pampas region Major cities such as S o Paulo Buenos Aires Porto Alegre and Montevideo have a humid subtropical climate generally in the form of hot and humid summers and mild to cool winters These areas which include the Pampas generally feature a Cfa climate categorization At S the Argentine city of Bah a Blanca lies on the southern limit of the humid subtropical zone br The Cwa climate occurs in parts of tropical highlands of S o Paulo state Mato Grosso do Sul and near the Andean highland in northwestern Argentina These highland areas feature summer temperatures that are warm enough to fall outside the subtropical highland climate category br br br Australia br br The humid subtropical climate zone predominantly lies in eastern Australia which begins from the coastal strip of Mackay Queensland and stretches down the coast to just south of Sydney where it transitions into the cooler oceanic climates br From Newcastle approximately kilometres mi northeast of Sydney the Cfa zone would extend to inland New South Wales excluding the highland regions which have an oceanic climate stretching towards Dubbo to the northwest and Wagga Wagga to the south ending at the New South Wales Victoria border Albury Wodonga To note these places would have characteristics of the semi arid and or Mediterranean climates Furthermore the inland Cfa climates generally have drier summers or at least summers with low humidity br Extreme heat is more often experienced in Sydney than in other large cities in Australia s Cfa zone especially in the western suburbs where highs over C F are not uncommon Frost is prevalent in the more inland areas of Sydney such as Richmond Average annual rainfall in the Sydney region ranges between and millimetres and in br There is usually a distinct summer rainfall maximum that becomes more pronounced moving northwards In Brisbane the wettest month February receives five times the rainfall of the driest month September Temperatures are very warm to hot but are not excessive the average maximum in February is usually around C F and in July around C F Frosts are extremely rare except at higher elevations but temperatures over C F are not common on the coast br North of the Cfa climate zone there is a zone centred upon Rockhampton which extends north to the K ppen Cwa classified climate zone of the Atherton Tablelands region This region has a very pronounced dry winter period with often negligible rainfall between June and October Winter temperatures generally only fall slightly below C F which would classify the region as a tropical savanna or Aw climate br Annual rainfall within Australia s humid subtropical climate zone can reach as high as millimetres in in coastal locations and is generally millimetres in or above The most intense day rainfall periods that occur in this coastal zone however are the outcome of east coast lows forming to the north of a large high pressure system there can be great variation in rainfall amounts from year to year as a result of these systems As an example Lismore which lies in the centre of this zone the annual rainfall can range from less than millimetres in in to more than millimetres in in br br br Europe br br As the continent does not have a large ocean to its east as the case in many other continents within the climate zone humid subtropical climates in Europe are limited to relatively small areas on the margins of the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins Cfa zones are generally transitional between the Mediterranean climate zones along the coast and oceanic and humid continental zones to the west and north where rainfall in the warmer months is too high for a Mediterranean classification while temperatures either in the summer and or winter are too warm to qualify as oceanic or humid continental Summer humidity is generally not as high here as in other continents within this climatic zone br The Po Valley in Northern Italy including major cities such as Milan Turin Bologna and Verona has a humid subtropical climate featuring hot humid summers with frequent thunderstorms winters are foggy damp and chilly with sudden bursts of frost Places along the shores of Lake Maggiore Lake Lugano Lake Como Como and Verbania in Italy and Lugano and Locarno in Switzerland have a humid subtropical climate with a distinctively high amount of rainfall during summer In France the climate is found in parts of the Garonne Valley city of Toulouse and in the Rh ne Valley including the cities of Lyon and Valence Some cities on the Balkan peninsula and in the Pannonian Basin such as Belgrade Novi Sad Ni and Budapest are just warm enough to be categorized as such At N Bratislava in Slovakia lies on the northern limit of the humid subtropical zone br The coastal areas in the northern half of the Adriatic Sea also fall within this climate zone The cities include Trieste Venice and Rimini in Italy Rijeka and Split in Croatia Koper in Slovenia and Kotor in Montenegro Other Southern European areas in the Cfa zone include the central valleys and coast of Catalonia of Girona and Barcelona in Spain some on the north east of Spain Huesca West Macedonia in Greece Kozani br Along the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria Varna coast of Romania Constan a and Mamaia Sochi Russia and Crimea have summers too warm C F mean temperature in the warmest month to qualify as oceanic no freezing month and enough summer precipitation and sometimes humid conditions where they would be fit to be classed under Cfa though they closely border the humid continental zone due to colder winters All these areas are subject to occasional in some cases repeated snowfalls and freezes during winter br In Central Europe a small area of humid subtropical climates are located in transitional areas between the oceanic and continental climates in areas where higher summer temperatures do not quite qualify it for inclusion in the Oceanic climate schema and mild winters do not allow their inclusion into continental climates Average summer temperatures in areas of Europe with this climate are generally not as hot as most other subtropical zones around the world Urban examples include Bratislava Budapest and the Innere Stadt of Vienna br In the Azores some islands have this climate with very mild and rainy winters C F and no snowfall warm summers C F but with no dry season during the warmest period which means that they can neither be classified as oceanic nor as Mediterranean only as humid subtropical as with Corvo Island br In many other climate classification systems outside of the K ppen most of these locations would not be included in the humid subtropical grouping The higher summer precipitation and poleward flow of tropical air masses in summer are not present in Europe as they are in eastern Australia or the southern United States br br br See also br Subtropics br Subtropical ridge br List of locations with a subtropical climate br br br
