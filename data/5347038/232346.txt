id: 232346
An unincorporated area is a region that is not governed by a local municipal corporation There are many unincorporated communities and areas in the United States and Canada br br br By country br br br Argentina br In Argentina the provinces of Chubut C rdoba Entre R os Formosa Neuqu n R o Negro San Luis Santa Cruz Santiago del Estero Tierra del Fuego and Tucum n have areas that are outside any municipality or commune br br br Australia br br Unlike many other countries Australia has only one level of local government immediately beneath state and territorial governments A local government area LGA often contains several towns and even entire metropolitan areas Thus aside from very sparsely populated areas and a few other unique cases almost all of Australia is part of an LGA Unincorporated areas are often in remote locations cover vast areas or have very small populations br Postal addresses in unincorporated areas as in other parts of Australia normally use the suburb or locality names gazetted by the relevant state or territorial government Thus any ambiguity regarding addresses rarely exists in unincorporated areas br br br Canada br br In Canada depending on the province an unincorporated settlement is one that does not have a municipal council that governs solely over the settlement It is usually but not always part of a larger municipal government These range from small hamlets to large urbanized areas similar in size to a town or city br In Alberta unincorporated communities can be classified as Hamlet Locality or townsite A Hamlet is an unincorporated community that can be designated by the council of Municipal District or Specialized Municipality within their boundaries or by the Minister of Municipal Affairs within the boundaries of an Improvement District br For example were they incorporated the urban service areas of Fort McMurray in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo and Sherwood Park in Strathcona County would be the fifth and sixth largest cities in Alberta br Unincorporated settlements with a population between and residents may have the status of designated place in Canadian census data br In some provinces large tracts of undeveloped wilderness or rural country are unorganized areas that fall directly under the provincial jurisdiction Some unincorporated settlements in such unorganized areas may have some types of municipal services provided to them by a quasigovernmental agency such as a local services board in Ontario In New Brunswick where a significant population lives in a local service district taxation and services may come directly from the province br br br Czech Republic br br The entire area of the Czech Republic is divided into municipalities the only exceptions are four military training areas These are parts of the regions and do not form self governing municipalities but are rather governed by military offices jezdn ad which are subordinate to the Ministry of Defence br br Note The Brdy Military Area was abandoned by the Army in and converted into a protected landscape area with its area being incorporated either into existing municipalities or into newly established municipalities based on the existing settlements The other four military training areas were reduced in size in too The decisions on whether the settlements joined existing municipalities or formed new ones were made by plebiscites br br br Denmark br Ertholmene is a small group of islands that forms the easternmost part of Denmark This small archipelago lies kilometers northeast of Bornholm and is the only part of metropolitan Denmark which is not part of a municipality The islands have been under military jurisdiction since when Denmark turned Christians into a naval base to in response to Sweden creating Karlskrona naval base a few years earlier In the entire area was declared protected cultural heritage Population of less than Statistics Denmark groups it with Bornholm in Landsdel Bornholm br br br Germany br Since Germany has no administrative level comparable to the townships of other countries the vast majority of the country close to is organized in municipalities German Gemeinde plural Gemeinden often consisting of multiple settlements that are not considered to be unincorporated Because these settlements lack a council of their own usually an Ortsvorsteher or Ortsvorsteherin village chairman chairwoman is appointed by the municipal council except in the very smallest villages br In the number of unincorporated areas in Germany called gemeindefreie Gebiete municipality free areas or singular gemeindefreies Gebiet was with a total area of km sq mi and around of its territory However these are mostly unpopulated areas such as forests lakes and their surroundings military training areas and the like br As of December Germany had uninhabited unincorporated areas of which are located in Bavaria not belonging to any municipality consisting mostly of forested areas lakes and larger rivers Also three inhabited unincorporated areas exist all of which served as military training areas Osterheide and Lohheide in Lower Saxony and Gutsbezirk M nsingen in Baden W rttemberg They have fewer than inhabitants in total Gutsbezirk M nsingen has become uninhabited after losing its inhabited parts to adjacent municipalities on January br br br Largest br The following shows the largest unincorporated areas in Germany including all inhabited areas but excluding lakes with an area of more than km sq mi br br In Bavaria there are other contiguous unincorporated areas covering an area of more than km sq mi which are however composed of several adjacent unincorporated areas each one of which is under km in area br br br Israel br In Israel almost all land is subdivided into municipalities which are further classified normally by population as city local council or regional council All three types of municipality provide services including zoning and planning br However a few unincorporated areas exist whether because of omissions and ambiguities left in official maps dating from the British Mandate for Palestine or due to deliberate policy of ensuring facilities of national importance such as Ben Gurion Airport Mikveh Israel boarding school or the BAZAN Group oil refineries would not have their operation affected by local considerations br The largest unincorporated area in Israel is the so called Reservation area a triangular region whose vertexes are Beersheba Dimona and Arad in which all Negev Bedouins were concentrated in the s As no municipal services are provided within unincorporated areas this effectively makes all Bedouin settlements in the area unrecognized with the sole exception of those that were included from within the Abu Basma Regional Council On November that council was split into two new councils Neve Midbar Regional Council and al Kasom Regional Council br br br Netherlands br The Netherlands has had regular periods with unincorporated land when newly reclaimed land polders fall dry Unincorporated land is since medieval times administered by an appointed officer with the name Landdrost or Drossaart Also Elten and Tudderen both annexed from Germany after World War II were governed by a Landdrost until they were ceded back to Germany in br The most recent period with unincorporated land started in when the dyke around Southern Flevoland was closed but several years are required before the polder is genuinely accessible for cultivation and construction of roads and homes can start as in the first years the soil is equivalent to quicksand During the initial period of inhabitation a special government appointed officer was installed the landdrost During the administrative office of a Landdrost no municipal council forms br In the first homes in what is now the city of Almere were built and from to the area was governed by the Landdrost as the executive of the Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders Southern IJsselmeerpolders Public Body In the Landdrost became the first mayor of the new city Almere Since that date the Netherlands does not have any unincorporated land areas br The Openbaar Lichaam remained however only governing the water body of the Markermeer After the municipal division of the Wadden Sea the territorial waters in the North Sea and the IJsselmeer all water bodies are now also part of a municipality and no unincorporated areas exist in the Netherlands anymore The Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders was dissolved in br br br New Zealand br The New Zealand outlying islands are offshore island groups that are part of New Zealand The Chatham Islands is the only island group among these that are populated and it has its own territorial authority Most of the other island groups are not part of any administrative region or district but are instead each designated as an Area Outside Territorial Authority br br br Norway br In Norway the outlying islands of Bouvet Island Jan Mayen and Svalbard are outside of all of the country s counties and municipalities They are ruled directly by national authorities without any local democracy An exception is the Longyearbyen Community Council in Svalbard which since in reality acts partly like a Norwegian municipality Svalbard has a governor appointed by the government of Norway ruling the area Jan Mayen has no population only radio and weather stations with staff whose manager has the responsibility for the activities Bouvet Island has only occasional visitors br br br United States br br In local government in the United States an unincorporated area generally refers to the part of a county that is outside any municipality An unincorporated community is one general term for a geographic area having a common social identity without municipal organization or official political designation i e incorporation as a city or town The two main types of unincorporated communities are br br a neighborhood or other community existing within one or across multiple existing incorporated areas i e cities or towns In this sense a community is part of a municipal government but not separately incorporated from it For example Hyannis Massachusetts is an unincorporated village within the town of Barnstable and Intervale New Hampshire is an unincorporated community on the border of the towns of Bartlett and Conway br a neighborhood or other community existing outside an incorporated municipal government In this sense the community is outside any municipal government and is entirely unincorporated Examples include Hovland Minnesota Nutbush Tennessee and Yucca Arizona all are small rural settlements of low population br Most states have granted some form of home rule so that county commissions or boards or councils have the same powers in these areas as city councils or town councils have in their respective incorporated areas Some states instead put these powers in the hands of townships which are minor civil divisions of each county and are called towns in some states br br Differences in state laws regarding the incorporation of communities leads to a great variation in the distribution and nature of unincorporated areas Unincorporated regions are essentially nonexistent in eight of the northeastern states All of the land in New Jersey Connecticut Massachusetts New York and Rhode Island and nearly all of the land in New Hampshire Pennsylvania and Vermont is part of an incorporated area of some type In these areas types and official names of local government entities can vary In New England which includes five of those eight states plus the less fully incorporated state of Maine local municipalities are known as towns or cities and most towns are administered by a form of direct democracy such as the open town meeting or representative town meeting Larger towns in New England may be incorporated as cities with some form of mayor council government In New Jersey multiple types exist as well such as city township town borough or village but these differences are in the structure of the legislative branches not in the powers or functions of the entities themselves br On the opposite end of the spectrum is the Virginia strong county model Virginia and other states with this model such as Alabama Maryland and Tennessee set strict requirements on incorporation or grant counties broad powers that in other states are carried out by cities creating a disincentive to incorporate and thus have large urbanized areas which have no municipal government below the county level br In mid Atlantic states such as New York and Pennsylvania a hybrid model that tries to balance the two approaches is prevalent with differing allocations of power between municipalities and counties existing br Throughout the U S some large cities have annexed all surrounding unincorporated areas within their counties creating what are known as consolidated city county forms of government e g Jacksonville Florida and Nashville Tennessee In these cases unincorporated areas continue to exist in other counties of their respective metropolitan areas Conversely a county island is surrounded on most or all sides by municipalities In areas of sparse population the majority of the land in any given state may be unincorporated br Some states including North Carolina grant extraterritorial jurisdiction to cities and towns but rarely villages so that they may control zoning for a limited distance into adjacent unincorporated areas often as a precursor and sometimes as a legal requirement to later annexation of those areas This is especially useful in rural counties that have no zoning at all or only spot zoning for unincorporated communities br In California all counties except the City and County of San Francisco have unincorporated areas Even in highly populated counties the unincorporated portions may contain a large number of inhabitants In Los Angeles County the county government estimates the population of its unincorporated areas to exceed one million people Despite having incorporated cities and towns including the state s most populous of the land in Los Angeles County is unincorporated this mostly consisting of Angeles National Forest and sparsely populated regions to its north In California the state constitution recognizes only one kind of municipality the city The California Government Code allows cities to call themselves towns if they wish although the designation is purely cosmetic br br br Insular areas br In the context of the insular areas of the United States the word unincorporated refers to territories in which the United States Congress has determined that only selected parts of the Constitution of the United States apply and which have not been formally incorporated into the United States by Congress Currently the five major unincorporated U S insular areas are American Samoa Guam the Northern Mariana Islands Puerto Rico and the U S Virgin Islands Unincorporated insular areas can be ceded to another nation or be granted independence The U S has one incorporated insular area Palmyra Atoll Incorporation is regarded as perpetual by the U S federal government once incorporated the territory cannot be disincorporated The United States Minor Outlying Islands without a permanent civilian population are unorganized in the sense that they do not have a local government and they are administered by the Office of Insular Affairs directly The populated American Samoa is unorganized in the sense that Congress has not passed an organic act but it does have a constitution and locally elected territorial legislature and executive br br br U S Census Bureau br An unincorporated community may be part of a census designated place CDP A CDP is an area defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only It is a populated area that generally includes one officially designated but currently unincorporated community for which the CDP is named plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and occasionally other smaller unincorporated communities as well Otherwise it has no legal status br The Census Bureau designates some unincorporated areas as unorganized territories as defined by the U S Census Bureau where portions of counties are not included in any legally established minor civil division MCD or independent incorporated place These occur in MCD states Arkansas Indiana Iowa Louisiana Maine Minnesota North Carolina North Dakota Ohio and South Dakota The census recognizes such separate pieces of territory as one or more separate county subdivisions for statistical purposes It assigns each unorganized territory a descriptive name followed by the designation unorganized territory Unorganized territories were first used for statistical purposes in conjunction with the census br At the census there were of these territories within the United States Their total land area was square miles km and they had a total population of South Dakota had the most unorganized territories as well as the largest amount of land under that status square miles km or of the state s land area North Dakota followed with territories square miles km or of its land area Maine was next with territories square miles km or of its land area Minnesota had territories square miles km or of its land area Several other states had small amounts of unorganized territory The unorganized territory with the largest population was Camp Lejeune North Carolina a United States Marine Corps base with a census population of inhabitants br In the census unorganized territory areas were identified in nine U S states Arkansas Indiana Iowa Maine Minnesota New York North Carolina North Dakota and South Dakota br br br U S mail delivery br Many unincorporated communities are also recognized as acceptable place names for use in mailing addresses by the United States Postal Service USPS indeed some have their own post offices and the Census Bureau uses the names of some widely recognized unincorporated communities for its CDPs for which it tabulates census data In some instances unincorporated areas have a mailing address indicating the name of an incorporated city as well as those where residents of one incorporated city have mailing addresses indicating another incorporated city Mailing addresses do not necessarily change whether an area becomes a part of an incorporated place changes to another incorporated place or disincorporates For example places in Kingwood Texas previously unincorporated retained Kingwood TX mailing addresses after the annexation of Kingwood into the city of Houston The Houston city government stated on its website The U S Postal Service establishes ZIP codes and mailing addresses to maximize the efficiency of their system not to recognize jurisdictional boundaries br The USPS is very conservative about recognizing new place names for use in mailing addresses and typically only does so when a place incorporates The original place name associated with a ZIP Code is still maintained as the default place name even though the name of the newly incorporated place is more accurate As an example Sandy Springs is one of the most populated places in Georgia but is served by a branch of the Atlanta post office Only after the city was incorporated in was Sandy Springs approved for use in mailing addresses though Atlanta remains the default name Accordingly Atlanta is the only accepted place name for mailing addresses in the nearby unincorporated town of Vinings also served by a branch of the Atlanta post office even though Vinings is in Cobb County and Atlanta is in Fulton and DeKalb counties In contrast neighboring Mableton has not been incorporated in nearly a century but has its own post office and thus Mableton is the only acceptable place name for mailing addresses in the town The areas of Dulah and Faria California which are unincorporated areas in Ventura County between Ventura and Carpinteria have the ZIP Code of which is assigned to the post office at E Santa Clara St in Ventura thus all mail to those two areas is addressed to Ventura br If an unincorporated area becomes incorporated it may be split among ZIP Codes and its new name may be recognized as acceptable for use with some or all of them in mailing addresses as has been the case in Johns Creek and Milton Georgia If an incorporated area disincorporates though this has no effect on whether a place name is acceptable in a mailing address or not as is the case with Lithia Springs Georgia ZIP Code boundaries often ignore political boundaries so the appearance of a place name in a mailing address alone does not indicate whether the place is incorporated or unincorporated br br br Populated place br Unincorporated areas with permanent populations in the United States are defined by the United States Geological Survey as populated places a place or area with clustered or scattered buildings and a permanent human population city settlement town village No legal boundaries exist although a corresponding civil record may occur the boundaries of which may or may not match the perceived populated place br br br Other nations br Some nations have some exceptional unincorporated areas br br Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People s Republic of China except for the Lok Ma Chau Loop is divided into districts br The Kingdom of Denmark has three unincorporated areas br In Denmark proper the former naval fortress Ertholmene east of Bornholm with less than inhabitants is still governed directly by the Ministry of Defence br In Greenland all land is incorporated except for the Northeast Greenland National Park and the Pituffik Space Base br In France all land is incorporated except for Clipperton Island a small overseas island possession held as an overseas state private property under the direct authority of the French government administered by France s Overseas Minister br In India there are several union territories central government administered regions Unlike the states of India which have their own governments union territories are federal territories governed in part or in whole by the Government of India Many of these were created at the time of India s independence or after being acquired from non British colonial powers or princely states br Azad Kashmir has no official status in Pakistani law but is nonetheless de facto governed by Pakistan br Slovakia is divided into municipalities There are two types of municipalities towns mesto pl mest and villages obec pl obce with minor differences between them Additionally there are several military areas which are not part of any municipality Each military area is a municipality of its own right However the military areas hold no elections and have no mayors or other elected representatives Instead they are administered directly by the Slovak Ministry of Defence br In Spain the Spanish Constitution of says that the land is divided into autonomous communities provinces and municipalities Each of these have certain powers determined by law Autonomous Communities and municipalities are enabled to appeal to the Constitutional Court any public decision that violates their autonomy by other entities State or Autonomous Community power Nevertheless some regions like Navarre have some unincorporated areas The largest of these the Bardenas Reales has a surface of km sq mi and is governed by a board of representatives of bordering municipalities a valley in the Pyrenees and a monastery all of which have rights to use the area The plazas de soberan a also functions as de facto unincorporated areas under the administration of the Spanish Ministry of Defence br Switzerland also has a few exceptions lakes and a forest as described by the Swiss federal statistical office See Gemeindefreie Gebiete in German br In Ukraine all land is divided into hromadas except for the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone The latter contains parts of Kyiv Oblast and Zhytomyr Oblast and is directly administered by a designated government agency br br br Countries without unincorporated areas br Many countries especially those with many centuries of history with multiple tiers of local government do not use the concept of an unincorporated area br br The whole of the territories of Albania Austria Belgium Bosnia and Herzegovina Croatia Finland Metropolitan France Greece Italy Japan Lithuania Montenegro the Netherlands the Philippines Poland Portugal Serbia Slovenia and Sweden are divided into municipalities br In Brazil Chile Colombia and Mexico all land must belong to a municipality Even large uninhabited areas such as forests or grasslands are by law part of the nearest city This is because in Latin America a municipality in some senses is the equivalent of what in the United States and Canada is called a county br In Mainland China every piece of land belongs to a county level third level administrative division equivalent to a municipality either a district q in an urban area or a county level city xi nj sh county xi n or banner q There is also a township level fourth level administrative division which may be a subdistrict ji d o town zh n township xi ng or sumu s m br In Croatia every piece of land belongs either to a city grad or to a municipality op ina br In Estonia the entire territory is divided into municipalities of which are municipal towns and are parishes The entire territory of the country is divided into settlements of four types towns boroughs small boroughs and villages br In France the territory is subdivided into communes municipalities An elected council and a mayor form the governing body of a municipality This applies to mainland France and to overseas departments and regions however some territories like Clipperton Island are not incorporated Six communes depopulated during World War I were maintained incorporated for memorial reasons although they have no population br In Indonesia every piece of land belongs to a municipality kota or a regency kabupaten br In Japan every piece of land belongs to a municipality of which there are four types cities shi the special wards tokubetsu ku of Tokyo towns ch or machi villages mura or son The four southernmost islands of Hachij Subprefecture are currently not part of any municipality as the town of Hachij and village of Aogashima both claim administrative rights br In Peru the whole territory is divided into districts distritos which form provinces provincias which form regions regiones Some districts especially in the Amazon are vast portions of territory but they are governed from a district capital which can be anywhere from a city to a small village br In the Philippines all land belongs to either a city or a municipality which are further subdivided into barangays br In Portugal the constitution defines territorial divisions as parishes municipalities and administrative regions It has no official definition of city limits so a city may include several parishes or a parish may cover several villages or townships but a municipality is usually administered from the city or town that bears its name br In South Africa the constitution gives every place in the country democratically elected third tier government br In South Korea every piece of land belongs to a municipality either a district gu in a city shi or a town eub or township myeon in a county gun br In Sweden all territory is divided into municipalities Sweden has post glacial rebound so the land area is increasing but municipal boundaries extend into the sea so new land is not unincorporated br In the free area of the Republic of China Taiwan Island Penghu Kinmen Matsu and some minor islands every piece of land belongs to either a township or a county administered city in county or district in provincial city There are in total townships county administered cities and districts in Taiwan See also administrative divisions of Taiwan br In the United Kingdom br In England all land is within a county or local government district both of which exercise power over their jurisdictions br In Northern Ireland all land is within one of districts br In Scotland all land is within one of unitary authorities designated as councils br In Wales all land is within one of single tier principal areas br br br See also br br County Island br Fire sign address br Main road town br Unorganized area br Unorganized Borough Alaska an area without county level
