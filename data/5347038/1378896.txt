title: Architecture of Atlanta
id: 1378896
The architecture of Atlanta is marked by a confluence of classical modernist post modernist and contemporary architectural styles Due to the Battle of Atlanta and the subsequent fire in the city s architecture retains almost no traces of its Antebellum past Instead Atlanta s status as a largely post modern American city is reflected in its architecture as the city has often been the earliest if not the first to showcase new architectural concepts However Atlanta s embrace of modernism has translated into an ambivalence toward architectural preservation resulting in the destruction of architectural masterpieces including the Commercial style Equitable Building Atlanta s first skyscraper the Beaux Arts style Terminal Station and the Classical Carnegie Library The city s cultural icon the Neo Moorish Fox Theatre would have met the same fate had it not been for a grassroots effort to save it in the mid s br br br History br br br Antebellum br br Because Atlanta was a settlement that grew from a planned railroad terminus and later a railroad junction rather than being planned in a grand manner its antebellum architecture was unremarkable compared to patrician Savannah or other older Southern cities The town s most important buildings included Edward A Vincent s Union Station the Atlanta Trout House and Washington Hall hotels and the Atlanta Bank An industrial journal noted that br br commodious brick stores were erected in besides a large number of fine residences mostly of brick Many of the new improvements are imposing structures and would not suffer by comparison with the most elegant portions of our modern cities br br Not a single antebellum building from what was the town of Atlanta remains today Remaining antebellum architecture inside the city limits consists of four houses that were well outside the city limits in the th century as well as the Tullie Smith House which was moved to the Atlanta History Center from a location in North Druid Hills an adjacent suburb The oldest building in Downtown Atlanta is the Georgia Railroad Freight Depot br br br Postbellum br br Most of Atlanta was burned during the Civil War depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture Yet Atlanta architecturally had never been particularly southern Because Atlanta originated as a railroad town rather than a patrician southern seaport like Savannah or Charleston many of the city s landmarks could have easily been erected in the Northeast or Midwest and indeed this was one reason why Atlanta referred to itself frequently as the New York or the Chicago of the South br Throughout the American Renaissance and beyond Atlantans were amazed at successive waves of ever more impressive hotels civic and industrial architecture and office buildings such as the Equitable Building stories Candler Building stories and Rhodes Haverty Building stories Among the most notable architects active in Atlanta between the Civil War and World War Two were A Ten Eyck Brown Francis Palmer Smith and G Lloyd Preacher br br br Cold War Era br br During the Cold War era Atlanta followed global modernist trends especially with regards to office towers and commercial buildings Examples of modernist architecture include the Westin Peachtree Plaza Georgia Pacific Tower the State of Georgia Building and the Atlanta Marriott Marquis br The era s most notable architect may be Atlanta native John Portman whose Hyatt Regency Hotel made a significant mark on the hospitality sector A graduate of Georgia Tech s College of Architecture Portman s work reshaped downtown Atlanta with his designs for the Atlanta Merchandise Mart Peachtree Center the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel and Truist Plaza br br br Contemporary Era br br In the latter half of the s Atlanta became one of the early adopters of postmodern designs which reintroduced classical elements to the cityscape Many of Atlanta s tallest skyscrapers were built from the late s to the early s with most displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns such as One Atlantic Center Peachtree Tower and the Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta And at feet m Atlanta s tallest skyscraper the Bank of America Plaza is the st tallest building in the world and the th tallest building in the United States br More recently Atlanta s built environment has been getting more eclectic and diverse For example Peachtree is more in the glass walled modernist vein while Millennium Gate also completed in is the largest classical monument in the U S to have been dedicated since completion of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington D C br br br Repurposed industrial architecture br br With the dawn of the twenty first century many former industrial buildings were repurposed for residential and retail use many along the BeltLine former railroad rights of way which became a ring of trails around the central city Examples are Ponce City Market Krog Street Market Telephone Factory Lofts Fulton Bag and Cotton Mills King Plow and Goat Farm Arts Centers and many others particularly in the Old Fourth Ward Inman Park Village Cabbagetown and Reynoldstown and the Marietta Street Artery br br br Notable Architecture br Arts facilities have led the way for modernists in Atlanta architecture with the High Museum designed by Richard Meier with a addition by Renzo Piano A recent design competition resulted in Freelon Associates in conjunction with HOK being selected as the architect for the new million home of the Center for Civil and Human Rights Michael Graves post modern style is exhibited in the Ten Peachtree Place office building in Midtown and the Michael C Carlos Museum on the campus of Emory University The story One Atlantic Center was designed by Philip Johnson in association with John Burgee Completed in the Atlanta Fulton Central Public Library was designed by one of the th century s most notable modernists architects Marcel Breuer who holds the distinction
