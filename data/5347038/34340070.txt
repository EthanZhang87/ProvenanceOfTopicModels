title: Geography of Atlanta
id: 34340070
The Geography of Atlanta encompasses square miles km of which square miles km is land and square miles km is water The city is situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and at feet m above mean sea level Atlanta has the highest elevation among major cities east of the Mississippi River Atlanta straddles the Eastern Continental Divide such that rainwater that falls on the south and east side of the divide flows into the Atlantic Ocean while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide flows into the Gulf of Mexico Atlanta sits atop a ridge south of the Chattahoochee River which is part of the ACF River Basin Located at the far northwestern edge of the city much of the river s natural habitat is preserved in part by the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area br br br Climate br br The climate of Atlanta and its metropolitan area is humid subtropical Cfa according to the K ppen classification with four seasons including hot humid summers and cool winters that are occasionally cold by the standards of the southern United States the city and its immediate suburbs are located in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone a although the far northern suburbs begin to transition to Zone b br Summers are long and consistently hot and humid The daily average temperature in July is F C with temperatures occasionally exceeding F or C and slight breezes and typically a chance of afternoon thunderstorms During the summer afternoon thunderstorms temperatures may suddenly drop below F or C with locally heavy rainfall br January averages F or C with temperatures in the suburbs slightly cooler Warm maritime air can bring springlike conditions while strong Arctic air masses can push lows to between and F and C Snow may not occur in every season in the city and inner suburbs but does every season in the northern metro When snow falls it is almost always during the period of December through March there have occurred only three measurable falls outside these months in the past ninety years the largest being inch or centimetres on November br Typical of the southeastern U S Atlanta receives abundant rainfall which is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year though spring and early fall are markedly drier Average annual rainfall is about inches mm with late winter and early spring as well as July being the wettest and fall especially October being the driest Despite having far fewer rainy days average yearly rainfall is higher here than in the Seattle area especially due to heavy thunderstorms and occasional tropical depressions br br br Extremes br Temperatures at or above F C now occur on days per year up from previously though there have been as many as days in and as few as days in Overnight freezes can be expected on days but the high temperature rarely fails to climb above the freezing mark In very cold winter months with high latitude blocking averages can occasionally fall below freezing the coldest month was January which averaged F C and which amazingly saw Atlanta average F C colder than Anchorage Alaska almost degrees latitude further north The only other month with a subfreezing mean has been January with an average of F C and a record cold mean maximum of F C br Snowfall averages inches cm per season The heaviest single storm brought in cm on January the most snow in one calendar day and the most in a calendar month the most snowfall in a season July through June of the next year is in cm in True blizzards are rare but possible the Storm of the Century which affected the region on March is one such example bringing snowdrifts up to ft m high in some parts of north Georgia Ice storms usually cause more trouble than does snowfall the most severe such storms may have occurred on January and January In Atlanta had its first White Christmas since and Later that same winter the third coldest ever a major snow and ice storm almost prevented the inauguration of the new governor of Georgia and crippled the region for two days with snow still left more than a week later in some places br Official weather recordkeeping began in Atlanta in on the morning of October Since then the highest recorded temperatures at Atlanta were F C on June the hottest month on record is August with a mean temperature of F C The lowest recorded temperatures were F C and F C on January and of and F C on February There was also an official recording of F C in in Marietta The coldest high temperature was F C again on February while conversely the hottest low temperature was F C on August br The rainiest month ever was July when Tropical Storm Alberto dumped massive amounts of rain on parts of the state and the south metro area bringing inches mm at Atlanta over three times a normal July Flooding was a major problem in those areas and further down state it was a major disaster The driest month was October when a record dry spell occurred over the entire eastern and southern United States leaving Atlanta with only a trace of precipitation for the entire month br br br Data br br See or edit raw graph data br br br Effect on vegetation br Some palm trees like palmetto and cacti like prickly pear can withstand the cold nights complementing numerous flowering pansies and a few camellias and other mild winter friendly plants of the region The growing season in the area lasts several months hardy plants being as early as mid February and others from mid March to late October when the last and first cold snaps usually occur Spring weather is pleasant but variable as cold fronts often bring strong or severe thunderstorms to almost all of the eastern and central U S Pollen counts tend to be extraordinarily high in the spring regularly exceeding particles per cubic meter in April and causing hay fever sometimes even in people not normally prone to it Pine pollen leaves a fine yellow green film on everything for much of that month The rain helps wash out Atlanta s abundant oak pine and grass pollens and fuels beautiful blooms from native flowering dogwood trees as well as azaleas forsythias magnolias and peach trees both flowering only and fruiting The citywide floral display runs during March and April and inspires the Atlanta Dogwood Festival one of Atlanta s largest Fall is also pleasant with less rain and fewer storms and leaves changing color from late October to mid November especially during drier years A secondary peak in severe storms also occurs around the second week of November br br br Effect of geography br The area s geography affects the weather as well An anticyclone over the Northeastern U S will blow cold air over the warmer Atlantic Ocean forming a wedge or marine layer up against the mountains This east or northeast wind will often blow down into the metro area in winter or even spring sometimes fall and very rarely summer dramatically lowering the temperature and bringing clouds and often fog or mist along with a swift breeze The temperature gradient across the sprawling metro Atlanta can be as much as F or C occasionally even more In winter this can be a curse bringing freezing rain to exposed objects on the north and or east sides of town and occasionally very dangerously to the ground and roads Later in the spring however it can be a great blessing as it often protects the area from severe thunderstorms and tornadoes with the cool air acting like a fire extinguisher to the storms The wedge may occasionally go the entire way through central Georgia and even into Alabama in the strongest conditions while still leaving areas of northwest Georgia much warmer than the metro area Conversely shallow and heavy cold air from the northwest may be blocked by the mountains preventing snow br The local geography also plays a role in the day to day weather with the shallow valleys to the southwest rather than the mountains to the northeast cooling rapidly on clear and calm nights particularly when the humidity is low Peachtree City and especially Newnan often report dramatically lower temperatures by as much as C or F on the pm and pm news and will not drop much further while the city built on a ridge will continue falling slowly but never reach that low This type of dramatic difference in microclimate is somewhat unusual for a place not near large mountains or bodies of water br br br Extreme weather br br br Tropical cyclones br Hurricane Opal brought sustained tropical storm conditions to the area one night in early October uprooting hundreds of trees mainly oaks and causing widespread power outages after soaking the area with rain for two days prior The western metro area caught the worst of the storm gusting to nearly miles per hour km h m s officially at Marietta br Such events are very rare so far inland some miles km inland from the Gulf of Mexico where most of the storms come from however some areas particularly east and south of the city received similar damage from the wide wind field of Hurricane Irma in September with a gust to miles per hour km h at Atlanta s airport and sustained winds up to mph km h there Record cool high temperatures of F C caused by cold air damming against the Appalachians served to eliminate the normal tornado risk in north Georgia and to weaken the storm faster than expected reducing the anticipated damage to the area Less than a month later in early October the much smaller Hurricane Nate was forecast to pass rapidly through northwest Georgia as a weak tropical storm expected to cause far fewer issues to the metro area than Irma These two storms caused the first tropical storm watches and for Irma warnings for the area since these were allowed to be issued for inland locations instead of just coastal ones br br br Tornadoes br Since some metro counties have been hit more than times by tornadoes with Cobb and Fulton being two of the highest in the state Note that some tornadoes may have occurred at the same time or in two different counties Another struck the Georgia Governor s Mansion in The Dunwoody tornado in early April was the worst tornado to have struck the suburban area Since then many counties have reinstalled civil defense sirens removed after the Cold War br On March an EF tornado hit downtown Atlanta with winds up to mph km h The tornado caused damage to Philips Arena the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel the Georgia Dome Centennial Olympic Park the CNN Center and the Georgia World Congress Center It also damaged the nearby neighborhoods of Vine City to the west and Cabbagetown and Fulton Bag and Cotton Mills to the east While there were dozens of injuries only one fatality was reported City officials warned it could take months to clear the devastation left by the tornado br br br Winter storms br The area experiences a winter storm with significant snowfall about once each year however this can be extremely irregular During the s only four major snows occurred December January January and March while three occurred in early an El Ni o year alone making it the snowiest winter since the s Despite predictions of a warm and dry winter due to La Ni a developing the following summer additional inches cm fell on December giving the city and its northern and western suburbs its first true white Christmas in over a century The only other measurable snows on that date were inches cm in and inches cm in A trace last fell on Christmas in and a dozen other years before that br A blizzard see Storm of the Century caught much of the Southeast off guard in dumping inches cm at the Atlanta airport on March and much more than that in the suburbs to the north and west as well as in the mountains Dallas a suburb about miles or kilometres to the west northwest received inches cm from the storm Some people were awakened by thunder and lightning in a very rare thundersnow event Several areas of northern Cobb County recorded over inches cm in snowdrifts It is widely regarded as the snow event of the century for Atlanta and is referred to as the Storm of the Century placing fifth in the city s snowfall records The only other recorded winter storm of comparable severity was the Great Blizzard of which struck in February A blizzard hit on January crippling the city and leaving schools out for the whole week Ice covered roads and over eight inches of snow fell in some places with over a foot in the far northern metropolitan area br The heaviest snow however was on January when inches cm buried the city during its second coldest month on record The second heaviest was in when a very late storm dumped inches cm on March The latest snow and freeze ever were in when inches cm and F C were recorded on April Since the earliest measurable snows were November and followed in by inches cm on the th the day before the second coldest Thanksgiving on record br Prior to March the most recent major snow occurred at the beginning of when up to inches cm fell on January As of the stretch of five nearly or entirely snowless winters made for an extremely long period compared to average This streak was ended in January when inches cm fell on January and inch cm fell three days later The following year the first widespread winter storm since dumped inches cm on March with the heaviest to the southwest and east northeast and surprisingly little or nothing in the far northern suburbs and mountains Much of it melted almost as fast as it was accumulating at mid day while eastern areas had thundersnow and cloud to ground strikes reported by lightning detection it was an upper level low from the Great Plains while most major storms in the area occur with a typical surface low pressure area traveling along the Gulf coast The snow tied with the blizzard and another storm for fifth heaviest official daily snow in the city s recorded weather history br Areas to the due east and west often receive more snow than metro Atlanta because the energy begins to transfer to a coastal low in the Atlantic on its way to becoming a nor easter Also the mountains to the northwest entrap shallow cold air Average annual snowfall from to in Atlanta is inches cm the snowiest month is January with inches cm Due to two record breaking heavy storms during the averaged period it is actually March that is statistically second with inches cm cut in half if the heaviest storm is removed This is followed by February with inches cm and December with inches cm then November April and October averaging a trace each The latest was April when inches cm fell in also the heaviest for the month and the latest ever freeze Four other April snows have been recorded since the most recent significant one being April Flurries occurred in on the afternoon of Halloween marking only the third recorded October snow all of which were an unmeasurable trace br Although December is just as cold as February and has more days it receives the least snow of any winter month roughly once per decade due to less overall precipitation in the later months of the year compared to the rainier mid and late winter However the lowest sun and shortest days of the year mean that what does fall can stay around for days A mid December snow a record inches cm for the month was followed by very cold weather that left spots of it on the ground in shady areas until Christmas Following the snow the next December event was in when the heaviest snows since the March blizzard hit the northwestern suburbs and west northwestern exurbs Paulding northwest Cobb and southeast Bartow counties were hit with up to inches cm of very heavy and wet snow due to the temperature being slightly above freezing for much of the event The very high water content and lack of any wind in turn caused widespread power outages as major accumulations brought down power lines leaving some without electricity for days This was the earliest in the season that the metro area is known to have received so much snow though long term official records are only kept at Atlanta proper br Ice storms have also occurred in the area Two hit the city a week apart in January the second one while Atlanta was hosting Super Bowl XXXIV which was felt to affect the city s future chances for hosting it again The well remembered January ice storm was brutal and was followed in February by the record breaking Southeast U S snowstorm that hit the coastal half of the state bringing light snow to what were then the far southeastern suburbs A January snowstorm which came to be called Snow Jam by the media and those who lived through it also crippled the city just as bad as ice can striking in the afternoon while everyone was at work several hours earlier than expected Tens of thousands of people were stranded in the city abandoning cars on every road and freeway and booking hotels to capacity unable to get home to the suburbs br Despite this well known experience the same thing happened in January when snow expected to hit mainly middle Georgia in the afternoon crept northward at midday the resulting road ice stranding children in schools and even on school buses overnight while people slept in makeshift shelters such as Home Depot Kroger and CVS stores and in fire stations and even in their vehicles Commutes that normally take minutes instead took several hours or even until the next day with average speeds near zero and many vehicles running out of gasoline Several people simply walked to their destination while Georgia National Guard troops were called to join HERO units along with the Georgia State Patrol and local police in checking on stuck and abandoned cars While only inches cm fell on the afternoon of the th and many issues from the snow then ice storm had been addressed the sudden rush of traffic between noon and pm rapidly created massive gridlock and prevented snow removal and deicing equipment from going anywhere GDOT equipment that had been dispatched to areas further down state based on early forecasts also lessened the response as they could not get back north to their regular districts in time Officials tried to blame the National Weather Service but this was refuted by The Weather Channel CNN and local TV stations which showed that winter storm warnings were extended up to the northern suburbs more than two hours before most school systems needed to decide on whether to cancel school for the day and even the prior winter weather advisory should have been enough to cause these cancellations br br br Drought br The driest year in Atlanta history was inches of rain with being a close second The Southeastern U S drought of began with dry weather in and left area lakes very low Most of the area s drinking water is stored in Lake Lanier and Lake Allatoona which reached record low levels in December Up through September was the driest year on record in over years second only to and On September the state issued a total outdoor watering ban for the north and northwestern or so of the state affecting counties generally north of the Fall Line Some local authorities and water systems had already taken such measures It was the first time the state had enacted such a ban Throughout the year drought the Atlanta area occasionally experienced smoke from the wildfires in south Georgia causing the local air to become dangerous for everyone The severe record drought which affected the region starting in late finally began to abate significantly after heavy fall rains in br br br Flooding br The historic drought ended with historic flooding in The Atlanta floods affected the entire area on September with parts of eastern Paulding northern Douglas and southwestern Cobb counties getting around inches mm of rain in a week with half of that falling in just hours near the end of the period Douglasville received the most rain in hours than any other city in metro Atlanta the city received over inches of rain on Sept The USGS calculated it to be a greater than year flood the National Weather Service stated that chances of that much rain anywhere in the region are in years Some freeways closed temporarily and several small bridges and culverts were ruined and will take months to replace Many homes in the area were completely destroyed Occasional heavy rains and flood advisories continued through early February br Flood events are localized from nearly stationary thunderstorms or more broadly impacting from slow moving tropical storm remnants or sometimes from unusually heavy and persistent winter rains during El Ni o years Other droughts have also ended in lesser floods including in The flooding has also ended as of br br br Environmental issues br br In the American Lung Association ranked Atlanta as having the th highest level of particle pollution in the United States The combination of pollution and pollen levels and uninsured citizens caused the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America to name Atlanta as the worst American city for asthma sufferers to live in However in all counties in the Atlanta metro area began requiring yearly emissions testing for all motor vehicles with the exception of antique cars and the three most recent model years br Bright spots include projects that encourage smart growth such as the BeltLine and Atlantic Station mixed use development which the Environmental Protection Agency commended in In Atlanta s Virginia Highland became the first carbon neutral zone in the United States There neighborhood merchants through the Chicago Climate Exchange directly fund the Valley Wood Carbon Sequestration Project thousands of acres of forest in rural Georgia br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Atlanta City Limits
