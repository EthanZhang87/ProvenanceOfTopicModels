The K ppen climate classification is one of the most widely used climate classification systems It was first published by German Russian climatologist Wladimir K ppen in with several later modifications by K ppen notably in and Later German climatologist Rudolf Geiger introduced some changes to the classification system in and which is thus sometimes called the K ppen Geiger climate classification br The K ppen climate classification divides climates into five main climate groups with each group being divided based on patterns of seasonal precipitation and temperature The five main groups are A tropical B arid C temperate D continental and E polar Each group and subgroup is represented by a letter All climates are assigned a main group the first letter All climates except for those in the E group are assigned a seasonal precipitation subgroup the second letter For example Af indicates a tropical rainforest climate The system assigns a temperature subgroup for all groups other than those in the A group indicated by the third letter for climates in B C D and the second letter for climates in E For example Cfb indicates an oceanic climate with warm summers as indicated by the ending b Climates are classified based on specific criteria unique to each climate type br As K ppen designed the system based on his experience as a botanist his main climate groups are based on the types of vegetation occurring in a given climate classification region In addition to identifying climates the system can be used to analyze ecosystem conditions and identify the main types of vegetation within climates Due to its association with the plant life of a given region the system is useful in predicting future changes of plant life within that region br The K ppen climate classification system was modified further within the Trewartha climate classification system in revised in The Trewartha system sought to create a more refined middle latitude climate zone which was one of the criticisms of the K ppen system the climate group C was too general br br br Overview br br The K ppen climate classification scheme divides climates into five main climate groups A tropical B arid C temperate D continental and E polar The second letter indicates the seasonal precipitation type while the third letter indicates the level of heat Summers are defined as the six month period that is warmer either from April to September and or October to March while winter is the six month period that is cooler br br br Group A Tropical climates br Tropical climates have an average temperature of C F or higher every month of the year with significant precipitation br br Af Tropical rainforest climate average precipitation of at least mm in in every month br Am Tropical

climates are characterized by constant high temperatures at sea level and low elevations all months of the year have average temperatures of C F or higher and generally high annual precipitation They are subdivided as follows br br br Af Tropical rainforest climate br br All months have an average precipitation of at least mm in These climates usually occur within latitude of the equator This climate has no natural seasons in terms of thermal and moisture changes When it is dominated most of the year by the doldrums low pressure system due to the presence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone ITCZ and when there are no cyclones then the climate is qualified as equatorial When the trade winds dominate most of the year the climate is a tropical trade wind rainforest climate br Examples br br Some of the places with this climate are indeed uniformly and monotonously wet throughout the year e g the northwest Pacific coast of South and Central America from Ecuador to Costa Rica see for instance Andagoya Colombia but in many cases the period of higher sun and longer days is distinctly wettest as at Palembang Indonesia or the time of lower sun and shorter days may have more rain as at Sitiawan Malaysia Among these places some have a pure equatorial climate Balikpapan Kuala Lumpur Kuching Lae Medan Paramaribo Pontianak and Singapore with the dominant ITCZ aerological mechanism and no cyclones or a subequatorial climate with occasional hurricanes Davao Ratnapura Victoria br Note The term aseasonal refers to the lack in the tropical zone of large differences in daylight hours and mean monthly or daily temperature throughout the year Annual cyclic changes occur in the tropics but not as predictably as those in the temperate zone albeit unrelated to temperature but to water availability whether as rain mist soil or groundwater Plant response e g phenology animal feeding migration reproduction etc and human activities plant sowing harvesting hunting fishing etc are tuned to this seasonality Indeed in tropical South America and Central America the rainy season and the high water season is called invierno Spanish or inverno Portuguese though it could occur in the Northern Hemisphere summer likewise the dry season and low water season is called verano or ver o and can occur in the Northern Hemisphere winter br br br Am Tropical monsoon climate br br This type of climate results from the monsoon winds which change direction according to the seasons This climate has a driest month which nearly always occurs at or soon after the winter solstice for that side

Colombia Panam border to the Orinoco River delta on the Atlantic Ocean about km have long dry periods the extreme is the BSh climate see below characterized by very low unreliable precipitation present for instance in extensive areas in the Guajira and Coro western Venezuela the northernmost peninsulas in South America which receive mm total annual precipitation practically all in two or three months br This condition extends to the Lesser Antilles and Greater Antilles forming the circum Caribbean dry belt The length and severity of the dry season diminish inland southward at the latitude of the Amazon River which flows eastward just south of the equatorial line the climate is Af East from the Andes between the dry arid Caribbean and the ever wet Amazon are the Orinoco River s Llanos or savannas from where this climate takes its name br br br As Tropical savanna climate with dry summers br Sometimes As is used in place of Aw if the dry season occurs during the time of higher sun and longer days during summer This is the case in parts of Hawaii northwestern Dominican Republic East Africa southeast India and northeast Sri Lanka and the Brazilian Northeastern Coast In places that have this climate type the dry season occurs during the time of lower sun and shorter days generally because of rain shadow effects during the high sun part of the year br Examples br br br Group B Arid desert and semi arid climates br br These climates are characterized by the amount of annual precipitation less than a threshold value that approximates the potential evapotranspiration The threshold value in millimeters is calculated as follows br br Multiply the average annual temperature in C by then add br According to the modified K ppen classification system used by modern climatologists total precipitation in the warmest six months of the year is taken as a reference instead of the total precipitation in the high sun half of the year br If the annual precipitation is less than of this threshold the classification is BW arid desert climate if it is in the range of of the threshold the classification is BS semi arid steppe climate br A third letter can be included to indicate temperature Here h signifies low latitude climate average annual temperature above C while k signified middle latitude climate average annual temperature below C br Desert areas situated along the west coasts of continents at tropical or near tropical locations characterized by frequent fog and low clouds although these places rank among the driest on earth in terms of actual precipitation received can be labeled BWn with the n denoting a climate characterized by frequent fog An equivalent BSn category can be found in foggy coastal steppes br br br BW Arid climates br br br BWh Hot deserts br br br BWk Cold deserts br br br BS Semi arid steppe climates br br br BSh Hot semi arid br br br BSk Cold semi arid br br br Group C Temperate mesothermal climates br br In the K ppen climate system temperate climates are defined as having an average temperature above C F or C F as noted previously in their coldest month but below C F The average temperature of C F roughly coincides with the equatorward limit of frozen ground and snow cover lasting for a month or more br The second letter indicates the precipitation pattern w indicates dry winters driest winter month average precipitation less than one tenth wettest summer month average precipitation s indicates at least three times as much rain in the wettest month of winter as in the driest month of summer f means significant precipitation in all seasons neither above mentioned set of conditions fulfilled br The third letter indicates the degree of summer heat a indicates warmest month average temperature above C F while b indicates warmest month averaging below C but with at least four months averaging above C F and c indicates one to three months averaging above C F br br br Cs Mediterranean type climates br br br Csa Hot summer Mediterranean climates br These climates usually occur on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of and These climates are in the polar front region in winter and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable rainy weather Summers are hot and dry due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems except in the immediate coastal areas where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring fog but prevent rain br Examples br br br Csb Warm summer Mediterranean climates br Dry summer climates sometimes extend to additional areas where the warmest month average temperatures do not reach C F These climates are classified as Csb br Examples br br br Csc Cold summer Mediterranean climates br Cold summer Mediterranean climates Csc exist in high elevation areas adjacent to coastal Csb climate areas where the strong maritime influence prevents the average winter monthly temperature from dropping below C This climate is rare and is predominantly found in climate fringes and isolated areas of the Cascades and Andes Mountains as the dry summer climate extends further poleward in the Americas than elsewhere Rare instances of this climate can be found in some coastal locations in the North Atlantic and at high altitudes in Hawaii br Examples br br br Cfa Humid subtropical climates br br These climates usually occur on the eastern coasts and eastern sides of continents usually in the high s and s latitudes Unlike the dry summer Mediterranean climates humid subtropical climates have a warm and wet flow from the tropics that creates warm and moist conditions in the summer months As such summer not winter as is the case in Mediterranean climates is often the wettest season br The flow out of the subtropical highs and the summer monsoon creates a southerly flow from the tropics that brings warm and moist air to the lower east sides of continents This flow is often what brings the frequent and strong but short lived summer thundershowers so typical of the more southerly subtropical climates like the southeast United States southern China and Japan br Examples br br br Cfb Oceanic climates br br br Marine west coast climate br Cfb climates usually occur in the higher middle latitudes on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of and they are typically situated immediately poleward of the Mediterranean climates However in southeast Australia southeast South America and extreme southern Africa this climate is found immediately poleward of temperate climates on places near the coast and at a somewhat lower latitude In western Europe this climate occurs in coastal areas up to N in Norway br These climates are dominated all year round by the polar front leading to changeable often overcast weather Summers are mild due to cool ocean currents Winters are milder than other climates in similar latitudes but usually very cloudy and frequently wet Cfb climates are also encountered at high elevations in certain subtropical and tropical areas where the climate would be that of a subtropical tropical rainforest if not for the altitude These climates are called highlands br Examples br br br Subtropical highland climate with uniform rainfall br br Subtropical highland climates with uniform rainfall Cfb are a type of oceanic climate mainly found in the highlands of Australia such as in or around the Great Dividing Range in the north of the state of New South Wales and also sparsely in other continents such as in South America among others Unlike a typical Cwb climate they tend to have rainfall spread evenly throughout the year They have characteristics of both the Cfb and Cfa climates but unlike these climates they have a high diurnal temperature variation and low humidity owing to their inland location and relatively high elevation br Examples br br br Cfc Subpolar oceanic climate br Subpolar oceanic climates Cfc occur poleward of or at higher elevations than the maritime temperate climates and are mostly confined either to narrow coastal strips on the western poleward margins of the continents or especially in the Northern Hemisphere to islands off such coasts They occur in both hemispheres most often at latitudes from north and south to north and south br Examples br br br Cw Dry winter subtropical climates br br br Cwa Dry winter humid subtropical climate br Main entry Subtropical monsoon climate br Cwa is a monsoonal influenced version of the humid subtropical climate having the classic dry winter wet summer pattern associated with tropical monsoonal climates They are found at similar latitudes as the Cfa climates except in regions where monsoons are more prevalent These regions are in the Southern Cone of South America the Gangetic Plain of South Asia southeastern Africa and parts of East Asia and Mexico br Examples br br br Cwb Dry winter subtropical highland climate br Dry winter subtropical highland climate Cwb is a type of climate mainly found in highlands inside the tropics of Central America South America Africa and South and Southeast Asia or areas in the subtropics Winters are noticeable and dry and summers can be very rainy In the tropics the monsoon is provoked by the tropical air masses and the dry winters by subtropical high pressure br Examples br br br Cwc Dry winter cold subtropical highland climate br Dry winter cold subtropical highland climates Cwc exist in high elevation areas adjacent to Cwb climates This climate is rare and is found mainly in isolated locations mostly in the Andes in Bolivia and Peru as well as in sparse mountain locations in Southeast Asia br br br Group D Continental microthermal climates br br These climates have an average temperature above C F in their warmest months and the coldest month average below C or C F as noted previously These usually occur in the interiors of continents and on their upper east coasts normally north of N In the Southern Hemisphere group D climates are extremely rare due to the smaller land masses in the middle latitudes and the almost complete absence of land at S existing only in some highland locations br br br Dfa Dwa Dsa Hot summer humid continental climates br br Dfa climates usually occur in the high s and low s latitudes with a qualifying average temperature in the warmest month of greater than C F In Europe these climates tend to be much drier than in North America Dsa exists at higher elevations adjacent to areas with hot summer Mediterranean Csa climates br These climates exist only in the northern hemisphere because the southern hemisphere has no large landmasses isolated from the moderating effects of the sea within the middle latitudes br Examples br br In eastern Asia Dwa climates extend further south into the mid s latitudes due to the influence of the Siberian high pressure system which also causes winters there to be dry and summers can be very wet because of monsoon circulation br Examples br br Dsa exists only at higher elevations adjacent to areas with hot summer Mediterranean Csa climates br Examples br br br Dfb Dwb Dsb Warm summer humid continental hemiboreal climates br br Dfb climates are immediately poleward of hot summer continental climates generally in the high s and low s latitudes in North America and Asia and also extending to higher latitudes in central and eastern Europe and Russia between the maritime temperate and continental subarctic climates where it extends up to degrees latitude in places br Examples br br Like with all Group D climates Dwb climates mostly only occur in the northern hemisphere br Examples br br Dsb arises from the same scenario as Dsa but at even higher altitudes or latitudes and chiefly in North America since the Mediterranean climates extend further poleward than in Eurasia br Examples br br br Dfc Dwc Dsc Subarctic boreal climates br br Dfc Dsc and Dwc climates occur poleward of the other group D climates or at higher altitudes generally in the s and s latitudes br Examples br br br Dfd Dwd Dsd Subarctic boreal climates with severe winters br Places with this climate have severe winters with the temperature in their coldest month lower than C These climates occur only in eastern Siberia The names of some of the places with this climate have become veritable synonyms for the extreme severe winter cold br Examples br br br Group E Polar climates br br In the K ppen climate system polar climates are defined as the warmest temperature of any month being below C F Polar climates are further divided into two types tundra climates and icecap climates br br br ET Tundra climate br Tundra climate ET warmest month has an average temperature between and C These climates occur on the northern edges of the North American and Eurasian land masses generally north of N although they may be found farther south depending on local conditions and on nearby islands ET climates are also found on some islands near the Antarctic Convergence and at high elevations outside the polar regions above the tree line br Examples br br br EF Ice cap climate br Ice cap climate EF this climate is dominant in Antarctica inner Greenland and summits of many high mountains even at lower latitudes Monthly average temperatures never exceed C F br Examples br br br Ecological significance br br br Biomass br The K ppen climate classification is based on the empirical relationship between climate and vegetation This classification provides an efficient way to describe climatic conditions defined by temperature and precipitation and their seasonality with a single metric Because climatic conditions identified by the K ppen classification are ecologically relevant it has been widely used to map the geographic distribution of long term climate and associated ecosystem conditions br br br Climate change br Over recent years there has been an increasing interest in using the classification to identify changes in climate and potential changes in vegetation over time The most important ecological significance of the K ppen climate classification is that it helps to predict the dominant vegetation type based on the climatic data and vice versa br In a Nanjing University paper published in Scientific Reports analyzing climate classifications found that between and approximately of all land area worldwide had moved from wetter and colder classifications to drier and hotter classifications The authors also found that the change cannot be explained as natural variations but are driven by anthropogenic factors br A study provides detailed maps for present and future K ppen Geiger climate classification
