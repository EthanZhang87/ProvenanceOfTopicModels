newspaper columns By the mid s Rogers was hugely popular in the United States for his leading political wit and was the highest paid of Hollywood film stars He died in with aviator Wiley Post when their small airplane crashed in northern Alaska br Rogers began his career as a performer on vaudeville His rope act led to success in the Ziegfeld Follies which in turn led to the first of his many movie contracts His s syndicated newspaper column and his radio appearances increased his visibility and popularity Rogers crusaded for aviation expansion and provided Americans with first hand accounts of his world travels His earthy anecdotes and folksy style allowed him to poke fun at gangsters prohibition politicians government programs and a host of other controversial topics in a way that found general acclaim from a national audience with no one offended His aphorisms couched in humorous terms were widely quoted for example I am not a member of an organized political party I am a Democrat br br One of Rogers s most famous sayings was I never met a man I didn t like and he even provided an epigram on this famous epigram br br When I die my epitaph or whatever you call those signs on gravestones is going to read I joked about every prominent man of my time but I never met a man I dident sic like I am so proud of that I can hardly wait to die so it can be carved br br br Early years br br Rogers was born on his parents Dog Iron Ranch in the Cherokee Nation of Indian Territory near present day Oologah Oklahoma now in Rogers County named in honor of his father Clement V Rogers The house in which he was born had been built in and was known as the White House on the Verdigris River His parents Clement V Clem Rogers and Mary America Schrimsher were both mixed race with Cherokee ancestry and considered themselves Cherokee Rogers quipped that his ancestors did not come over on the Mayflower but they met the boat His mother was one quarter Cherokee and born into the Paint Clan br Unlike his father Clement s people Mary s Cherokee relatives had been expelled from Georgia under the Indian Removal Act of in an exodus known as The Trail of Tears Of the Cherokees driven to Indian Territory later Oklahoma perished en route She died of amoebic dysentery when Will was years of age His father remarried almost three years after her death br Rogers was the youngest of eight children He was named for the Cherokee leader Colonel William Penn Adair Only three of his siblings sisters Sallie Clementine Maude Ethel and Mary May survived into adulthood br His mother Mary Schrimsher was a sister of Martha Schrimsher Gulager the paternal grandmother of Clu Gulager making Rogers and Gulager first cousins once removed br His father Clement was a leader in the Cherokee Nation An attorney and Cherokee judge Clement owned two slaves he had acquired from his father and was a Confederate combat veteran of the American Civil War He was promoted to regimental captain under Confederate colonel later Brigadier General Stand Watie and fought at the Battle of Pea Ridge br Clement served as a delegate to the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention Rogers County Oklahoma is named in honor of him He served several terms in the Cherokee Senate br Roach presents a sociological psychological assessment of the relationship between Will and his father during the formative boyhood and teenage years Clement had high expectations for his son and wanted him to be more responsible and business minded Will was more easygoing and oriented toward the loving affection offered by his mother Mary rather than the harshness of his father The personality clash increased after his mother s death when the boy was ten Young Will went from one venture to another with little success Only after Will won acclaim in vaudeville did the rift begin to heal Clement s death in precluded a full reconciliation br Will Rogers attended school in Indian Territory at the Willie Halsell College at Vinita in and and then the Kemper Military School at Boonville over the year He was a good student and an avid reader of The New York Times but he dropped out of school after the th grade Rogers later said that he was a poor student saying that he studied the Fourth Reader for ten years He was much more interested in cowboys and horses and learned to rope and use a lariat br br br First jobs br In Rogers appeared in the St Louis Fair as part of the Mulhall Rodeo Near the end of when he was years old he and a friend Dick Parris left home hoping to work as gauchos in Argentina They arrived in Argentina in May and spent five months trying to make it as ranch owners in the Pampas Rogers and his partner lost all their money and he later said I was ashamed to send home for more The two friends separated and Rogers sailed for South Africa It is often claimed he took a job breaking in horses for the British Army but the Boer War had ended three months earlier Rogers was hired at James Piccione s ranch near Mooi River Station in the Pietermaritzburg district of Natal br br br Career br Rogers began his show business career as a trick roper in Texas Jack s Wild West Circus in South Africa br br He Texas Jack had a little Wild West aggregation that visited the camps and did a tremendous business I did some roping and riding and Jack who was one of the smartest showmen I ever knew took a great interest in me It was he who gave me the idea for my original stage act with my pony I learned a lot about the show business from him He could do a bum act with a rope that an ordinary man couldn t get away with and make the audience think it was great so I used to study him by the hour and from him I learned the great secret of the show business knowing when to get off It s the fellow who knows when to quit that the audience wants more of br Grateful for the guidance but anxious to move on Rogers quit the circus and went to Australia Texas Jack gave him a reference letter for the Wirth Brothers Circus there and Rogers continued to perform as a rider and trick roper and worked on his pony act He returned to the United States in appeared at the Saint Louis World s Fair and began to try his roping skills on the vaudeville circuits br br br Vaudeville br br On a trip to New York City Rogers was at Madison Square Garden on April when a wild steer broke out of the arena and began to climb into the viewing stands Rogers roped the steer to the delight of the crowd The feat got front page attention from the newspapers giving him valuable publicity and an audience eager to see more Willie Hammerstein saw his vaudeville act and signed Rogers to appear on the Victoria Roof which was literally on a rooftop with his pony For the next decade Rogers estimated he worked for weeks a year at the Roof and at the city s myriad vaudeville theaters br Rogers later recalled these early years br br I got a job on Hammerstein s Roof at a week for myself my horse and the man who looked after it I remained on the roof for eight weeks always getting another two week extension when Willie Hammerstein would say to me after the Monday matinee you re good for two weeks more Marty Shea the booking agent for the Columbia came to me and asked if I wanted to play burlesque They could use an extra attraction I told him I would think about it but Burlesque sounded to me then as something funny Shea and Sam A Scribner the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company approached Rogers a few days later Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting and would take What s he carrying Scribner asked Shea Himself a horse and a man answered Shea Scribner replied Give him eight weeks at br In the fall of Rogers began to appear in Florenz Ziegfeld s Midnight Frolic The variety revue began at midnight in the top floor night club of Ziegfeld s New Amsterdam Theatre and drew many influential and regular customers By this time Rogers had refined his act His monologues on the news of the day followed a similar routine every night He appeared on stage in his cowboy outfit nonchalantly twirling his lasso and said Well what shall I talk about I ain t got anything funny to say All I know is what I read in the papers He would make jokes about what he had read in that day s newspapers The line All I know is what I read in the papers is often incorrectly described as Rogers s most famous punch line when it was his opening line br His run at the New Amsterdam ran into and Rogers s growing popularity led to an engagement on the more famous Ziegfeld Follies At this stage Rogers s act was strictly physical a silent display of daring riding and clever tricks with his lariat He discovered that audiences identified the cowboy as the archetypical American doubtless aided by Theodore Roosevelt s image as a cowboy Rogers s cowboy was an unfettered man free of institutional restraints with no bureaucrats to order his life When he came back to the United States and worked in Wild West shows he slowly began adding the occasional spoken ad lib such as Swingin a rope s all right if your neck ain t in it Audiences responded to his laconic but pointed humor and were just as fascinated by his frontier Oklahoma twang By Rogers was a featured star in Ziegfeld s Follies on Broadway as he moved into satire by transforming the Ropin Fool to the Talkin Fool At one performance with President Woodrow Wilson in the audience Rogers improvised a roast of presidential policies that had Wilson and the entire audience in stitches and proved his remarkable skill at off the cuff witty commentary on current events He built the rest of his career around that skill br A editorial in The New York Times said that Will Rogers in the Follies is carrying on the tradition of Aristophanes and not unworthily Rogers branched into silent films too for Samuel Goldwyn s company Goldwyn Pictures He made his first silent movie Laughing Bill Hyde which was filmed in Fort Lee New Jersey Many early films were filmed and produced in the New York area in those years Rogers could make a film yet easily still rehearse and perform in the Follies He eventually appeared in most of the Follies from to br br br Films br Hollywood discovered Rogers in as Samuel Goldwyn gave him the title role in Laughing Bill Hyde br A three year contract with Goldwyn at triple the Broadway salary moved Rogers west He bought a ranch in Pacific Palisades and set up his own production company While Rogers enjoyed film acting his appearances in silent movies suffered from the obvious restrictions of silence as he had gained his fame as a commentator on stage He wrote many of the title cards appearing in his films In he began a one year stint for Hal Roach and made pictures Among the films he made for Roach in were three directed by Rob Wagner Two Wagons Both Covered Going to Congress and Our Congressman He made two other feature silents and a travelogue series in After that he did not return to the screen until beginning work in the talkies in br Rogers made silent movies but with the arrival of sound in he became a top star in that medium His first sound film They Had to See Paris gave him the chance to exercise his verbal wit br He played a homespun farmer State Fair in an old fashioned doctor Dr Bull in a small town banker David Harum in and a rustic politician Judge Priest in He was also in County Chairman Steamboat Round the Bend and In Old Kentucky His favorite director was John Ford br Rogers appeared in feature films alongside such noted performers as Lew Ayres Billie Burke Richard Cromwell Jane Darwell Andy Devine Janet Gaynor Rochelle Hudson Boris Karloff Myrna Loy Joel McCrea Hattie McDaniel Ray Milland Maureen O Sullivan ZaSu Pitts Dick Powell Bill Bojangles Robinson Mickey Rooney and Peggy Wood He was directed three times by John Ford He appeared in four films with his friend Stepin Fetchit aka Lincoln T Perry David Harum Judge Priest Steamboat Round the Bend and The County Chairman br With his voice becoming increasingly familiar to audiences Rogers essentially played himself in each film without film makeup managing to ad lib and sometimes work in his familiar commentaries on politics The clean moral tone of his films resulted in various public schools taking their classes to attend special showings during the school day His most unusual role may have been in the first talking version of Mark Twain s novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur s Court His popularity soared to new heights with films including Young As You Feel Judge Priest and Life Begins at with Richard Cromwell and Rochelle Hudson br br br Newspapers and magazines br Rogers was an indefatigable worker He toured the lecture circuit The New York Times syndicated his weekly newspaper column from to Going daily in his short column Will Rogers Says reached million newspaper readers He also wrote frequently for the mass circulation upscale magazine The Saturday Evening Post Rogers advised Americans to embrace the frontier values of neighborliness and democracy on the domestic front while remaining clear of foreign entanglements He took a strong highly popular stand in favor of aviation including a military air force of the sort his flying buddy General Billy Mitchell advocated br Rogers began a weekly column titled Slipping the Lariat Over at the end of He had already published a book of wisecracks and had begun a steady stream of humor books Through the columns for the McNaught Syndicate between and as well as his personal appearances and radio broadcasts he won the loving admiration of the American people poking jibes in witty ways at the issues of the day and prominent people often politicians He wrote from a nonpartisan point of view and became a friend of presidents and a confidant of the great Loved for his cool mind and warm heart he was often considered the successor to such greats as Artemus Ward and Mark Twain Rogers was not the first entertainer to use political humor before his audience Others such as Broadway comedian Raymond Hitchcock and Britain s Sir Harry Lauder preceded him by several years Bob Hope is the best known political humorist to follow Rogers s example br br br Radio br Radio was the exciting new medium and Rogers became a star there as well broadcasting his newspaper pieces From to he made radio broadcasts for the Gulf Oil Company This weekly Sunday evening show The Gulf Headliners ranked among the top radio programs in the country Since Rogers easily rambled from one subject to another reacting to his studio audience he often lost track of the half hour time limit in his earliest broadcasts and was cut off in mid sentence To correct this he brought in a wind up alarm clock and its on air buzzing alerted him to begin wrapping up his comments By his show was being announced as Will Rogers and his Famous Alarm Clock br br br Personal life br br In Rogers married Betty Blake and the couple had four children Will Rogers Jr Mary Amelia James Blake and Fred Stone Will Jr became a World War II hero played his father in two films and was elected to Congress Mary became a Broadway actress and James Jim was a newspaperman and rancher Fred died of diphtheria at age two The family lived in New York but they spent summers in Oklahoma In Rogers bought a acre ha ranch near Claremore Oklahoma which he intended to use as his retirement home He paid US an acre equal to per acre today br From about to Rogers traveled the length and breadth of the United States in a lecture tour He began his lectures by pointing out that A humorist entertains and a lecturer annoys During this time he became the first civilian to fly from coast to coast with pilots flying the mail in early air mail flights The National Press Club dubbed him Ambassador at Large of the United States He visited Mexico City along with Charles Lindbergh as a guest of U S Ambassador Dwight Morrow Rogers gave numerous after dinner speeches became a popular convention speaker and gave dozens of benefits for victims of floods droughts or earthquakes br Rogers traveled to Asia to perform in and to Central and South America the following year In he made a globe girdling tour and returned to play the lead in Eugene O Neill s stage play Ah Wilderness He had tentatively agreed to go on loan from Fox to MGM to star in the movie version of the play But concerned about a fan s reaction to the facts of life talk between his character and the latter s son he declined the role He and Wiley Post made plans to fly to Alaska that summer br br br Politics br br Rogers was a Democrat but has historically been known as apolitical He was friends with every president starting with Theodore Roosevelt and he notably supported Republican Calvin Coolidge over John W Davis in During the Republican Convention of while criticizing the party platform Rogers welcomed the nomination of Kaw citizen Charles Curtis as vice president although he felt the leadership had deliberately kept him from the presidency The Republican Party owed him something but I didn t think they would be so low down as to pay him that way Four years later when the Republican leadership attempted to remove the more conservative Curtis from the Hoover ticket Rogers defended him and took credit for keeping him on the ticket I saved my Injun Charley Curtis for vice presidency The rascals was just ready to stab him when we caught em br In Rogers supported Democrat Franklin D Roosevelt who was his favorite president and politician Although he supported Roosevelt s New Deal he could just as easily joke about it Lord the money we do spend on Government and it s not one bit better than the government we got for one third the money twenty years ago br Rogers served as a goodwill ambassador to Mexico and had a brief stint as mayor of Beverly Hills a largely ceremonial position that allowed Rogers to joke about do nothing politicians such as himself During the depths of the Great Depression angered by Washington s inability to feed the people he embarked on a cross country fundraising tour for the Red Cross br br br presidential campaign br Rogers thought all campaigning was bunk To prove the point he mounted a mock campaign in for the presidency His only vehicle was the pages of Life a weekly humor magazine The campaign was in large part an effort to boost circulation for the struggling magazine Rogers ran as the bunkless candidate of the Anti Bunk Party His campaign promise was that if elected he would resign Every week from Memorial Day through Election Day Rogers caricatured the farcical humors of grave campaign politics On election day he declared victory and resigned he did not actually receive any state electoral votes br br Asked what issues would motivate voters Prohibition What s on your hip is bound to be on your mind July br Asked if there should be presidential debates Yes Joint debate in any joint you name August br How about appeals to the common man Easy You can t make any commoner appeal than I can August br What does the farmer need Obvious He needs a punch in the jaw if he believes that either of the parties cares a damn about him after the election August br Can voters be fooled Darn tootin Of all the bunk handed out during a campaign the biggest one of all is to try and compliment the knowledge of the voter September br What about a candidate s image Ballyhoo I hope there is some sane people who will appreciate dignity and not showmanship in their choice for the presidency October br br What of ugly campaign rumors Don t worry The things they whisper aren t as bad as what they say out loud October br br br Philosophy and style br After Rogers gained recognition as a humorist philosopher in vaudeville he gained a national audience in acting and literary careers from to In these years Rogers increasingly expressed the views of the common man in America He downplayed academic credentials noting Everybody is ignorant only on different subjects Americans of all walks admired his individualism his appreciation for democratic ideas and his liberal philosophies on most issues Moreover Rogers extolled hard work in order to succeed and such expressions affirmed American theories about how to realize individual success Rogers symbolized the self made man the common man who believed in America in progress and in the American Dream of upward mobility His humor never offended even those who were the targets of it br In the s the United States was happy and prosperous in various ways leading to the nickname Roaring Twenties but it also suffered from rapid change and social tensions Some people were disenchanted by and alienated from the outside world Many common people believed that World War I had resulted in extensive and largely senseless carnage and they supported isolationism for the US According to scholar Peter Rollins Rogers appeared to be an anchor of stability his conventional home life and traditional moral code reminded people of a recent past His newspaper column which ran from to expressed his traditional morality and his belief that political problems were not as serious as they sounded In his films Rogers began by playing a simple cowboy his characters evolved to explore the meaning of innocence in ordinary life In his last movies Rogers explores a society fracturing into competing classes from economic pressures Throughout his career Rogers was a link to a better more comprehensible past br In the high circulation weekly magazine The Saturday Evening Post financed a European tour for Rogers in return for publication of his articles Rogers made whirlwind visits to numerous European capitals and met with both international figures and common people His articles reflected a fear that Europeans would go to war again He recommended isolationism for the United States He reasoned that for the moment American needs could best be served by concentrating on domestic questions and avoiding foreign entanglements He commented br br America has a unique record We never lost a war and we never won a conference in our lives I believe that we could without any degree of egotism single handed lick any nation in the world But we can t confer with Costa Rica and come home with our shirts on br Rogers was famous for his use of language He effectively used up to date slang and invented new words to fit his needs He also made frequent use of puns and terms which closely linked him to the cowboy tradition as well as speech patterns using a southern dialect br Brown argues that Rogers held up a magic mirror that reflected iconic American values Rogers was the archetypical American Democrat thanks to his knack of moving freely among all social classes his stance above political parties and his passion for fair play He represented the American Adam with his independence and self made record Rogers furthermore represented the American Prometheus through his commitment to utilitarian methods and his ever optimistic faith in future progress br br br Aviation and death br br Will Rogers became an advocate for the aviation industry after noticing advancements in Europe and befriending Charles Lindbergh the most famous American aviator of the era During his European trip Rogers witnessed the European advances in commercial air service and compared them to the almost nonexistent facilities in the United States Rogers newspaper columns frequently emphasized the safety record speed and convenience of this means of transportation and he helped shape public opinion on the subject br In the famed aviator Wiley Post an Oklahoman became interested in surveying a mail and passenger air route from the West Coast to Russia He attached a Lockheed Explorer wing to a Lockheed Orion fuselage fitting floats for landing in the lakes of Alaska and Siberia Rogers visited Post often at the airport in Burbank California while he was modifying the aircraft He asked Post to fly him through Alaska in search of new material for his newspaper column br After making a test flight in July Post and Rogers left Lake Washington in Renton Washington in the Lockheed Orion Explorer in early August and then made several stops in Alaska While Post piloted the aircraft Rogers wrote his columns on his typewriter Before they left Fairbanks they signed and mailed a burgee a distinguishing flag belonging to the South Coast Corinthian Yacht Club The signed burgee is on display at South Coast Corinthian Yacht Club in Marina del Rey California On August they left Fairbanks for Point Barrow br About miles southwest of Point Barrow having difficulty figuring their position due to bad weather they landed in a lagoon to ask directions On takeoff the engine failed at low altitude and the aircraft plunged into the lagoon shearing off the right wing and ended up inverted in the shallow water of the lagoon Both men died instantly Rogers was buried August in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale California it was a temporary interment He was re interred at the Will Rogers Memorial in Claremore Oklahoma in br Experts have studied the factors in the accident and still disagree about it Bobby H Johnson and R Stanley Mohler argued in a article that Post had ordered floats that did not reach Seattle in time for the planned trip He used a set that was designed for a larger type of plane making the already nose heavy hybrid aircraft even more nose heavy But Bryan and Frances Sterling maintain in their book Forgotten Eagle Wiley Post America s Heroic Aviation Pioneer that their research showed the floats were the correct type for the aircraft thereby suggesting another cause for the crash br br br Legacy br br In the town of Higgins Texas near a ranch where Rogers had worked in began an annual observance of Will Rogers Day in honor of the cowboy philosopher who remained a close friend of Frank Ewing the son of his old employer br Rogers was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton Ohio br br br Oklahoma honors br Before his death the

entrance a stakeout location for camera crews looking to catch House members during and after voting It is also a common background for reporters and lawmakers with staff often directing the media to be at the Will Rogers stakeout at a certain time According to some Capitol guides each U S president rubs the left shoe of the Rogers statue for good luck before entering the House Chamber to give the State of the Union address br A state appropriation paid for the work It was sculpted in clay by Jo Davidson He had been a close friend of Rogers Davidson had the work cast in bronze in Brussels Belgium It was dedicated on June before a crowd of more than people The Architect of the Capitol David Lynn said there had never been such a large ceremony or crowd in the Capitol br His birthplace at the Dog Iron Ranch is located two miles east of Oologah Oklahoma When the Verdigris River valley was flooded to create Oologah Lake as part of a major dam project the Rogers house was preserved by moving it about mile km to its present location overlooking the original site br The family tomb is at the Will Rogers Memorial Museum constructed in nearby Claremore on the site purchased by Rogers in for his retirement home On May Rogers s body was moved from a holding vault in Glendale California to the tomb After his wife Betty died later that year she was also interred there A casting of the
