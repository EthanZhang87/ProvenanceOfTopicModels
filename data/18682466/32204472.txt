familiar and a bit too reliant on slapstick the sitcom like Dog Days fails to improve upon previous installments and will likely appeal to few outside its target audience Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale the same grade as the two previous films br Abby West of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B and wrote Though often self centered and conniving Greg remains a likable kid and the movie entertains by pulling off over the top scenarios that set up digestible life lessons for youngsters OregonLive com praised Zachary Gordon s acting writing h is easy likeability and general relatability are perhaps two of the biggest keys to Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days br Matt Mueller of OnMilwaukee gave the film a negative review calling it manic forced predictable scatterbrained and often times unpleasant He criticized its overstuffed screenplay for being very attention deficit cramming in numerous wacky plot elements most of them solely existing for predictable jokes that were met in my screening with interminable silence He wrote that s ome of the storylines could ve made for decent movies on their own particularly the one where Greg joins the Boy Scouts but that they were only brought back when the screenplay needs another forced comic set piece or ill fated attempt at wringing unearned emotion He disliked Greg s behavior writing He s lazy and wildly selfish taking advantage of his friend s unbridled kindness His trip with the Jeffersons ends with Greg insulting the entire family and getting Robert arrested by the police Later in the film he runs up their bill sneaking into the country club What part of this behavior is charming The review concludes with Mueller writing In Dog Days lone earnest moment Rowley astutely explains that his parents disappointment is worse than their yelling In that case I m not angry that a movie like this can take the joys of childhood and make them so joyless and unpleasant I m disappointed br br br Accolades br br br Future br br br Standalone
