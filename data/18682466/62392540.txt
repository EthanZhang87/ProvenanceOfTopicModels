promote the book Kinney hosted a book tour called The Wrecking Ball Show as a follow up to the previous book promotion The Meltdown Show It lasted for days across multiple countries Italy Germany France Greece Bulgaria Spain and Portugal The show s activities were decided live through spinning a wheel activities included a dancing competition a tower building contest with foam blocks and a trivia challenge br Kinney used systematic inventive thinking to come up with jokes for the book He elaborated that it helps me generate ideas without having to rely on memories In it problem solving is based on templates If you can use those templates to harness your creativity then you can solve problems more quickly than you could another way Kinney described moments from the book in which a kitchen remodel leads to a larger construction project and a hot tub is lifted over the house as based on true experiences He concluded by describing Wrecking Ball as his best written book br On the subject of the high amount of illustrations in the novel Kinney stated that the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is closer to being long form comics rather than a graphic novel He described the latest Diary of a Wimpy Kid books as requiring many illustrations due to being more cinematic then criticized the earlier books for being sparse and minimalistic br br br Themes br Kinney has stated that the theme of the book is Greg letting go of his childhood home He found that the best way to open the book would be to have Greg clean out his closet and try to sell objects at a yard sale reflecting him letting go of his childhood possessions While discussing his overseas book tour Kinney wrote that he sees the series as a mirror He explains that the books are popular worldwide because childhood is universal and children around the world all deal with the same kinds of things br br br Reception br In its first week Wrecking Ball sold slightly less than copies As of February it has sold over
