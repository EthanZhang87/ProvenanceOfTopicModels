The Fox Broadcasting Company commonly known simply as Fox and stylized in all caps is an American commercial broadcast television network owned by the Fox Entertainment division of Fox Corporation headquartered at Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan Fox hosts additional offices at the Fox Network Center in Los Angeles and at the Fox Media Center in Tempe Arizona Launched as a competitor to the Big Three television networks ABC CBS and NBC on October Fox went on to become the most successful attempt at a fourth television network It is also known to push the boundaries of what could be shown on a broadcasting network as evident with shows like Married with Children The Simpsons Family Guy and That s Show It was also the highest rated free to air network in the demographic from to and to and was the most watched American television network in total viewership during the season br br Fox and its affiliated companies operate many entertainment channels in international markets but these do not necessarily air the same programming as the U S network Most viewers in Canada have access to at least one U S based Fox affiliate either over the air or through a pay television provider although Fox s National Football League broadcasts and most of its prime time programming are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations for pay television providers imposed by the Canadian Radio television and Telecommunications Commission CRTC to protect rights held by domestically based networks br Fox is named after the film studio that was originally called th Century Fox the network s corporate sibling prior to that studio s acquisition by The Walt Disney Company and indirectly after the producer William Fox who had founded one of the film studio s predecessors Fox Film before it was merged with th Century Pictures in Fox is a member of the North American Broadcasters Association and the National Association of Broadcasters br br br History br br br Origins br th Century Fox now th Century Studios had been involved in television production as early as the s producing several syndicated programs Following the demise of the DuMont Television Network in August after it became mired in severe financial problems the NTA Film Network was launched as a new fourth network th Century Fox would also produce original content for the NTA network The film network effort would fail after a few years but th Century Fox continued to dabble in television through its production arm TCF Television Productions producing series such as Perry Mason Batman and M A S H for the three major broadcast television networks ABC NBC and CBS br br br s Establishment of the network br br br Foundations br The Fox network s foundations were laid in March through News Corporation s million purchase of a interest in TCF Holdings the parent company of the th Century Fox film studio In May News Corporation a media company owned by Australian publishing magnate Rupert Murdoch that had mainly served as a newspaper publisher at the time of the TCF Holdings deal agreed to pay billion to acquire independent television stations in six major U S cities from the John Kluge run broadcasting company Metromedia WNEW TV in New York City WTTG in Washington D C KTTV in Los Angeles KRIV TV in Houston WFLD TV in Chicago and KRLD TV in Dallas A seventh station ABC affiliate WCVB TV in Boston was part of the original transaction but was spun off to the Hearst Broadcasting subsidiary of the Hearst Communications in a separate concurrent deal as part of a right of first refusal related to that station s sale to Metromedia Two years later News Corporation acquired WXNE TV in that market from the Christian Broadcasting Network and changed its call letters to WFXT br Radio personality Clarke Ingram suggested that the Fox network is a revival or at least a linear descendant of DuMont since Metromedia was founded when DuMont spun off its two remaining owned and operated stations WNEW TV then known as WABD and WTTG as DuMont Broadcasting it later changed its name to Metropolitan Broadcasting before becoming Metromedia Additionally the former base of DuMont s operations the DuMont Tele Centre in Manhattan eventually became the present day Fox Television Center br br br Beginning of the network br br In October th Century Fox announced its intentions to form a fourth television network that would compete with ABC CBS and NBC The plans were to use the combination of the Fox studios and the former Metromedia stations to both produce and distribute programming Organizational plans for the network were held off until the Metromedia acquisitions cleared regulatory hurdles Then in December Rupert Murdoch agreed to pay million to acquire the remaining equity in TCF Holdings from his original partner Marvin Davis The purchase of the Metromedia stations was approved by the Federal Communications Commission FCC in March the call letters of the New York City and Dallas outlets were subsequently changed respectively to WNYW and KDAF These first six stations then broadcasting to a combined reach of of the nation s households became known as the Fox Television Stations group With the sole exception of KDAF which was sold to Renaissance Broadcasting in at which time it became a charter affiliate of The WB all of the original owned and operated stations O Os are still part of the Fox network today Like the core O O group Fox s affiliate body initially consisted of independent stations a few of which had maintained affiliations with ABC NBC CBS or DuMont earlier in their existences The local charter affiliate was in most cases that market s top rated independent however Fox opted to affiliate with a second tier independent station in markets where a more established independent declined the affiliation such as Denver Phoenix and St Louis Largely because of both these factors Fox in a situation very similar to what DuMont had experienced four decades before had little choice but to affiliate with UHF stations in all except a few mainly larger markets where the network gained clearance Then Fox Inc head Barry Diller was acknowledged to have been the one who created the network with the New York Times noting in October that Diller s current obsession is creating a television network to compete each evening with NBC CBS and ABC br The Fox Broadcasting Company or FBC as it was known back then officially debuted with a soft launch at p m Eastern and Pacific Time on Thursday October Its inaugural program was a late night talk show The Late Show which was hosted by comedian Joan Rivers After a strong start The Late Show quickly eroded in the ratings it was never able to overtake NBC stalwart The Tonight Show By early Rivers and her then husband Edgar Rosenberg the show s original executive producer quit The Late Show after disagreements with the network over the show s creative direction the program then began to be hosted by a succession of guest hosts After that point some stations that affiliated with FBC in the weeks before the April launch of its prime time lineup such as WCGV TV in Milwaukee and WDRB TV in Louisville signed affiliation agreements with the network on the condition that they would not have to carry The Late Show due to the program s weak ratings br Shortly before the official launch of FBC on April under original Fox Entertainment President Garth Ancier the network underwent a re branding to the much shorter Fox According to an interview Ancier gave at that time it was ad man Jay Chiat who suggested to network executives that rather than create a brand from scratch the network ought to use the Fox heritage of the previous years and the searchlight iconography to link Fox Broadcasting to th Century Fox Until late in the game during the s several station groups like Media Central and Pappas Telecasting had avoided Fox when the network launched but joined the network later on br The network had its grand opening when it expanded its programming into prime time on April inaugurating its Sunday night lineup with the premieres of the sitcom Married with Children and the sketch comedy series The Tracey Ullman Show The premieres of both series were rebroadcast twice following their initial airings at p m and pm Eastern Pacific respectively that night which Jamie Kellner who served as the network s president and chief operating officer until his resignation in January stated would allow viewers to sample FBC programming without missing Minutes Murder She Wrote or the o clock movies Fox added one new show per week over the next several weeks with the drama Jump Street and comedies Mr President and Duet completing its Sunday schedule On July the network rolled out its Saturday night schedule with the premiere of the supernatural drama series Werewolf which began with a two hour pilot movie event Three other series were added to the Saturday lineup over the next three weeks comedies The New Adventures of Beans Baxter Karen s Song and Down and Out in Beverly Hills the latter being an adaptation of the film of the same name Both Karen s Song and Down and Out in Beverly Hills were canceled by the start of the television season the network s first fall launch and were replaced by the sitcoms Second Chance and Women in Prison br In regards to its late night lineup Fox had already decided to cancel The Late Show and had a replacement series in development The Wilton North Report when the former series began a ratings resurgence under its final guest host comedian Arsenio Hall Wilton North lasted just a few weeks however and the network was unable to reach a deal with Hall to return as host when it hurriedly revived The Late Show in early The Late Show went back to featuring guest hosts eventually selecting Ross Shafer as its permanent host only for it to be canceled for good by October while Hall signed a deal with Paramount Television to develop his own syndicated late night talk show The Arsenio Hall Show Fox aired the th Primetime Emmy Awards and would air the next five editions br Although the network had modest successes in Married with Children and The Tracy Ullman Show several affiliates were disappointed with Fox s largely underperforming programming lineup during the network s first three years KMSP TV in Minneapolis and KPTV in Portland Oregon both owned at the time by Chris Craft Television disaffiliated from Fox in with KITN now WFTC and KPDX respectively replacing those stations as Fox affiliates citing that the network s weaker program offerings were hampering viewership of their stronger syndicated slate br At the start of the television season Fox added a third night of programming on Mondays The season heralded the start of a turnaround for Fox It saw the debut of a midseason replacement series The Simpsons an animated series that originated as a series of shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show ranked at a three way tie for th place in the Nielsen ratings it became a breakout hit and was the first Fox series to break the Top The Simpsons at years as of is the longest running American sitcom the longest running American animated program and the longest running American scripted primetime television series br In Fox also first introduced the documentary series Cops and crime focused magazine program America s Most Wanted the latter of which debuted as a half hour series as part of the network s mainly comedy based Sunday lineup for its first season before expanding to an hour and moving to Fridays for the season These two series which would become staples on the network for just over two decades would eventually be paired to form the nucleus of Fox s Saturday night schedule beginning in the season Meanwhile Married with Children which differentiated itself from other family sitcoms of the period as it centered on a dysfunctional lower middle class family saw viewer interest substantially increase beginning in its third season after Michigan homemaker Terry Rakolta began a boycott to force Fox to cancel the series after objecting to risqu humor and sexual content featured in a episode Married s newfound success led it to become the network s longest running live action sitcom airing for seasons br br br s Rise into mainstream success and beginnings of rivalry with the Big Three br Fox survived where DuMont and other attempts to start a fourth network had failed because it programmed just under the number of hours defined by the FCC to legally be considered a network This allowed Fox to make revenue in ways forbidden to the established networks for instance it did not have to adhere to the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules that were in effect at the time since during its first years it was considered to be merely a large group of stations By comparison DuMont had been saddled by numerous regulatory barriers that hampered its potential to grow most notably a ban on acquiring additional stations during an era when the FCC had much tighter ownership limits for television stations limiting broadcasters to a maximum of five stations nationwide than it did when Fox launched In addition Murdoch was more than willing to open his wallet to get and keep programming and talent DuMont in contrast operated on a shoestring budget and was unable to keep the programs and stars it had br Most of the other startup networks that launched in later years such as UPN and The WB followed Fox s model as well Furthermore DuMont operated during a time when the FCC did not require television manufacturers to include UHF capability To see DuMont s UHF stations most people had to buy an expensive converter Even then the signal quality was marginal at best compared to the signals of VHF stations see also UHF television broadcasting UHF vs VHF By the time Fox launched cable allowed UHF stations to generally be on an equal footing with VHF stations br Although Fox was growing rapidly as a network and had established itself as a presence it was still not considered a major competitor to the established Big Three broadcast networks ABC CBS and NBC From its launch Fox had the advantage of offering programs intended to appeal toward a younger demographic adults between and years of age and that were edgier in content whereas some programs that were carried by the Big Three networks attracted an older skewing audience Until the early s when Fox expanded its programming to additional nights and outside prime time most Fox stations were still essentially formatted as independent stations filling their schedules with mainly first run and acquired programming and during prime time running either syndicated programs or more commonly movies on nights when the network did not provide programming Few Fox stations carried local newscasts during the network s early years unlike the owned and operated stations and affiliates of its established rivals Those that did were mostly based in larger markets including some of the network s O Os and retained newscasts that had aired for decades Even then these news operations were limited to one newscast per day following the network s prime time lineup br On September Fox reached an agreement with TCI the nation s largest cable company at the time in which TCI systems in markets that were not served by an over the air Fox affiliate at the time would become charter affiliates of a cable only national feed of the network known as Foxnet The cable only network launched on June bringing Fox programming to smaller markets that did not carry a default Fox affiliate at the time it would manage to reach a total of million subscribers by br As Fox gradually headed towards carrying a full week s worth of programming in prime time through the addition of programming on Thursday and Friday nights at the start of the season the network s added offerings included the scheduling of The Simpsons opposite veteran NBC sitcom The Cosby Show as part of Fox s initial Thursday night lineup that fall along with future hit Beverly Hills which would become the network s longest running drama airing for ten seasons after only a half season of success on Sunday nights The show performed well in its new Thursday slot spending four seasons there and helping to launch Martin another Fox comedy that became a hit when it debuted in August The Simpsons returned to Sunday nights in the fall of and has remained there ever since br The sketch comedy series In Living Color which debuted in April created many memorable characters and launched the careers of future movie stars Jim Carrey Jamie Foxx Damon Wayans Marlon Wayans Keenen Ivory Wayans guest stars Chris Rock and Tim Meadows and both members of the show s dance troupe the Fly Girls Rosie Perez and Jennifer Lopez The series also gained international prominence after Fox aired a special live episode in January as an alternative to the halftime show during Super Bowl XXVI which was broadcast on CBS marking the start of Fox s rivalry with the Big Three networks while popularizing the counterprogramming strategy against the Super Bowl telecast br The early and mid s saw the debuts of several soap opera style prime time dramas aimed at younger audiences that became quick hits which in addition to Beverly Hills included its adult focused spin off Melrose Place which initially had a mediocre ratings performance before viewership rose significantly midway through its first season following Heather Locklear s addition to the cast and family drama Party of Five The early and mid s also saw the network launch several series aimed at a black audience which in addition to Martin included the sitcom Living Single and police procedural New York Undercover br br br Luring the NFL and affiliation switches br br Despite having a few successful shows like the science fiction drama The X Files Fox still lacked credibility among viewers Even those working in television thought of the network as the one that has that cartoon show The Simpsons More than of affiliates in were UHF stations Fox became a viable competitor to the older networks when it won broadcast television rights to the National Football League NFL away from CBS In December Fox signed a contract with the NFL to televise games from the National Football Conference NFC which had been airing its games on CBS since starting with the season The initial four year contract which Fox bid billion to obtain while CBS offered million per year to retain the rights also included the exclusive U S television rights to Super Bowl XXXI in The network also lured Pat Summerall John Madden Dick Stockton Matt Millen James Brown Terry Bradshaw and behind the scenes production personnel from CBS Sports to staff its NFL coverage br Shortly afterward News Corporation began striking affiliation deals with and later purchasing more television station groups On May Fox agreed to purchase a stake in New World Communications a television and film production company controlled by investor Ronald Perelman that had just recently entered into broadcasting through its purchase of seven stations owned by SCI Television As a result of Fox acquiring a minority interest in the company New World signed an agreement to switch the affiliations of twelve stations eight CBS affiliates three ABC affiliates two of which were subsequently placed in a blind trust and then sold directly to Fox due to conflicts with FCC ownership rules and one NBC affiliate that it had either already owned outright or was in the process of acquiring from Citicasters and Argyle Communications at the time to Fox starting in September and continuing as existing affiliation contracts with their existing major network partners expired br That summer SF Broadcasting a joint venture between Fox and Savoy Pictures that was founded in March purchased four stations from Burnham Broadcasting three NBC affiliates and one ABC affiliate through a separate agreement those stations would also switch to Fox between September and January as existing affiliation agreements lapsed These two deals were not the first instances in which a longtime Big Three station affiliated with Fox in Miami the affiliation moved from WCIX channel to NBC affiliate WSVN in January as the result of a complicated six station affiliation swap in two South Florida markets spurred by NBC s purchase of CBS affiliate WTVJ channel and CBS s purchase of WCIX WSVN immediately attracted industry notice for featuring a news intensive tabloid format uncharacteristic of any Fox affiliate or independent station heretofore with then Fox network president Lucie Salhany calling WSVN the future of television in May WSVN remains the largest Fox affiliate in terms of market size to have entirely eschewed any prominent on air branding with the network name br The NFC contract in fact was the impetus for the affiliation deal with New World and SF Broadcasting s purchase of the Burnham stations as Fox sought to improve local coverage of its new NFL package by aligning the network with stations that had more established histories and advertiser value than its charter affiliates The deals spurred a series of affiliation realignments between all four U S television networks involving individual stations and various broadcasting groups such as those between CBS and Group W whose corporate parent later bought the network in August and ABC and the E W Scripps Company which owned three Fox affiliates that switched to either ABC or NBC as a result of the New World deal affecting television markets between September and September The two deals also had the side benefit of increasing local news programming on the new Fox affiliates mirroring the programming format adopted by WSVN upon that station s switch to the network as well as expanding the number of news producing stations in Fox s portfolio beyond mainly charter stations in certain large and mid sized markets br With significant market share for the first time ever and the rights to the NFL Fox firmly established itself as the nation s fourth major network Fox Television Stations would acquire New World outright on July in a billion stock purchase making the latter s twelve Fox affiliates owned and operated stations of the network the deal was completed on January Later in August Fox bought several stations owned by Chris Craft Industries and its subsidiaries BHC Communications and United Television for billion most of these stations were UPN affiliates although its Minneapolis station KMSP TV would rejoin Fox in September as an owned and operated station These purchases for a time made Fox Television Stations the largest owner of television stations in the U S a title that has since been assumed by the Sinclair Broadcast Group one of the network s largest affiliate groups br br br Evolving programming br Fox completed its prime time expansion to all seven nights on January with the launch of two additional nights of programming on Tuesdays and Wednesdays The method of gradually adding nights to the programming schedule that began with the network s April prime time launch was replicated by The WB and UPN when those networks debuted in January making it the fifth broadcast network behind the Dumont network to air programming on a nightly basis September saw the heavy promotion and debut of a short lived western series that incorporated science fiction elements The Adventures of Brisco County Jr However it was the supernatural investigative drama that debuted immediately following it on Friday nights The X Files that would find long lasting success and would become Fox s first series to crack Nielsen s year end Top most watched network programs After several other failed attempts at late night programming following the cancellation of The Late Show most notably the quick failure of The Chevy Chase Show in Fox finally found success in that time period with the debut of MADtv on October the sketch comedy series became a solid competitor to NBC s Saturday Night Live for over a decade and was the network s most successful late night program as well as one of its most successful Saturday night shows running for seasons until br An attempt to make a larger effort to program Saturday nights by moving Married with Children from its longtime Sunday slot and adding a new but short lived sitcom Love and Marriage to the night at the beginning of the season backfired with the public as it resulted in a brief cancellation of America s Most Wanted that was criticized by law enforcement and public officials and was roundly rejected by viewers which brought swift cancellation to the newer series Married quickly returned to Sundays before moving again to Mondays two months later both it and Martin would end their runs at the end of that season The Saturday schedule was revised in November to feature one new and one encore episode of Cops and the revived America s Most Wanted America Fights Back Cops and AMW remained the anchors of Fox s Saturday lineup making it the most stable night in American broadcast television for over years both shows eventually were among the few first run programs remaining on Saturday evenings across the four major networks after decreasing prime time viewership as more people opted to engage in leisure activities away from home rather than watch television on that night of the week led ABC NBC and CBS to largely abandon first run series on Saturdays outside newsmagazines sports and burned off prime time shows that failed on other nights in favor of reruns and movies by the mid s America s Most Wanted ended its year run on Fox in June and was subsequently picked up by Lifetime before being cancelled for good in Cops in turn would move its first run episodes to Spike in after seasons ending its original run on Fox as the network s longest running prime time program and had been cancelled in leaving sports and repeats of reality and drama series as the only programs airing on Fox on Saturday evenings br During the season Fox had three shows in the Nielsen Top in terms of total viewers The X Files which ranked th King of the Hill which ranked th and The Simpsons which ranked th all of which aired on Sunday nights Building around its flagship animated comedy The Simpsons Fox would experience relative success with animated sitcoms in prime time beginning with the debut of the Mike Judge produced King of the Hill in Family Guy the first of three adult oriented animated series from Seth MacFarlane to air on the network and Futurama from Simpsons creator Matt Groening would make their debuts in however they were canceled in and respectively Due to strong DVD sales and highly rated cable reruns on Cartoon Network s Adult Swim Fox later decided to order new episodes of Family Guy which began airing in Futurama would be revived with four direct to DVD films between and and would return as a first run series on Comedy Central where it ran from to Less successful efforts included The Critic starring Saturday Night Live alumnus Jon Lovitz which Fox picked up in after it was cancelled by ABC only for the series to be cancelled again after its second season and The PJs which moved to The WB in after Fox cancelled that series after its second season Other notable shows that debuted in the late s included the quirky David E Kelley produced live action dramedy Ally McBeal the short lived game show Greed and the period comedy That s Show the latter of which became Fox s second longest running live action sitcom airing for eight seasons br Throughout the s and into the next decade Fox launched a slate of cable channels beginning with the debuts of general entertainment network FX and movie channel FXM Movies from Fox now FX Movie Channel followed by the debut of Fox News Channel in August Its sports operations expanded with the acquisition of controlling interests in several regional sports networks including the Prime Network and SportsChannel between and to form Fox Sports Net which launched in November its purchase of Speedvision later Speed Channel which was replaced in the United States by Fox Sports in August however it continues to exist in other North American and Caribbean countries as Fox Sports Racing and the launches of Fox Sports World later Fox Soccer which was replaced by FXX in September and Fox Sports en Espa ol now Fox Deportes in the early s br br br s Rise to ratings leadership the American Idol effect and fierce rivalry with CBS br By many staple Fox shows of the s had ended their runs During the late s and carrying over into the early s Fox put much of its efforts into producing reality shows many of which were considered to be sensationalistic and controversial in nature such as Who Wants to Marry a Multi Millionaire Temptation Island Married by America and Joe Millionaire which became the first Fox program to crack the Nielsen Top as well as video clip shows such as World s Wildest Police Videos and When Animals Attack After shedding most of these programs Fox gradually filled its lineup with acclaimed dramas such as The O C House and Bones and comedies such as The Bernie Mac Show Malcolm in the Middle and Arrested Development br As the decade wore on Fox began surpassing ABC and NBC in the ratings first in age demographics then in overall viewership and placed second behind a resurgent CBS in total viewership beginning in Fox hit a major milestone in when it emerged as the most watched U S broadcast network in the lucrative demographic for the first time largely boosted by the strength of the reality singing competition series American Idol Regarded as the single most dominant program on st century U S television as well as the first Fox show to lead the Nielsen seasonal ratings Idol had peak audiences of up to million viewers during the season finale and double season average audiences of around million viewers in and Subsequently it leapfrogged over Fox s Big Three competition to become the highest rated U S television program overall starting with the season becoming the first reality singing competition

Tuesday nights earned international prominence in the st century and became Fox s first prime time drama series and the network s third program overall to reach the Nielsen Top beginning br Beginning CBS and Fox which ranked as the two most watched broadcast networks in the U S during the s have tended to equal one another in demographic ratings among general viewership with both networks winning certain demographics by narrow margins however while Fox has the youngest skewing viewer base CBS is consistently regarded to have the oldest audience demographics among the major broadcast networks Fox hit a milestone in February by scoring its first sweeps victory in total viewership and demographic ratings boosted largely by its broadcast of Super Bowl XXXIX and the strengths of American Idol House and The O C br In September as a result of the increasing number of over the air Fox affiliates and the increased availability of digital subchannels carrying Fox in certain markets Foxnet was discontinued Then a sweeping milestone came by the conclusion of the season on May shortly after the widely acclaimed seventh season finale of American Idol when Fox outranked longtime leader CBS as the most watched television network overall in the United States attributed to the strengths of Super Bowl XLII and its NFL game coverages Idol and House during that season To date Fox is the only non Big Three network to top the overall Nielsen ratings since its inception in the season br In the late s Fox launched a few series that proved to be powerful hits in different respects In the network

S television The said show has continuously attracted worldwide media attention that it formed a large loyal international fanbase At the same time Fox s live telecast of the Super Bowl XLV helped the network emerge as the first U S television network to earn an average single night prime time audience of at least million viewers br American Idol lost its first place standing among all network prime time programs during the finale falling to second that season behind NBC Sunday Night Football ending the longest streak at for a prime time broadcast network series in U S television history through its eight year ratings domination in both the Adults demographic and total viewership Idol also remained in the Nielsen Top for eleven years from to and became the highest rated non sports

to president and CEO of Fox Entertainment In May Fox dropped its procedural drama after six seasons It had been the network s scripted tentpole since but is produced by th Television and was therefore picked up by ABC afterward Its spin off Lone Star was still renewed by Fox Beginning in Fox also began to broadcast the USFL from April to July br br br Programming br br As of Fox currently provides hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week The network provides fifteen hours of prime time programming to its owned and operated and affiliated stations on Monday through Saturdays from to p m and Sundays from p m to p m all times Eastern and Pacific An hour of late night programming is also offered on Saturdays from p m to am Eastern and Pacific Time a former hour of original comedy but currently a repeat hour for primetime series though scheduling for that hour varies depending on the market due to late local newscasts airing in the traditional p m p m timeslot on some Fox stations and the hour long Sunday morning political discussion show and the network s only regular national news program Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream airing from a m to am Eastern and Pacific although the timeslot also varies by market due to local news or public affairs programming br Sports programming is also provided usually on weekends with notable exceptions albeit not every weekend year round and most commonly airing between a m and pm Eastern time often airing for longer hours during football season in the fall slightly less during NASCAR and college basketball season in the winter and barely any in the spring and summer afternoons however baseball will air each Saturday evening between and Eastern time The Saturday prime time block is mainly scheduled for sports programming with encores of shows airing when no sports programming is airing on a given week br br br Adult animation br br Except for The Critic The PJs and Futurama which were respectively cancelled in and typically every Sunday night during prime time unless preempted usually by sports telecasts Fox airs a lineup incorporating original adult animation sitcoms all being produced or co produced with Fox for post works by the network s original sister company th Television which is currently a subsidiary of Walt Disney Television This block of adult cartoons became a staple of the network airing under the brand Animation Domination from May to September when the network rebranded the block as Sunday Funday as a result of the re incorporation of live action comedy series on the Sunday night lineup after ten years aside from occasional burn offs of series aired on other nights during the pm Eastern Pacific hour although animated series remain an integral part of that night s schedule br The first programs to air as part of the Animation Domination lineup were American Dad which also had its beginnings in the lineup and moved to TBS in October Family Guy which returned to the network after a three year cancellation when Animation Domination began The Simpsons the longest running cartoon on Fox predating the lineup by years and King of the Hill which also predated the lineup by eight years Once King of the Hill was cancelled Family Guy s spinoff The Cleveland Show would air from to and Loren Bouchard s next series Bob s Burgers would air starting in Animated shows currently airing as part of the lineup include The Simpsons Family Guy Bob s Burgers Duncanville The Great North and Housebroken Other shows in the lineup include Sit Down Shut Up Allen Gregory Napoleon Dynamite Bordertown Bless the Harts and the live action animated hybrid Son of Zorn br An extension of the Sunday prime time block called Animation Domination High Def launched on Saturday late nights in July marking the return of first run programming in that time period since the cancellation of The Wanda Sykes Show with ADHD Shorts Axe Cop and High School USA Due to low ratings Fox announced on April that it would discontinue Animation Domination High Def although the block was slated to end on June it continued to air in encore form until the start of the season when the hour returned to airing encores of comedies or reality series br br br Children s programming br br Fox began airing children s programming on September with the debut of the Fox Children s Network rebranded as the Fox Kids Network in and then to simply Fox Kids in a programming block that aired on Saturday mornings and weekday afternoons Programming within the Fox Kids block consisted mainly of animated series although it also featured some live action series as part of the lineup Shows featured in the block included Bobby s World X Men Spider Man The Tick Fun House Goosebumps and Digimon it also aired select shows from Warner Bros Animation including the popular animated series Tiny Toon Adventures Animaniacs and Batman The Animated Series Warner Bros pulled Batman and Animaniacs from the Fox Kids lineup in September moving both shows as well as Tiny Toons which had already ended its run to the newly launched Kids WB block on The WB Fox Kids most successful series however was Mighty Morphin Power Rangers from eventual sister company and Fox Kids co parent Saban Entertainment which debuted in and became the block s flagship program until it moved to ABC and Toon Disney in br In October Fox sold its children s division Saban Entertainment and Fox Family Worldwide the parent subsidiary of cable network Fox Family Channel now Freeform to The Walt Disney Company for billion The network relegated the Fox Kids block to Saturdays in January turning over the two hour timeslot held by the weekday block to its owned and operated and affiliated stations rather than retaining the slots and filling them with adult oriented daytime shows then on September as part of a time lease agreement with Kids Entertainment to program the remaining four hour Saturday morning lineup Fox Kids was replaced by a new children s program block called FoxBox which was renamed Kids TV in January Notable programs in that block include Yu Gi Oh Kirby Right Back at Ya Sonic X and One Piece br Fox discontinued the Kids TV block on December due to conflicts between the network and Kids Entertainment that were later settled regarding Kids failure to pay Fox for the programming lease rights and the network s inability to fulfill a promise guaranteeing clearance on of its stations and to get other stations to carry the block in certain markets where a Fox station declined it an issue that plagued Fox s children s program blocks since the start of its affiliation deal with New World Communications Fox had earlier announced on November that it would no longer carry children s programming in the time period citing stiff competition from cable channels aimed at the demographic the network instead turned over two of the four vacant Saturday morning hours to its affiliates to allow them to air local newscasts or educational programs purchased from the syndication market while it retained the remaining two hours to run a network managed paid programming block Weekend Marketplace which debuted on January br As of some former Kids TV shows such as Chaotic only in Spanish Dinosaur King Sonic X and various entries in the Yu Gi Oh franchise are made available to stream on the free ad supported Tubi streaming service which Fox acquired on April Outside Tubi Sonic X is also available on Netflix as of December though only seasons and In addition Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is made available to stream on both the free ad supported Pluto TV and subscription based Paramount streaming services following that property s acquisition by Nickelodeon br On September Xploration Station a two hour syndicated block produced by Steve Rotfeld Productions began airing on Fox stations owned by several affiliate groups including Fox Television Stations and Tribune Broadcasting The block which complies with guidelines defined by the Children s Television Act features programs focused on the STEM fields Stations can choose to either carry Xploration Station continue to air Weekend Marketplace as the Sinclair Broadcast Group chose to do since it already carries syndicated E I programming purchased by the company across its Fox affiliates although Sinclair added the block on most of its Fox affiliates in September or in case of Birmingham not at all since Raycom Media Gray Television carried E I programs through existing contracts with syndicators of educational program content instead br br br News br br Unlike ABC CBS and NBC Fox does not currently air national news programs morning evening or overnight or newsmagazines choosing to focus solely on its prime time schedule sports and other ancillary network programming The absence of a national news program on the Fox network is despite the fact that its parent company Fox Corporation owns Fox News Channel which launched in October and currently maintains near universal distribution within the United States via pay television providers Fox News is not structured as a news division of the Fox network and operates as a technically separate entity within Fox Corporation through the company s Fox News Group subsidiary However it does produce some content that is carried by the broadcast network which is usually separate from the news coverage aired by the cable channel in particular FNC anchor Bill Hemmer anchors most prime time news presentations on the Fox network especially during political news events which are anchored by Bret Baier on Fox News Channel br Specifically the Fox network airs coverage of the State of the Union address presidential debates national election coverage as well as live breaking news coverage currently branded as a Fox News Special Report also branded as a Fox News Alert or sometimes a Fox News Red Alert carriage of such special coverage of a breaking news story may vary from station to station and is often limited to events that occur during the network s usual prime time block for example unlike the Big Three Fox does not often provide coverage of major political convention speeches which usually occur during the p m Eastern Time hour during which most of its affiliates air local newscasts however the majority of Fox s owned and operated stations and affiliate groups do carry weekday breaking news briefs The political discussion show Fox News Sunday also airs on the Fox network on Sunday mornings and is rebroadcast later in the day on FNC Fox also operates an affiliate news service called Fox NewsEdge which launched with Fox News Channel in and provides national and international news reports and feature stories for Fox stations to use in their own local newscasts Between June and December Fox did not simulcast the public January committee hearings and instead stuck with regularly scheduled programming although ABC CBS and NBC aired it br Fox first tried its hand at a national news program in prime time with the hour long weekly newsmagazine The Reporters which was produced by the same team behind the Fox Television Stations distributed syndicated tabloid program A Current Affair the program ran from to when it was cancelled due to low ratings From until about Fox also aired news capsules that aired within its prime time schedule branded first as Fox News Extra and later as Fox News Updates which were produced at New York City O O WNYW and used their anchors Another failed attempt occurred in when Fox launched Front Page which included among its five hosts Ron Reagan and Josh Mankiewicz in an attempt to capture a younger demographic for a newsmagazine program br The network tried its hand at a newsmagazine again in with Fox Files hosted by Fox News Channel anchors Catherine Crier and Jon Scott as well as a team of correspondents it lasted a little over a year before being cancelled Its last attempt at a newsmagazine series occurred during the Sweeps period with The Pulse hosted by Fox News Channel anchor Shepard Smith On May the network aired an interview special with then Fox News primetime anchor Megyn Kelly Megyn Kelly Presents br Fox also attempted national morning programs only the first of which aired on the network itself Its first venture at such a program was Fox After Breakfast an hour long morning news and lifestyle show hosted by Tom Bergeron Laurie Hibberd and Vicki Lawrence that ran on the network from to Fox aired the program at a m as opposed to the a m to a m time slot that NBC CBS and ABC air their national morning shows to accommodate local morning newscasts that ran in the latter slot on some of its stations the program originated as Breakfast Time in on sister cable channel FX Fox tried again in with Good Day Live a heavily entertainment focused syndicated offshoot of Good Day L A a news entertainment lifestyle program that debuted in on Los Angeles owned and operated station KTTV the national version of the program was cancelled in On January Fox premiered The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet on its owned and operated stations hosted by Mike Jerrick and Juliet Huddy then anchors of Fox News Channel s DaySide the show was lighter in format and more entertainment oriented though its focus often changed when a major news story occurred In February the program was syndicated to other stations including many affiliated with ABC NBC and CBS in markets where it was not carried by a Fox or MyNetworkTV affiliate The Morning Show was cancelled in June br br br Sports br br When the network launched Fox management having seen the critical role that sports programming soccer events in particular had played in the growth of the British satellite service BSkyB believed that sports and specifically professional football would be the engine that would make Fox a major network the quickest In after ABC initially hedged on renewing its contract to broadcast Monday Night Football Fox made an offer to the National Football League NFL to acquire the rights for the same amount that ABC had been paying about million per game at the time However partly due to the fact that Fox had not yet established itself as a major network the NFL chose to renew its contract with ABC where Monday Night Football remained until its move to sister cable channel ESPN in September br Six years later when the league entered contract negotiations with its television partners Fox placed a billion bid to obtain broadcast rights to the National Football Conference covering four seasons of games beginning with the NFL season The NFL selected the Fox bid on December stripping CBS of football telecasts for the first time since The event placed Fox on par with the Big Three television networks and ushered in an era of growth for the NFL Fox s acquisition of the NFL rights also quickly led toward the network reaching an affiliation deal with New World Communications to change the affiliations of twelve of its stations to Fox see above The rights gave Fox many new viewers and a platform for advertising its other programs br With a sports division now established with the arrival of the NFL Fox acquired broadcast television rights to the National Hockey League Major League Baseball since and NASCAR auto racing since initially as part of a deal that also involved NBC and TNT br From to Fox aired the Bowl Championship Series a group of college football bowl games held around New Year s Day and the BCS National Championship Game with the exception of any event held at the Rose Bowl Stadium including the Rose Bowl Game and the Rose Bowl hosted BCS National Championship Game as their organizer maintained a separate contract with ABC Following the conclusion of the deal Fox acquired rights to the Big Ten Conference and Pac Conference s newly established football championship games the latter alternating yearly with ESPN In Fox acquired tier rights to the Big Ten Conference br In August Fox and mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship UFC reached a multi year agreement which included the rights to broadcast four live events in prime time or late night annually marking the first time that the UFC aired its events on broadcast television Its first UFC on Fox event Velasquez vs Dos Santos aired on November This deal ended at the end of with UFC events moving to ESPN and ESPN br The network s telecast of Super Bowl LVII remains the highest rated U S television program on average of all time Meanwhile its telecast of Super Bowl LI remains the record holder for the largest overall audience ever tallied in U S television history br br br Stations br br Fox has owned and operated stations and current and pending affiliation agreements with additional television stations encompassing states the District of Columbia and three U S possessions through its Fox Television Stations subsidiary Fox has the most owned and operated stations of the major American commercial broadcast networks The network has a national reach of of all households in the United States or Americans with at least one television set Currently New Hampshire New Jersey and Delaware are the only U S states where Fox does not have a locally licensed affiliate New Hampshire is served by Boston s WFXT New Jersey is split between New York City O O WNYW and Philadelphia O O WTXF while Delaware is served by WTXF and Salisbury Maryland affiliate WBOC DT br Fox largely discontinued analog broadcasts on June as part of the transition to digital television As a newer broadcast network Fox still has a few low power affiliates covering markets like Youngstown Ohio WYFX LD In some markets including both of the ones mentioned these stations also maintain simulcasts on a subchannel of a co owned managed full power television station Fox also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel only affiliations in cities located outside the largest Nielsen designated markets that do not have enough full power stations to support a standalone affiliation or have a low power station as the only other option as an affiliate though a couple have appeared in the top the largest subchannel only Fox affiliate by market size is WSYX DT in Columbus Ohio No by Nielsen br Nexstar Media Group is Fox s largest affiliate group in terms of overall market and numerical reach with stations including some former Fox O Os that were spun off in to Local TV which Tribune Media later acquired in to finance former Fox parent News Corporation s purchase of The Wall Street Journal Nexstar purchased Tribune in the fall of the Sinclair Broadcast Group is the second largest operator of Fox stations by numerical total owning or providing services to Fox affiliated stations br Fox previously distributed its programming in markets that did not have enough stations to support an affiliate via Foxnet a cable channel acting as an alternate national feed for small and certain mid sized U S markets generally those within the bottom Nielsen media markets that launched in and operated until its shutdown on September the channel featured a master schedule of programs acquired from the syndication market and some brokered programming to fill time slots not occupied by Fox network programming The concept behind Foxnet served as the basis for The WB Station Group launched in September as the cable only feed of The WB and The CW Plus the immediate successor of The WB which launched in September as a cable only digital multicast feed of The CW which both allow the customization of localized branding which Foxnet did not allow its cable partners to do in addition to allowing affiliates to sell local advertising br br br Differences between Fox and the Big Three networks br br br Network programming br Fox s programming schedule differs from the Big Three networks in several significant ways the network airs its prime time programming for only two hours on Monday through Saturday evenings and three hours on Sundays compared to the three hours on Monday through Saturdays from to p m and four hours on Sunday nights from to p m Eastern and Pacific Time programmed by the three longer established networks ABC CBS and NBC This scheduling is termed as common prime referring to the programming of prime time content across all of the conventional broadcast networks during the early and mid evening hours while the p m Eastern hour is programmed only by the three older networks br Fox has traditionally avoided programming the p m hour choosing to cede the time period to its local affiliates for them to program many of which air local newscasts during that hour however some exceptions do exist for select special film presentations which by virtue of their running time depending on whether the film s original length combined with commercial breaks that would be included in the television cut would exceed a traditional two hour broadcast timeslot must spill over into the p m hour and overruns from live sports telecasts scheduled to air during prime time However the network did regularly schedule programming in the p m hour on Sunday nights from September to September when that specific time period was turned back over to its affiliates although it never added programming at that hour on any other night Fox s original reason for the reduced number of prime time hours was to avoid fulfilling FCC requirements in effect at the time to be considered a network and to be free of resulting regulations although these rules have since been relaxed br Despite being a major network in addition to not carrying national morning and evening newscasts Fox also does not air any network daytime programming such as soap operas game shows or talk shows Because of this the network s owned and operated stations and affiliates handle the responsibility of programming daytime hours with syndicated or locally produced programming then corporate sister th Television distributes several syndicated daytime programs carried by many Fox stations such as Divorce Court and The Wendy Williams Show Fox Television Stations also test markets certain series from th Television and other syndicators such as Warner Bros Television Distribution that are proposed for national distribution on some of its stations The network also does not carry network supplied children s programming on Saturday mornings or late night programming on Monday through Friday nights Local affiliates either produce their own programming or run syndicated programs during these time periods Because of the erratic scheduling of the network s sports programming many Fox stations choose to run a mix of syndicated programming infomercials and especially movies to fill weekend afternoon timeslots when a sports event is not scheduled to air br In addition from the network s inception Fox has produced two versions of its program promotions for distribution to the network s stations a standard version incorporating airtimes based on their broadcast in the Eastern Central or Pacific Mountain time zones depending on the feed used by the station as those seen during network commercial breaks and versions with clean end tags to allow stations to include local airtime and station information through graphical insertion and verbal continuity by station promotional announcers during the program logo graphic or prime time menu This practice which differs from that long used by ABC NBC and CBS which only allow their stations to insert logos within their network promotions was also later adopted by The WB and UPN and their successors The CW and to a lesser extent MyNetworkTV for use by their affiliated stations A third cut of these promos exists for national program advertising carried by cable networks including Fox s sister cable networks where the wording check local listings is placed in the end tag br Fox is the only broadcast network that currently carries adult animated comedies This started with The Simpsons in This is followed up by King of the Hill in until with the last remaining six episodes airing on syndication but is set to return to Hulu for new episodes in Family Guy which was cancelled twice until being picked up by Adult Swim for reruns and was brought back by the network in thanks to home video sales and Futurama in until when it was also picked up by Adult Swim only to be purchased by Comedy Central for new episodes between and and is also set to return for new episodes on Hulu in American Dad in until when TBS picked up the series The Cleveland Show in Bob s Burgers in Duncanville in and The Great North and Housebroken in Although the network also aired other adult animated shows like The Critic The PJs Sit Down Shut Up Allen Gregory Napoleon Dynamite Bordertown Son of Zorn the network s only live action animated hybrid sitcom and Bless the Harts they had no success and were short lived While ABC CBS and NBC have tried to copy the success of Fox with adult animated shows none were successful br br br News programming br Within Fox s station body the quantity of locally produced news programming varies considerably compared to the owned and operated and affiliated stations of ABC NBC and CBS which typically carry at least hours of local newscasts on weekdays and one hour on weekends which are usually spread across morning midday early or late evening timeslots At minimum most Fox stations run a late evening newscast following the network s prime time lineup at p m in the Eastern and Pacific and p m in the Central and Mountain Time Zones which typically run minutes to one hour in length besides the fact that the network s stations have more latitude to air an earlier late evening newscast since Fox does not program that hour this stems from the fact that several of its charter stations were already airing prime time newscasts as independent stations prior to the network s launch such as New York City O O WNYW which debuted its p m newscast in March Most Fox stations also carry a weekday morning newscast of one to three hours in length at am as a local alternative to the national morning news programs provided by the Big Three networks though mainly in the case of Fox stations that have a news operation and in a few cases via simulcasts with ABC NBC and CBS affiliated stations that operate a Fox affiliate this is often part of a morning news block that runs for four to six hours on average br Fox has fewer stations that have an independent news operation than those of ABC NBC and CBS as of October of Fox s stations including all owned and operated stations maintain in house news departments compared to roughly of the stations of each of the three other major broadcast networks whose newscasts are either produced in house or in conjunction with another station KVVU channel in Las Vegas has the highest weekly total of news programming hours among Fox s stations at hours br Most Fox stations that run a news operation use a newscast intensive scheduling format that is very similar to an ABC NBC or CBS affiliated station which in many cases may incorporate midday or early evening newscasts the latter of which is often extended by a half hour to compete with the national evening newscasts provided by the Big Three networks some Fox stations except for those owned by Fox Television Stations and those formerly owned by Tribune Broadcasting air their early evening newscasts only on Monday through Friday nights due to frequent sports event overruns into that daypart on weekends The first Fox station to adopt such a scheduling format was WSVN in Miami upon affiliating with the network in January WSVN retained its existing morning midday and early evening newscasts while moving its late newscast from p m to p m and expanding it to one hour the station later relaunched an p m newscast in and expanding its weekday morning newscast by two hours This type of format was later adopted by the former major network stations that switched to Fox between and especially those affected by New World and Burnham Broadcasting affiliation deals Many Fox stations with upstart news departments often do not run a full slate of newscasts initially usually carrying only a prime time newscast at first before gradually adding other newscasts over time br In many small to mid sized markets largely those ranked outside the largest Nielsen designated television markets production of the local Fox affiliate s newscasts is outsourced to an NBC ABC or CBS station either due to insufficient funds or studio space for a news department or in most cases as a byproduct of the station being operated through a legal duopoly or a management agreement with a major network affiliate such as with Cunningham Broadcasting owned WEMT channel in Greeneville Tennessee which has its newscasts produced by NBC affiliate WCYB TV channel through a local marketing agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group Fox affiliates that outsource their news production to a major network affiliate often carry a lesser amount of news programming than is possible with an affiliate with a standalone news department due to the contracting station s preference to avoid having the Fox station s newscasts compete against their own in common timeslots differing from outsourcing agreements between two same market ABC CBS or NBC affiliates in certain areas in which both stations may simulcast newscasts in the same timeslots The lone exceptions to this rule currently are El Paso Texas affiliate KFOX TV channel and WXIN which respectively began producing newscasts for their CBS affiliated duopoly partners using resources from their existing news departments in September when new sister stations KFOX and KDBC TV channel consolidated their operations into a single facility and January when WXIN sister WTTV channel affiliated with CBS with the Fox stations maintaining the same amount of news programming that they did beforehand Another exception is KNPN LD channel in St Joseph Missouri which has been the smallest Fox affiliate by market size with an in house news operation since the station s July sign on News Press Gazette Company expanded production of KNPN s newscasts to its sister flagship stations KNPG LD channel and KCJO LD channel when they respectively joined NBC and CBS in November and June though the former also maintained roughly the same amount of news programming before the conversions KNPN airs morning midday and early evening newscasts on weekdays and a nightly late evening newscast all three stations simulcast the first minutes of the morning newscast while the remainder of KNPN s newscasts air in separate time slots from those seen on KNPG and KCJO br WPGH TV channel in Pittsburgh is the largest Fox station by Nielsen market ranking at that outsources its news programming NBC affiliate WPXI channel owned by Cox Media Group has produced the station s p m newscast since when WPGH shut down its news department following the closure of owner Sinclair Broadcast Group s News Central division A few Fox affiliates only air syndicated programming in time periods where newscasts would air on other major network stations The largest Fox station by market size that does not carry news programming is WSYT channel in Syracuse New York which discontinued a p m newscast produced by CBS affiliate WTVH channel in In Dayton Ohio Sinclair Broadcast Group took the unusual step in August of adopting Fox News as its universal brand for its news operation in that market making it appear as if the news department was operated by WRGT TV even though it actually belongs to WRGT s virtual duopoly partner ABC affiliate WKEF which Sinclair owns outright newscasts on WKEF would be branded as Fox News on ABC Sinclair used WRGT over WKEF due to the latter s perennial also ran reputation in the market in regards to their newscast ratings WRGT and WKEF have since switched to a new branding model in the summer of involving a web news service known as Dayton Now and in WRGT s Fox affiliation moved to WKEF s second subchannel along with a number of other Sinclair or related companies in several other markets as Sinclair consolidated its network affiliations onto one station in a market to address regulatory concerns br br br Related services br br br Video on demand services br Fox maintains several video on demand venues for viewers to watch the network s programming including a traditional VOD service called Fox on Demand which is carried on most traditional cable satellite streaming and telecom providers Fox also streams most of its programming on the streaming video service Hulu along with traditional streaming via the network s Full Episode portal on Fox com The network s mobile and digital media player app was branded as Fox Now and featured access to a live stream of the network s primetime and sports programming though not local and syndicated programming for affiliates not owned by the network along with full time live streams of their owned cable networks with TV Everywhere authentication through authorized television providers br The most recent episodes of the network s shows are usually made available on the Fox on Demand television service the day after their original broadcast In addition fast forwarding capabilities are disabled while viewing content a commonality for video on demand television services provided by the U S broadcast networks and the program s original advertisements that aired during the initial broadcast are included for a week after becoming available on the service before being replaced by direct response advertising thereafter Due to restrictions put in place by the network in January to encourage live or same week DVR viewing via traditional and cable on demand methods Hulu and Fox com both impose an eight day delay for most viewers to access the most recent episode of any Fox program restricting day after air streaming of its shows on both services to subscribers of certain pay television providers such as Dish Network and Verizon FiOS using an ISP account through agreements made with Fox along with Hulu s free service with advertisements on Yahoo Stream however Hulu offers newer episodes of Fox programs the day after their original broadcast to paid subscribers requiring only a user determined login br In March Fox began to stream the full schedule of all of their owned Fox Television Stations through Fox Now The following month Fox acquired the ad supported streaming service Tubi The service primarily offers content and channels licensed from third party studios but later began to add episodes of Fox Entertainment original series such as The Masked Singer a week after their television premiere br Fox discontinued the Fox Now app in July streaming of the network s programming would continue on other apps instead such as Hulu Fox Local or Tubi br br br Fox HD br br Fox began broadcasting its programming in p high definition on September with that day s slate of NFC football games during week one of the NFL season Until March the network did not display an on screen logo graphic on the bottom right corner of the screen outside a ten second sweep of a Fox HD promotional logo which until the end of also featured a sponsor tag for DirecTV instead a trigger in Fox s program delivery system at each station displayed the logo bug of an owned and operated or affiliate station in the right hand corner of the screen frame which disappeared during commercial breaks the station logo bug would still be triggered even if Fox programming was pre empted locally due to breaking news severe weather coverage or special programming though some stations such as WGGB DT in Springfield Massachusetts did not display a logo or substitute only the FOX logo alone However network or affiliate bugs are not displayed during Fox Sports programming During some high profile or live programs such as American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance however Fox forwent the affiliate s logo and displayed its network logo instead mainly for promotional consideration due to fair use of clips from each series by other media outlets such as news programs talk shows and review and satirical programs that rely on clip content until the bug was placed in the safe area The Sunday political talk program Fox News Sunday displayed the Fox HD logo at all times for both that reason and because of many stations airing the program on tape delay later in the morning Beginning on March the standard Fox logo with hashtag is now used on all programming with the station bug flashed for a few moments at the start of a program or coming out of commercial as is traditionally done with ABC CBS and NBC stations In addition the Fox HD bug was discontinued although it was still used on Fox News Sunday until around late early br On some Fox programs a hashtag rests above the affiliate s logo for example newgirl or bones to provide viewers reference to the network s official Twitter search tag to find or start discussions during the program being broadcast In April additional tags relating to plot points in a given episode for instance the saturdaynightGLEEver tag for an April episode of Glee of that same title began to also be promoted in this space to both add additional trending topics and spread out more conversations on Twitter In cases where the Fox bug appears instead of the station s logo bug the Twitter hashtag is directly above the Fox logo in the safe area Fox s coverage of the World Series started broadcasting in HD with Game of the World Series br During the transitional period from analog to digital television Fox was the only commercial television network in the U S to air programs in widescreen that were not available in HD which were identified as being presented in Fox High Resolution Widescreen from to Prior to the launch of its HD feed some sitcoms and drama series were presented in widescreen standard definition with reality talk and game shows American Idol being the first major exception as it began to be presented in high definition in later being presented only in widescreen enhanced definition The children s sports program This Week in Baseball began airing in widescreen in while Fox News Sunday converted to HD when Fox News Channel began operating from its new high definition facilities in November prior to Fox News Channel s conversion to a unified widescreen presentation on both its high definition and standard definition feeds in September it was the final Fox News program to structure its graphics and camera positions for the safe area MADtv was produced to air only in until September likely due to a combination of stations tape delaying the program and therefore being unable to offer it via the live network feed in and the show s producers not making the switch to the format The final Fox show to convert to HD was Family Guy beginning with its September episode all programming provided by Fox is now broadcast in widescreen and in high definition as of and in Dolby Digital surround sound br Fox is unique among U S broadcasters as it distributes its HD feed over satellite to the network s affiliates as an MPEG transport stream intended to be delivered bit for bit for broadcast transmission During network programming hours local commercials are inserted over the feed using a transport stream splicer Affiliates of most other networks decode compressed satellite network video feeds and then re encode them for final over the air transmission br After Fox began broadcasting its sports programming with graphics optimized for displays rather than the safe area in late July the network asked cable and satellite providers to comply and use the No Active Format Description flag it now disseminates over Fox programming which displays content natively broadcast in in a letterboxed format suitable for television screens to allow any optimized graphical elements to be displayed in full Subsequently a number of Fox O Os and affiliates also began disseminating the AFD No flag over local news and syndicated programs that the stations broadcast in HD and have incorporated graphical elements seen during local programs and on air promos as well as logo bugs optimized for the letter boxed presentation br br br Branding br br br Station standardization br During the early s Fox began having its stations use a branding structure using a combination of the Fox name and the station s channel number often followed by the licensed call letters for instance WNYW in New York City WTTG in Washington D C and WAGA TV in Atlanta Georgia are all branded as Fox By the mid to late s stations minimized their call letters to be just barely readable while still in compliance with FCC identification requirements This marked the start of the trend for other networks to apply such naming schemes br The branding scheme has varied in some markets with some Fox stations using a city or regional name within the branding instead of the channel number for example Chicago owned and operated station WFLD branded as Fox Chicago from to and Philadelphia O O WTXF TV branded as Fox Philadelphia from to a few of the network s stations also minimized use of the Fox name opting to use their call letters or a more generic branding WSVN in Miami which has branded as WSVN for general use and Channel News for its newscasts since it joined the network in January KHON TV channel in Honolulu which changed its general branding from Fox to KHON in WDRB in Louisville Kentucky which dropped its Fox brand in favor of branding by its call letters in September and KVRR channel in Fargo North Dakota which dropped the generic Fox branding it used in part due to its network of repeater stations throughout eastern North Dakota in favor of branding by its calls in May Similarly most of the stations that switched to Fox as a result of its affiliation deal with New World Communications retained their Big Three era branding for general or news purposes with a few exceptions such as WJW in Cleveland which dropped its CBS era TV and Newscenter brands in in favor of Fox is ei ht as a general brand and ei ht is News as the title for its newscasts likewise that same year KDFW in Dallas Fort Worth re branded itself as Fox Texas after its newscast name of News Texas before shortening its ID to simply Fox in and changing its newscast name to Fox News both in use since then before conforming to Fox s station branding conventions when Fox Television Stations acquired New World in br A particularly unique situation was with KTVU channel in Oakland San Francisco which as a Fox affiliate under longtime owner Cox Media Group retained its perennial Channel brand with limited references as Fox Channel by the early s In the station rebranded as KTVU Fox for general purposes adding the Fox logo on the underside of the top line of its heritage Circle Laser logo as well while retaining KTVU Channel News as the branding for its newscasts Fox Television Stations which traded WFXT in Boston and WHBQ TV channel in Memphis station to Cox in in exchange for KTVU and sister station KICU TV instituted the KTVU Fox branding full time in February retaining the Circle Laser both within the group s standardized boxkite logo and in an alternate version which would become the primary logo through its de emphasis of the O O standardization later that year placed next to a prominent Fox wordmark Another situation also includes another Fox station KCPQ in Seattle Washington which as a Fox affiliate under Tribune Media and Nexstar Media Group also retained the Q Fox name as well as the Q News name for its newscast until KCPQ dropped the Q moniker and rebranded itself to Fox in September conforming with the branding of other Fox O O stations after its acquisition by Fox br Starting in more standardization of the O Os began to take place both on air and online All of the network s O Os began adopting an on air look more closely aligned with the Fox News Channel which included a standardized red white and blue boxkite style logo augmented by red pillars which rotated on air particularly in the logo bugs seen during newscasts After News Corporation s acquisition of the social networking site Myspace which it sold in June to a consortium that included singer Justin Timberlake among its backers some Fox O Os launched websites with identical layouts and similar URL domains under the MyFox scheme such as MyFoxDC com for WTTG On air usage of the FNC inspired logos was reduced in August when a new standardized graphics package was implemented with wordmark bugs being used during newscasts and other programming while several of the O Os ceased using the MyFox domains in the use of the Fox News Channel boxkite logos in all elements along with explicit connections with the latter was drastically reduced since the July resignation of Roger Ailes from Fox for a more traditional and simpler call channel number horizontal wordmark style which is more flexible with both traditional television and smaller mobile screens In Fox s local newscast music composer Stephen Arnold Music released a new news music package Beyond that uses none of the Fox News Channel sonic elements associated with the previous Fox O O music package and it has rolled out across all Fox O O local news operations br As of Fox O O s with a sister MyNetworkTV station in that market have also begun to play down that network with many MyNetworkTV O O s now taking on the branding of Fox channel number Plus Xtra More etc suggesting them as an extension of their higher profile sister Fox station Several of these stations now also carry extended newscasts or rebroadcasts of earlier newscasts from their sister stations during primetime pushing MyNetworkTV s schedule to a late night offering br br br Logos br When Fox launched on October as Fox Broadcasting Company it used a logo with three squares containing the network s initials FBC similar to BBC s current logo from present in the UK Below it was a rectangle with the network s full name in the same font This logo is mostly the same color as the ITV s old logo from to in the UK which was used during the network s first six months in existence and was primarily featured as a network identification slide at the beginning of The Late Show with Joan Rivers On April when the network inaugurated its prime time programming a more familiar logo based on th Century Fox s signature logo design was introduced featuring just the capitalized FOX name alongside the familiar trademark searchlights and double pane platform Fox s owned and operated stations used a variant for station identifications from to which incorporated both an O and searchlight in negative space the latter of which intersected the X and panes within the otherwise translucent yellow gold logo until as late as the mid s some Fox affiliates that did not license the regulation network logo or which used CGI to output their station logos with local production houses which tried to emulate the parent network s logo as close as possible used those that imitated the th Century Fox inspired design in their station logos br In September the familiar logo was given a more hip makeover with the FOX wordmark overhauled into its current proprietary logotype and the angle changed removing the tilting the logo remained in use during the season in print advertisements featured in TV Guide and other television listings magazines Starting with the introduction of this logo the network began displaying an on screen bug within its programs on the lower right hand corner of the screen initially for one minute at the start of each program segment or act eventually being displayed throughout the program outside commercial breaks before reverting to the former display format regularly upon the digital transition The O character also underwent a makeover acquiring its trademark pillar like bowl which has since become a major focal point for the logo and Fox advertising in lieu of the searchlight motif The O is alternately used as a zero character in the station logo of several Fox affiliates which have a tens channel location including Phoenix s channel KSAZ TV and Sacramento affiliate KTXL TV channel br Another revised logo was introduced for the television season removing the searchlights but retaining the two lower panes and adding a third pane atop the logotype A variant of the original design was implemented in excluding the panes underneath the network name but restoring the searchlights placed behind the F and X in the Fox wordmark br The current version of the logo was introduced in removing the searchlights completely and switching the logo exclusively to a wordmark design Despite this the searchlight theme remained an integral part of st Century Fox s branding efforts they are still incorporated into Fox News Channel s logo and the universal station logo introduced in by Fox s owned and operated stations which were retained by the seven former O Os that Fox Television Stations sold in to Local TV and had spread to several Fox stations owned by Tribune Broadcasting including those it acquired through the company s merger with Local TV the logo introduced by the O Os was modified for Tribune s Fox affiliates in to feature only one searchlight as part of the company s graphical standardizations for those stations and certain other Fox affiliates not owned or operated by either company The searchlight logo is still used within the logos of a small number of Fox affiliates the searchlights continued to be featured in the logo of sister channel FX until a rebranding effort in The screen bug may have been used from to when the network upgraded to high definition the watermark placement remained at the i format Until March they did not display the on screen bug just the hashtag missing the Fox bug used on some affiliates br For the season Fox implemented branding elements by Trollb ck Company with the logo mark slightly thickened along with animations of the mark with its shapes incorporated into advertising and on air branding elements including an animation of the abstract shapes morphing into the main Fox logo br br br Controversy br Controversy surrounded the network in and over profanity expressed respectively by Cher and Nicole Richie aired live during Fox s broadcast of the Billboard Music Awards on its affiliates in the Eastern and Central Time Zones despite the use of five second audio delays the indecent material was edited out when the program was broadcast in other time zones from the Mountain Time Zone westward Both of the obscene instances were condemned by the Parents Television Council and named by them among the worst instances on television from to PTC members filed tens of thousands of complaints to the Federal Communications Commission regarding the broadcasts A subsequent apology made by Fox representatives was labeled a sham by PTC president L Brent Bozell III who argued that the network could have easily used an audio delay to edit out the obscene language As the FCC was investigating the broadcasts in Fox announced that it would begin extending live broadcast delays to five minutes from its standard five or ten seconds to more easily be able to edit out obscenities uttered over the air In June in the case Federal Communications Commission v Fox Television Stations the U S Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC could not issue indecency fines against Fox because it does not have the authority to fine broadcasters for fleeting expletives such as in the case of the Billboard Awards The FCC eventually decided to appeal the Second Circuit Court s finding The U S Supreme Court granted certiorari and oral arguments in FCC v Fox et al began November br The Parents Television Council has also criticized many popular Fox shows for perceived indecent content such as American Dad Arrested Development The Simpsons Family Guy Hell s Kitchen Married with Children Prison Break and That s Show The Council sometimes has gone even as far as to file complaints with the Federal Communications Commission regarding indecent content within Fox programming having done so for That s Show and Married by America having successfully been able to get the FCC to fine the network nearly million for its airing of the latter program That fine was reduced to in January after an appeal of the fine by Fox was granted as a result of its earlier discovery that the FCC originally claimed to have received complaints regarding the content in Married by America it later admitted to only receiving which came from only people A study of the complaints by blogger Jeff Jarvis deduced that all but two were virtually identical to each other meaning that the million judgment was based on original complaints written by a total of only three people br br br Presidents of
