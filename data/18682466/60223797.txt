Greg playing a wacky prank by pretending to be a burglar and Rowley mishearing Greg s request to pull him back up on his feet after he loses his balance instead grabbing Greg by the feet and causing him to fall in a puddle br In Rowley s entry about the time when Greg created a special award just for me Greg gives Rowley a good boy award for cleaning Greg s garage Greg gives Rowley more awards for doing his chores and after Rowley says that they aren t special anymore because he has so many Greg makes a point system instead with Rowley s reward for getting points being a basket of dirty laundry br Rowley then writes about the time I found out Greg is a lousy study partner While studying for a math test with Rowley at the library Greg tries to make a secret code and cheat on the test Opposed to the idea of cheating Rowley suggests that they study separately and Greg slips a mean note between the dividers This leads to Greg and Rowley making entire pages of rude drawings with that s you notes and they get kicked out of the library after Rowley chases Greg br In the next entry the time I made the worst mistake of my life Greg cheats by copying Rowley s entire test even writing Rowley s name They both get in trouble and while Greg is given days of detention and forced to take the test again Rowley is given a warning He gets upset after he is warned not to cheat Rowley writes about the time Greg totally had my back next hoping that Greg won t get mad for making him look bad The class gets a new teacher who is not bothered by the students acting crazy and not doing any work Everyone including Rowley gets a C grade Greg complains that Rowley was the only one who did classwork causing the teacher to increase Rowley s grade to a B br Rowley then brings up an anecdote in which he and Greg draw their own superheroes In the penultimate diary entry Rowley has a sleepover at Greg s house where they sneak out to bounce on a trampoline Greg s parents get mad and his mother divides his and Rowley s room in half Greg draws an invisible forcefield that zaps Rowley if he tries to pass through it Greg prevents Rowley from using the bathroom and he pees out the window in the morning The sleepover ends with Greg flushing one of Rowley s action figures down the toilet br Rowley shows Greg his biography and Greg is angry that it focuses on both him and Rowley instead of just him Rowley suggests that it could be their biography but Greg threatens to change all the parts with Rowley Rowley changes the diary s focus back to himself The book ends with Rowley s parents telling him he should find new friends and Rowley responding that he can t because Greg takes up a lot of his time Rowley believes that since Greg s mother says that friends get on each other s nerves he and Greg must be best friends since they get on each other s nerves the most br br br Development br A shorter Wimpy Kid story from Rowley s point of view was written to celebrate World Book Day Kinney later developed it into a full length book becoming Rowley Jefferson s Journal because he enjoyed writing it br In an interview on the official Wimpy Kid YouTube channel Kinney described that he noticed the audience always rooting for Rowley in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies This inspired him to write a novel from Rowley s point of view On the subject of the book s illustrations Kinney said that he liked how his art style is still recognizable even though Rowley draws like a five year old He stated that he enjoyed writing the book and that it is his favorite book in the series because he likes how Rowley is unable to keep the book s focus on Greg When asked if the series would change to focus entirely on Rowley Kinney confirmed that he will continue to write main series books but that he would also really like to write more Rowley books because it s a lot of fun and I think it s really fresh and Rowley can write in lots of different styles about lots of different genres So I d really like to get to there where Rowley is authoring lots of books The following year a follow up to Rowley Jefferson s Journal titled Rowley Jefferson s Awesome Friendly Adventure was published Rowley Jefferson s Awesome Friendly Spooky Stories another sequel was released in March br br br See also br List of media spin offs br br br
