Time is a list of the top most influential people assembled by the American news magazine Time First published in as the result of a debate among American academics politicians and journalists the list is now a highly publicized annual event Appearing on the list is often seen as an honor and Time makes it clear that entrants are recognized for changing the world regardless of the consequences of their actions The final list of influential individuals is exclusively chosen by Time editors with nominations coming from the Time alumni and the magazine s international writing staff Only the winner of the Reader s Poll conducted days before the official list is revealed is chosen by the general public The corresponding commemorative gala is held annually in Manhattan br In Time began publishing the Time Next list which spotlights rising stars who are shaping the future of business entertainment sports politics science health and more br br br Selection criteria br In Time s editors identified three rather distinct qualities when choosing people to be listed Time s editor at large Michael Elliott wrote br br First there were those who came to their status by means of a very public possession of power President George W Bush is the pre eminent example Others though they are rarely heard from in public nonetheless have a real influence on the great events of our time Think of Ali Husaini Sistani the Grand Ayatullah of Iraq s Shi ites who in effect has a veto on plans to transfer power from those who occupy his country to its people Still others affect our lives through their moral example Consider Nelson Mandela s forgiveness of his captors and his willingness to walk away from the South African presidency after a single term br For the list managing editor Richard Stengel clarified that the Time focused on the most influential people rather than the hottest most popular or most powerful people He said br br Influence is hard to measure and what we look for is people whose ideas whose example whose talent whose discoveries transform the world we live in Influence is less about the hard power of force than the soft power of ideas and example Yes there are Presidents and dictators who can change the world through fiat but we re more interested in innovators like Monty Jones the Sierra Leone scientist who has developed a strain of rice that can save African agriculture Or heroes like the great chess master Garry Kasparov who is leading the lonely fight for greater democracy in Russia Or Academy Award winning actor George Clooney who has leveraged his celebrity to bring attention to the tragedy in Darfur br br br History br br br s br From to Time magazine awarded one of Darko Mladenovic s Ray crystal sculptures to each Time honoree These sculptures were produced by Swarovski br In the winner of the online poll was chan founder Christopher Poole who received votes Time claimed that their technical team did detect and extinguish several attempts to hack the vote However it was shown weeks before the poll ended that the results had been heavily influenced by hackers The first letters of the top names spell out marblecake also the game Marblecake was an obscene chan meme and marblecake was the name of the Internet Relay Chat channel used for communication by some of the participants in rigging the poll br br br s br In its online presentation Time introduced the list as follows In our annual Time issue we name the people who most affect our world The overall list was organized with four main sub lists Leaders Heroes Artists and Thinkers Oprah Winfrey continued a streak that began in having been included on every Time list and was one of women on the list While saw a break in Oprah s streak she would be a finalist four more times during the decade and returned to the list in The list included many expected names and some surprises such as Scott Brown who HuffPost described as a premature selection at that point in his career br The list included Indians but according to a local news station in India Time faced criticism when they excluded Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan from the list even though he was supposedly in the race According to Rob Cain of Forbes Khan is the biggest and most revered figure in India and Khan s fan following is one of the largest in Bollywood br The announcement of the list was celebrated by a black tie gala at the Time Warner Center in New York City on May Time readers contributed to the selection through an online vote of over finalists br Time introduced the list as follows Meet the most influential people in the world They are artists and activists reformers and researchers heads of state and captains of industry Their ideas spark dialogue and dissent and sometimes even revolution Welcome to this year s Time The announcement was celebrated with a black tie event in New York City on April The honorees were joined by A list celebrities at the Jazz at

Robert Redford Jason Collins and Mary Barra on international covers The list included women the most in the list s history The gala was held on April in New York City br Time managing editor Nancy Gibbs commented br br The Time is a list of the world s most influential men and women not its most powerful though those are not mutually exclusive terms Power as we ve seen this year can be crude and implacable from Vladimir Putin s mugging of Crimea to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un s summary execution of his uncle and mentor Jang Song thaek Those men made our list but they are the outliers and not just because we generally seek to celebrate the best work of the human spirit The vast majority of this year s roster reveals that while power is certain influence is subtle Power is a tool influence is a skill one is a fist the other a fingertip You don t lead by hitting people over the head Dwight Eisenhower used to say That s assault not leadership To assemble the list we rely on our journalists around the world and our Time alumni many of whom are as influential as ever If there is a common theme in many of the tributes it s the eagerness to see what some engineer actor leader or athlete will do next As much as this exercise chronicles the achievements of the past year we also focus on figures whose influence is likely to grow so we can look around the corner to see what is coming At age Spanish British born actress Millie Bobby Brown became the youngest person to be listed on the list when Stranger Things was in its third season The list also included two Israelis entrepreneur and WeWork founder Adam Neumann and actress and model Gal Gadot br In the list Time chose authors to write the honorees blurbs Some of the pairings include Gal Gadot writing

Controversies br br br Exclusions br The exclusion of then British prime minister Tony Blair from the list caused mild controversy Time editor at large Michael J Elliott defended the decision to consistently exclude Blair saying that Gerhard Schr der and Jacques Chirac are not there either This is a worldwide list There are no Western European political leaders on it because they are not that powerful or influential at this time The exclusion of then President of the United States George W Bush in generated similar controversy Former Senator Rick Santorum R PA said on Fox News The fact of the matter is the president of the United States I don t care who s in that office is the most powerful man on the face of the Earth and has more influence over various aspects of lives not just in this country but around the world And for Time magazine to dismiss that just shows you how biased and I would argue hateful they are br Adi Ignatius Time s deputy managing editor who oversaw the list at the time explained that any U S president has a certain built in influence Bush had actually squandered some of that built in influence His position on Iraq has cost him support in his own party To a certain point he sort of reached a lame duck status br br br Inclusions br The list has also generated controversy over inclusions In conservative commentator Ann Coulter was listed which led Salon to observe br br When Time magazine named Ann Coulter among its most influential people last week alongside such heavyweights as Ariel Sharon Bill Clinton Nelson Mandela and the Dalai Lama the choice produced guffaws online Plugging the issue on Fox News last week Time executive editor Priscilla Painton insisted it was Coulter s use of humor that made her so influential stopping just short of suggesting that Coulter is the conservative Jon Stewart But even Fox s Bill O Reilly wasn t buying it He pressed Painton Do you think people Americans listen to Ann Coulter Do you think she has influence in public opinion br Time defended Coulter as a best selling author whose controversial commentary strongly affected political debates in the United States Coulter did not however make additional appearances on the list br br br Mistakes br In February Time included the male British author Evelyn Waugh on its Most Read Female Writers in College Classes list generating media attention and concerns regarding fact checking at the magazine Time later issued a retraction In a BBC interview with Justin Webb Oxford professor Valentine Cunningham said the mistake was a piece of
