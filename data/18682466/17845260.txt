Duncan s novel were acquired by DreamWorks in June According to Thor Freudenthal DreamWorks first approached him about working on the film after a short film which he had worked on played at the Sundance Film Festival Freudenthal said that DreamWorks really embraced and responded to the film and sent him an early version of the script Nickelodeon Movies would also join in to produce the film with DreamWorks He was initially hesitant to sign onto the project balking at the seemingly shallow title However he stated that after reading the script that he realized you don t think much about the logistics involved and saw deeper messages and more complex aspects of the film Freudenthal was attracted to the urban fairytale aspect of the film noting in an interview br br It s basically these unwanted children these unwanted animals coming together and making their own place in their own home That s what I liked It wasn t the fact that it was Fox Terriers and things like that So that sort of made me sign on and be ready for it br A producer of the film Lauren Shuler Donner is also an activist and dog lover and was convinced that the book s message about the importance of family made the novel an ideal property to bring to the big screen Shuler Donner insisted that the movie stand out from other family movies visually and it was Freudenthal s background in animation that gave him an edge over other directors According to her It was the way he framed shots the way he moved the camera the use of color the use of light He s very visually savvy and very specific Much of the screenplay was handled by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle creators of Kim Possible for Disney Channel br br br Casting br Emma Roberts was cast in August to play teenage older sister Andi Freudenthal began his search for a young actress who could carry a whole movie and settled on then year old Roberts Ewan Leslie a producer of the film said in an interview of Roberts that she is one of those young actors whose face just lights up the screen and she has the ability to play a wide range of emotions without any dialogue br Filmmakers conducted a nationwide search for an actor to play Bruce Andi s whimsical and inventive younger brother Jake T Austin auditioned late after nearly other boys had tried out for the part Jason Clark another producer of the film stated that Austin was amazing on every level He played the emotional beats very well felt the role and also understood timing br The rest of the roles were cast in the following months Don Cheadle who plays Andi and Bruce s protective social worker joined the film in September Lisa Kudrow was cast as the siblings foster mother in October and Johnny Simmons was cast that same month as Dave Kyla Pratt was chosen to play Heather soon after br The dogs were carefully cast as well Filmmakers wanted a variety of breeds with different colors and facial structures so that their look suggested their personality Freudenthal said that he deliberately chose both very small and very large dogs to create a contrast similar to the characters of Lenny and George in the John Steinbeck novella Of Mice And Men The majority of the dogs cast were rescues The lead dog who plays Friday was rescued about six months before shooting began Crew members also helped to find adoptive homes for the abandoned dogs and several adopted dogs themselves br br br Filming br A Hollywood animal trainer Mark Forbes was hired to prepare the dogs before shooting began Forbes and his team began working with the dogs about four months before shooting Those dogs with no prior training were first taught basic commands such as sit and roll over They were then trained to respond to more complex commands and learned to retrieve objects and to wave The next phase of training involved using the dogs body language to express emotions sadness for example was conveyed when a dog tucked its tail between its legs Finally the dogs were taken to public places to review the commands that they had learned The purpose of this was to ensure that the dogs would perform in any location According to Forbes You want the dogs to sense that everything is fine and they ll still get their treat regardless of the location The set becomes just another place for them to go The trainers worked with the human actors as well to familiarize them with how the dogs behave and create a comfort level between the human and the dog actors The dogs were also trained to interact with the various gadgets in the film with early prototypes built by the special effects team br Special effects supervisor Michael Lantieri enlisted to create the various contraptions invented by Bruce throughout the film to keep the dogs fed One such gadget is a device which can be operated by the dogs to throw a ball to be fetched br br The first was a simple spring loaded device that throws a ball and spoon down hallways while the second device was a bit more sophisticated This fetching machine uses a bicycle and a hand from a mannequin It is timed so that the wheels turn and the ball is magnetic so it sticks in the hand which comes round and launches the object so the dog can chase it explains Lantieri Things can seem simple when you read them but making it work on screen has to do with timing the weight of the ball and how the ball stays in the hand until you want it to move br Other devices built for the film include a feeding machine that drops food into each of the dogs bowls on a timed schedule a vending machine filled with shoes and other chew toys a room filled with doors whose doorbells go off on their own and another containing a replica of a car surrounded by fans which simulates for the dogs the experience of placing their heads through an open car window while driving br All of the contraptions were created using objects that might actually be found in an abandoned hotel and in such a way that they looked like they had been created by a gifted year old boy br br br Release br br br Box office br Hotel for Dogs was released in Puerto Rico on January and in the United States on January to theaters It earned in its opening weekend the
