positive review saying Similar to its counterpart this animated reboot amusingly tackles universal aspects of adolescence like first day jitters the fleeting nature of popularity navigating cafeteria social hierarchies and the frustrations of not fitting in With this notable sense of visual dexterity and stirring sentiments surrounding friendship and individuality that don t come across as hollow platitudes the brisk minute feature is yet another noteworthy start to a burgeoning franchise reboot Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times complimented the animation found the misadventures experienced by the characters to be good humored and believed that the film manages to explore how friendship can evolve John Serba of Decider found the movie entertaining and lively complimented the depiction of teachable moments and compared Greg to Homer Simpson describing him as a reliable anti role model Jennifer Green of Common Sense Media rated the movie out of stars complimented the depiction of positive messages citing self authenticity and true friendship and found agreeable the presence of role models stating both Greg and Rowley demonstrate loyalty br Jesse Hassenger of The A V Club gave the movie a mixed review writing On that level the new version of Wimpy Kid has its moments It bounces between vignettes some amusing and some choppily edited testing the mettle of Heffley and his optimistic best pal Rowley Ethan William Childress perhaps Kinney s most durable creation Even if their minds wander most grown ups probably won t be as bored as the actors playing Heffley s parents sound they both give oddly flat and colorless vocal performances It s these hints of indifference that make Diary Of A Wimpy Kid feels like a contractual obligation or a cobbling together of streaming content rather than the start of a new series Sarah Bea Milner of Screen Rant rated the movie out of stating Existing fans of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid franchise will at least get some enjoyment from watching such a faithful adaptation Perhaps s animated reboot can serve as a cautionary tale for the industry being a good writer does not make one a good screenwriter and sometimes the best way to stay faithful to the spirit of a book is to have a competent and experienced professional write the adaptation br br br Accolades br Jessica Mikayla received a nomination for Best Performance in a
