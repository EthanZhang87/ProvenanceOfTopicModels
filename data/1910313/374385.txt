Creative problem solving CPS is the mental process of searching for an original and previously unknown solution to a problem To qualify the solution must be novel and reached independently The creative problem solving process was originally developed by Alex Osborn and Sid Parnes Creative problem solving CPS is a way of using creativity to develop new ideas and solutions to problems The process is based on separating divergent and convergent thinking styles so that one can focus their mind on creating at the first stage and then evaluating at the second stage br br br Creative solution types br The process of creative problem solving usually begins with defining the problem This may lead to finding a simple non creative solution a textbook solution or discovering prior solutions developed by other individuals If the discovered solution is sufficient the process may then be abandoned br A creative solution will often have distinct characteristics that include using only existing components or the problematic factor as the basis for the solution However a change of perspective may in many cases be helpful A solution may also be considered creative if readily available components can be used to solve the problem within a short time limit br If a creative solution has a broad application such that the usage goes beyond the original intent it may be referred to as an innovative solution or an innovation some innovations may also be considered an invention br br br Techniques and tools br Many techniques and tools employed for creating effective solutions to a problem are described in creativity techniques and problem solving articles br br br Creative problem solving technique categories br Mental state shift and cognitive re framing Changing one s focus away from active problem solving and towards a creative solution set br Multiple idea facilitation Increasing the quantity of fresh ideas based on the belief that a greater number of ideas will raise the chances that one of these is valuable This may include randomly selecting an idea such as choosing a word from a list and thinking about its similarities to the situation In turn this random act may inspire a related idea that would lead to a solution br Inducing a change of perspective Efficiently entering a fresh perspective may result in a solution that thereby becomes obvious This is especially useful for solving particularly challenging problems Many techniques to this end involve identifying independent dimensions that differentiate closely associated concepts Differentiating concepts help overcome a tendency to use oversimplified associative thinking in which two related concepts are so closely associated that their differences are overlooked br br br Idea generation techniques br Brainstorming Brainstorming is an idea generation method invented by Alex Osborn and further developed by Charles Hutchison Clark Brainstorming aims to encourage the generation of new and unusual ideas in a group of people Alex Osborn based his development of brainstorming on the Indian technique Prai Barshana which has been around for about years He named brainstorming after the idea of this method namely using the brain to storm a problem br Creative Thinking Coming up with ideas especially innovative ideas needs creativity and can be supported by certain creativity techniques The creativity process is usually applied through a person product process and place Thus creativity means that a creative person develops great ideas and novel products through a creative process in a creative environment br Creativity processes use these influencing factors as they support the search for ideas problem solving and evaluation and selection of ideas via rules a group of people and a creative process br br Design thinking Design thinking is an approach to problem solving and ideation process that works through four key elements br The user as the starting point br Interdisciplinary team br Iterative process br Creative environment In the design thinking process the customer s needs are first determined through an iterative process and a question is defined then creative solutions and ideas are generated through brainstorming and visualized via prototypes for user feedback br Complex Opportunity Recognition Techniques Opportunity Recognition describes the identification of opportunities to generate growth for companies The different idea generation techniques of opportunity recognition are based either on the market the company or the company s environment In order for this approach to be suitable for young companies it must fulfill the following attributes br Not too resource intensive br Suitable for workshops br High growth potential br Don t require existing structures or certain age of the company br br br See also br br br Related articles br br Creativity br Collective problem solving br Frugal innovation br Invention br Lateral
