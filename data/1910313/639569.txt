Lode Runner is a D puzzle platform game developed by Doug Smith and published by Broderbund in Its gameplay mechanics are similar to Space Panic from The player controls a character who must collect all the gold pieces in a level and get to the end while being chased by a number of enemies It is one of the first games to include a level editor br After the original game a number of remakes spin offs and sequels were published in the Lode Runner series for different computers and consoles by different developers and publishers Tozai Games holds the copyright and trademark rights br br br Gameplay br br The player controls a stick figure who must collect all the gold in a level while avoiding guards who try to catch the player After collecting all the gold the player must reach the top of the screen to reach the next level There are levels in the game which progressively challenge players problem solving abilities or reaction times br Levels have a multi story brick platform motif with ladders and suspended hand to hand bars that offer multiple ways to travel Guards can pick up gold bars by running over them but any individual guard may carry no more than one bar at a time The player can dig holes into floors to temporarily trap guards and may safely walk atop any who have fallen into holes Should a guard be carrying a bar of gold when he falls into a hole he will drop it and the player can pick it up Holes dug by the player fill themselves in after a short delay A trapped guard who cannot escape a hole before it fills is consumed immediately respawning in a random location at the top of the level Unlike guards the player s character may not climb up out of a hole and he will be killed if it fills before he can escape by other means Floors may contain trapdoors through which the player and guards will fall and bedrock through which the player cannot dig br The player can dig a hole only to either side of his position and may not dig directly beneath his own feet In order to dig through multiple layers of bricks the player must create a gap whose width is at least equal to the number of layers However exceptions to this rule arise when the player digs from the position of standing on a ladder or hanging from a hand to hand bar which allows the player to repeatedly dig and descend one row This kind of digging is involved in solving many of the levels br The player starts with five lives each level completion awards an extra life Should a guard catch the player one life is subtracted and the current level restarts The player s character can fall from arbitrary heights without any injury but cannot jump and players can trap themselves in pits from which the only escape is to abort the level costing a life and begin again br br br Enemy AI br br The guards do not always take the shortest path to the player and can move in counterintuitive ways Sometimes when the player and a guard are on the same ladder for instance the guard will move away from the player In general depending on their exact positioning relative to Lode Runner the guards sometimes appear to be repelled Mastering the game involves developing the intuition to predict the movement of the guards br br br Permitted contact br The player may come into contact with a guard directly from above with the stick figure s feet touching the guard s head This is what enables the player to walk over guards who are temporarily stuck in a hole that has been dug It is also possible to make this contact while both the guard and the player are in free fall since the player not only runs faster than the guards but also falls faster moreover it is possible to survive the feet to head contact while a guard is standing on a platform and begins to move Both forms of contact are necessary to solve some levels Sometimes it is necessary to liberate a trapped guard by digging while standing on his head but then moving rapidly in the opposite direction when the guard begins marching to freedom In a few levels it is necessary to use a falling guard as a bridge to reach an otherwise unreachable area One subtlety is that if a down movement is initiated while standing on a guard s head or briefly touching the guard s head during free fall the consequences are fatal br br br Trapping and using guards br In some levels guards can be deliberately trapped in various ways For instance they can be lured into entering a part of the level from which there is no escape In some situations the player can liberate trapped guards by digging them out In some levels the player must exploit the guards by having them collect gold pieces which are positioned such that whoever collects them will become trapped When the guard collects the piece and becomes trapped the player can release the guard and then later steal the gold when the guard drops it or falls into a hole br In some levels there are gold pieces which can be collected only by killing guards by digging holes to trap them Deceased guards come back to life from locations near the top of the screen which may allow them to reach parts of the level that cannot be reached by the player br br br Traversal orders br Some levels require careful ordering of traversal because they are divided into zones connected by passages which are impossible to traverse in the reverse direction If a gold piece remains in an unreachable zone the player may have to abort the level to start again losing a life unless there is a way to coax a guard into bringing the gold br br br Timing br Some of the game s puzzles in the advanced levels are time sensitive The player must dig in order to penetrate the interior of some cavern to collect gold and quickly return the same way before the digging repairs itself enclosing Lode Runner in that cavern with no means of escape br Some puzzles require deliberate timing among the digging actions because Lode Runner must run over previously dug out tiles that have just repaired themselves while having enough time to pass through ones which have not yet repaired br br br Development br Around late high school student James Bratsanos heard from a friend about a new arcade video game Space Panic by Universal which involves climbing platforms and ladders while digging holes to trap monsters Bratsanos was intrigued by his friend s description of the concept and he wanted to develop it further He began writing a Commodore PET program called Suicide using simple text based graphics Due to his lack of programming experience there were no pre programmed levels but he instead built an engine that could interpret a game level and then run a processing loop on the monsters This novel design later evolved into the concept of a level editor br At the University of Washington in Bratsanos met two other students architecture student Douglas E Smith and Tracy Steinbeck Following the release of Nintendo s arcade platformer Donkey Kong that year the three students began working on a program called Kong which evolved the concepts of Suicide Bratsanos later left the project to pursue his studies and Smith continued to develop Kong into the prototype of what later became Lode Runner Kong was written for a Prime Computer minicomputer limited to one building on the UW campus Kong was soon ported to VAX minicomputers which had more terminals available on campus The game was programmed in Fortran using ASCII character graphics When Kong was ported to the VAX some Pascal sections were mixed into the original Fortran code br Over one weekend in Smith recreated a crude playable version in assembly language on an Apple II and renamed the game Miner Through the end of the year he refined that version which was black and white with no joystick support He submitted a rough version to Broderbund around October and received a one line rejection letter in response to the effect of Thank you for submitting your game concept Unfortunately it does not fit within our product line br Miner like its text based Kong predecessors had only simple animation where characters move across the screen in block increments It was too primitive for an acceptable commercial product as Broderbund wanted detailed pixel level movement Smith s new game would be one of the first to include a level editor for user generated content allowing players to create levels for the game Smith was given a advance by Broderbund to develop the inter square animation and to provide levels of play In a interview game designer John Romero claimed that Smith added the level editing function at the request of neighborhood kids he had testing the game and a ton of the levels they designed ended up in the final game Smith borrowed money to purchase a color monitor and joystick and continued to improve the game Around Christmas of he submitted the game renamed Lode Runner to four publishers and received offers from all four Sierra Sirius Synergistic and Broderbund
