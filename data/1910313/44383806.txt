earliest journals exclusively covering video games emerged in late but early column based coverage continued to flourish in North America and Japan with prominent examples like video game designer Yuji Horii s early s column in Weekly Sh nen Jump and Rawson Stovall s nationally syndicated column The Vid Kid running weekly ran from to br The first consumer oriented print magazine dedicated solely to video gaming was Computer and Video Games which premiered in the U K in November This was two weeks ahead of the U S launch of the next oldest video gaming publication Electronic Games magazine founded by Arcade Alley writers Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz As of the oldest video game publications still in circulation are Famitsu founded in and The Games Machine Italy founded in br The video game crash of badly hurt the market for video game magazines in North America Computer Gaming World CGW reported in a article that there were eighteen color magazines covering computer games before the crash but by CGW was the only surviving magazine in the region Expanding on this in a discussion about the launch of the NES in North America Nintendo of America s PR runner Gail Tilden noted that I don t know that we got any coverage at that time that we didn t pay for Video game journalism in Japan experienced less disruption as the first magazines entirely dedicated to video games

was Tokuma Shoten s Family Computer Magazine also known as Famimaga which began in and was focused on Nintendo s bit Family Computer This magazine later spawned famous imitators such as Famits originally named Famicom Ts shin in and Nintendo Power in Famimaga had a circulation of copies per issue by December increasing to million in br By British video game magazines had a circulation of

launched in mid br br br Features br Often game reviews would be accompanied by awards such as the C VG Hit the YS Megagame or the Zzap Gold Medal awarded usually to titles with a score above Other features would be gameplay hints tips cheats a letters page and competitions br br br Web based br There are conflicting claims regarding which of the first two electronic video game magazines was the first to be published regularly online Originally starting as a print fanzine in April Game Zero magazine claims to have launched a web page in November with the earliest formal announcement of the page occurring in April Game Zero s web site was based upon a printed bi monthly magazine based in Central Ohio with a circulation of that developed into a CD ROM based magazine with a circulation of at its peak The website was updated weekly during its active period from br Another publication Intelligent Gamer Online IG Online debuted a complete web site in April commencing regular updates to the site on a daily basis despite its bi weekly name Intelligent Gamer had been publishing online for years prior to the popularization of the web originally having been based upon a downloadable Intelligent Gamer publication developed by Joe Barlow and Jeremy Horwitz in This evolved further under Horwitz and Usenet based publisher Anthony Shubert into Intelligent Gamer Online interactive online mini sites for America Online AOL and the Los Angeles Times TimesLink Prodigy online services in late and early At the time it was called the first national videogame magazine found only online br Game Zero Magazine ceased active publication at the end of and is maintained as an archive site Efforts by Horwitz and Shubert backed by a strong library of built up web content eventually allowed IG Online to be acquired by Sendai Publishing and Ziff Davis Media the publishers of then leading United States print publication Electronic Gaming Monthly who transformed the publication into a separate print property in February br br br New media br Future Publishing exemplifies the old media s decline in the games sector In the group saw multi million GBP profits and strong growth but by early were issuing profit warnings and closing unprofitable magazines none related to gaming Then in late November the publisher reported both a pre tax loss of million million USD and the sale in order to reduce its level of bank debt of Italian subsidiary Future Media Italy br In mid Eurogamer s business development manager Pat Garratt wrote a criticism of those in print games journalism who had not adapted to the web drawing on his own prior experience in print to offer an explanation of both the challenges facing companies like Future Publishing and why he believed they had not overcome them br With the rise of eSport popularity traditional sport reporting websites such ESPN and Yahoo launched their own eSport dedicated sections in early This move came with controversy especially in the case of ESPN whose president John Skipper stated eSports were a competition instead of a sport The response to the shift was either great interest or great distaste However as of January ESPN and Yahoo continue their online coverage of eSports Yahoo eSports ended on June br In addition ESPN and Yahoo other contemporary eSport dedicated news sites like The Score Esports or Dot Esports cover some of the most widely followed games like Counter Strike League of Legends and Dota br br br Independent br While self made print fanzines about games have been around since the first home consoles the rise of the internet gave independent gaming journalist a new platform br At first ignored by most major game publishers it was not until the communities developed an influential and dedicated readership and increasingly produced professional or near professional writing that the sites gained the attention of these larger companies br Independent video game websites are generally non profit with any revenue going back towards hosting costs and occasionally paying its writers As their name suggests they are not affiliated with any companies or studios though bias is inherent in the unregulated model to which they subscribe While most independent sites take the form of blogs the user submitted model where readers write stories that are moderated by an editorial team is also popular br In recent times some of the larger independent sites have begun to be bought up by larger media companies most often Ziff Davis Media who now own a string of independent sites br In IGN and GameSpot announced significant layoffs br br br The rise of reviews on video oriented sites br According to a article by Mike Rose in Gamasutra The publicity someone like TotalBiscuit can bring you compared to mainstay consumer websites like IGN GameSpot and Game Informer is becoming increasingly significant A year ago I would have advised any developer to get in touch with as many press outlets as possible as soon as possible I still advise this now but with the following caveat You re doing so to get the attention of YouTubers Rose interviewed several game developers and publishers and concluded that the importance of popular YouTube coverage was most pronounced for indie games dwarfing that of the dedicated gaming publications br David Auerbach wrote in Slate that the influence of the video games press is waning Game companies and developers are now reaching out directly to quasi amateur enthusiasts as a better way to build their brands both because the gamers are more influential than the gaming journalists and because these enthusiasts have far better relationships with their audiences than gaming journalists do Nintendo has already been shutting out the video game press for years He concluded that gaming journalists audience gamers is leaving them for video oriented review sites br br br Ethics br br Journalism in the computer and video game media industry has been a subject of debate since at least br br br Conflicts of interest and pressure from game publishers br Publications reviewing a game often receive advertising revenue and entertainment from the game s publishers which can lead to perceived conflicts of interest Reviews by official platform specific magazines such as Nintendo Power typically have direct financial ties to their respective platform holders br In The DO Company s president sent an email to GamePro threatening to reduce their advertising spend following a negative review br In Jeff Gerstmann was fired from GameSpot after posting a review on Kane Lynch Dead Men that was deemed too negative by its publisher which also advertised heavily on the website Due to non disclosure agreements Gerstmann was not able to talk about the topic publicly until br In a article for Eurogamer Robert Florence criticised the relationship between the video games press and publishers characterising it as almost indistinguishable from PR and questioned the integrity of a games journalist Lauren Wainwright In the controversy that followed dubbed Doritogate after a video of Geoff Keighley emerged of him sitting in front of bottles of Mountain Dew bags of Doritos and an ad banner for Halo the threat of legal action the result of broad libel laws in the UK caused Eurogamer to self censor Eurogamer s editor in chief Tom Bramwell censored the article and Florence consequently retired from video games journalism br According to a July survey by Mike Rose in Gamasutra approximately a quarter of high profile YouTube gaming channels receive pay from the game publishers or developers for their coverage especially those in the form of Let s Play videos br Following the Gamergate controversy that started in August both Destructoid and The Escapist tightened their disclosure and conflict of interest policies Kotaku editor in chief Stephen Totilo said writers were no longer allowed to donate to Patreon campaigns of developers Kotaku later disclosed that journalist Patricia Hernandez who had written for them was friends with developers Anna Anthropy and Christine Love as well as being Anthropy s former housemate Polygon announced that they would disclose previous and future Patreon contributions br br br Review scores and aggregate ratings br Reviews performed by major video game print sources websites and mainstream newspapers that sometimes carry video game such as The New York Times and The Washington Post are generally collected for consumers at sites like Metacritic Game Rankings and Rotten Tomatoes If the reviews are scored or graded these sites will convert that to a numerical score and use a calculation to come out with an aggregate score In the case of Metacritic these scores are further weighted by an importance factor associated with the publication Metacritic also is known to evaluate unscored reviews and assign a numeric score for this as well based on the impression the site editors get about the review br Within the industry Metacritic has become a measure of the critical success of a game by game publishers frequently used in its financial reports to impress investors The video game industry typically does not pay on residuals but instead on critical performance Prior to release a publisher may include contractual bonuses to a developer if they achieve a minimum Metacritic score In one of the more recognized examples members of Obsidian Entertainment were to have gotten bonuses from Bethesda Softworks for their work on Fallout New Vegas if they obtained a Metacritic score of or better out of After release the game only obtained an aggregate score from Metacritic one point away and Bethesda refused to pay them br Video game reviewers are aware of their impact on the Metacritic score and subsequent effect on bonus payment schemes Eurogamer prior to were aware that they generally graded games on a scoring scale lower than other websites and would pull down the overall Metacritic score For this reason the site dropped review scores in and their scores are no longer included in these aggregate scores Kotaku also dropped review scores for the same reason Eurogamer later reverted to scoring reviews br Frequently publishers will enforce an embargo on reviews of a game until a certain date commonly on the day of release or a few days ahead of that date Such embargos are intended to prevent tarnishing the game s reputation prior to release and affecting pre release and first day sales Similar embargos are used in other entertainment industries but the nature of interactivity with video games creates unique challenges in how these embargos are executed In agreements with publishers media outlets will get advance copies of the game to prepare their review to have ready for this date However embargo agreement may include other terms such as specific content that may not be discussed in the review This has led to some publications purposely holding off reviews until after the embargo as to be able to include specific criticism towards features that were marked off limits in the embargo agreement such as for s SimCity Additionally modern lengthier games can offer more than hours of content and the amount of time journalists have to review these advance copies prior to the embargo date is limited It has become a concern of these journalists that they are knowingly publishing reviews that cover only a fraction of the game s content but waiting any longer beyond the embargo date will harm viewership of their site br br br Rumors confidential information and blacklisting br A good deal of information in the video game industry is kept under wraps by developers and publishers until the game s release even information regarding the selection of voice actors is kept under high confidential agreements However rumors and leaks of such information still fall into the hands of video game journalists often from anonymous sources from within game development companies and it becomes a matter of journalistic integrity whether to publish this information or not br Kotaku has self reported on the downsides of reporting unrevealed information and dealing with subsequent video game publisher backlash as a result In the site published information about the then upcoming PlayStation Home before Sony had announced it and Sony severed its relationship with Kotaku When Kotaku reported this on their site readers complained to Sony about this and Sony reversed its decision Kotaku has also published significant detailed histories on troubled game development for titles such as for Doom and Prey as well as announcing titles months in advance from the publisher In November the site reported they had been blacklisted by Bethesda and Ubisoft for at least a year they no longer got review copies nor received press information from the publishers nor can interact with any of their company s representatives br br br New Games Journalism br New Games Journalism NGJ is a video game journalism term coined by journalist Kieron Gillen in in which personal anecdotes references to other media and creative analyses are used to explore game design play and culture It is a model of New Journalism applied to video game journalism A article in the New Yorker claimed that the term New Games Journalism never caught on but the impulse that video games deserved both observational and personal approaches is quite valid It cites author Tom Bissell and his book Extra Lives Why Video Games Matter as a good example of this type of gaming journalism br br br Retro game reviews br As retrogaming grew in popularity so did reviews and examinations of older video games This is primarily due to feelings of nostalgia to video games people have grown up with which according to professor Clay Routledge may be more powerful than similar nostalgic emotions caused by other artforms such as music br br br See also br List of books about video games br List of video game magazines br br br br br br Further reading br br br External links br br Ten Unmissable Examples of New Games
