Video game art is a form of computer art employing video games as the artistic medium Video game art often involves the use of patched or modified video games or the repurposing of existing games or game structures however it relies on a broader range of artistic techniques and outcomes than artistic modification and it may also include painting sculpture appropriation in game intervention and performance sampling etc It may also include the creation of art games either from scratch or by modifying existing games br Notable examples of video game art include Cory Arcangel s Super Mario Clouds and I Shot Andy Warhol Joseph Delappe s projects including Dead in Iraq and the Salt Satyagraha Online Gandhi s March to Dandi in Second Life the Rhizome Commissions relating to the theme of games Paolo Pedercini s Molleindustria games such as Unmanned and Every Day the Same Dream and Ian Bogost s Cowclicker br Artistic modifications are frequently made possible through the use of level editors though other techniques exist Some artists make use of machinima applications to produce non interactive animated artworks however artistic modification is not synonymous with machinima as these form only a small proportion of artistic modifications Machinima is distinct from art mods as it relies on different tools though there are many similarities with some art mods br Like video games artistic game modifications are often interactive and may allow for single player or multiplayer experience Multiplayer works make use of networked environments to develop new kinds of interaction and collaborative art production br br br Techniques br br br Machinima br br Machinima is the use of real time three dimensional D graphics rendering engines to generate computer animation The term also refers to works that incorporate this animation technique br br br In game intervention and performance br Artists may intervene in online games in a non play manner often disrupting games in progress in order to challenge or expose underlying conventions and functions of game play Examples of this include Anne Marie Schleiner s Velvet Strike a project designed to allow players of realistic first person shooter games to use anti war graffiti within the game to make an artistic statement and Dead in Iraq an art project created by Joseph DeLappe in which the player character purposely allows himself to be shot and then recites the names of US soldiers who have died in the Iraq War br br br Site specific installations and site relative mods br Site specific installations and site relative gaming modifications mods replicate real world places often the art gallery in which they are displayed to explore similarities and differences between real and virtual worlds An example is What It Is Without the Hand That Wields It where blood from kills in Counterstrike manifests and spills into a real life gallery br br br Real time performance instruments br Video games can be incorporated into live audio and visual performance using a variety of instruments and computers such as electronic keyboards embedded with music chips See also chiptune and the Fijuu project br br br Generative art mods br Generative art mods exploit the real time capabilities of game technologies to produce ever renewing autonomous artworks Examples include Julian Oliver s ioq apaint a generative painting system that uses the actions of software agents in combat to drive the painting process Alison Mealy s UnrealArt which takes the movements of game entities and uses them to control a drawing process in an external program Kent Sheely s Cities in Flux a Grand Theft Auto San Andreas mod that glitches and distorts the game s world in real time and RetroYou s R C Racer a modification of the graphic elements of a racing game which results in rich fields of colour and shape br br br See also br Art game br Adaptive music br Demoscene br Digital art br Electronic
