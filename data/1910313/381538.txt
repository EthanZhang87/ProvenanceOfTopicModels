The OODA loop observe orient decide act is a decision making model developed by military strategist and United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd He applied the concept to the combat operations process often at the operational level during military campaigns It is often applied to understand commercial operations and learning processes The approach explains how agility can overcome raw power in dealing with human opponents It is especially applicable to cyber security and cyberwarfare br The OODA loop has become an important concept in litigation business law enforcement management education and military strategy According to Boyd decision making occurs in a recurring cycle of observe orient decide act An entity whether an individual or an organization that can process this cycle quickly observing and reacting to unfolding events more rapidly than an opponent can thereby get inside the opponent s decision cycle and gain the advantage br Dominic Cummings Chief Advisor to the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson credited the success of the Vote Leave campaign in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum to its faster processing of OODA loops along with the focus of Vote Leave on disrupting the OODA loops of the opposing Britain Stronger in Europe campaign team br Some scholars are critical of the concept Aviation historian Michael Hankins for example writes that the OODA loop is vague enough that its defenders and attackers can each see what they want to see in it For some the OODA concept s flexibility is its strength but for others it becomes so generalized as to lose its usefulness He concludes that The OODA loop is merely one way among a myriad of ways of describing intuitive processes of learning and decision making that most people experience daily It is not incorrect but neither is it unique or especially profound br br br See also br br br br br br Bibliography br Boyd John R September Destruction and Creation PDF U S Army Command and General Staff College br Boyd John R The Essence of Winning and Losing June a five slide set by Boyd br Dreier A S Strategy Planning Litigating to Win Boston MA Conatus Press ISBN OCLC br Greene Robert OODA and You br Hillaker Harry Code one magazine John Boyd United States Air Force Retired Father of the F July br Linger Henry Constructing The Infrastructure for the Knowledge Economy Methods and Tools Theory and Practice p br Metayer Estelle Decision making It s all about taking off and landing safely Competia December br Osinga Frans Science Strategy and War The Strategic Theory of John Boyd br Richards Chet Certain to Win the Strategy of John Boyd Applied to Business ISBN br Ullman David G OO OO OO The Sound of a Broken OODA Loop Crosstalk April br br br External links br Archived documents br Video The OODA Loop and Clausewitzian Friction br Bazin A Boyd s OODA Loop and the Infantry Company Commander Infantry Magazine br OODA Loop Information Not Agility Is Life OODA Loop Information Not Agility Is Life br OODA Loop in Emergency Preparedness OODA Loop in Emergency Preparedness
