Packaging is the science art and technology of enclosing or protecting products for distribution storage sale and use Packaging also refers to the process of designing evaluating and producing packages Packaging can be described as a coordinated system of preparing goods for transport warehousing logistics sale and end use Packaging contains protects preserves transports informs and sells In many countries it is fully integrated into government business institutional industrial and for personal use br Package labeling American English or labelling British English is any written electronic or graphic communication on the package or on a separate but associated label Many countries or regions have regulations governing the content of package labels Merchandising branding and persuasive graphics are not covered in this article br br br History of packaging br br br Ancient era br br The first packages used the natural materials available at the time baskets of reeds wineskins bota bags wooden boxes pottery vases ceramic amphorae wooden barrels woven bags etc Processed materials were used to form packages as they were developed first glass and bronze vessels The study of old packages is an essential aspect of archaeology br The first usage of paper for packaging was sheets of treated mulberry bark used by the Chinese to wrap foods as early as the first or second century BC br The usage of paper like material in Europe was when the Romans used low grade and recycled papyrus for the packaging of incense br The earliest recorded use of paper for packaging dates back to when a Persian traveller visiting markets in Cairo Arab Egypt noted that vegetables spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were sold br br br Modern era br br br Tinplate br The use of tinplate for packaging dates back to the th century The manufacturing of tinplate was the monopoly of Bohemia for a long time in Andrew Yarranton an English engineer and Ambrose Crowley brought the method to England where it was improved by ironmasters including Philip Foley By John Hanbury had a rolling mill at Pontypool for making Pontypoole Plates The method pioneered there of rolling iron plates by means of cylinders enabled more uniform black plates to be produced than was possible with the former practice of hammering br Tinplate boxes first began to be sold from ports in the Bristol Channel in The tinplate was shipped from Newport Monmouthshire By boxes were made and exported Tobacconists in London began packaging snuff in metal plated canisters from the s onwards br br br Canning br br With the discovery of the importance of airtight containers for food preservation by French inventor Nicholas Appert the tin canning process was patented by British merchant Peter Durand in After receiving the patent Durand did not himself follow up with canning food He sold his patent in to two other Englishmen Bryan Donkin and John Hall who refined the process and product and set up the world s first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road London By they were producing the first canned goods for the Royal Navy br The progressive improvement in canning stimulated the invention of the can opener Robert Yeates a cutlery and surgical instrument maker of Trafalgar Place West Hackney Road Middlesex UK devised a claw ended can opener with a hand operated tool that haggled its way around the top of metal cans In another lever type opener of a more complex shape was patented in the United States by Ezra Warner of Waterbury Connecticut br br br Paper based packaging br br Set up boxes were first used in the th century and modern folding cartons date back to The first corrugated box was produced commercially in in England Corrugated also called pleated paper received a British patent in and was used as a liner for tall hats Scottish born Robert Gair invented the pre cut paperboard box in flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes Gair s invention came about as a result of an accident as a Brooklyn printer and paper bag maker during the s he was once printing an order of seed bags and the metal ruler commonly used to crease bags shifted in position and cut them Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes br Commercial paper bags were first manufactured in Bristol England in and the American Francis Wolle patented a machine for automated bag making in br br br th century br Packaging advancements in the early th century included Bakelite closures on bottles transparent cellophane overwraps and panels on cartons These innovations increased processing efficiency and improved food safety As additional materials such as aluminum and several types of plastic were developed they were incorporated into packages to improve performance and functionality br br In Michigan State University became the first university in the world to offer a degree in Packaging Engineering br In plant recycling has long been typical for producing packaging materials Post consumer recycling of aluminum and paper based products has been economical for many years since the s post consumer recycling has increased due to curbside recycling consumer awareness and regulatory pressure br br Many prominent innovations in the packaging industry were developed first for military use Some military supplies are packaged in the same commercial packaging used for general industry Other military packaging must transport materiel supplies foods etc under severe distribution and storage conditions Packaging problems encountered in World War II led to Military Standard or mil spec regulations being applied to packaging which was then designated military specification packaging As a prominent concept in the military mil spec packaging officially came into being around due to operations in Iceland experiencing critical losses ultimately attributed to bad packaging In most cases mil spec packaging solutions such as barrier materials field rations antistatic bags and various shipping crates are similar to commercial grade packaging materials but subject to more stringent performance and quality requirements br As of the packaging sector accounted for about two percent of the gross national product in developed countries About half of this market was related to food packaging br In the global food packaging market size was estimated at USD billion exhibiting a CAGR of over the forecast period Growing demand for packaged food by consumers owing to quickening pace of life and changing eating habits is expected to have a major impact on the market br br br The purposes of packaging and package labels br Packaging and package labeling have several objectives br br Physical protection The objects enclosed in the package may require protection from among other things mechanical shock vibration electrostatic discharge compression temperature etc br Barrier protection A barrier to oxygen water vapor dust etc is often required Permeation is a critical factor in design Some packages contain desiccants or oxygen absorbers to help extend shelf life Modified atmospheres or controlled atmospheres are also maintained in some food packages Keeping the contents clean fresh sterile and safe for the duration of the intended shelf life is a primary function A barrier is also implemented in cases where segregation of two materials prior to end use is required as in the case of special paints glues medical fluids etc br Containment or agglomeration liquids and powders need to be contained for shipment and sale Small objects are typically grouped together in one package for reasons of storage and selling efficiency For example a single box of marbles requires less physical handling than single marbles Liquids powders and granular materials need containment br Information transmission Packages and labels communicate how to use transport recycle or dispose of the package or product With pharmaceuticals food medical and chemical products some types of information are required by government legislation Some packages and labels also are used for track and trace purposes Most items include their serial and lot numbers on the packaging and in the case of food products medicine and some chemicals the packaging often contains an expiry best before date usually in a shorthand form Packages may indicate their construction material with a symbol br Marketing Packaging and labels can be used by marketers to encourage potential buyers to purchase a product Package graphic design and physical design have been important and constantly evolving phenomena for several decades Marketing communications and graphic design are applied to the surface of the package and often to the point of sale display Most packaging is designed to reflect the brand s message and identity on the one hand while highlighting the respective product concept on the other hand br br Security Packaging can play an important role in reducing the security risks of shipment Packages can be made with improved tamper resistance to deter manipulation and they can also have tamper evident features indicating that tampering has taken place Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of package pilferage or the theft and resale of products Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage than other types and some have pilfer indicating seals Counterfeit consumer goods unauthorized sales diversion material substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such anti counterfeiting technologies Packages may include authentication seals and use security printing to help indicate that the package and contents are not counterfeit Packages also can include anti theft devices such as dye packs RFID tags or electronic article surveillance tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate Using packaging in this way is a means of retail loss prevention br Convenience Packages can have features that add convenience in distribution handling stacking display sale opening reclosing using dispensing reusing recycling and ease of disposal br Portion control Single serving or single dosage packaging has a precise amount of contents to control usage Bulk commodities such as salt can be divided into packages that are a more suitable size for individual households It also aids the control of inventory selling sealed one liter bottles of milk rather than having people bring their own bottles to fill themselves br Branding Positioning Packaging and labels are increasingly used to go beyond marketing to brand positioning with the materials used and design chosen key to the storytelling element of brand development Due to the increasingly fragmented media landscape in the digital age this aspect of packaging is of growing importance br br br Packaging types br br Packaging may be of several different types For example a transport package or distribution package can be the shipping container used to ship store and handle the product or inner packages Some identify a consumer package as one which is directed toward a consumer or household br Packaging may be described in relation to the type of product being packaged medical device packaging bulk chemical packaging over the counter drug packaging retail food packaging military materiel packaging pharmaceutical packaging etc br It is sometimes convenient to categorize packages by layer or function primary secondary etc br br Primary packaging is the material that first envelops the product and holds it This usually is the smallest unit of distribution or use and is the package which is in direct contact with the contents br Secondary packaging is outside the primary packaging and may be used to prevent pilferage or to group primary packages together br Tertiary or transit packaging is used for bulk handling warehouse storage and transport shipping The most common form is a palletized unit load that packs tightly into containers br These broad categories can be somewhat arbitrary For example depending on the use a shrink wrap can be primary packaging when applied directly to the product secondary packaging when used to combine smaller packages or tertiary packaging when used to facilitate some types of distribution such as to affix a number of cartons on a pallet br Packaging can also have categories based on the package form For example thermoform packaging and flexible packaging describe broad usage areas br br br Labels and symbols used on packages br br Many types of symbols for package labeling are nationally and internationally standardized For consumer packaging symbols exist for product certifications such as the FCC and T V marks trademarks proof of purchase etc Some requirements and symbols exist to communicate aspects of consumer rights and safety for example the CE marking or the estimated sign that notes conformance to EU weights and measures accuracy regulations Examples of environmental and recycling symbols include the recycling symbol the recycling code which could be a resin identification code and the Green Dot Food packaging may show food contact material symbols In the European Union products of animal origin which are intended to be consumed by humans have to carry standard oval shaped EC identification and health marks for food safety and quality insurance reasons br Bar codes Universal Product Codes and RFID labels are common to allow automated information management in logistics and retailing Country of origin labeling is often used Some products might use QR codes or similar matrix barcodes Packaging may have visible registration marks and other printing calibration and troubleshooting cues br The labelling of medical devices includes many symbols many of them covered by international standards foremost ISO br br br Consumer package contents br Several aspects of consumer package labeling are subject to regulation One of the most important is to accurately state the quantity weight volume count of the package contents Consumers expect that the label accurately reflects the actual contents Manufacturers and packagers must have effective quality assurance procedures and accurate equipment even so there is inherent variability in all processes br Regulations attempt to handle both sides of this In the US the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act provides requirements for many types of products Also NIST has Handbook Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods This is a procedural guide for compliance testing of net contents and is referenced by several other regulatory agencies br Other regions and countries have their own regulatory requirements For example the UK has its Weights and Measures Packaged Goods Regulations as well as several other regulations In the EEA products with hazardous formulas need to have a UFI br br br Shipping container labeling br br Technologies related to shipping containers are identification codes bar codes and electronic data interchange EDI These three core technologies serve to enable the business functions in the process of shipping containers throughout the distribution channel Each has an essential function identification codes either relate product information or serve as keys to other data bar codes allow for the automated input of identification codes and other data and EDI moves data between trading partners within the distribution channel br Elements of these core technologies include UPC and EAN item identification codes the SCC UPC shipping container code the SSCC Serial Shipping Container Codes Interleaved of and UCC EAN newly designated GS bar code symbologies and ANSI ASC X and UN EDIFACT EDI standards br Small parcel carriers often have their own formats For example United Parcel Service has a MaxiCode D code for parcel tracking br RFID labels for shipping containers are also increasingly used A Wal Mart division Sam s Club has also moved in this direction and is putting pressure on its suppliers to comply br Shipments of hazardous materials or dangerous goods have special information and symbols labels placards etc as required by UN country and specific carrier requirements On transport packages standardized symbols are also used to communicate handling needs Some are defined in the ASTM D Standard Practice for Pictorial Markings for Handling of Goods and ISO Pictorial marking for handling of goods br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Package development considerations br Package design and development are often thought of as an integral part of the new product development process Alternatively the development of a package or component can be a separate process but must be linked closely with the product to be packaged br Package design starts with the identification of all the requirements structural design marketing shelf life quality assurance logistics legal regulatory graphic design end use environmental etc The design criteria performance specified by package testing completion time targets resources and cost constraints need to be established and agreed upon Package design processes often employ rapid prototyping computer aided design computer aided manufacturing and document automation br br An example of how package design is affected by other factors is its relationship to logistics When the distribution system includes individual shipments by a small parcel carrier the sorting handling and mixed stacking make severe demands on the strength and protective ability of the transport package If the logistics system consists of uniform palletized unit loads the structural design of the package can be designed to meet those specific needs such as vertical stacking for a longer time frame A package designed for one mode of shipment may not be suited to another br With some types of products the design process involves detailed regulatory requirements for the packaging For example any package components that may contact foods are designated food contact materials br Toxicologists and food scientists need to verify that such packaging materials are allowed by applicable regulations Packaging engineers need to verify that the completed package will keep the product safe for its intended shelf life with normal usage Packaging processes labeling distribution and sale need to be validated to assure that they comply with regulations that have the well being of the consumer in mind br Sometimes the objectives of package development seem contradictory For example regulations for an over the counter drug might require the package to be tamper evident and child resistant These intentionally make the package difficult to open The intended consumer however might be disabled or elderly and unable to readily open the package Meeting all goals is a challenge br Package design may take place within a company or with various degrees of external packaging engineering independent contractors consultants vendor evaluations independent laboratories contract packagers total outsourcing etc Some sort of formal project planning and project management methodology is required for all but the simplest package design and development programs An effective quality management system and Verification and Validation protocols are mandatory for some types of packaging and recommended for all br br br Environmental considerations br br Package development involves considerations of sustainability environmental responsibility and applicable environmental and recycling regulations It may involve a life cycle assessment br which considers the material and energy inputs and outputs to the package the packaged product contents the packaging process the logistics system waste management etc It is necessary to know the relevant regulatory requirements for point of manufacture sale and use br The traditional three R s of reduce reuse and recycle are part of a waste hierarchy which may be considered in product and package development br br Prevention Waste prevention is a primary goal Packaging should be used only where needed Proper packaging can also help prevent waste Packaging plays an important part in preventing loss or damage to the packaged product contents Usually the energy content and material usage of the product being packaged are much greater than that of the package A vital function of the package is to protect the product for its intended use if the product is damaged or degraded its entire energy and material content may be lost br Minimization also source reduction Eliminate overpackaging The mass and volume of packaging per unit of contents can be measured and used as criteria for minimizing the package in the design process Usually reduced packaging also helps minimize costs Packaging engineers continue to work toward reduced packaging br Reuse Reusable packaging is encouraged Returnable packaging has long been useful and economically viable for closed loop logistics systems Inspection cleaning repair and recouperage are often needed Some manufacturers re use the packaging of the incoming parts for a product either as packaging for the outgoing product or as part of the product itself br Recycling Recycling is the reprocessing of materials pre and post consumer into new products Emphasis is focused on recycling the largest primary components of a package steel aluminum papers plastics etc Small components can be chosen which are not difficult to separate and do not contaminate recycling operations Packages can sometimes be designed to separate components to better facilitate recycling br Energy recovery Waste to energy and refuse derived fuel in approved facilities make use of the heat available from incinerating the packaging components br Disposal Incineration and placement in a sanitary landfill are undertaken for some materials Certain US states regulate packages for toxic contents which have the potential to contaminate emissions and ash from incineration and leachate from landfill Packages should not be littered br Development of sustainable packaging is an area of considerable interest to standards organizations governments consumers packagers and retailers br Sustainability is the fastest growing driver for packaging development particularly for packaging manufacturers that work with the world s leading brands as their CSR Corporate Social Responsibility targets often exceed those of the EU Directive br br br Packaging machinery br br Choosing packaging machinery includes an assessment of technical capabilities labor requirements worker safety maintainability serviceability reliability ability to integrate into the packaging line capital cost floorspace flexibility change over materials multiple products etc energy requirements quality of outgoing packages qualifications for food pharmaceuticals etc throughput efficiency productivity ergonomics return on investment etc br Packaging machinery can be br br purchased as standard off the shelf equipment br purchased custom made or custom tailored to specific operations br manufactured or modified by in house engineers and maintenance staff br Efforts at packaging line automation increasingly use programmable logic controllers and robotics br Packaging machines may be of the following general types br br Accumulating and collating machines br Blister packs skin packs and vacuum packaging machines br Bottle caps equipment over capping lidding closing seaming and sealing machines br Box case tray and carrier forming packing unpacking closing and sealing machines br Cartoning machines br Cleaning sterilizing cooling and drying machines br Coding printing marking stamping and imprinting machines br Converting machines br Conveyor belts accumulating and related machines br Feeding orienting placing and related machines br Filling machines handling dry powdered solid liquid gas or viscous products br Inspecting visual sound metal detecting etc br Label dispenser br Orienting unscrambling machines br Package filling
