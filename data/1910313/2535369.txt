Evolutionary design continuous design evolutive design or incremental design is directly related to any modular design application in which components can be freely substituted to improve the design modify performance or change another feature at a later time br Software architects and software developers should use fitness functions to continuously keep the software system in check br br br Informatics br In particular it applies with the name continuous design to software development In this field it is a practice of creating and modifying the design of a system as it is developed rather than purporting to specify the system completely before development starts as in the waterfall model Continuous design was popularized by extreme programming Continuous design also uses test driven development and refactoring br Martin Fowler wrote a popular book called Refactoring as well as a popular article entitled Is Design Dead that talked about continuous evolutionary design James Shore wrote an article in IEEE titled Continuous Design br br br Industrial design Project br Modular design states that a product is made of subsystems that are joined together to create a full product The above design model defined in electronics and evolved in industrial design into well consolidated industrial standards related to platform concept and its evolution br br br See also br Rapid application development br Continuous integration br Evolutionary database design br br br br br br External links br Is Design Dead
