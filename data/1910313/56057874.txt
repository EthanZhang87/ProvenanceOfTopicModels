Fashion design copyright refers to the web of domestic and international laws that protect unique clothing or apparel designs The roots of fashion design copyright may be traced in Europe to as early as the th century br As of in most countries including the United States and the United Kingdom fashion design does not have the same protection as other creative works art film literature etc because apparel clothes shoes handbags etc are classified as functional items except when copyright laws can be applied This explains the success of the knockoff businesses to the detriment of established labels and emerging designers the latter ones being especially damaged because they rely on relatively few designs br br br History br French king Francis I gave out specific privileges related to the production of textiles By in Lyon illegalities were already being defined in regards to fashion materials and in in England and Scotland fashion designers had fruitfully pushed their needs for protection into basic legislation In Germany began protecting fashion patterns as well as models and in European regulation on designs that were new and provided an aspect of fresh character or aesthetic were brought under protection From to the total production volume for clothing decreased by about each year and by the European union trade deficit for clothing was at billion These statistics show that while there are benefits of their advanced design legislation the economic and external factors still hindered their industry growth in ways the U S can empathize with As came to a close WIPO or the World Intellectual Property Organization had registered twenty nine international designs br br br Current regulation br The protection of fashion design varies greatly from one country to the other br br br European Union br Unlike in the USA when the laws regarding the clothing industry were created in Europe the continent had a booming fashion industry that already started to reshape the clothing manufacturing industry br In the European Union the Creative Designs Directive and the European Designs Directive are in effect to protect new designs for three or five years The European Union Intellectual Property Office are responsible for managing intellectual property in the EU br br br United States br br The US laws written in identify fashion as a manufacturing industry rather than a creative one because fashion design had not reshaped the clothing manufacturing industry yet The Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA of originally brought more limits to fashion design copyrighting but a sui generis protection to the design of vessel hulls DMCA Title V Vessel Hull Design Protection Act or VHDPA was included to give more protection to some useful articles The House of Representatives deemed fit to enable tighter fashion design copyrights through an extension of the VHDPA There is no official design rights system so brands and companies have to use design patents a technical component of the design and trademarks names slogans logos to copyright their products Another option for highly recognizable fashion designs is to register it as a trade dress with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ex Herm s and the Birkin bag br In the Supreme Court case Star Athletica LLC v Varsity Brands Inc it was ruled that Fashion design can be covered by copyright br br an artistic feature of the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection if the feature can be perceived as a two or three dimensional work of art separate from the useful article and would qualify as a protectable pictorial graphic or sculptural work either on its own or in some other medium if imagined separately from the useful article This decision enhanced the protection of unique fashion works which are often knocked off by fast fashion retailers who turn the vast grey area of fashion copyrights into a profit br br br Infringement cases br From to Gucci and Guess were in a copyrights feud over the use of a logo Courts in the USA China and Australia had ruled in favor of Gucci while courts in France and Italy had ruled in favor of Guess br In Alexander McQueen destroyed all its products containing the Hells Angels trademarked winged death heads symbol after the motorcycle club threatened to sue br In the case of Yves Saint Laurent v Christian Louboutin a court ruled that a brand could reuse Louboutin s signature red on shoes as long as the whole shoe is covered in red because having only the soles in red was indeed a copyright violation br In the UK in the case of Adidas v Thom Browne a court ruled that Adidas stripe signature could be used by other brands br br br Societal impact br Researcher Johanna Blakley argues that the very lack of regulation of fashion design has allowed the fashion industry to do very well economically and has led to the birth of fast fashion and a much faster changing of fashion trends and has enabled pieces of clothing to become pieces of art She also refers to Tom Ford pointing out that the people who buy cheap lookalikes are a different demographic compared with people who buy the original very high end products and that while many exclusive designers get copied also the high end designers often attribute the inspiration of their creations to following street fashion so the copying is a two way street br br br Digital fashion copyrights br When a garment is replicated digitally the copyrights holder of the physical garment does not necessarily remain the copyrights holder of the digital garment For example if a design agency does D applications for a fashion company those D animations belong to the agency Licence agreements are essential if several agencies are involved Facing digitization the fashion industry may go through the same disruption the music and film industries went through br The Herm s v MetaBirkins case the copyrights holder of the Birkin bag the Herm s group filed a lawsuit against the company MetaBirkins which had created an almost identical NFT bag sold apiece It was ruled in that NFTs were not protected by the First Amendment and had to respect copyrighted fashion designs br br br See also br Design patent br br br br br br External links br How Is Fashion Protected by Copyright Law Copyrightalliance org br Fashion Design and
