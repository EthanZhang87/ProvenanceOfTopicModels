A design language or design vocabulary is an overarching scheme or style that guides the design of a complement of products or architectural settings creating a coherent design system for styling br br br Objectives br Designers wishing to give their suite of products a unique but consistent appearance and user interface can define a specification for it The specification can describe choices for design aspects such as materials color schemes shapes patterns textures or layouts They then follow the scheme in the design of each object in the suite br Usually design languages are not rigorously defined the designer basically makes one thing similarly as another In other cases they are followed strictly so that the products gain a strong thematic quality For example although there is a great variety of unusual chess set designs the pieces within a set are typically thematically consistent br Sometimes designers encourage others to follow their design languages when decorating or accessorizing br br br Industrial design br Industrial design is the process of designing products for mass production A design language can provide a range of products a similar style that sets it apart from competitors br In automotive design the design language often uses a signature grille design For instance many BMW vehicles share a design language including front end styling consisting of a split kidney grille and four circular headlights Some manufacturers have appropriated design language cues from rival firms br br br Examples br Apple used the Snow White design for its home computers in the s which used parallel stripes to give the impression that the enclosure was smaller than it actually was The Apple Industrial Design Group is responsible for the industrial design of all Apple products br Cadillac introduced the Art and Science design philosophy in which emphasized sharp and crisp edges what noted automotive journalist Dan Neil described as a fractal geometric style br Ford used the New Edge design language in the s and early s which combined intersecting arcs to create soft aerodynamic shapes Later Ford used Kinetic Design that featured a large lower trapezoidal grill on many vehicles br Mazda has used the Nagare design language which used flowing lines influenced by wind Mazda later used the Kodo design language br Other examples include the Dynamic Shield design language used by Mitsubishi and Dynamic x Solid used by Subaru br br br Software br In software architecture design languages are related to architecture description languages The most well known design language is Unified Modeling Language br In the context of graphical user interfaces for example human interface guidelines can be thought of as design languages for applications br br br Examples br Apple has created some software design languages The Platinum design language was used for Mac OS and and emphasized various shades of gray The Aqua design language was introduced with Mac OS X Jaguar and emphasized flatter interface elements and liberal use of reflection effects and transparency Brushed metal first used in was intended for programs such as QuickTime Player that mimic the operation or interface of common devices br Microsoft has used the Aero design language for Windows Vista and Windows The Aero design language used semitransparent glass like window borders as a distinctive feature The Metro design language focused on simplified icons absence of clutter and basic shapes Metro was used in many Microsoft products including Windows Windows Phone the Xbox and Xbox One The Fluent Design System was developed as a revamp of Metro in and used more motion depth and translucency effects br Google developed Material Design in which emphasizes smooth responsive animations and transitions padding and depth using lighting and shadows Many of Google s products have implemented Material Design including Android Android applications and web applications br Flat design is a design language and style that simplifies elements and colours It has influenced user interface design in Microsoft s Zune Android starting with Android iOS and OS X Yosemite br In the GNOME Project expanded its focus of Adwaita to allow it to prosper as a design language for GNOME br br br See also br Graphic design br Human interface guidelines br Object modeling language br Complementary architecture br Pattern language br User interface design br br br br br br External links br macOS Human Interface Guidelines
