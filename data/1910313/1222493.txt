title: Emergent gameplay
id: 1222493
Emergent gameplay refers to complex situations in video games board games or role playing games that emerge from the interaction of relatively simple game mechanics br Designers have attempted to encourage emergent play by providing tools to players such as placing web browsers within the game engine such as in Eve Online The Matrix Online providing XML integration tools and programming languages Second Life fixing exchange rates Entropia Universe and allowing a player to spawn any object they desire to solve a puzzle Scribblenauts br br br Intentional emergence br Intentional emergence occurs when some creative uses of the game are intended by the game designers Since the s and s board games and role playing games such as Cosmic Encounter or Dungeons Dragons have featured intentional emergence as a primary game function by supplying players with relatively simple rules or frameworks for play that intentionally encouraged them to explore creative strategies or interactions and exploit them toward victory or goal achievement br br br Creative solutions br Immersive sims such as Deus Ex and System Shock are games built around emergent gameplay These games give the player character a range of abilities and tools and a consistent game world established by rules but do not enforce any specific solution onto the player though the player may be guided into suggested solutions To move past a guard blocking a door the player could opt to directly attack the guard sneak up and knock the guard unconscious distract the guard to move away from their post or use parkour to reach an alternative opening well out of sight among other solutions In such games it may be possible to complete in game problems using solutions that the game designers did not foresee for example in Deus Ex designers were surprised to find players using wall mounted mines as pitons for climbing walls A similar concept exists for roguelike games where emergent gameplay is considered a high value factor by the Berlin Interpretation for roguelikes br Such emergence may also occur in games through open ended gameplay and sheer weight of simulated content like in Minecraft Dwarf Fortress or Space Station These games do not have any endgame criteria though they do similarly to immersive sims present a consistent and rule based world These games will often present the player with tutorials of what they could do within the game From this players may follow the intended way to play the game or can veer in completely different directions such as extravagant simulated machines within Minecraft br Certain classes of open ended puzzle games can also support emergent gameplay The line of games produced by Zachtronics such as Spacechem and Infinifactory are broadly considered programming puzzles where the player must assemble pieces of a mechanism to produce a specific product from various inputs The games otherwise have no limits in how many components can be used and how long the process needs to complete though through in game leaderboards players are encouraged to make more efficient solutions than their online friends While each puzzle is crafted to assure at least one possible solution exists players frequently find emergent solutions that may be more elegant use components in unexpected fashions or otherwise diverge greatly from the envisioned route br br br Emergent narrative br Some games do not use a pre planned story structure even non linear br In The Sims a story may emerge from the actions of the player But the player is given so much control that they are more creating a story than interacting with a story Emergent narrative would only partially be created by the player Warren Spector the designer of Deus Ex has argued that emergent narrative lacks the emotional impact of linear storytelling br Left Dead features a dynamic system for game dramatics pacing and difficulty called the Director The way the Director works is called Procedural narrative instead of having a difficulty which increases to a constant level the A I analyzes how the players fared in the game so far and tries to add subsequent events that would give them a sense of narrative br Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress also have emergent narrative features due to the abstraction of how elements are represented in game allowing system wide features to apply across multiple objects without the need to develop specialized assets for each different state this can create more realistic behavior for non player controlled entities that aid in the emergent narrative For example in Dwarf Fortress any of the living creatures in the game could gain the state of being intoxicated from alcohol creating random behavior in their movement from the intoxication but not requiring them to display anything uniquely different in contrast to a more representational game that would need new assets and models for a drunk creature Because these are abstract and interacting systems this can then create emergent behavior the developers had never anticipated br br br Unintentional emergence br Unintentional emergence occurs when creative uses of the video game were not intended by the game designers br br br Glitch or quirk based strategies br br Emergent gameplay can arise from a game s AI performing actions or creating effects unexpected by even the software developers This may be by either a software glitch the game working normally but producing unexpected results when played in an abnormal way or software that allows for AI development for example the unplanned genetic diseases that can occur in the Creatures series br In several games especially first person shooters game glitches or physics quirks can become viable strategies or even spawn their own game types In id Software s Quake series rocket jumping and strafe jumping are two such examples In the game Halo pressing the melee attack button B quickly followed by the reload button X and the primary fire button R trigger would result in the player not having to wait for the gun to be back in position to shoot after a melee attack Doing this has become known as BXR ing br Starsiege Tribes had a glitch in the physics engine which allowed players to ski up and down steep slopes by rapidly pressing the jump key gaining substantial speed in the process The exploitation of this glitch became central to the gameplay supplanting the vehicles that had been originally envisioned by the designers as the primary means of traversing large maps br Thanks to a programming oversight by Capcom the combo or combo notion was introduced with the fighting game Street Fighter II when skilled players learned that they could combine several attacks that left no time for their opponents to recover as long as they were timed correctly br The PlayStation version of the edition of the FIFA series featured a selection of new attacking skills like off the ball running and touch sensitive passing all of which were designed for analog controller use Particularly skilled players had been artificially manipulating these features into the game series since at least the edition by deft and rapid manipulation of the original non analogue stick PS controllers The game was relatively easy to beat on the hardest level on single player using a series of tricks from the instruction manual which the AI could not replicate consistently or defend against but long term players found that in trying to make the game attain to a more realistic football simulation by playing without using these tricks the simplistic in game AI would seem to respond by learning osmotically from the player with greater creativity from the opposition teams and an apparent learning intelligence in selecting off the ball players and shot direction things that were supposed to be impossible with the non analog controller br br br Changing game objectives br In online car racing games particularly Project Gotham Racing players came up with an alternative objective known as Cat and Mouse The racers play on teams of at least two cars Each team picks one very slow car as the mouse and their goal is to have their slow car cross the finish line first Thus the team members in faster cars aim to push their slow car into the lead and ram their opposing teams slow cars off the road br Completing games without getting certain items or by skipping seemingly required portions of gameplay results in sequence breaking a technique that has developed its own dedicated community Often speed of completion and or minimalist use of items are respectable achievements This technique has long been used in the Metroid game series and has developed into a community devoted to speedruns NetHack has over time codified many such challenges as conduct and acknowledges players who manage to finish characters with unbroken pacifist or vegetarian disciplines for example A comparable form of restricted gameplay has been implemented within World of Warcraft known as Iron Man leveling br A change in gameplay can be used to create a de facto minigame such as the Green Demon Challenge in Super Mario where the object is to avoid collecting a up which chases the player even passing through terrain while the player attempts to collect all red coins on a level Other challenges have been built around reaching normally unreachable areas or items sometimes using glitches or gameplaying tools or by completing a level without using an important game control such as the jump button or joystick br Machinima the use of computer animation from video game engines to create films began in The practice of recording deathmatches in id Software s computer game Quake was extended by adding a narrative thus changing the objective from winning to creating a film Later game developers provided increased support for creating machinima for example Lionhead Studios game The Movies is tailored for it br br br Real economy interaction br br Traders in MMOs with economic systems play purely to acquire virtual game objects or avatars which they then sell for real world money on auction websites or game currency exchange sites This results in the trader s play objective to make real money regardless of the original game designer s objectives br Many games prohibit currency trading in the EULA but it is still a common practice br Some players provide real world services like website design web hosting paid for with in game currency This can influence the economy of the game as players gain wealth power in the game unrelated to game events For example this strategy is used in Blizzard Entertainment s World of Warcraft br br br See also br Alternative reality game br
