Parametric design is a design method in which features such as building elements and engineering components are shaped based on algorithmic processes rather than direct manipulation In this approach parameters and rules establish the relationship between design intent and design response The term parametric refers to the input parameters that are fed into the algorithms br While the term now typically refers to the use of computer algorithms in design early precedents can be found in the work of architects such as Antoni Gaud Gaud used a mechanical model for architectural design see analogical model by attaching weights to a system of strings to determine shapes for building features like arches br Parametric modeling can be classified into two main categories br Propagation based systems where algorithms generate final shapes that are not predetermined based on initial parametric inputs br Constraint systems in which final constraints are set and algorithms are used to define fundamental aspects such as structures or material usage that satisfy these constraints br Form finding processes are often implemented through propagation based systems These processes optimize certain design objectives against a set of design constraints allowing the final form of the designed object to be found based on these constraints br Parametric tools enable reflection of both the associative logic and the geometry of the form generated by the parametric software The design interface provides a visual screen to support visualization of the algorithmic structure of the parametric schema to support parametric modification br The principle of parametric design can be defined as mathematical design where the relationship between the design elements are shown as parameters which could be reformulated to generate complex geometries these geometries are based on the elements parameters by changing these parameters new shapes are created simultaneously br On the parametric design software designers and engineers are free to add and adjust the parameters that affect the design results For example materials dimensions user requirements and user body data In the parametric design process the designer can reveal the versions of the project and the final product without going back to the beginning by establishing the parameters and establishing the relationship between the variables after creating the first model br In the parametric design process Any change of parameters like editing or developing will be automatically and immediately updated in the model which is like a short cut to the final model br br br Parameter br The word parameter derives from the Greek for para besides before or instead of metron measure If we look at the Greek origin of the word it becomes clear that the word means a term that stands in for or determines another measure br In parametric CAD software the term parameter usually signifies a variable term in equations that determine other values A parameter as opposed to a constant is characterized by having a range of possible values One of the most seductive powers of a parametric system is the ability to explore many design variations by modifying the value of a few controlling parameters br br br History early examples br br br Analogue parametric design br br One of the earliest instances of parametric design was the upside down model of churches by Antonio Gaudi In his design for the Church of Col nia G ell he created a model of strings weighted down with birdshot to create complex vaulted ceilings and arches By adjusting the position of the weights or the length of the strings he could alter the shape of each arch and observe the impact on the connected arches He placed a mirror at the bottom of the model to see how it would appear when built right side up br br br Features of Gaud s method br Gaud s analog method incorporated the main features of a computational parametric model input parameters equation output br The string length birdshot weight and anchor point location function as independent input parameters br The vertex locations of the points on the strings serve as the model s outcomes br The outcomes are derived using explicit functions in this case gravity or Newton s law of motion br By modifying individual parameters of these models Gaud could generate different versions of his model while ensuring the resulting structure would stand in pure compression Instead of manually calculating the results of parametric equations he could automatically derive the shape of the catenary curves through the force of gravity acting on the strings br br German architect Frei Otto also experimented with non digital parametric processes using soap bubbles to find optimal shapes of tensegrity structures such as in the Munich Olympic Stadium designed for the Summer Olympics in Munich br br br Architecture br br Nature has often served as inspiration for architects and designers Computer technology has provided designers and architects with the tools to analyze and simulate the complexity observed in nature and apply it to structural building shapes and urban organizational patterns In the s architects and designers began using computers running software developed for the aerospace and moving picture industries to animate form br One of the first architects and theorists to use computers for generating architecture was Greg Lynn His blob and fold architecture are early examples of computer generated architecture The new Terminal of Shenzhen Bao an International Airport completed in was designed by Italian architect Massimiliano Fuksas with parametric design support from engineering firm Knippers Helbig It serves as an example of the use of parametric design and production technologies in a large scale building br In the general architectural design all design aspects and their dimensions can be considered as parameters such as location orientation shape solar radiation and so on br The iterative process is an approach to continuously improving a concept design or product Creators produce a prototype test it tweak it and repeat the cycle with the goal of getting closer to the solution br In the case of parametric architecture iteration can in principle create variation at every pass through the same set of instructions Examples may include varying the size and shape of a floor plate as one builds a skyscraper or changing the angle of a modular cladding system as it is tiled over an undulating surface In addition to producing variation iteration can be a powerful tool for both optimization and for minimizing the time needed to achieve that optimization Using a fluid parametric system which can give immediate feedback a designer can generate solutions and test them rapidly by iterating through many possibilities each created with a different set of parameters br br br Urban design br Parametric urbanism focuses on the study and prediction of settlement patterns Architect Frei Otto identifies occupying and connecting as the two fundamental processes involved in all urbanization Parametric processes can help optimize pedestrian or vehicle circulation block and fa ade orientations and instantly compare the different performances of multiple urban design options br Parametric design techniques enable architects and urban designers to better address and respond to diverse urban contexts environmental challenges and social issues By integrating data and analysis into the design process parametric urbanism allows for more informed and adaptive solutions to urban design challenges ultimately leading to more resilient and sustainable urban environments br br br Industrial design br With the development of technology and the improvement of people s quality of life there are more and more factors that affect the final result of interior and furniture design Space form color line light color pattern and texture are all influencing elements br The parametric design method brings industrial designers more design possibilities The parametric design method gives furniture designers opportunities to challenge more complex furniture structures and create more complex shapes When dealing with ergonomic problems parametric design methods can help designers to create digital real use scenarios and provide more comfortable design concepts br Using design tables in the furniture industry to implement parametric design is useful when a large order is needed to be fulfilled with different sizes of the same model of furniture as it reduces work time and possibility of error br br br Software br br br See also br Design computing Computing as applied to design
