Fitness game exergame and gamercise portmanteaus of exercise and game are terms used for video games that are also a form of exercise Fitness games rely on technology that tracks body movement or reaction The genre has been used to challenge the stereotype of gaming as a sedentary activity and promoting an active lifestyle among gamers Fitness games are seen as evolving from technology aimed at making exercise more fun br br br History br The genre s roots can be found in game peripherals released in the eighties including the Joyboard a Atari peripheral developed by Amiga and released in the Power Pad or Family Trainer a peripheral for the Nintendo Entertainment System NES originally released by Bandai in and the Foot Craz released for the Atari in although all three had limited success Konami s Dance Dance Revolution was cited as one of the first major fitness games when it was ported from the arcade to PlayStation it sold over three million copies In the s a number of devices and games have used the exergame style to much success the EyeToy camera has sold over ten million units while Nintendo s Wii Fit has sold in excess of million copies By June health games were generating revenues of billion largely due to Wii Fit s million sales at the time The term exergaming entered the Collins English Dictionary in br The genre has been promoted as a way to improve users health through exercise but few studies have been undertaken to measure the health benefits Smaller trials have yielded mixed results and have shown that the respective traditional methods of exercise are superior to their video game equivalents Design considerations for fitness games include the need to balance the physical effectiveness of the exercise with the attractiveness of the gameplay with both factors needed to be adapted to the abilities of the player referred to as dual flow br br br s br Fitness games contain elements that were developed in the virtual reality community during the s The pioneer in this area was Autodesk which developed two systems the HighCycle and Virtual Racquetball The HighCycle was an exercise bike that a user would pedal through a virtual landscape If the user pedaled fast enough the virtual bike would take off and fly over the landscape Virtual Racquetball tracked the position and orientation of an actual racquet that was used to hit a virtual ball in a virtual environment This environment was shared with another user equipped with another tracked racquet allowing the two users to play each other over phone lines In both systems the users could wear the VPL eyephones an early head mounted display HMD that would provide more immersion for the user br The first true attempt at what would later be called Exertainment was the Atari Puffer project This was an exercise bike that would hook up to an Atari or system Forward speed was controlled by pedaling while steering and additional gameplay was handled by a handlebar mounted Gamepad The machine was nearly ready for production with several games Tumbleweeds and Jungle River Cruise when Atari declared bankruptcy and the Puffer project was abandoned The Joyboard for the Atari was also released in by the Amiga Corporation br In Japan Bandai dabbled in this space with the Family Trainer pad released in for the Famicom the Japanese version of the Nintendo Entertainment System In Nintendo acquired the North American rights to the pad and marketed it as the Power Pad in North America br The first fitness game system released to the market was the CompuTrainer by RacerMate Inc Designed as a training aid and motivational tool the CompuTrainer system allowed users to interactively ride on their own bicycle through a virtual landscape generated on an NES or Commodore by connecting their bike trainer unit directly to an external port on the game cartridge Two trainer units could be connected at a time for players to race virtually on screen while also displaying data such as speed power pedaling cadence heart rate and distance As riders raced virtually the cartridge sent a signal back to the CompuTrainer unit to dynamically change the bicycle s actual resistance based on what was happening on screen in real time with incline wind and drafting The product had a price that was far too high to be considered as an entertainment product but was affordable by dedicated athletes RacerMate released the Racermate Challenge I cartridge on the Commodore and the Racermate Challenge II cartridge on the NES RacerMate made the CompuTrainer until where its latest version runs using Microsoft Windows compatible software with extensive graphic and physiological capabilities br About the same time as the Computrainer Concept II introduced a computer attachment for their rowing machine This has become their eRow product and is used for both individual motivation as well as competition in indoor rowing leagues br br br s br During the s there was a surge of interest in the application of virtual reality to high end gym equipment Life Fitness and Nintendo partnered to produce the Exertainment System Precor had an LCD based bike product and Universal had several CRT based systems The Netpulse system provided users with the ability to browse the web while exercising Fitlinxx introduced a system that used sensors attached to weight machines in order to provide automated feedback to users br Three issues combined to ensure the failure of these systems in the marketplace First they were significantly more expensive than the equivalent models that did not have all the additional electronics Second they were harder to maintain and were often left broken Lastly the additional expertise required to operate the software was often intimidating to the users who shied away from the machines out of fear that they would look foolish while trying to master the machine br Until nothing significant happened in the field of videogame exercise Hardware was still too expensive for the average home consumer and the health clubs were gun shy about adopting any new technology As high performance game console capabilities improved and prices fell manufacturers once more started to explore the fitness market br In Konami s Dance Dance Revolution was released Pump It Up a dance game similar to Konami s was released in by the company Andamiro br br br s br In UK startup Exertris introduced an interactive gaming bike to the commercial fitness market br Fitness games came to the mass media attention at the Consumer Electronics Show when Bill Gates showcased the Exertris Interactive Gaming Bike in and the following year the same show hosted a pavilion dedicated to video game technology that also worked as sports and exercise equipment br br The release of the EyeToy Kinetic brought the first multi function fitness game hardware into the home market Making the players physical movements into the game s controller saw the launch of Gamercize combining traditional fitness equipment with game consoles The minimalist approach allows game play to continue only when exercising turning all game titles into potential fitness games br Nintendo s Wii in brought acceleration detection with the Wii Remote In late Nintendo released Wii Fit which utilized a new peripheral the Wii Balance Board The popularity of the Wii led to it being used in hospital Wiihab rehabilitation programs br The PCGamerBike appeared at CES in where it received an Honoree Award It differs from other fitness game devices in that its pedal motion can be mapped to any key on the keyboard It also has an optical encoder which detects forward and reverse pedal motion The Fisher Price Smart Cycle was another entry in the field br Other examples of fitness game products include Positive Gaming iDANCE iSTEP Cobalt Flux Blufit Cyber coach NeoRacer Gymkids exercise equipment with interactive technology some Wii titles such as EA Sports Active Cybex TRAZER Powergrid Fitness Kilowatt Lightspace Play Floor PlayMotion Yourself Fitness Expresso Fitness S i play Cyber ExerCycle VEQTOR Sport Trainer and Sportwall br br br s br Microsoft s Kinect was the first major consumer focused body motion tracking hardware Games such as Just Dance and Nike Kinect Training used Kinect to make physical body motion into a method of control for games The trend within consoles that started with the Wii peaked with the pedometer pairing Wii Fit U These were followed up in the eighth generation by a fitness game push by Microsoft with the Xbox One launch day Xbox Fitness service which tracked metrics such as heart rate and correct form while synchronising these metrics with the Microsoft Health By Microsoft had pivoted away from Kinect and fitness games on consoles In Nintendo released Fitness Boxing and Ring Fit Adventure for the Nintendo Switch which take advantage of the Joy Con controllers acting as motion detectors in multiple areas of the body br Mobile phone apps such as Zombies Run Run An Empire Ingress and Pok mon Go have been described as augmented reality exergames br Virtual reality VR is emerging as a new interface method for fitness games Games like Beat Saber Holodance OhShape and others allow players to get good exercise while playing a video game br br br s br Fitness games gained in popularity during the COVID pandemic Ring Fit Adventure sold out at most retailers worldwide and saw a price increase from to on reselling websites Nintendo also released Jump Rope Challenge for free and for a limited time in an effort to keep Nintendo Switch owners active while in quarantine However Nintendo later announced that the game would remain on the Nintendo eShop until further notice As of September players of the game had recorded billion jumps in total br The COVID pandemic also caused delays in the industry One reason Ring Fit Adventure did not have enough supply to meet demand was that China was hit early by the pandemic leading to manufacturing shortages The pandemic also delayed several VR products such as the Valve Index and titles such as Marvel s Iron Man VR and Little Witch Academia VR Broom Racing br Fitness games also proved to be especially helpful during the COVID pandemic as they were a great motivator for physical activity which fought the sedentary lifestyle lockdowns caused Physical fitness is known to aid in disease prognosis as it boosts the immune system shortened the recovery period from COVID and reduced the negative effects of stress from living in isolation br Overwhelmed medical centers also turned to therapeutic fitness games during the COVID pandemic as they proved to be more socially distant required less direct supervision and used less personal protective equipment These games can be adjusted for each patients exercise needs making them suitable for the COVID patients whose mobility became limited or elderly patients who were affected by COVID at an increased rate br br br Effectiveness br Laboratory studies have demonstrated that some fitness games can provide light to moderate intensity physical activity br Recreational fitness games can also be useful for rehabilitation While they are not always as adjustable as therapeutic fitness games recreational fitness games can still help maintain an adequate amount of physical activity can help those without access to traditional rehabilitation and can prolong the benefits of in hospital rehabilitation However recreational fitness games might require more supervision as they are less likely to exercise the correct muscles as therapeutic fitness games br Exercise games have also proven to be an effective supplement for rehabilitation programs during the COVID pandemic including balance rehabilitation for the elderly Children are oftentimes more receptive to the idea of fitness games making it an especially helpful tool in motivating ill children in their rehabilitation efforts br A systematic review found that exercise games could reduce BMI and improve body fat percentage and cardiorespiratory fitness br A systematic review found that fitness games can be utilized to augment treatment for a variety of patient populations such as geriatrics and those with Parkinson s disease cerebral palsy and spinal cord injuries br A systematic review and meta analysis found that fitness games are effective for improving muscle tension muscle strength activities of daily living ADL joint range of motion gait balance and kinematics The review also suggested that fitness games may be more effective at improving dynamic balance control and preventing falls in subacute and chronic stroke patients when compared to current treatment methods br A systematic review in the Journal of Medical Internet Research of randomized trials studying the Social Effects of Exergames on Older Adults found that the majority of exergame studies demonstrated promising results for enhanced social well being such as reduction of loneliness increased social connection and positive attitudes towards others br Another systematic review of randomised controlled trials of fitness games in overweight children found that they can produce a small reduction in body mass index br As of fitness games for those with neurological disabilities had been studied in around small clinical trials in people of all ages to see if it can help this group get enough physical exercise to maintain their health This mode of getting exercise appears attractive in this population from a public health perspective because of its low cost and accessibility Fitness games have the potential to provide moderate intensity exercises in this population but the evidence was too weak on long term follow up to draw strong conclusions br There is significant evidence across multiple random controlled trials relating fitness games to improved cognitive functioning in healthy older adults with a mean age of and attenuated deterioration or improvement in adults with cognitive impairment from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s disease br In addition studies investigated if fitness games can lead to improvements in cognitive performance in clinical and non clinical populations such as those who have ADHD and depression There are first encouraging results but the empirical evidence still is limited br Studies have shown that fitness games help manage anxiety in several ways Fitness games help lower anxiety levels in various clinical populations such as patients with Parkinson s disease enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation with fibromyalgia and with systemic lupus erythematosus by introducing more permanent positive physiological changes than methods that do not involve exercise do br Fitness games are accessible to many disabled patients as some have settings that allow the game to remember a person s range of motion whether they have any assistive devices and general physical ability br br br Safety br br Fitness games have been shown to be safe and cost effective when used for stroke rehabilitation Virtual environments allow patients to practice skills that would otherwise be unsafe in real world scenarios A stroke patient with compromised balance for example could practice crossing the street in a simulated environment something that would be risky and unsafe in real time Fitness games can also make typical rehab exercises safer Implementing virtual obstacles instead of physical obstacles in balance training exercises for example mitigates the risk of falls while increasing a patient s confidence br br br Design trends br When making a fitness game system the manufacturer of a consumer product must make the decision as to whether the system will be usable with off the shelf games or if custom software must be written for it Because it takes longer for a user to move their entire body in response to stimulation from the game it is often the case that dedicated software must be written for the game to playable An example of this is Konami s Dance Dance Revolution Though designed to be played by users moving about on a specially designed dancepad that game can alternatively be played by pushing buttons with one s fingers using a standard hand held gamepad When played with the dancepad at higher levels the game can be quite challenging and physically exhausting but if the game is played using the buttons on the hand controller none of the sequences are physically limited br Newer systems such as Xbox PlayStation and Wii use alternative input devices such as the Kinect and PlayStation Move The Move uses image analysis to extract the motion of the user against a background and uses these motions to control the character in the game A specifically designed exercise game Kinect superimposes animated objects to be punched kicked or otherwise interacted with over a video image of the user The Wii and PlayStation both incorporate motion sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes into the hand held controllers that are used to direct behaviors within the game br Research projects such as exertion interfaces that investigate the design aspects of these games explore how the technological augmentation that comes with the digital gameplay component can be nurtured for additional benefits such as utilizing the social power of exercising together even though players are connected only over a network or scaling the number of players enabling novel exercise experiences not available without the technological augmentation br One of the newest trends is using virtual reality immersion VR systems have several potential advantages for athletic training environments can be precisely controlled and scenarios standardized augmented information can be incorporated to guide performance and the environment can be dynamically altered to create different competitive situations High frame rate display technologies for example head mounted display can be used to transform the user into any sporting situation e g a track cycling veledrome Natural movements can also be incorporated into the games for example utilizing an omnidirectional treadmill such as the Infinadeck Such a system allows the user to virtually be in the game while allowing degrees of movement While the technology is new it is showing promising results in weight management as well as in high participation rates br br br br br br Further reading br Sinclair J Hingston P Masek M Considerations for the design of exergames
