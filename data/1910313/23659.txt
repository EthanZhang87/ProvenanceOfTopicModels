title: Plug-in (computing)
id: 23659
In computing a plug in or plugin add in addin add on or addon is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program When a program supports plug ins it enables customization br A theme or skin is a preset package containing additional or changed graphical appearance details achieved by the use of a graphical user interface GUI that can be applied to specific software and websites to suit the purpose topic or tastes of different users to customize the look and feel of a piece of computer software or an operating system front end GUI and window managers br br br Purpose and examples br Applications may support plug ins to br br enable third party developers to extend an application br support easily adding new features br reduce the size of an application by not loading unused features br separate source code from an application because of incompatible software licenses br Types of applications and why they use plug ins br br Digital audio workstations and audio editing software use audio plug ins to generate process or analyze sound Ardour Audacity Cubase FL Studio Logic Pro X and Pro Tools are examples of such systems br Email clients use plug ins to decrypt and encrypt email Pretty Good Privacy is an example of such plug ins br Video game console emulators often use plug ins to modularize the separate subsystems of the devices they seek to emulate For example the PCSX emulator makes use of video audio optical etc plug ins for those respective components of the PlayStation br Graphics software use plug ins to support file formats and process images A Photoshop plug in may do this br Media players use plug ins to support file formats and apply filters foobar GStreamer Quintessential VST Winamp XMMS are examples of such media players br Packet sniffers use plug ins to decode packet formats OmniPeek is an example of such packet sniffers br Remote sensing applications use plug ins to process data from different sensor types e g Opticks br Text editors and Integrated development environments use plug ins to support programming languages or enhance the development process e g Visual Studio RAD Studio Eclipse IntelliJ IDEA jEdit and MonoDevelop support plug ins Visual Studio itself can be plugged into other applications via Visual Studio Tools for Office and Visual Studio Tools for Applications br Web browsers have historically used executables as plug ins though they are now mostly deprecated Examples include the Adobe Flash Player a Java virtual machine for Java applets QuickTime Microsoft Silverlight and the Unity Web Player Browser extensions which are a separate type of installable module are still widely in use br br br Mechanism br br The host application provides services which the plug in can use including a way for plug ins to register themselves with the host application and a protocol for the exchange of data with plug ins Plug ins depend on the services provided by the host application and do not usually work by themselves Conversely the host application operates independently of the plug ins making it possible for end users to add and update plug ins dynamically without needing to make changes to the host application br Programmers typically implement plug ins as shared libraries which get dynamically loaded at run time HyperCard supported a similar facility but more commonly included the plug in code in the HyperCard documents called stacks themselves Thus the HyperCard stack became a self contained application in its own right distributable as a single entity that end users could run without the need for additional installation steps Programs may also implement plug ins by loading a directory of simple script files written in a scripting language like Python or Lua br br br Mozilla definition br br In Mozilla Foundation definitions the words add on extension and plug in are not synonyms Add on can refer to anything that extends the functions of a Mozilla application Extensions comprise a subtype albeit the most common and the most powerful one Mozilla applications come with integrated add on managers that similar to package managers install update and manage extensions The term plug in however strictly refers to NPAPI based web content renderers Mozilla deprecated plug ins for its products But UXP based applications like web browsers Pale Moon and Basilisk keep supporting NPAPI plug ins br br br Helper application br A helper application is an external viewer program like IrfanView or Adobe Reader that displays content retrieved using a web browser Unlike a plugin whose full code would be included in the browser s address space a helper application is a standalone application Web browsers choose an appropriate helper application based on a file s Media type as indicated by the filename extension br br br History br In the mid s the EDT text editor ran on the Unisys VS operating system for the UNIVAC Series mainframe computer It allowed a program to be run from the editor which can access the in memory edit buffer The plug in executable could call the editor to inspect and change the text The University of Waterloo Fortran compiler used this to allow interactive compilation of Fortran programs br Early personal computer software with plug in capability included HyperCard and QuarkXPress on the Apple Macintosh both released in In Silicon Beach Software included plug in capability in Digital Darkroom and SuperPaint br br br See also br Applet br Browser extension br br br
