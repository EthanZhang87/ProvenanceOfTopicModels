Transgenerational design is the practice of making products and environments compatible with those physical and sensory impairments associated with human aging and which limit major activities of daily living The term transgenerational design was coined in by Syracuse University industrial design professor James J Pirkl to describe and identify products and environments that accommodate and appeal to the widest spectrum of those who would use them the young the old the able the disabled without penalty to any group br The transgenerational design concept emerged from his federally funded design for aging research project Industrial design Accommodations A Transgenerational Perspective The project s two seminal publications provided detailed information about the aging process informed and sensitized industrial design professionals and design students about the realities of human aging and offered a useful set of guidelines and strategies for designing products that accommodate the changing needs of people of all ages and abilities br br br Overview br The transgenerational design concept establishes a common ground for those who are committed to integrating age and ability within the consumer population Its underlying principle is that people including those who are aged or impaired have an equal right to live in a unified society br Transgenerational design practice recognizes that human aging is a continuous dynamic process that starts at birth and ends with death and that throughout the aging process people normally experience occurrences of illness accidents and declines in physical and sensory abilities that impair one s independence and lifestyle But most injuries impairments and disabilities typically occur more frequently as one grows older and experiences the effects of senescence biological aging Four facts clarify the interrelationship of age with physical and sensory vulnerability br br young people become old br young people can become disabled br old people can become disabled br disabled people become old br Within each situation consumers expect products and services to fulfill and enhance their lifestyle both physically and symbolically Transgenerational design focuses on serving their needs through what Cagan and Vogel call a value oriented product development process They note that a product is deemed of value to a customer if it offers a strong effect on lifestyle enabling features and meaningful ergonomics resulting in products that are useful usable and desirable during both short and long term use by people of all ages and abilities p br Transgenerational design is framed as a market aware response to population aging that fulfills the need for products and environments that can be used by both young and old people living and working in the same environment p br br br Benefits br Transgenerational design benefits all ages and abilities by creating a harmonious bond between products and the people that use them It satisfies the psychological physiological and sociological factors desired and anticipated by users of all ages and abilities p br br Safety br Comfort br Convenience br Usability br Ergonomics br Accommodation br Transgenerational design addresses each element and accommodates the user regardless of age or ability by providing a sympathetic fit and unencumbered ease of use Such designs provide greater accessibility by offering wider options and more choices thereby preserving and extending one s independence and enhancing the quality of life for all ages and abilities at no group s expense br Transgenerational designs accommodate rather than discriminate and sympathize rather than stigmatize They do this by br br bridging the transitions across life s stages br responding to the widest range of individual differences br helping people remain active and independent br adapting to changing sensory and physical needs br maintaining one s dignity and self respect br enabling one to choose the appropriate means to accomplish activities of daily living br br br History br Transgenerational design emerged during the mid s coincident with the conception of universal design an outgrowth of the disability rights movement and earlier barrier free concepts In contrast transgenerational design grew out of the Age Discrimination Act of which prohibited discrimination on the basis of age in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance or excluding denying or providing different or lesser services on the basis of age The ensuing political interest and debate over the Act s amendments which abolished mandatory retirement at age made the issues of aging a major public policy concern by injecting it into the mainstream of societal awareness br br br Background br At the start of the s the oldest members of the population having matured during the Great Depression were being replaced by a generation of Baby Boomers steadily reaching middle age and approaching the threshold of retirement Their swelling numbers signaled profound demographic changes ahead that would steadily expand the aging population throughout the world br Advancements in medical research were also changing the image of old age from a social problem of the sick poor and senile whose solutions depend on public policy to the emerging reality of an active aging population having vigor resources and time to apply both br Responding to the public s growing awareness the media public policy and some institutions began to recognize the impending implications Time and Newsweek devoted cover stories to the Greying of America Local radio stations began replacing their rock and roll formats with music targeted to more mature tastes The Collegiate Forum Dow Jones Co Inc devoted its Fall issue entirely to articles on the aging work force A National Research Conference on Technology and Aging and the Office of Technological Assessment of the House of Representatives initiated a major examination of the impact of science and technology on older Americans br In the National Endowment for the Arts the Administration on Aging the Farmer s Home Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development signed an agreement to improve building landscape product and graphic design for older Americans which included new research applications for old age that recognized the potential for making products easier to use by the elderly and therefore more appealing and profitable br br br Development br In recognizing the implications of population aging Syracuse University s Department of Design All University Gerontology Center and Center for Instructional Development initiated and collaborated on an interdisciplinary project Industrial Design Accommodations A Transgenerational Perspective The year long project supported by a Federal grant joined the knowledge base of gerontology with the professional practice of industrial design br The project defined the three aspects of aging as physiological sociological and psychological and divided the designer s responsibility into aesthetic technological and humanistic concerns br The strong interrelationship between the physiological aspects of aging and industrial design s humanistic aspects established the project s instructional focus and categorized the physiological aspects of aging as the sensory and physical factors of vision hearing touch and movement This interrelationship was translated into a series of reference tables which related specific physical and sensory factors of aging and were included in the resulting set of design guidelines to br br sensitize designers and design students to the aging process br provide them with appropriate knowledge about this process br accommodate the changing needs of our transgenerational population br The project produced and published two instructional manuals one for instructors and one for design professionals each containing a detailed set of design guidelines and strategies for designing transgenerationalproducts Under terms of the grant instructional manuals were distributed to all academic programs of industrial design recognized by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design NASAD br br br Chronology br The term transgenerational design first appears to have been publicly recognized and acknowledged by the Bristol Myers Company in its annual report which stated The trend towards transgenerational design seems to be catching on in some fields noting that transgenerational design has the added advantage of circumventing the stigmatizing label of being old br The results of the Federal grant project were first presented at the national conference Exploration Technological Innovations for an Aging Population supported in part by the American Association of Retired Persons AARP and the National Institute on Aging The proceedings focused on current efforts to address the impact of technology and an aging population identification of high impact issues and problems innovative ideas and potential solutions br Also in Design News the Japanese design magazine introduced the new concept of transgenerational design for coping with the needs of an aging population and its strategy stating that the impact will soon be felt by all global institutions and alter the present course of industrial design practice and education br The OXO company introduced the first group of Good Grips kitchen tools to the U S Market These ergonomically designed transgenerational tools set a new standard for the industry and raised the bar to consumer expectation for comfort and performance Sam Farber OXOs founder stated that population trends demand transgenerational products products that will be useful to you throughout the course of your life because it extends the life of a product and its materials by anticipating the whole experience of the user br The Fall issue of the Design Management Journal addressed the issue of Responsible Design and introduced the transgenerational design concept in the article Transgenerational Design A Strategy Whose Time Has Arrived The article presented a description the rationale and examples of early transgenerational products and offered insights on the rationale and benefits of such a transgenerational approach br The September October issue of AARP The Magazine exposed the transgenerational design concept to the readers in a featured article This Bold House describing the concept details and benefits of a transgenerational house The article noted that easy grip handles flat thresholds and adjustable height vanities are just the beginning in the world s most accessible house providing families of all ages and abilities with what they will want and need their whole lives br In November the transgenerational design concept was introduced in presentations to the European design community at the international symposiums Designing for Our Future Selves held at the Royal College of Art in London and the Netherlands Design Institute in Rotterdam br The book Transgenerational Design Products for an Aging Population Pirkl may be regarded as the prime mover of the widespread acceptance and practice of the transgenerational design concept It presented the first specialized content and photographic examples of transgenerational products and environments offering practical strategies in response to population aging along with case study examples based on applying a better understanding of age related capabilities It introduced the transgenerational design concept to the international design and gerontology communities broadening the conventional idea of environmental support to include the product environment sparking scholarly discussions and comparisons with other emerging concepts universal design design for all inclusive design and gerontechnology br The transgenerational design concept was presented at the first of the International Guest Lecture Series by World Experts sponsored by the European Design for Aging Network DAN held consecutively at five international symposiums Designing for Our Future Selves Royal College of Art London November Eindhoven University of Technology Eindhoven November The Netherlands Design Institute Amsterdam November University of Art and Design Helsinki November and National College of Art and Design Dublin November br The Transgenerational House A Case Study in Accessible Design and Construction was presented in June at Designing for the st Century An International Conference on Universal Design held at the Rhode Island College of Art and Design Providence RI br Architectural Graphic Standards published by the American Institute of Architects and commonly referred to as the architects bible presented a Transgenerational House case study in its Inclusive Design section Described as an intricate exploration in how the execution of detailed thought can create a living environment that serves the young and old alike across generations the study includes plans for the room layout kitchen laundry master bath adjustable height vanity and roll in shower br The proliferation of transgenerational design has diminished the tendency to associate age and disability with deficit decline and incompetence by providing a market aware response to population aging and the need for living and work environments used by young and old people living and working in the same environment br Continuing to emerge as a growing strategy for developing products services and environments that accommodate people of all ages and abilities transgenerational design has been adopted by major corporations like Intel Microsoft and Kodak who are looking at product development the same way as designing products for people with visual hearing and physical impairments so that people of any age can use them br Discussions between designers and marketers are indicating that successful transgenerational design requires the right balance of upfront research work solid human factors analysis extensive design exploration testing and a lot of thought to get it right and that transgenerational design is applicable to any consumer products company from appliance manufacturers to electronics companies furniture makers kitchen and bath and mainstream consumer products companies br br br See also br Ageless computing br Curb cut effect br Development plan br
