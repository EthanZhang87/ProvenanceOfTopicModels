Design methods are procedures techniques aids or tools for designing They offer a number of different kinds of activities that a designer might use within an overall design process Conventional procedures of design such as drawing can be regarded as design methods but since the s new procedures have been developed that are more usually grouped together under the name of design methods What design methods have in common is that they are attempts to make public the hitherto private thinking of designers to externalise the design process br Design methodology is the broader study of method in design the study of the principles practices and procedures of designing br br br Background br Design methods originated in new approaches to problem solving developed in the mid th Century and also in response to industrialisation and mass production which changed the nature of designing A Conference on Systematic and Intuitive Methods in Engineering Industrial Design Architecture and Communications held in London in is regarded as a key event marking the beginning of what became known within design studies as the design methods movement leading to the founding of the Design Research Society and influencing design education and practice Leading figures in this movement in the UK were J Christopher Jones at the University of Manchester and L Bruce Archer at the Royal College of Art br The movement developed through further conferences on new design methods in the UK and USA in the s The first books on rational design methods and on creative methods also appeared in this period br New approaches to design were developing at the same time in Germany notably at the Ulm School of Design Hochschule f r Gestaltung HfG Ulm under the leadership of Tom s Maldonado Design teaching at Ulm integrated design with science including social sciences and introduced new fields of study such as cybernetics systems theory and semiotics into design education Bruce Archer also taught at Ulm and another influential teacher was Horst Rittel In Rittel moved to the School of Architecture at the University of California Berkeley where he helped found the Design Methods Group a society focused on developing and promoting new methods especially in architecture and planning br At the end of the s two influential but quite different works were published Herbert A Simon s The Sciences of the Artificial and J Christopher Jones s Design Methods Simon proposed the science of design as a body of intellectually tough analytic partly formalizable partly empirical teachable doctrine about the design process whereas Jones catalogued a variety of approaches to design both rational and creative within a context of a broad futures creating systems view of design br The s saw some reaction against the rationality of design methods notably from two of its pioneers Christopher Alexander and J Christopher Jones Fundamental issues were also raised by Rittel who characterised design and planning problems as wicked problems un amenable to the techniques of science and engineering which deal with tame problems The criticisms turned some in the movement away from rationalised approaches to design problem solving and towards argumentative participatory processes in which designers worked in partnership with the problem stakeholders clients customers users the community This led to participatory design user centered design and the role of design thinking as a creative process in problem solving and innovation br However interest in systematic and rational design methods continued to develop strongly in engineering design during the s for example through the Conference on Engineering Design series of The Design Society and the work of the Verein Deutscher Ingenieure association in Germany and also in Japan where the Japanese Society for the Science of Design had been established as early as Books on systematic engineering design methods were published in Germany and the UK In the USA the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Design Engineering Division began a stream on design theory and methodology within its annual conferences The interest in systematic rational approaches to design has led to design science and design science methodology in engineering and computer science br br br Methods and processes br The development of design methods has been closely associated with prescriptions for a systematic process of designing These process models usually comprise a number of phases or stages beginning with a statement or recognition of a problem or a need for a new design and culminating in a finalised solution proposal In his Systematic Method for Designers L Bruce Archer produced a very elaborate step model of a systematic design process for industrial design but also a summary model consisting of three phases Analytical phase programming and data collection analysis Creative phase synthesis development and Executive phase communication The UK s Design Council models the creative design process in four phases Discover insight into the problem Define the area to focus upon Develop potential solutions Deliver solutions that work A systematic model for engineering design by Pahl and Beitz has phases of Clarification of the task Conceptual design Embodiment design and Detail design A less prescriptive approach to designing a basic design process for oneself has been outlined by J Christopher Jones br In the engineering design process systematic models tend to be linear in sequential steps but acknowledging the necessity of iteration In architectural design process models tend to be cyclical and spiral with iteration as essential to progression towards a final design In industrial and product design process models tend to comprise a sequence of stages of divergent and convergent thinking The Dubberly Design Office has compiled examples of more than design process models but it is not an exhaustive list br Within these process models there are numerous design methods that can be applied In his book of Design Methods J C Jones grouped methods according to their purposes within a design process Methods of exploring design situations e g Stating Objectives Investigating User Behaviour Interviewing Users Methods of searching for ideas e g Brainstorming Synectics Morphological Charts Methods of exploring problem structure e g Interaction Matrix Functional Innovation Information Sorting Methods of evaluation e g Checklists Ranking and Weighting br Nigel Cross outlined eight stages in a process of engineering product design each with an associated method Identifying Opportunities User Scenarios Clarifying Objectives Objectives Tree Establishing Functions Function Analysis Setting Requirements Performance Specification Determining Characteristics Quality Function Deployment Generating Alternatives Morphological Chart Evaluating Alternatives Weighted Objectives Improving Details Value Engineering br Many design methods still currently in use originated in the design methods movement of the s and s adapted to modern design practices Recent developments have seen the introduction of more qualitative techniques including ethnographic methods such as cultural probes and situated methods br br br Emergence of design research and design studies br The design methods movement had a profound influence on the development of academic interest in design and designing and the emergence of design research and design studies Arising directly from the Conference on Design Methods the Design Research Society DRS was founded in the UK in The purpose of the Society is to promote the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields and is an interdisciplinary group with many professions represented br In the USA a similar Design Methods Group DMG was also established in by Horst Rittel and others at the University of California Berkeley The DMG held a conference at MIT in with a focus on environmental design and planning and that led to the foundation of the Environmental Design Research Association EDRA which held its first conference in A group interested in design methods and theory in architecture and engineering formed at MIT in the early s including Donald Sch n who was studying the working practices of architects engineers and other professionals and developing his theory of reflective practice In the National Science Foundation created a Design Theory and Methodology Program to promote methods and process research in engineering design br Meanwhile in Europe Vladimir Hubka established the Workshop Design Konstruction WDK which led to a series of International Conferences on Engineering Design ICED beginning in and later became the Design Society br Academic research journals in design also began publication DRS initiated Design Studies in Design Issues appeared in and Research in Engineering Design in br br br Influence on all professional design practice br Several pioneers of design methods developed their work in association with industry The Ulm school established a significant partnership with the German consumer products company Braun through their designer Dieter Rams J Christopher Jones began his approach to systematic design as an ergonomist at the electrical engineering company AEI L Bruce Archer developed his systematic approach in projects for medical equipment for the UK National Health Service br In the USA designer Henry Dreyfuss had a profound impact on the practice of industrial design by developing systematic processes and promoting the use of anthropometrics ergonomics and human factors in design including through his book Designing for People Another successful designer Jay Doblin was also influential on the theory and practice of design as a systematic process br Much of current design practice has been influenced and guided by design methods For example the influential IDEO consultancy uses design methods extensively in its Design Kit and Method Cards Increasingly the intersections of design methods with business and government through the application of design thinking have been championed by numerous consultancies within the design profession Wide influence has also come through Christopher Alexander s pattern language method originally developed for architectural and urban design which has been adopted in software design interaction design pedagogical design and other domains br br br See also br br br br br br Other sources not cited above
