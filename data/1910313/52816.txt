Half Life is a first person shooter game developed by Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Studios for Windows It was Valve s debut product and the first game in the Half Life series The player assumes the role of Gordon Freeman a scientist who must escape from the Black Mesa Research Facility after it is invaded by aliens following a disastrous scientific experiment The gameplay consists of combat exploration and puzzles br Valve was disappointed with the lack of innovation in the FPS genre and aimed to create an immersive world rather than a shooting gallery Unlike other games at the time the player has almost uninterrupted control of the player character the story is mostly experienced through scripted sequences rather than cutscenes Valve developed the game using GoldSrc a heavily modified version of the Quake engine licensed from id Software The science fiction novelist Marc Laidlaw was hired to craft the plot and assist with design br Half Life received acclaim for its graphics gameplay and narrative and won more than PC Game of the Year awards It is considered one of the most influential first person shooter games and one of the greatest video games ever made By it had sold more than nine million copies It was ported to the PlayStation in along with the multiplayer expansion Decay and to OS X and Linux in Valve ported Half Life to its Source engine as Half Life Source in In Crowbar Collective released an unofficial remake Black Mesa br Half Life inspired numerous fan made mods some of which became standalone games such as Counter Strike Day of Defeat and Sven Co op It was followed by the expansion packs Opposing Force and Blue Shift developed by Gearbox Software and the sequels Half Life Half Life Episode One Half Life Episode Two and Half Life Alyx br br br Gameplay br br Half Life is a first person shooter that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game Unlike most first person shooters at the time which relied on cut scene intermissions to detail their plotlines Half Life s story is told mostly using scripted sequences bar one short cutscene keeping the player in control of the first person viewpoint In line with this the player rarely loses the ability to control the player character Gordon Freeman who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game the player sees through his eyes for the entire length of the game Half Life has no levels it instead divides the game into chapters whose titles briefly appear on screen as the player progresses through the game With the exception of short loading pauses progression throughout the game is continuous with each map directly connecting to the next with the exception of levels involving teleportation br The game regularly integrates puzzles such as navigating a maze of conveyor belts or using nearby boxes to build a small staircase to the next area the player must travel to Some puzzles involve using the environment to kill an enemy like turning a valve to spray hot steam at their enemies There are few bosses in the conventional sense where the player defeats a superior opponent by direct confrontation Instead such organisms occasionally define chapters and the player is generally expected to use the terrain rather than firepower to kill the boss Late in the game the player receives a long jump module for the HEV suit which allows the player to increase the horizontal distance and speed of jumps by crouching before jumping The player must rely on this ability to navigate various platformer style jumping puzzles in Xen toward the end of the game br The player battles alone for the majority of the game but is occasionally assisted by non player characters specifically security guards and scientists who help the player The guards will fight alongside the player and both guards and scientists can assist in reaching new areas and pass on relevant plot information An array of alien enemies populate the game including headcrabs bullsquids vortigaunts and headcrab zombies The player also faces human opponents in the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit a fictional special forces unit of the United States Marine Corps and Black Ops assassins br Half Life includes online multiplayer support for both individual and team based deathmatch modes It was one of the first mainstream games to use the WASD keys as the default control scheme br br br Plot br At the underground Black Mesa Research Facility physicist Gordon Freeman participates in an experiment on a crystal of unknown origin This triggers an explosion which severely damages the facility and inexplicably causes alien creatures to appear Many scientists are killed br Gordon survives thanks to his hazard suit Venturing to the surface for help he discovers that hostile Marines have been dispatched to cover up the incident Escaping below ground he destroys a giant tentacled creature inside a rocket engine test facility br Freeman travels by underground rail to the Lambda Complex where scientists can stop the alien invasion Along the way he launches a space satellite to aid the scientists and explores an abandoned older section of Black Mesa br He is eventually captured by Marines and left for dead in a garbage compactor He escapes through a waste treatment facility and stumbles into a lab filled with alien specimens seemingly collected before the accident br The Marines are overwhelmed and withdraw Scaling cliffs navigating a bombed out military base and traversing sewers Gordon arrives at the Lambda Complex Inside he restarts a nuclear reactor and uses mysterious teleportation technology to reach the last survivors of the science team br They reveal that humans have been teleporting surveyors to an alien border world However a hostile psychic entity opened an enormous portal back to Earth triggering the invasion The scientists send Gordon to kill the creature br On the alien world Xen Freeman encounters the remains of researchers who ventured before him and crystals like the one in the catastrophic experiment He defeats the monstrous Gonarch and explores a factory manufacturing alien soldiers br Finally Gordon kills the Nihilanth the entity maintaining the rift He is then disarmed and summoned by the powerful and mysterious Administrator who offers work for his employers If Gordon accepts he is placed into stasis to await his next assignment br br br Development br br Valve based in Kirkland Washington was founded in by the former Microsoft employees Mike Harrington and Gabe Newell For its first product Valve settled on a concept for a horror first person shooter FPS game They did not want to build their own game engine as this would have created too much work for a small team and Newell planned to innovate in different areas Instead Valve licensed the Quake engine and the Quake II engine from id Software and combined them with their own code Newell estimated that around of the final engine code was by Valve As the project expanded Valve cancelled development of a fantasy role playing game Prospero and the Prospero team joined the Half Life project br Half Life was inspired by the FPS games Doom and Quake Stephen King s novella The Mist and a episode of The Outer Limits titled The Borderland According to the designer Harry Teasley Doom was a major influence and the team wanted Half Life to scare you like Doom did The project had the working title Quiver after the Arrowhead military base from The Mist The name Half Life was chosen because it was evocative of the theme not clich d and had a corresponding visual symbol the Greek letter lower case lambda which represents the decay constant in the half life equation According to the designer Brett Johnson the level design was inspired by environments in the manga series Akira br Valve struggled to find a publisher as many believed the game was too ambitious for a first time developer Sierra On Line signed Valve for a one game deal as it was interested in making a D action game especially one based on the Quake engine Valve first showed Half Life in early it was a success at E that year where Valve demonstrated the animation and artificial intelligence Novel features of the artificial intelligence included fear and pack behavior br Valve aimed for a November release to compete with Quake II By September the team found that while they had built some innovative aspects in weapons enemies and level design the game was not fun and there was little design cohesion They postponed the release and reworked every level They took a novel approach of assigning a small team to build a prototype level containing every element in the game and then spent a month iterating on the level When the rest of the team played the level which the designer Ken Birdwell described as Die Hard meets Evil Dead they agreed to use it as a baseline The team developed three theories about what made the level fun First it had several interesting things happen in it all triggered by the player rather than a timer so that the player would set the pace of the level Second the level responded to any player action even for something as simple as adding graphic decals to wall textures to show a bullet impact Finally the level warned the player of imminent danger to allow them to avoid it rather than killing the player with no warning br To move forward with this unified design Valve sought a game designer but found no one suitable Instead Valve created the cabal initially a group of six individuals from across all departments that worked primarily for six months straight in six hour meetings four days a week The cabal was responsible for all elements of design including level layouts key events enemy designs narrative and the introduction of gameplay elements relative to the story The collaboration proved successful and once the cabal had come to decisions on types of gameplay elements that would be needed mini cabals from other departments most affected by the choice were formed to implement these elements Membership in the main cabal rotated since the required commitment created burnout br The cabal produced a page design document detailing nearly every aspect of the game They also produced a page document for the narrative and hired the science fiction novelist Marc Laidlaw to help manage the script Laidlaw said his contribution was to add old storytelling tricks to the team s ambitious designs I was in awe of the team It felt to me like I was just borrowing from old standards while they were the ones doing something truly new Rather than dictate narrative elements from some kind of ivory tower of authorial inspiration he worked with the team to improvise ideas and was inspired by their experiments For example he conceived the opening train ride after an engineer implemented train code for another concept br Valve initially planned to use traditional cutscenes but switched to a continuous first person perspective for lack of time Laidlaw said they discovered unexpected advantages in this approach as it created a sense of immersion and enforced a sense of loneliness in a frightening environment Laidlaw felt that non player characters were unnecessary to guide players if the design had sufficiently strong visual grammar and that this allowed the characters to feel like characters instead of signposts An early version of Half Life began immediately after the disaster with the environments already wrecked Laidlaw worked with Johnson to create versions of the lab environment before the disaster to help set the story He said These were all economical ways of doing storytelling with the architecture which was my whole obsession The narrative had to be baked into the corridors br Within a month of the cabal s formation the other team members started detailed game development and within another month began playtesting through Sierra The cabal was intimately involved with playtesting monitoring the player but otherwise not interacting They noted any confusion or inability to solve a game s puzzles and made them into action items to be fixed on the next iteration Later with most of the main adjustments made the team included means to benchmark players actions They then collected and interpreted statistically to fine tune levels further Between the cabal and playtesting Valve identified and removed parts that proved unenjoyable Birdwell said that while there were struggles at first the cabal approach was critical for Half Life s success and was reused for Team Fortress from the start br Much of the detail of Half Life s development has been lost According to the Valve employee Erik Johnson two or three months before release their Visual SourceSafe source control system exploded Logs of technical changes from before the final month of development were lost and code had to be recovered from individual computers br br br Mods br Half Life received support from independent game developers supported and encouraged by Valve With the game Valve included Worldcraft the level design tool used during development and a software development kit enabling developers to modify the game and create mods Both tools were updated with the release of the version patch Supporting tools including texture editors model editors and level editors such as the multiple engine editor QuArK were either created or updated to work with Half Life br The Half Life software development kit served as the development base for many mods including the Valve developed Team Fortress Classic and Deathmatch Classic a remake of Quake s multiplayer deathmatch mode in the GoldSrc engine Other mods such as Counter Strike and Day of Defeat DOD began life as the work of independent developers who later received aid from Valve Other multiplayer mods include Action Half Life Firearms Science and Industry The Specialists Pirates Vikings and Knights Natural Selection and Sven Co op Single player mods include USS Darkstar a futuristic action adventure on board a zoological research spaceship They Hunger a survival horror total conversion trilogy involving zombies Poke a follow up to the original Half Life story with improved graphics and Someplace Else a side story to the original Half Life br Some

version and as a single player spin off Counter Strike Condition Zero as well as in two versions using the Source engine Team Fortress Classic Day of Defeat Gunman Chronicles a futuristic Western movie style total conversion with emphasis on its single player mode and Sven Co op were also released as standalone products Half Life is also the subject of the YouTube improv roleplaying series Half Life VR but the AI is Self Aware and Freeman s Mind br In Valve s network was infiltrated by hackers Among the stolen files were the unreleased Half Life modification Half Life Threewave a canceled remake of the mod Threewave CTF from Quake The files were found by the independent reporter Tyler McVicker of Valve News Network on a Vietnamese FTP server in February and were unofficially released that September br br br Release br Half Life was released in November The revised version of Half Life shown at E was given Game Critics Awards for Best PC Game and Best Action Game Valve

original content A short film based on Half Life also titled Half Life Uplink was developed by Cruise Control a British marketing agency and released on February The protagonist is a journalist who infiltrates the Black Mesa Research Facility trying to discover what has happened there br Half Life was censored in Germany to comply with the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons which regulates depictions of violence against humans Valve replaced the human characters with robots spilling oil and gears instead of blood and body parts when killed among other changes In Half Life was removed from the German censorship list To acknowledge this Valve released Half Life Uncensored a free downloadable content pack that reverts the censorship br br br Ports and remakes br Valve canceled a version of Half Life for Mac developed by Logicware in Newell said the port was substandard and would have made Mac players second class customers Rebecca Heineman the co founder of

said it was not just one of the best games of the year It s one of the best games of any year an instant classic that is miles better than any of its immediate competition and in its single player form is the best shooter since the original Doom Next Generation wrote It is fast paced it is dramatic and it brings the very idea of adventure on a PC out of the dark ages and into a D world All that and not a single Orc in sight IGN described it as a tour de force in game design the definitive single player game in a first person shooter GameSpot said it was the closest thing to a revolutionary step the genre has ever taken br Several reviewers cited the level of immersion and interactivity as revolutionary AllGame said It isn t everyday that you come across a game that totally revolutionizes an entire genre but Half Life has done just that Hot Games commented on the realism and how the environment all adds up to a totally immersive gaming experience that makes everything else look quite shoddy in comparison Gamers Depot wrote that it was the most immersive game they had played br The final portion of the game taking place in the alien world of Xen was generally considered the weakest Besides introducing a wholly new and alien setting it also featured a number of low gravity jumping puzzles The GoldSrc engine did not provide as much precise control for the player during jumping making these jumps difficult and often with Freeman falling into a void and the player restarting the game Wired s Julie Muncy called the Xen sequence an abbreviated unpleasant stop on an alien world with bad platforming and a boss fight against what appeared by all accounts to be a giant floating infant The Electric Playground said that Half Life was an immersive and engaging entertainment experience in its first half and that it peaked too soon br During the AIAS nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards Half Life was awarded Computer Entertainment Title of the
