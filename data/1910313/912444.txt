A skybox is a method of creating backgrounds to make a video game level appear larger than it really is When a skybox is used the level is enclosed in a cuboid The sky distant mountains distant buildings and other unreachable objects are projected onto the cube s faces using a technique called cube mapping thus creating the illusion of distant three dimensional surroundings A skydome employs the same concept but uses either a sphere or a hemisphere instead of a cube br Processing of D graphics is computationally expensive especially in real time games and poses multiple limits Levels have to be processed at tremendous speeds making it difficult to render vast skyscapes in real time Additionally real time graphics generally have depth buffers with limited bit depth which puts a limit on the amount of details that can be rendered at a distance br To avoid these problems games often employ skyboxes Traditionally these are simple cubes with up to six different textures placed on the faces By careful alignment a viewer in the exact middle of the skybox will perceive the illusion of a real D world around it made up of those six faces br As a viewer moves through a D scene it is common for the skybox to remain stationary with respect to the viewer This technique creates the illusion that objects in the skybox are infinitely far away since they do not exhibit any parallax motion whereas D objects closer to the viewer do appear to move This is often a good approximation of reality where distant objects such as clouds stars and even mountains appear to be stationary when the viewpoint is displaced by relatively small distances However designers must be careful about which objects they include in a fixed skybox If an object of known size e g a car is included in the texture and is large enough for the viewer to perceive it as close by the lack of parallax motion may be perceived as unrealistic or confusing br The source of a skybox can be any form of texture including photographs hand drawn images or pre rendered D geometry Usually these textures are created and aligned in directions with viewing angles of degrees which covers up the faces of the cube br br br Advanced skyboxes br br Simple texture based skyboxes had severe disadvantages They could not be animated and all objects would appear equally distant at infinity They looked simple and because of certain limits it was hard for designers to be creative with this feature But starting in the late s some game designers built small amounts of D geometry to appear in the skybox to create a better illusion of depth in addition to a traditional skybox for objects very far away This constructed skybox was placed in an unreachable location typically outside the bounds of the playable portion of the level to prevent players from touching the skybox br In older versions of this technology such as the ones presented in the game Unreal this was limited to movements in the sky such as the movements of clouds Elements could be changed from level to level such as the positions of stellar objects or the color of the sky giving the illusion of the gradual change from day to night The skybox in this game would still appear to be infinitely far away as the skybox although containing D geometry did not move the viewing point along with the player movement through the level br Newer engines such as the Source engine continue on this idea allowing the skybox to move along with the player although at a different speed Because depth is perceived on the compared movement of objects making the skybox move slower than the level causes the skybox to appear far away but not infinitely so It is also possible but not required to include D geometry which will surround the accessible playing environment such as unreachable buildings or mountains They are designed and modeled at a smaller scale typically th then rendered by the engine to appear much larger This results in fewer CPU requirements than if they were rendered in full size The effect is referred to as a D skybox br In the game Half Life this effect was extensively used in showing The Citadel a huge structure in the center of City In the closing chapters of the game the player travels through the city towards the Citadel the skybox effect making it grow larger and larger progressively with the player movement completely appearing to be a part of the level As the player reaches the base of the Citadel it is broken into two pieces A small lower section is a part of the main map while the upper section is in the D skybox The two sections are seamlessly blended together to appear as a single structure br br br See also br Cube mapping br Parallax scrolling br br br External links br Skybox D Valve Developer Community br Making a skybox in OpenGL Tutorial SkyBox br br br
