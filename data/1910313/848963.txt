In video games censorship are efforts by an authority to limit access censor content or regulate video games or specific video games due to the nature of their content Some countries will do this to protect younger audiences from inappropriate content using rating systems such as the ESRB rating system Others will do this to censor any negative outlook on a nation s government br br br Overview br Support for video game regulation has at times been linked to moral panic Even so governments have enacted or have tried to enact legislation that regulates distribution of video games through censorship based on content rating systems or banning In David Gauntlett claimed that grant funding news headlines and professional prestige more commonly go to authors who in good faith promote anti media beliefs Tom Grimes James A Anderson and Lori Bergen reiterated these claims in a book examining sociological effects on the production of media effects research br br br Voluntary regulation br Voluntary rating systems adopted by the video game industry such as the ESRB rating system in the United States and Canada established in and the Pan European Game Information PEGI rating system in Europe established in are aimed at informing parents about the types of games their children are playing or are asking to play Some ratings of controversial games indicate they are not targeted at young children Mature M or Adults Only AO in the US or or in the UK The packaging warns such games should not be sold to children In the US ESRB ratings are not legally binding but many retailers take it upon themselves to refuse the sale of these games to minors In the United Kingdom UK the BBFC ratings are legally binding UK retailers also enforce the PEGI ratings which are not legally binding br br br Canada br The Ontario Film Review Board and the British Columbia Film Classification Office respectively prohibited the sale of Manhunt and Soldier of Fortune to customers under the age of notwithstanding their ESRB Mature ratings by legally classifying them as films and giving them a Restricted rating Ontario as well as several other provinces have since adopted laws that allow the ESRB ratings system to be enforceable by law primarily by making it unlawful for retailers to sell Mature or Adults Only rated games to customers who are not appropriately aged br br br China br br Video game consoles were banned in Mainland China in June This ban was finally lifted in January However the Chinese would still police video games which would be hostile to China or not in conformity with the outlook of China s government Reported by Bloomberg metaphorically speaking Cai Wu head of China s Ministry of Culture said We want to open the window a crack to get some fresh air but we still need a screen to block the flies and mosquitoes br Several video games have been banned in China due to unfavorable views on war history and government In Hearts of Iron was banned as the Ministry of Culture deemed the games portrayal of World War II to be distorted In the Chinese Ministry banned Battlefield as they claimed it misrepresented China and was an attempt to smears China s image br Display of blood in Chinese game industry is strictly limited if not banned Before blood in many games cannot be red The new ban prohibits the presence of any blood br In addition chat in Chinese video games is subject to similar or even wider restrictions as elsewhere on the Chinese Internet For example the chat in the English language version of Genshin Impact censors not only swear words but also words such as Taiwan Tibet Hong Kong Falun Gong Stalin Hitler and Putin A study of about Chinese games found out that over words have been subject to blacklisting br br br Germany br The German Strafgesetzbuch Criminal Code in outlaws the dissemination of propaganda material of unconstitutional and terrorist organisations a the use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations Volksverhetzung agitation of the people and a instructions for crimes In the official lists these four sections are always bundled so any game that contains swastika flags and or any depiction of Adolf Hitler is listed alongside racist propaganda pieces br outlaws representation of excessive violence in media which describe cruel or otherwise inhuman acts of violence against human or humanoid beings in a manner which expresses a glorification or rendering harmless of such acts of violence or which represents the cruel or inhuman aspects of the event in a manner which injures human dignity br One notable example of censorship in Germany is that of Call of Duty WWII In the German version of the game swastika symbols are removed and replaced with Iron Crosses Another censored video game in Germany was Wolfenstein II The New Colossus where Hitler s famous mustache was digitally removed and swastikas were replaced with triangular symbols br On August USK announced that the German government will relax this Section a restriction on video games as long as the imagery included falls within the social adequacy allowance USK will still evaluate how this imagery is used and reject games they believe fail to meet the social adequacy allowance In November several sequels from Wolfenstein series became uncensored in Germany br br br Japan br The Japanese versions are known for removing or heavily modifying anything and all related to sex and nudity in the game out of fear and concern for the morality of its citizens In general censorship in Japan aims to reduce gore and extreme violence in the localized versions of games br Japan s game regulatory system is CERO for home video games and EOCS JCRC for pornographic games br br br South Korea br Indecent websites such as those offering unrated games any kind of pornography and gambling are also blocked Attempts to access these sites are automatically redirected to the warning page showing This site is legally blocked by the government regulations Search engines are required to verify age for some keywords deemed inappropriate for minors br br br Mexico br Mexico voluntarily adopted the ESRB rating system for rating video games br br br United States and territories br The United States Puerto Rico Samoa Guam Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands all voluntarily comply with the ESRB rating system br br br History br The first major controversy over video games in the United States was in the early s when games such as Mortal Kombat and Night Trap released which were known for scenes that would be considered too violent or too sexual for kids The issue regarding video games eventually made it into the United States Congress After a proposal to have a government commission to establish video game ratings the Interactive Digital Software Association was established by major video game corporations and presented the Entertainment Software Ratings Board ESRB to the Congress which was approved and would become the standard of video game ratings br Jack Thompson has criticized violent video games claiming that playing violent video games leads to teenagers replicating those behaviors in the real world He often represented victims or parents of victims in cases regarding shootings usually blaming the actions on the perpetrator having played violent video games Thompson also supported a campaign that tried to stop the release of Bully br In the Entertainment Software Association the lobbying group for the video games industry had enlisted over members to the Video Game Voters Network a grassroots lobbying group to mobilize gamers to act against public policy that may negatively impact the gaming industry The VGV was launched in by the ESA and uses social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to inform members of allies and opponents In the ESA spent over US Million on lobbying including but not limited to against VVG legislation This included opposing a bipartisan federal bill that would direct the National Academy of Sciences to study the effects of all forms of violent media Such bills themselves had come under criticisms from some scholars for pressuring scientists to find specific outcomes rather than studying the issues neutrally br br br US government legislation br The regulation of video games have been historically supported by politicians such as Joe Lieberman and Hillary Clinton who have pushed legislation for regulating video games br No video game console manufacturer has allowed any game marked AO to be published in North America however the PC gaming service Steam has allowed AO titles such as Hatred to be published on its platform No major retailers are willing to sell AO rated games although the immensely popular PlayStation game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was briefly rated AO after the presence of the Hot Coffee add on became evident The add on was later removed with the game s rating returning to M In the th Congress and th Congress the Video Games Enforcement Act was introduced to the US House of Representatives The act required an identification check for the purchase of M and AO rated games The bill and others like it did not succeed because of likely First Amendment violations Although no law mandates identification checking for games with adult content a survey by the Federal Trade Commission showed that video game retailers have voluntarily increased ID verification for M and AO rated games and sales of those games to underage potential buyers decreased from in to in A further survey in April found that video game retailers continued to enforce the ratings by allowing only of underage teenage shoppers to buy M rated video games a statistically significant decrease from the purchase rate in br On January Joe Baca representative of California s rd District introduced H R the Video game health labelling act This bill called for a label to be placed in a clear and conspicuous location on the packaging on all video games with an ESRB rating of T Teen or higher stating br WARNING Excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behavior The proposed legislation was referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce Trade and Consumer Protection On January Joe Baca reintroduced the Video game health labelling act as H R of the th Congress The bill was once again passed onto the subcommittee br On June the Supreme Court of the United States ruled on Brown v Entertainment Merchants Association Video games were protected speech under the First Amendment The case centered on a California law that sought to restrict sales of violent video games to minors The video game industry led by the Entertainment Merchants Association and the Entertainment Software Association successfully obtained an injunction on the bill believing that the definition of violence as stated in the California law was too vague and would not treat video games as protected speech This opinion was upheld in lower courts and supported by the Supreme Court s decision The majority of the justices did not consider the studies brought to their attention as convincing evidence of harm and stated that they could not create a new class of restricted speech that was not applied to other forms of media br However Justice Breyer s minority decision found the evidence more convincing br Deana Pollard Sacks Brad Bushman and Craig A Anderson objected to the ruling claiming that the thirteen experts who authored the Statement on Video Game Violence on the Brown side were considerably more academically merited and had on average authored over times as many peer reviewed journal articles about aggression violence based on original empirical research as the signatories supporting the EMA whereas the over signatories supporting Brown had on average authored over times as many Richard Hall Ryan Hall and Terri Day replied It is not surprising that Anderson and Bushman found their own qualifications and the qualifications of those who agree with them to be superior to the qualifications of those who disagree with them and claimed that they might have used methodology which have undercounted contributions of some scholars On April Dianne Feinstein a Californian senator and Democrat spoke in San Francisco to a group of constituents about gun violence She said video games have a very negative role for young people and the industry ought to take note of that and that Congress might have to step in if the video games industry did not cease to glorify guns br br br See also br List of banned video games br List of controversial video games br List of regionally censored video games br Video game controversies br br
