organisation According to a study conducted by Forrester Research Consulting in the year to investigate whether the design led cultures gave companies a significant advantage over their contemporaries The results showed evidence that most of the enterprises that were analyzed during the research had digital experiences that outpaced the competition The study proved that focusing on design strengthens an organisation from the inside as well as from the outside br In a design led enterprise the design permeates the organisation beyond the product teams that are embedded in the culture and in such organizations there is always an ambition to do better br These companies typically support a variety of skills from the more oriented designers to the junior designers or the more tactical designers The teams use collaborative processes and tools to unify the working groups of the organization An organization driven by design is more proactive rather than reactive and it tends to confirm the next challenge rather than wait until the challenge presents itself This is made possible by the values that are built based on which is done through collaboration experimentation empathy as well as user research br Furthermore developing a design culture requires a definition of the design and the necessary resources that will facilitate its integration into the organization

organization s life Consequently identifying the designers to be involved in the designing process requires an in depth understanding of the purpose of the design towards the organisation s culture and innovation as well br Additionally building a design culture entails creating an environment that presents a platform that ensures that every individual obtains solutions to some problems present in the organisation There exist several factors necessary for developing a design culture in any organisation Cultivating culture is the first approach to developing design culture This step entails
