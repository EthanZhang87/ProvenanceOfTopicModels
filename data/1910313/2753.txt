AutoCAD is a D and br D computer aided design CAD software application developed by Autodesk It was first released in December for the CP M and IBM PC platforms as a desktop app running on microcomputers with internal graphics controllers Initially a DOS application subsequent versions were later released for other platforms including Classic Mac OS Microsoft Windows and macOS iOS and Android br AutoCAD is a general drafting and design application used in industry by architects project managers engineers graphic designers city planners and other professionals to prepare technical drawings After discontinuing the sale of perpetual licenses in January commercial versions of AutoCAD are licensed through a term based subscription or Autodesk Flex a pay as you go option introduced on September Subscriptions to the desktop version of AutoCAD include access to the web and mobile applications However users can subscribe separately to the AutoCAD Web App online or AutoCAD Mobile through an in app purchase br br br History br Before AutoCAD was introduced most CAD programs ran on mainframe computers or minicomputers with each CAD operator user working at a separate graphics terminal br br br Origins br br AutoCAD was derived from a program that began in and then released in called Interact CAD also referred to in early Autodesk documents as MicroCAD which was written prior to Autodesk s then Marinchip Software Partners formation by Autodesk cofounder Michael Riddle br The first version by Autodesk was demonstrated at the Comdex and released that December AutoCAD supported CP M computers As Autodesk s flagship product by March AutoCAD had become the most ubiquitous CAD program worldwide The first UNIX version was Release for Xenix in October while the first version for Windows was Release released in February br br br Features br br br Compatibility with other software br ESRI ArcMap permits export as AutoCAD drawing files Civil D permits export as AutoCAD objects and as LandXML Third party file converters exist for specific formats such as Bentley MX GENIO Extension PISTE Extension France ISYBAU Germany OKSTRA and Microdrainage UK also conversion of pdf files is feasible however the accuracy of the results may be unpredictable or distorted For example jagged edges may appear Several vendors provide online conversions for free such as Cometdocs br br br Language br AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT are available for English German French Italian Spanish Japanese Korean Chinese Simplified Chinese Traditional Brazilian Portuguese Russian Czech Polish and Hungarian also through additional language packs The extent of localization varies from full translation of the product to documentation only The AutoCAD command set is localized as a part of the software localization br br br Extensions br AutoCAD supports a number of APIs for customization and automation These include AutoLISP Visual LISP VBA NET and ObjectARX ObjectARX is a C class library which was also the base for br br products extending AutoCAD functionality to specific fields br creating products such as AutoCAD Architecture AutoCAD Electrical AutoCAD Civil D br third party AutoCAD based application br There are a large number of AutoCAD plugins add on applications available on the application store Autodesk Exchange Apps br AutoCAD s DXF drawing exchange format allows importing and exporting drawing information br br br Vertical integration br Autodesk has also developed a few vertical programs for discipline specific enhancements such as br br Advance Steel br AutoCAD Architecture br AutoCAD Electrical br AutoCAD Map D br AutoCAD Mechanical br AutoCAD MEP br AutoCAD Plant D br Autodesk Civil D br Since AutoCAD several verticals are included with AutoCAD subscription as Industry Specific Toolset br For example AutoCAD Architecture formerly Architectural Desktop permits architectural designers to draw D objects such as walls doors and windows with more intelligent data associated with them rather than simple objects such as lines and circles The data can be programmed to represent specific architectural products sold in the construction industry or extracted into a data file for pricing materials estimation and other values related to the objects represented br Additional tools generate standard D drawings such as elevations and sections from a D architectural model Similarly Civil Design Civil Design D and Civil Design Professional support data specific objects facilitating easy standard civil engineering calculations and representations br Softdesk Civil was developed as an AutoCAD add on by a company in New Hampshire called Softdesk originally DCA Softdesk was acquired by Autodesk and Civil became Land Development Desktop LDD later renamed Land Desktop Civil D was later developed and Land Desktop was retired br br br Platforms br br br File formats br AutoCAD s native file formats are denoted either by a dwg dwt dws or dxf filename extension dwg and to a lesser extent dxf have become de facto if proprietary standards for CAD data interoperability particularly for D drawing exchange br The primary file format for D and D drawing files created with AutoCAD is dwg While other third party CAD software applications can create dwg files AutoCAD uniquely creates RealDWG files The drawing version code changes between AutoCAD releases br Using AutoCAD any dwg file may be saved to a derivative format These derivative formats include br br Drawing Template Files dwt New dwg are created from a dwt file Although the default template file is acad dwt for AutoCAD and acadlt dwt for AutoCAD LT custom dwt files may be created to include foundational configurations such as drawing units and layers br Drawing Standards File dws Using the CAD Standards feature of AutoCAD a Drawing Standards File may be associated to any dwg or dwt file to enforce graphical standards br Drawing Interchange Format dxf The dxf format is an ASCII representation of a dwg file and is used to transfer data between various applications br br br Variants br br br AutoCAD LT br AutoCAD LT is the lower cost version of AutoCAD with reduced capabilities first released in November Autodesk developed AutoCAD LT to have an entry level CAD package to compete in the lower price level Priced at it became the first AutoCAD product priced below It was sold directly by Autodesk and in computer stores unlike the full version of AutoCAD which must be purchased from official Autodesk dealers AutoCAD LT introduced Desktop Subscription service from per year as of three subscription plans were available from a month to a year license Since AutoCAD LT AutoCAD LT support LISP customization br While there are hundreds of small differences between the full AutoCAD package and AutoCAD LT there are a few recognized major differences in the software s features br br D capabilities AutoCAD LT lacks the ability to create visualize and render D models as well as D printing br Network licensing AutoCAD LT cannot be used on multiple machines over a network br Customization AutoCAD LT does not support customization with LISP ARX NET and VBA br Management and automation capabilities with Sheet Set Manager and Action Recorder br CAD standards management tools br br br AutoCAD Mobile and AutoCAD Web br AutoCAD Mobile and AutoCAD Web formerly AutoCAD WS and AutoCAD is an account based mobile and web application enabling registered users to view edit and share AutoCAD files via mobile device and web using a limited AutoCAD feature set and using cloud stored drawing files The program which is an evolution and combination of previous products uses a freemium business model with a free plan and two paid levels including various amounts of storage tools and online access to drawings includes new features such as a Smart Pen mode and linking to third party cloud based storage such as Dropbox Having evolved from Flash based software AutoCAD Web uses HTML browser technology available in newer browsers including Firefox and Google Chrome br AutoCAD WS began with a version for the iPhone and subsequently expanded to include versions for the iPod Touch iPad Android phones and Android tablets Autodesk released the iOS version in September following with the Android version on April The program is available via download at no cost from the App Store iOS Google Play Android and Amazon Appstore Android br In its initial iOS version AutoCAD WS supported drawing of lines circles and other shapes creation of text and comment boxes and management of color layer and measurements in both landscape and portrait modes Version released August added support for unit typing layer visibility area measurement and file management The Android variant includes the iOS feature set along with such unique features as the ability to insert text or captions by voice command as well as manually Both Android and iOS versions allow the user to save files on line or off line in the absence of an Internet connection br In Autodesk announced plans to migrate the majority of its software to the cloud starting with the AutoCAD WS mobile application br According to a interview with Ilai Rotbaein an AutoCAD WS product manager for Autodesk the name AutoCAD WS had no definitive meaning and was interpreted variously as Autodesk Web Service White Sheet or Work Space In AutoCAD WS was renamed to AutoCAD Later it was renamed to AutoCAD Web App br br br Student versions br AutoCAD is licensed for free to students educators and educational institutions with a month renewable license available Licenses acquired before March were a month license with its last renovation on March The student version of AutoCAD is functionally identical to the full commercial version with one exception DWG files created or edited by a student version have an internal bit flag set the educational flag When such a DWG file is printed by any version of AutoCAD commercial or student older than AutoCAD SP or AutoCAD and newer the output includes a plot stamp banner on all four sides Objects created in the Student Version cannot be used for commercial use Student Version objects infect a commercial version DWG file if they are imported in versions older than AutoCAD or newer than
