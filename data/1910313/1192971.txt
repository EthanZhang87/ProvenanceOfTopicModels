title: Wicked problem
id: 1192971
In planning and policy a wicked problem is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete contradictory and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize It refers to an idea or problem that cannot be fixed where there is no single solution to the problem and wicked denotes resistance to resolution rather than evil Another definition is a problem whose social complexity means that it has no determinable stopping point Moreover because of complex interdependencies the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems Due to their complexity wicked problems are often characterized by organized irresponsibility br The phrase was originally used in social planning Its modern sense was introduced in by C West Churchman in a guest editorial Churchman wrote in the journal Management Science either repeating his own coinage or responding to a previous use of the term by Horst Rittel the origin is uncertain Churchman discussed the moral responsibility of operations research to inform the manager in what respect our solutions have failed to tame his wicked problems Rittel and Melvin M Webber formally described the concept of wicked problems in a treatise contrasting wicked problems with relatively tame solvable problems in mathematics chess or puzzle solving br br br Characteristics br Rittel and Webber s formulation of wicked problems in social policy planning specified ten characteristics br br There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem br Wicked problems have no stopping rule br Solutions to wicked problems are not true or false but better or worse br There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem br Every solution to a wicked problem is a one shot operation because there is no opportunity to learn by trial and error every attempt counts significantly br Wicked problems do not have an enumerable or an exhaustively describable set of potential solutions nor is there a well described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan br Every wicked problem is essentially unique br Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem br The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem s resolution br The social planner has no right to be wrong i e planners are liable for the consequences of the actions they generate br Conklin later generalized the concept of problem wickedness to areas other than planning and policy Conklin s defining characteristics are br br The problem is not understood until after the formulation of a solution br Wicked problems have no stopping rule br Solutions to wicked problems are not right or wrong br Every wicked problem is essentially novel and unique br Every solution to a wicked problem is a one shot operation br Wicked problems have no given alternative solutions br br br Examples br Classic examples of wicked problems include economic environmental and political issues A problem whose solution requires a great number of people to change their mindsets and behavior is likely to be a wicked problem Therefore many standard examples of wicked problems come from the areas of public planning and policy These include global climate change natural hazards healthcare the AIDS epidemic pandemic influenza international drug trafficking nuclear weapons homelessness and social injustice br In recent years problems in many areas have been identified as exhibiting elements of wickedness examples range from aspects of design decision making and knowledge management to business strategy to space debris br br br Background br Rittel and Webber coined the term in the context of problems of social policy an arena in which a purely scientific engineering approach cannot be applied because of the lack of a clear problem definition and differing perspectives of stakeholders In their words The search for scientific bases for confronting problems of social policy is bound to fail because of the nature of these problems Policy problems cannot be definitively described Moreover in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the indisputable public good there is no objective definition of equity policies that respond to social problems cannot be meaningfully correct or false and it makes no sense to talk about optimal solutions to these problems Even worse there are no solutions in the sense of definitive answers br Thus wicked problems are also characterised by the following br br The solution depends on how the problem is framed and vice versa i e the problem definition depends on the solution br Stakeholders have radically different world views and different frames for understanding the problem br The constraints that the problem is subject to and the resources needed to solve it change over time br The problem is never solved definitively br Although Rittel and Webber framed the concept in terms of social policy and planning wicked problems occur in any domain involving stakeholders with differing perspectives Recognising this Rittel and Kunz developed a technique called Issue Based Information System IBIS which facilitates documentation of the rationale behind a group decision in an objective manner br A recurring theme in research and industry literature is the connection between wicked problems and design Design problems are typically wicked because they are often ill defined no prescribed way forward involve stakeholders with different perspectives and have no right or optimal solution Thus wicked problems cannot be solved by the application of standard or known methods they demand creative solutions br br br Strategies to tackle wicked problems br Wicked problems cannot be tackled by the traditional approach in which problems are defined analysed and solved in sequential steps The main reason for this is that there is no clear problem definition of wicked problems Ultimately the solution to Wicked problems requires additional research to understand the gaps in information pertaining these issues Governments must invest in more evidence informed science to address the full scope of these problems Broader thinking into the appropriate options will allow for more innovation within this process br In a paper published in Nancy Roberts identified the following strategies to cope with wicked problems br br Authoritative br These strategies seek to tame wicked problems by vesting the responsibility for solving the problems in the hands of a few people The reduction in the number of stakeholders reduces problem complexity as many competing points of view are eliminated at the start The disadvantage is that authorities and experts charged with solving the problem may not have an appreciation of all the perspectives needed to tackle the problem br Competitive br These strategies attempt to solve wicked problems by pitting opposing points of view against each other requiring parties that hold these views to come up with their preferred solutions The advantage of this approach is that different solutions can be weighed up against each other and the best one chosen The disadvantage is that this adversarial approach creates a confrontational environment in which knowledge sharing is discouraged Consequently the parties involved may not have an incentive to come up with their best possible solution br Collaborative br These strategies aim to engage all stakeholders in order to find the best possible solution for all stakeholders Typically these approaches involve meetings in which issues and ideas are discussed and a common agreed approach is formulated A significant advantage of this approach is the creation of a strong information sharing environment The main problem is the risk that certain ideas while integral to finding a possible solution may be too controversial to accept by other involved parties By enhancing the collaborative processes between researchers this allows for wider coordination of roles within this research With the inclusion of diverse perspectives into this process it enhances the potential options and figures considered The commitment to collaboration in addressing a Wicked problem will likely result in further understanding of the underlying factors and could enhance the means of addressing it br In his paper Rittel hints at a collaborative approach one which attempts to make those people who are being affected into participants of the planning process They are not merely asked but actively involved in the planning process A disadvantage of this approach is that achieving a shared understanding and commitment to solving a wicked problem is a time consuming process Another difficulty is that in some matters at least one group of people may hold an absolute belief that necessarily contradicts other absolute beliefs held by other groups Collaboration then becomes impossible until one set of beliefs is relativized or abandoned entirely br Research over the last two decades has shown the value of computer assisted argumentation techniques in improving the effectiveness of cross stakeholder communication The technique of dialogue mapping has been used in tackling wicked problems in organizations using a collaborative approach More recently in a four year study of interorganizational collaboration across public private and voluntary sectors steering by government was found to perversely undermine a successful collaboration producing an organizational crisis which led to the collapse of a national initiative br br In Wholesome Design for Wicked Problems Robert Knapp stated that there are ways forward in dealing with wicked problems The first is to shift the goal of action on significant problems from solution to intervention Instead of seeking the answer that totally eliminates a problem one should recognize that actions occur in an ongoing process and further actions will always be needed br Examining networks designed to tackle wicked problems in health care such as caring for older people or reducing sexually transmitted infections Ferlie and colleagues suggest that managed networks may be the least bad way of making wicked problems governable br br br Communication of wicked problems br br br Problem structuring methods br br A range of approaches called problem structuring methods PSMs have been developed in operations research since the s to address problems involving complexity uncertainty and conflict PSMs are usually used by a group of people in collaboration rather than by a solitary individual to create a consensus about or at least to facilitate negotiations about what needs to change Some widely adopted PSMs include soft systems methodology the strategic choice approach and strategic options development and analysis SODA br br br Related concepts br br br Messes and social messes br Russell L Ackoff wrote about complex problems as messes Every problem interacts with other problems and is therefore part of a set of interrelated problems a system of problems I choose to call such a system a mess br Extending Ackoff Robert Horn says that a Social Mess is a set of interrelated problems and other messes Complexity systems of systems is among the factors that makes Social Messes so resistant to analysis and more importantly to resolution br According to Horn the defining characteristics of a social mess are br br No unique correct view of the problem br Different views of the problem and contradictory solutions br Most problems are connected to other problems br Data are often uncertain or missing br Multiple value conflicts br Ideological and cultural constraints br Political constraints br Economic constraints br Often a logical or illogical or multi valued thinking br Numerous possible intervention points br Consequences difficult to imagine br Considerable uncertainty ambiguity br Great resistance to change and br Problem solver s out of contact with the problems and potential solutions br br br Divergent and convergent problems br E F Schumacher distinguishes between divergent and convergent problems in his book A Guide for the Perplexed Convergent problems are those for which attempted solutions gradually converge on one solution or answer Divergent problems are those for which different answers appear to increasingly contradict each other all the more they are elaborated requiring a different approach involving faculties of a higher order like love and empathy br br br Wicked problems in software development br In DeGrace and Stahl introduced the concept of wicked problems to software development In the last decade other computer scientists have pointed out that software development shares many properties with other design practices particularly that people process and technology problems have to be considered equally and have incorporated Rittel s concepts into their software design methodologies The design and integration of complex software defined services that use the Web web services can be construed as an evolution from previous models of software design and therefore becomes a wicked problem also br br br Super wicked problems br br Kelly Levin Benjamin Cashore Graeme Auld and Steven Bernstein introduced the distinction between wicked problems and super wicked problems in a conference paper which was followed by a journal article in Policy Sciences In their discussion of global climate change they define super wicked problems as having the following additional characteristics br br There is a significant time deadline on finding the solution br There is no central authority dedicated to finding a solution br Those seeking to solve the problem are also causing it br Certain policies irrationally impede future progress br While the items that define a wicked problem relate to the problem itself the items that define a super wicked problem relate to the agent trying to solve it Global warming is a super wicked problem and the need to intervene to tend to our longer term interests has also been taken up by others including Richard Lazarus br br
