food based products br br br History br Advergames a portmanteau of advertisement and video games appeared early in the history of the video game industry One of the first known attempts was a polo sport game tied into the clothing brand Polo which Carol Shaw had been developing for the Atari around but which had been cancelled prior to release The first known released advergame was Tapper a

other establishments for adults but the game proved popular and a non branded version Root Beer Tapper was released for general arcades with beer replaced by root beer br Numerous advergames were developed through the s and s for home video game consoles and personal computers but with the introduction of wide spread availability of the Internet browser games became a popular route for advergames Such games were cheaper to produce compared to previous advergames as well as to other traditional advertising routes such as television advertising A Kaiser Family Foundation report in found that of food product companies had established dedicated sections of their websites with advergames that were targeted at children with many of these offering multiple advergames br The term advergames was coined by Anthony Giallourakis in The Internet domain www advergames com was purchased that year by Giallourakis and several years later in a free web portal showcasing a selection of

was published by Citro n exclusively for Turkey br br br Legal concerns br br br Protection for children br Because video games generally draw significant interest from minors there are ethical and legal concerns around advergames Whereas adults generally can recognize and resist persuasive advertising in games younger children may not recognize that an advergame is a form of advertising and can be drawn in by statements made by the game br One key market area of concern was food product based advergames The increased used of browser and mobile advergames in the mid s led to concerns that such games would lead to an increase in the childhood obesity rate In particular many food based advergames promote less nutritious products like snack foods However research has shown that the influence of advergames is not limited to foods with poor nutrition as a study using advergames designed around healthy food choices led to the monitored children to select a healthier snack when presented a variety of choices br br br False advertising br Advergames can run afoul of laws established related to truth in advertising Making false claims even if in language not intended to be advertising in advergames can result in penalties and fines by the national or regional consumer protection agencies In a notable case the Gatorade company a subsidiary of PepsiCo had published a free mobile game Bolt which featured Usain Bolt and challenged the player to keep your performance high by avoiding water The state of California asserted this claim was false as Gatorade had been shown to be more harmful to the human body than water and with the game targeted to youth send the wrong message The state sued Gatorade and the case was ultimately settled with Gatorade paying a US fine to the state part of which the state used to promote health conscious water drinking habits for children br br br National regulations and oversight br In the United States attempts have been made by the United States Congress to give the Federal Trade Commission FTC authority to oversee online advertising aimed at children including advergames but had been challenged by lobbies representing the food industry and effectively shut down such attempts Nevertheless the propagation of online games and advertising aimed at children led to passage of the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act COPPA in which set strict standards for what type of private information websites could collect from minors with the FTC overseeing any such fines br In the United Kingdom advergames regulation was brought into coverage by the CAP Code or the Code of Non broadcast Advertising Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing in The CAP code updated frequently provides specific guidance on what advergames among other types of advertising can and cannot do with specific attention to how such games may influence children CAP code violations are monitored and penalized by the Advertising Standards Authority br br br Other concerns br Messaging in advergames may backfire and impact the reputation of the brand the game promotes A notable example from Intel which had published in The Intel IT Manager Game a browser based game that attempted to give insight into the job opportunities of an information technology manager including simulating the hires of new employees However the game only allowed male employees to be hired by design and Intel received criticism for discounting female hires The game was taken offline and later replaced with a new version that had equal gender representation While the situation could be compared to a similar problem around the game Fable which also forced players to use male avatars the real world setting of Intel s game was seen as a more serious flaw and at the time gender representation in the information technology industry was a serious concern br br br
