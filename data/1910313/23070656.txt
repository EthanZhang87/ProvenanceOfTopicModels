title: Isometric video game graphics
id: 23070656
Isometric video game graphics are graphics employed in video games and pixel art that use a parallel projection but which angle the viewpoint to reveal facets of the environment that would otherwise not be visible from a top down perspective or side view thereby producing a three dimensional D effect Despite the name isometric computer graphics are not necessarily truly isometric i e the x y and z axes are not necessarily oriented to each other Instead a variety of angles are used with dimetric projection and a pixel ratio being the most common The terms perspective view D and pseudo D are also sometimes used although these terms can bear slightly different meanings in other contexts br Once common isometric projection became less so with the advent of more powerful D graphics systems and as video games began to focus more on action and individual characters However video games using isometric projection especially computer role playing games have seen a resurgence in recent years within the indie gaming scene br br br Overview br br br Advantages br br In the fields of computer and video games and pixel art the technique has become popular because of the ease with which D sprite and tile based graphics can be made to represent D gaming environments Because parallelly projected objects do not change in size as they move about an area there is no need for the computer to scale sprites or do the complex calculations necessary to simulate visual perspective This allowed bit and bit game systems and more recently handheld and mobile systems to portray large game areas quickly and easily And while the depth confusion problems of parallel projection can sometimes be a problem good game and level design can alleviate this br Further though not limited strictly to isometric video game graphics pre rendered D graphics can possess a higher fidelity and use more advanced graphical techniques than may be possible on commonly available computer hardware even with D hardware acceleration Similarly to modern CGI used in motion pictures graphics can be rendered one time on a powerful super computer or render farm and then displayed many times on less powerful consumer hardware such as on television sets tablet computers and smartphones This means that static pre rendered isometric graphics often look better compared to their contemporary real time rendered counterparts and may age better over time compared to their peers However this advantage may be less pronounced today than it was in the past as developments in graphical technology equalize or produce diminishing returns and current levels of graphical fidelity become good enough for many people br Lastly there are also gameplay advantages to using an isometric or near isometric perspective in video games For instance compared to a purely top down game they add a third dimension opening up new avenues for aiming and platforming Secondly compared to a first or third person video game they allow you to more easily field and control a large number of units such as a full party of characters in a computer role playing game or an army of minions in a real time strategy game Further they may alleviate situations where a player may become distracted from a game s core mechanics by having to constantly manage an unwieldy D camera I e the player can focus on playing the game itself and not on manipulating the game s camera br In the present day rather than being purely a source of nostalgia the revival of isometric projection is the result of real tangible design benefits br br br Disadvantages br Some disadvantages of pre rendered isometric graphics are that as display resolutions and display aspect ratios continue to evolve static D images need to be re rendered each time in order to keep pace or potentially suffer from the effects of pixelation and require anti aliasing Re rendering a game s graphics is not always possible however as was the case in when Beamdog remade BioWare s Baldur s Gate Beamdog were lacking the original developers creative art assets the original data was lost in a flood and opted for simple D graphics scaling with smoothing without re rendering the game s sprites The results were a certain fuzziness or lack of crispness compared to the original game s graphics This does not affect real time rendered polygonal isometric video games however as changing their display resolutions or aspect ratios is trivial in comparison br br br Differences from true isometric projection br The projection commonly used in video games deviates slightly from true isometric due to the limitations of raster graphics Lines in the x and y directions would not follow a neat pixel pattern if drawn in the required to the horizontal While modern computers can eliminate this problem using anti aliasing earlier computer graphics did not support enough colors or possess enough CPU power to accomplish this Instead a pixel pattern ratio would be used to draw the x and y axis lines resulting in these axes following a arctan angle to the horizontal Game systems that do not use square pixels could however yield different angles including true isometric Therefore this form of projection is more accurately described as a variation of dimetric projection since only two of the three angles between the axes are equal to each other i e br br br History of isometric video games br Some three dimensional games were released as early as the s but the first video games to use the distinct visual style of isometric projection in the meaning described above were arcade games in the early s br br br s br The use of isometric graphics in video games began with Data East s DECO Cassette System arcade game Treasure Island released in Japan in September but it was not released internationally until June The first isometric game to be released internationally was Sega s Zaxxon which was significantly more popular and influential it was released in Japan in December and internationally in April Zaxxon is an isometric shooter where the player flies a space plane through scrolling levels It is also one of the first video games to display shadows br Another early isometric game is Q bert Warren Davis and Jeff Lee began programming the concept around April The game s production began in the summer and then released in October or November Q bert shows a static pyramid in an isometric perspective with the player controlling a character which can jump around on the pyramid br In February the isometric platform game arcade game Congo Bongo was released running on the same hardware as Zaxxon It allows the player character to traverse non scrolling isometric levels including three dimensional climbing and falling The same is possible in the arcade title Marble Madness released in br br In isometric games were no longer exclusive to the arcade market and also entered home computers with the release of Blue Max for the Atari bit computers and Ant Attack for the ZX Spectrum In Ant Attack the player can move forward in any direction of the scrolling game offering complete free movement rather than fixed to one axis as with Zaxxon The views can also be changed around a degrees axis The ZX Spectrum magazine Crash consequently awarded it in the graphics category for this new technique known as Soft Solid D br A year later the ZX Spectrum game Knight Lore was released It was generally regarded as a revolutionary title that defined the subsequent genre of isometric adventure games Following Knight Lore many isometric titles were seen on home computers to an extent that it once was regarded as being the second most cloned piece of software after WordStar according to researcher Jan Krikke Other examples out of those were Highway Encounter Batman Head Over Heels and La Abad a del Crimen Isometric perspective was not limited to arcade adventure games though for example the strategy game Populous used isometric perspective br br br s br br Throughout the s several successful games such as Syndicate SimCity Civilization II X COM and Diablo used a fixed isometric perspective But with the advent of D acceleration on personal computers and gaming consoles games previously using a D perspective generally started switching to true D and perspective projection instead This can be seen in the successors to the above games for instance SimCity Civilization VI XCOM Enemy Unknown and Diablo III all use D polygonal graphics and while Diablo II used fixed perspective D perspective like its predecessor it optionally allowed for perspective scaling of the sprites in the distance to lend it a pseudo D appearance br Also during the s isometric graphics began being used for Japanese role playing video games JRPGs on console systems particularly tactical role playing games many of which still use isometric graphics today Examples include Front Mission Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics the latter of which used D graphics to create an environment where the player could freely rotate the camera Other titles such as Vandal Hearts and Breath of Fire III carefully emulated an isometric or parallel view but actually used perspective projection br Isometric or similar perspectives become popular in role playing video games such as Fallout and Baldur s Gate In some cases these role playing games became defined by their isometric perspective which allows larger scale battles br br br s br Isometric projection has seen continued relevance in the new millennium with the release of several newly crowdfunded role playing games on Kickstarter These include the Shadowrun Returns series by Harebrained Schemes the Pillars of Eternity series and Tyranny by Obsidian Entertainment and Torment Tides of Numenera by inXile Entertainment Both Obsidian Entertainment and inXile Entertainment have employed or were founded by former members of Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment Obsidian Entertainment in particular wanted to bring back the look and feel of the Infinity Engine games like Baldur s Gate Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment Lastly several pseudo isometric D RPGs such as Divinity Original Sin Wasteland and Dead State have been crowdfunded using Kickstarter These titles differ from the above games however in that they use perspective projection instead of parallel projection br br br Use of related projections and techniques br br The term isometric perspective is frequently misapplied to any game with an usually fixed angled overhead view that appears at first to be isometric These include the aforementioned dimetrically projected video games games that use trimetric projection such as Fallout and SimCity games that use oblique projection such as Ultima Online and Divine Divinity and games that use a combination of perspective projection and a bird s eye view such as Silent Storm Torchlight and Divinity Original Sin br Also not all isometric video games rely solely on pre rendered D sprites There are for instance titles which use polygonal D graphics completely but render their graphics using parallel projection instead of perspective projection such as Syndicate Wars Dungeon Keeper and Depths of Peril games which use a combination of pre rendered D backgrounds and real time rendered D character models such as The Temple of Elemental Evil and Torment Tides of Numenera and games which combine real time rendered D backgrounds with hand drawn D character sprites such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea Hour of Darkness br One advantage of top down oblique projection over other near isometric perspectives is that objects fit more snugly within non overlapping square graphical tiles thereby potentially eliminating the need for an additional Z order in calculations and requiring fewer pixels br br br Mapping screen to world coordinates br br One of the most common problems with programming games that use isometric or more likely dimetric projections is the ability to map between events that happen on the d plane of the screen and the actual location in the isometric space called world space A common example is picking the tile that lies right under the cursor when a user clicks One such method is using the same rotation matrices that originally produced the isometric view in reverse to turn a point in screen coordinates into a point that would lie on the game board surface before it was rotated Then the world x and y values can be calculated by dividing by the tile width and height br Another way that is less computationally intensive and can have good results if the method is called on every frame rests on the assumption that a square board was rotated by degrees and then squashed to be half its original height A virtual grid is overlaid on the projection as shown on the diagram with axes virtual x and virtual y Clicking any tile on the central axis of the board where x y tileMapWidth y will produce the same tile value for both world x and world y which in this example is indexed Selecting the tile that lies one position on the right on the virtual grid actually moves one tile less on the world y and one tile more on the world x This is the formula that calculates world x by taking the virtual y and adding the virtual x from the center of the board Likewise world y is calculated by taking virtual y and subtracting virtual x These calculations measure from the central axis as shown so the results must be translated by half the board For example in the C programming language br br This method might seem counter intuitive at first since the coordinates of a virtual grid are taken rather than the original isometric world and there is no one to one correspondence between virtual tiles and isometric tiles A tile on the grid will contain more than one isometric tile and depending on where it is clicked it should map to different coordinates The key in this method is that the virtual coordinates are floating point numbers rather than integers A virtual x and y value can be which means the center of the third tile In the diagram on the left this falls in the rd tile on the y in detail When the virtual x and y must add up to the world x will also be br br br Examples br br br Dimetric projection br br br br br br br br
