Geometrical design GD is a branch of computational geometry It deals with the construction and representation of free form curves surfaces or volumes and is closely related to geometric modeling Core problems are curve and surface modelling and representation GD studies especially the construction and manipulation of curves and surfaces given by a set of points using polynomial rational piecewise polynomial or piecewise rational methods The most important instruments here are parametric curves and parametric surfaces such as B zier curves spline curves and surfaces An important non parametric approach is the level set method br Application areas include shipbuilding aircraft and automotive industries as well as architectural design The modern ubiquity and power of computers means that even perfume bottles and shampoo dispensers are designed using techniques unheard of by shipbuilders of s br Geometric models can be built for objects of any dimension in any geometric space Both D and D geometric models are extensively used in computer graphics D models are important in computer typography and technical drawing D models are central to computer aided design and manufacturing and many applied technical fields such as geology and medical image processing br Geometric models are usually distinguished from procedural and object oriented models which define the shape implicitly by an algorithm They are also contrasted with digital images and volumetric models and with mathematical models such as the zero set of an arbitrary polynomial However the distinction is often blurred for instance geometric shapes can be represented by objects a digital image can be interpreted as a collection of colored squares and geometric shapes such as circles are defined by implicit mathematical equations Also the modeling of fractal objects often requires a combination of geometric and procedural techniques br Geometric problems originating in architecture can lead to interesting research and results in geometry processing computer aided geometric design and discrete differential geometry br In architecture geometric design is associated with the pioneering explorations of Chuck Hoberman into transformational geometry as a design idiom and applications of this design idiom within the domain of architectural geometry br br br See also br br Architectural geometry br Computational topology br CAD CAM CAE br Digital geometry br Geometric design of roads br List of interactive geometry software br Parametric curves br Parametric surfaces br Solid modeling br Space partitioning br Wikiversity Topic Computational geometry br br br br br br External links br Evolute Research and Consulting br Computer Aided Geometric Design
