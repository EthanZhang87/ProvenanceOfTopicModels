title: Video game modding
id: 407326
Video game modding short for modification is the process of alteration by players or fans of one or more aspects of a video game such as how it looks or behaves and is a sub discipline of general modding Mods may range from small changes and tweaks to complete overhauls and can extend the replay value and interest of the game br Modding a game can also be understood as the act of seeking and installing mods to the player s game but the act of tweaking pre existing settings and preferences is not truly modding br Mods have arguably become an increasingly important factor in the commercial success of some games as they add depth to the original work and can be both fun for players playing the mods and as a means of self expression for mod developers br People can become fans of specific mods in addition to fans of the game they are for such as requesting features and alterations for these mods In cases where mods are very popular players might have to clarify that they are referring to the unmodified game when talking about playing a game The term vanilla is often used to make this distinction Vanilla Minecraft for example refers to the original unmodified game br As early as the s video game mods have also been used for the sole purpose of creating art as opposed to an actual game This can include recording in game actions as a film as well as attempting to reproduce real life areas inside a game with no regard for game play value This has led to the rise of artistic video game modification as well as machinima and the demoscene br Popular games can have tens of thousands of mods created for them br br br Development br br Many mods are not publicly released to the gaming community by their creators Some are very limited and just include some gameplay changes or even a different loading screen while others are total conversions and can modify content and gameplay extensively A few mods become very popular and convert themselves into distinct games with the rights getting bought and turning into an official modification or in some cases a stand alone title that does not require the original game to play br Technical and social skills are needed to create a mod A group of mod developers may join to form a mod team br Doom was the first game to have a large modding community In exchange for the technical foundation to mod id Software insisted that mods should only work with the retail version of the game not the demo which was respected by the modders and boosted Doom s sales Another factor in the popularity of modding Doom was the increasing popularity of the Internet which allowed modding communities to form Mods for Quake such as Capture the Flag and Team Fortress became standard features in later games in the shooter genre While first person shooters are popular games to mod the virtual pet genre with games such as Petz and Creatures fostered younger modders particularly girls br br br Tools br Mod making tools are a variety of construction sets for creating mods for a game Early commercial mod making tools were the Boulder Dash Construction Kit and The Bard s Tale Construction Set which allowed users to create game designs in those series Much more successful among early mod making tools was the Forgotten Realms Unlimited Adventures from Strategic Simulations Inc which allowed users to construct games based on the game world that was launched with the Pool of Radiance game br By the mid s modding tools were commonly offered with PC games and by the early s a game that launched with no modding tools was considered more worthy of note in a review than one that did Maxis released the modding tools for The Sims before the game itself resulting in a suite of fan created mods being available at launch The advertising campaign for Neverwinter Nights focused on the included Aurora toolset The World Editor for Warcraft III allowed a variety of custom scenarios or maps to be created for the game such as a number of tower defense and multiplayer online battle arena maps the most notable of which was Defense of the Ancients The provision of tools is still seen as the most practical way that a company can signal to fans that its game is open for modding Fans may also use and create open source software tools for modding games Generative AI is expected to make developing for hobby projects easier particularly with assets such as textures and dialogue though this also led to ethical issues over its use especially with voice actors who expressed concern regarding their characters voices being cloned without their consent br There are also free content delivery tools available that make playing mods easier They help manage downloads updates and mod installation in order to allow people who are less technically literate to play Steam s Workshop service for example allows a user to easily download and install mods in supported games br br br Game support for modifications br The potential for end user change in game varies greatly though it can have little correlation with the number and quality of mods made for a game br In general the most modification friendly games will define gameplay variables in text or other non proprietary format files for instance in the Civilization series one could alter the movement rate along roads and many other factors and have graphics of a standard format such as bitmaps Publishers can also determine mod friendliness in the way important source files are available such as Doom having its art assets separate from the main program which allows them to be shared and modified br Games have varying support from their publishers for modifications but often require expensive professional software to make One such example is Homeworld which requires the program Maya to build new in game objects However there are free versions of Maya and other advanced modeling software available There are also free and even open source modeling programs such as Blender that can be used as well br For advanced mods such as Desert Combat that are total conversions complicated modeling and texturing software are required to make original content Advanced mods can rival the complexity and work of making the original game content short of the engine itself rendering the differences in ease of modding small in comparison to the total amount of work required Having an engine that is for example easy to import models to is of little help when doing research modeling and making a photorealistic texture for a game item As a result other game characteristics such as its popularity and capabilities have a dominating effect on the number of mods created for the game by users br A game that allows modding is said to be moddable The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim as well as its predecessors Morrowind and Oblivion are examples of highly moddable games with an official editor available for download from the developer Daggerfall was much less moddable but some people released their own modifications nevertheless Some modifications such as Gunslingers Academy have deliberately made the game more moddable by adding in scripting support or externalizing underlying code Supreme Commander set out to be the most customisable game ever and as such included a mod manager which allowed for modular modding having several mods on at once br The game industry is currently facing the question of how much it should embrace the players contribution in creating new material for the game or mod communities as part of their structure within the game Some software companies openly accept and even encourage such communities Others though have chosen to enclose their games in heavily policed copyright or Intellectual Property regimes IPR and close down sites that they see as infringing their ownership of a game br br br Portability issues br br For cross platform games mods written for the Windows version have not always been compatible with the Mac OS X and or Linux ports of the game In large part this is due to the publisher s concern with prioritizing the porting of the primary game itself when allocating resources for fixing the porting of mod specific functions may not be cost effective for the smaller market share of alternate platforms For example Battlefield ported by Aspyr for Mac OS X had file access issues specific to mods until the D patch Unreal Tournament does not have a working community mods menu for the Mac OS X version and until the patch had graphics incompatibilities with several mods such as Red Orchestra and Metaball br Also mods compiled into platform specific libraries such as those of Doom are often only built for the Windows platform leading to a lack of cross platform compatibility even when the underlying game is highly portable In the same line of reasoning mod development tools are often available only on the Windows platform id Software s Doom Radiant tool and Epic Games UnrealEd are examples of this br Mod teams that lack either the resources or know how to develop their mods for alternate platforms sometimes outsource their code and art assets to individuals or groups who are able to port the mod br The mod specialist site for Macs Macologist has created GUI launchers and installers for many UT mods as well as solving cross platform conversion issues for mods for other games br br br Unforeseen consequences or benefits of modding br In January it was reported that in The Sims modifications that changed item and game behavior were unexpectedly being transferred to other players through the official website s exchange feature leading to changed game behavior without advance warning br After the Hot Coffee mod incident there were calls from the industry to better control modders There is concern about mods that show nudity and Bethesda does not allow mods with such content to be uploaded on its website Nexus allows for mods which allow nudity as long as nudity is not present in the preview image One of the most popular mods of this type is Caliente s Beautiful Bodies Edition which allows for body modification in Bethesda s Skyrim and Fallout and has been downloaded at least million times br In members from the Grand Theft Auto fan site GTAForums reported instances of malware being circulated through modifications written for Grand Theft Auto V Two of the modifications in question namely Angry Planes and No Clip came with code for loading a remote access tool and a keylogger for stealing Facebook and Steam account credentials The modifications in question have since been taken out of circulation with affected players being advised to change their social media account passwords and disinfect their computers br The National Crime Agency of the UK has indicated that modding can act as a pathway to cybercrime for some people br br br Motivations of modders br The Internet provides an inexpensive medium to promote and distribute user created content like mods an aspect commonly known as Web Video game modding was described as remixing of games and can be therefore seen as part of the remix culture as described by Lawrence Lessig or as a successor to the playful hacker culture that produced the first video games br Mods can be both useful to players and a means of self expression Three motivations have been identified by Olli Sotamaa for fans to create mods to patch the game to express themselves and to get a foot in the door of the video game industry It has been noted that these motivations encompass intrinsic and extrinsic motivations Poor suggests becoming a professional is not a major motivation of modders noting that they tend to have a strong sense of community and that older modders who may already have established careers are less motivated by the possibility of becoming professional than younger modders br br br History br One of the first games that supported user modifications as packaged was Lode Runner which included a level editor which users could make and save levels to share with other players on the same computer br id Software s Wolfenstein D one of the earliest first person shooters was released in a form that did not intend for users to be able to mod the game but users were able to find ways to manipulate the game s files after scouring them for data locations to create their own levels and graphics Because of this when id developed their next game Doom they purposely separated the game engine and other aspects related to the game s operation from the game levels and graphics placing these into a WAD file WAD short for Where s All the Data In this manner modders only needed to change the WAD file to mod the game launching numerous Doom modding efforts id s approach of separating data file from execution files became essential for modding of video games in the future br br br Official status of mods br Mods can extend the shelf life of games such as Half Life which increased its sales figures over the first three years of its release According to the director of marketing at Valve a typical shelf life for a game would be to months even if it was a mega hit In early the DayZ modification for ARMA was released and caused a massive increase in sales for the three year old game putting it in the top spot for online game sales for a number of months and selling over units for the game In some cases modders who are against piracy have created mods that enforce the use of a legal game copy br Half Life had a Valve run annual mod expo which began in showcasing the new games built using the Half Life engine br Due to the increasing popularity and quality of modding some developers such as Firaxis have included fan made mods in official releases of expansion packs A similar case is that of Valve when they hired Defense of the Ancients lead designer IceFrog in developing Dota br For example a number of fan made maps scenarios and mods such as the Best of the Net collection and Double Your Pleasure were included in the Civilization II expansion Fantastic Worlds and the Civilization III expansion Play the World and in the Civilization IV expansion Beyond the Sword two existing mods Rhye s and Fall of Civilization and Fall from Heaven were included with the expansion the latter through a spin off called Age of Ice Sid Meier who had opposed supporting mods in Civilization II said that the strength of the modding community is the very reason the series survived br br br Legal status of mods br br Copyright law as it relates to video games and mod packs is an evolving and largely unsettled legal issue The legal uncertainty revolves around which party is legally the copyright owner of the mods within the pack the company that produced the game the end user that created the compilation or the creators of the individual mods Video games are protected by copyright law as a literary work In the United States context the mechanisms of how the modder gets into the code of the game to mod it may violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or even simply the end user license agreement EULA Most EULAs forbid modders from selling their mods A particular concern of companies is the use of copyrighted material by another company in mods such as a Quake Aliens vs Predator mod which was legally contested by th Century Fox Some companies such as Nintendo discourage modding through aggressive litigation strict EULAs and Terms and Conditions for their property Mods themselves may introduce other copyrighted elements into video games which further complicate matters br Some regard the fan use of copyrighted material in mods to be part of a moral economy and develop norms about the reuse of this material often settling on a system of shared ownership where mods and code are freely shared with the common good in mind It has been argued that total conversion mods may be covered in the United States under the concept of fair use br Modding can be compared with the open source software movement and open source video game development br In part of the reason that Second Life generated interest was how user generated content mods was central to the experience and how the intellectual property rights remained with the creator player This was developed by the publisher into a market br br br Controversy surrounding paid mods br In April Valve implemented a paid mod feature onto Steam the first game to implement this feature was The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim The move resulted in a swift backlash from the modding community and after an enormous influx of complaints of overpriced mods content that had been published without its creator s consent and concerns over mods that contained third party copyrighted content i e material that neither Valve nor the mod creator owned Valve discontinued the paid mod feature entirely and agreed to refund those that spent money to purchase a mod Other concerns identified included that being able to mod the game was a reason why players bought the game on PC in the first place and a worry that newbie modders would not be able to stand on the shoulders of giants by modding pre existing mods and that mod teams would become unworkable The removal of the system itself was also criticized br br br Types br br br Total conversion br br A total conversion is a mod of an existing game that replaces virtually all of the artistic assets in the original game and sometimes core aspects of gameplay Total conversions can result in a completely different genre from the original br The Half Life modding community splintered across the different total conversions available often modding for a particular total conversion rather than Half Life in general Examples of famous total conversions include Counter Strike whose developers were hired by Valve to turn it into a commercial product Defense of the Ancients which was the first MOBA to have sponsored tournaments and Garry s Mod for which fans created thousands of game modes over its decade long development br Many popular total conversions are later turned into standalone games replacing any remaining original assets to allow for commercial sale without copyright infringement Some of these mods are even approved for sale despite using the IP of the original game such as Black Mesa br br br Overhaul br An overhaul mod significantly changes an entire game s graphics and gameplay usually with the intent to improve on the original but not going as far as being a completely different experience This can also include adding revised dialog and music br Examples of overhaul mods include Deus Ex Revision which was given permission from publisher Square Enix to release on Steam alongside the original game and GTA Redux which not only improves the original game s textures but also adds a new weather system visual effects and adjusts the wanted system weapons and vehicle handling br br br Randomizer br Randomizers are a type of user mod typically atop games of the bit and bit generations that keep the fundamental gameplay but randomize elements of the game to make it more of a challenge Randomizers came out of the speedrunning community which had exhausted the challenge of racing through the game with one of the earliest being for The Legend of Zelda around In the Zelda randomizer the mod moved the location of the dungeons the layout of these dungeons and the location of enemies in a random but procedurally generated manner similar to roguelikes based on a numerical seed so that speedrunners would have to overcome these new changes Their popularity grew as randomizer playthroughs were popular with streaming media Some games have offered official randomizer modes in the game itself such as Cassette Beasts in or in downloadable content including Bloodstained Ritual of the Night in and Axiom Verge in br br br Add on br br An add on or addon is a typically small mod which adds to the original content of a specific game In most cases an add on will add one particular element to a game such as a new weapon in a shooting game a new unit or map in a strategy game a new vehicle or track in a racing game items in a game like Minecraft or Terraria or additional contents in simulation games such as new pilotable airplanes e g the Airbus A or Boeing Dreamliner An example of a mod that adds functionality to augment or enhance a players experience is ComputerCraft a Minecraft mod that adds programmable computers and robots to allow the player to automate tasks in game This can be accomplished without changing any of the original game s existing content Many games are flexible and allow this however that is not always the case Some add ons occasionally have to replace in game content due to the nature of a peculiar game engine It may be the case for example that in a game which does not give a player the option to choose their character modders wishing to add another player model will simply have to overwrite the old one A famous example of this type of mod can be found for the Grand Theft Auto series wherein modders may use downloadable tools to replace content such as models in the game s directory The Left Dead series can also be modded with individual add ons which are stored in a VPK format so that a player may choose to activate a given mod or not br br br Unofficial patch br An unofficial patch can be a mod of an existing game that fixes bugs not fixed by an official patch or that unlocks content present in the released game s files but is inaccessible in official gameplay Such patches are usually created by members of the game s fan base when the original developer is unwilling or unable to supply the functionality officially Jazz Jackrabbit has an unofficial patch which adds and fixes many of its features One effect of this type of mod is that hidden or partially deleted content can be revealed An example is the Hot Coffee mod for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas which unlocks a sexually explicit minigame The ESRB changed the rating of GTA SA from Mature M to Adults Only AO In the fourth quarter of Rockstar released a clean version of the game with the Hot Coffee scenes removed Grand Theft Auto San Andreas allowing the rating of the game to be reverted to its original Mature rating In May a similar event occurred with Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion br br br Art mod br An art mod is a mod that is created for artistic effect Art mods are most frequently associated with video game art However modified games that retain their playability and are subject to more extensive mods i e closer to total conversions may also be classified as art games Art mods are usually designed to subvert the original game experience One example is the Velvet Strike mod for Counter Strike in which the players spray paint anti violence messages in multiplayer games as a form of performance art Another example is Robert Nideffer s Tomb Raider I and II patches which were designed to subvert the unofficial Nude Raider patch of the late s by altering Lara Croft s sexual orientation The origins of the art mod can be traced to the classic mod Castle Smurfenstein a humorous subversion of Castle Wolfenstein which replaces the Nazi guards with Smurfs The very first art mod however is generally considered to be Iimura Takahiko s AIUEOUNN Six Features a modification of Sony s System G br br br Support continuation by mod br After EA lost its license with Major League Baseball and ended support for MVP Baseball the game s modding community has continued to support it by releasing updated roster lists and graphics every year along with creating alternative baseball leagues e g MVP Caribe a total conversion in the game br IL Sturmovik Cliffs of Dover released in received mixed reviews due to bugs and other issues Modders fixed the game over time and received source code access which led to an official re release under the name IL Sturmovik Cliffs of Dover BLITZ Edition br Following the closure of Ion Storm the source code to Daikatana was released to a select group of modders by John Romero leading the version patch which also ported the game to MacOS Linux and FreeBSD br br br User interface mod br A user interface mod changes parts of how players interact with the game and commonly mods to the UI reveal information that the player or modder believes is helpful in playing the game br br br Mod packs br Mod packs are groups of mods put into one package for download often with an auto installer A mod pack s purpose is to make it easier for the player to install and manage multiple mods Mod packs may be created with the purpose of making the original game more accessible to new players or to make the game harder for veterans to enjoy br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br Sihvonen Tania Players Unleashed Modding The Sims
