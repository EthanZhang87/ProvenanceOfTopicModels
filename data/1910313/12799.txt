Graphic design is a profession academic discipline and applied art whose activity consists in projecting visual communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups with specific objectives Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of design and of the fine arts Its practice involves creativity innovation and lateral thinking using manual or digital tools where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually br The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that of the encoder or interpreter of the message They work on the interpretation ordering and presentation of visual messages Usually graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the compositional arrangement of the text ornamentation and imagery to convey ideas feelings and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses The design work can be based on a customer s demand a demand that ends up being established linguistically either orally or in writing that is that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation br Graphic design has as a field of application different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication system For example it can be applied in advertising strategies or it can also be applied in the aviation world or space exploration In this sense in some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the production of sketches and drawings this is incorrect since visual communication is a small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied br With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of the rise of printing in Europe in the th century and the growth of consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West closely associated with advertising in the th century and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the th century Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever particularly because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who develop them br br br Terminology br William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the term graphic design in a article although it appears in a July issue volume number of Organized Labor a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco in an article about technical education for printers br br An Enterprising Trades Union br The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating br br A decade later the course catalog of the California School of Arts Crafts advertised a course titled Graphic Design and Lettering which replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering Both classes were taught by Frederick Meyer br br br History br br In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of visual communication in the th and st centuries the distinction between advertising art graphic design and fine art has disappeared They share many elements theories principles practices languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client In advertising the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services In graphic design the essence is to give order to information form to ideas expression and feeling to artifacts that document the human experience br The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively recent concerning its preparation activity and objectives Although there is no consensus on an exact date when graphic design emerged some date it back to the Interwar period Others understand that it began to be identified as such by the late th century br It can be argued that graphic communications with specific purposes have their origins in Paleolithic cave paintings and the birth of written language in the third millennium BCE However the differences in working methods auxiliary sciences and required training are such that it is not possible to clearly identify the current graphic designer with prehistoric man the th century xylographer or the lithographer of br The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic manifestation as a product of graphic design while others only recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an industrial production model visual manifestations that have been projected to address various needs productive symbolic ergonomic contextual among others br Nevertheless the evolution of graphic design as a practice and profession has been closely linked to technological innovations social needs and the visual imagination of professionals Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout history in fact good examples of graphic design date back to manuscripts from ancient China Egypt and Greece As printing and book production developed in the th century advances in graphic design continued over the subsequent centuries with composers or typographers often designing pages according to established type br By the late th century graphic design emerged as a distinct profession in the West partly due to the process of labor specialization that occurred there and partly due to the new technologies and business possibilities brought about by the Industrial Revolution New production methods led to the separation of the design of a communication medium such as a poster from its actual production Increasingly throughout the th and early th centuries advertising agencies book publishers and magazines hired art directors who organized all visual elements of communication and integrated them into a harmonious whole creating an expression appropriate to the content In typographer William A Dwiggins coined the term graphic design to identify the emerging field br Throughout the th century the technology available to designers continued to advance rapidly as did the artistic and commercial possibilities of design The profession expanded greatly and graphic designers created among other things magazine pages book covers posters CD covers postage stamps packaging brands signs advertisements kinetic titles for TV programs and movies and websites By the early st century graphic design had become a global profession as advanced technology and industry spread worldwide br br br Historical background br br In China during the Tang dynasty wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts A Buddhist scripture printed in is the earliest known printed book Beginning in the th century in China longer scrolls and books were produced using movable type printing making books widely available during the Song dynasty br In the mid th century in Mainz Germany Johannes Gutenberg developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace using movable type made with a new metal alloy that created a revolution in the dissemination of information br br br Nineteenth century br In Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design education in Great Britain informing the government of the importance of design in his Journal of Design and Manufactures He organized the Great Exhibition as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design br From to William Morris Kelmscott Press was a leader in graphic design associated with the Arts and Crafts movement creating hand made books in medieval and Renaissance era style in addition to wallpaper and textile designs Morris work along with the rest of the Private Press movement directly influenced Art Nouveau br br Will H Bradley became one of the notable graphic designers in the late nineteenth century due to creating art pieces in various Art Nouveau styles Bradley created a number of designs as promotions for a literary magazine titled The Chap Book br br br Twentieth century br br In Frederick H Meyer director and instructor at the California School of Arts and Crafts taught a class entitled Graphic Design and Lettering Raffe s Graphic Design published in was the first book to use Graphic Design in its title In author and graphic designer Leon Friend published his book titled Graphic Design and it is known to be the first piece of literature to cover the topic extensively br The signage in the London Underground is a classic design example of the modern era Although he lacked artistic training Frank Pick led the Underground Group design and publicity movement The first Underground station signs were introduced in with a design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the name of the station The station name was in white sans serif letters It was in when Pick used the expertise of Edward Johnston to design a new typeface for the Underground Johnston redesigned the Underground sign and logo to include his typeface on the blue bar in the center of a red circle br In the s Soviet constructivism applied intellectual production in different spheres of production The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes They designed buildings film and theater sets posters fabrics clothing furniture logos menus etc br Jan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his book New Typography He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as fascistic but it remained influential Tschichold Bauhaus typographers such as Herbert Bayer and L szl Moholy Nagy and El Lissitzky greatly influenced graphic design They pioneered production techniques and stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth century The following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and application br The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with consumerism This raised concerns and criticisms notably from within the graphic design community with the First Things First manifesto First launched by Ken Garland in it was re published as the First Things First manifesto in in the magazine Emigre stating We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful lasting and democratic forms of communication a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning The scope of debate is shrinking it must expand Consumerism is running uncontested it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed in part through the visual languages and resources of design br br br Applications br br Graphic design can have many applications from road signs to technical schematics and reference manuals It is often used in branding products and elements of company identity such as logos colors packaging labelling and text br From scientific journals to news reporting the presentation of opinions and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information known as information design With the advent of the web information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories Information design can include Data and information visualization which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation and can be tied in with information graphics br br br Skills br A graphic design project may involve the creative presentation of existing text ornament and images br The process school is concerned with communication it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers produces meaning communication as an agent br br br Typography br br Typography includes type design modifying type glyphs and arranging type Type glyphs characters are created and modified using illustration techniques Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces point size tracking the space between all characters used kerning the space between two specific characters and leading line spacing br Typography is performed by typesetters compositors typographers graphic artists art directors and clerical workers Until the digital age typography was a specialized occupation Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions For example the Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report br br br Page layout br br Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements content on a page such as image placement text layout and style Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages Elements typically consist of type text images pictures and with print media occasionally place holder graphics such as a dieline for elements that are not printed with ink such as die laser cutting foil stamping or blind embossing br br br Grids br A grid serves as a method of arranging both space and information allowing the reader to easily comprehend the overall project Furthermore a grid functions as a container for information and a means of establishing and maintaining order Despite grids being utilized for centuries many graphic designers associate them with Swiss design The desire for order in the s resulted in a highly systematic approach to visualizing information However grids were later regarded as tedious and uninteresting earning the label of designersaur Today grids are once again considered crucial tools for professionals whether they are novices or veterans br br br Tools br In the mid s desktop publishing and graphic art software applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes and to simulate the effects of traditional media Traditional tools such as pencils can be useful even when computers are used for finalization a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the creative process Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally br br br Computers and software br Designers disagree whether computers enhance the creative process Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand rendering or paste up While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome br Most designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer based technologies First hand rendered layouts are used to get approval to execute an idea then the polished visual product is produced on a computer br Graphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image making typography and layout Nearly all of the popular and industry standard software programs used by graphic designers since the early s are products of Adobe Inc Adobe Photoshop a raster based program for photo editing and Adobe Illustrator a vector based program for drawing are often used in the final stage CorelDraw a vector graphics editing software developed and marketed by Corel Corporation is also used worldwide Designers often use pre designed raster images and vector graphics in their work from online design databases Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop vector logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator and CorelDraw and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs such as Adobe InDesign Serif PagePlus and QuarkXPress br Many free and open source programs are also used by both professionals and casual graphic designers Inkscape uses Scalable Vector Graphics SVG as its primary file format and allows importing and exporting other formats Other open source programs used include GIMP for photo editing and image manipulation Krita for digital painting and Scribus for page layout br br br Related design fields br br br Interface design br br Since the advent of personal computers many graphic designers have become involved in interface design in an environment commonly referred to as a Graphical user interface GUI This has included web design and software design when end user interactivity is a design consideration of the layout or interface Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding graphic designers often work with software developers and web developers to create the look and feel of a web site or software application An important aspect of interface design is icon design br br br User experience design br br User experience design UX is the study analysis and development of creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users This involves the creation of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product including aspects of branding design usability and function UX design involves creating the interface and interactions for a website or application and is considered both an act and an art This profession requires a combination of skills including visual design social psychology development project management and most importantly empathy towards the end users br br br Experiential graphic design br Experiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings As such it is a cross disciplinary collaborative process involving designers fabricators city planners architects manufacturers and construction teams br Experiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space also called environmental graphic design Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are wayfinding placemaking branded environments exhibitions and museum displays public installations and digital environments br br br Occupations br br Graphic design career paths cover all parts of the creative spectrum and often overlap Workers perform specialized tasks such as design services publishing advertising and public relations As of median pay was per year The main job titles within the industry are often country specific They can include graphic designer art director creative director animator and entry level production artist Depending on the industry served the responsibilities may have different titles such as DTP associate or Graphic Artist The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as illustration photography animation visual effects or interactive design br Employment in design of online projects was expected to increase by by while employment in traditional media such as newspaper and book design expect to go down by Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques programs and methods br Graphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry such as design consultancies or branding agencies others may work within publishing marketing or other communications companies Especially since the introduction of personal computers many graphic designers work as in house designers in non design oriented organizations Graphic designers may also work freelance working on their own terms prices ideas etc br A graphic designer typically reports to the art director creative director or senior media creative As a designer becomes more senior they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities such as brand development and corporate identity development They are often expected to interact more directly with clients for example taking and interpreting briefs br br br Crowdsourcing in graphic design br br Jeff Howe of Wired Magazine first used the term crowdsourcing in his article The Rise of Crowdsourcing It spans such creative domains as graphic design architecture apparel design writing illustration and others Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design Companies startups small businesses and entrepreneurs have all benefitted from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common Major companies that operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites br br br Role of graphic design br Graphic design is essential for advertising branding and marketing influencing how people act Good graphic design builds strong recognizable brands communicates messages clearly and shapes how consumers see and react to things br One way that graphic design influences consumer behavior is through the use of visual elements such as color typography and imagery Studies have shown that certain colors can evoke specific emotions and behaviors in consumers and that typography can influence how information is perceived and remembered For example serif fonts are often associated with tradition and elegance while sans serif fonts are seen as modern and minimalistic These factors can all impact the way consumers perceive a brand and its messaging br Another way that graphic design impacts consumer behavior is through its ability to communicate complex information in a clear and accessible way For example infographics and data visualizations can help to distill complex information into a format that is easy to understand and engaging for consumers This can help to build trust and credibility with consumers and encourage them to take action br br br Ethical consideration in graphic design br Ethics are an important consideration in graphic design particularly when it comes to accurately representing information and avoiding harmful stereotypes Graphic designers have a responsibility to ensure that their work is truthful accurate and free from any misleading or deceptive elements This requires a commitment to honesty integrity and transparency in all aspects of the design process br One of the key ethical considerations in graphic design is the responsibility to accurately represent information This means ensuring that any claims or statements made in advertising or marketing materials are true and supported by evidence For example a company should not use misleading statistics to promote their product or service or make false claims about its benefits Graphic designers must take care to accurately represent information in all visual elements such as graphs charts and images and avoid distorting or misrepresenting data br Another important ethical consideration in graphic design is the need to avoid harmful stereotypes This means avoiding any images or messaging that perpetuate negative or harmful stereotypes based on race gender religion or other characteristics Graphic designers should strive to create designs that are inclusive and respectful of all individuals and communities and avoid reinforcing negative attitudes or biases br br br Future of graphic design br The future of graphic design is likely to be heavily influenced by emerging technologies and social trends Advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence virtual and augmented reality and automation are likely to transform the way that graphic designers work and create designs Social trends such as a greater focus on sustainability and inclusivity are also likely to impact the future of graphic design br One area where emerging technologies are likely to have a significant impact on graphic design is in the automation of certain tasks Machine learning algorithms for example can analyze large datasets and create designs based on patterns and trends freeing up designers to focus on more complex and creative tasks Virtual and augmented reality technologies may also allow designers to create immersive and interactive experiences for users blurring the lines between the digital and physical worlds br Social trends are also likely to shape the future of graphic design As consumers become more conscious of environmental issues for example there may be a greater demand for designs that prioritize sustainability and minimize waste Similarly there is likely to be a growing focus on inclusivity and diversity in design with designers seeking to create designs that are accessible and representative of a wide range of individuals and communities br br br See also br br br Related areas br br br Related topics br br br br br br Bibliography br Fiell
