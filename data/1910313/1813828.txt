In the United States a design patent is a form of legal protection granted to the ornamental design of an article of manufacture Design patents are a type of industrial design right Ornamental designs of jewelry furniture beverage containers Fig and computer icons are examples of objects that are covered by design patents br A similar intellectual property right a registered design can be obtained in other countries In Kenya Japan South Korea and Hungary industrial designs are registered after performing an official novelty search In the countries of the European Community one needs to only pay an official fee and meet other formal requirements for registration e g Community design at EUIPO Germany France Spain br For the member states of WIPO cover is afforded by registration at WIPO and examination by the designated member states in accordance with the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement This allows for broad worldwide coverage of a design by filing a single application in a single language e g English br br br Protections br br A US design patent covers the ornamental design of an article of manufacture An object with a design that is substantially similar in appearance to the design claimed in a design patent cannot be made used sold or imported into the United States without the permission of the patent holder The object does not have to be exact for the patent to be infringed It only has to be substantially similar in overall appearance Design patents with line drawings cover only the features shown as solid lines Items shown in broken lines are not covered This is one of the reasons Apple was awarded a jury verdict in the US case of Apple v Samsung Apple s patent showed much of their iPhone design as broken lines It didn t matter if Samsung was different in those areas The fact that the solid lines of the patent were the same as Samsung s design meant that Samsung infringed the Apple design patent br Design patents are subject to both the novelty and non obviousness standards of the patent code However because design patents are not measured based on the utility of the designs to which they are directed there is an open question as to how to measure the non obviousness of an ornamental design There is substantial case law however on how to evaluate design patent non obviousness br Once a design patent has been submitted it begins a term of protection In the United States for a design patent whose application was submitted on or after May that patent has a term limit of years from its date of grant For a design patent whose application was submitted prior to that date the term limit is years from the date of grant During this period the patent holder is entitled to bring a lawsuit against any entity that infringes on that patent once the term expires it may not be renewed and the design patent ceases to receive protection in US courts br br br Computer images br Both novel fonts and computer icons can be covered by design patents Icons are only covered however when they are displayed on a computer screen thus making them part of an article of manufacture with practical utility Screen layouts can also be protected with design patents br br br Publication of application br In China Canada Japan South Africa and the United States a design patent application is not published and is kept secret until granted br In Brazil the applicant can request that the application be kept in secrecy for a period of days from the filing date This will also delay the prosecution and granting of the application for days br In Japan an applicant can request that a design be kept secret for a period of up years after the registration has been granted br br br Notable design patents br br In George Bruce was awarded the first design patent U S patent D The design patent was for a new font br In Fr d ric Auguste Bartholdi was awarded design patent U S patent D for the Statue of Liberty This patent covered the sale of small copies of the statue Proceeds from the sale of the statues helped raise money to build the full statue in New York Harbor br In three design patents were granted for the badge of the American Legion U S patent D the badge of the American Legion Women s Auxiliary U S patent D and the badge of the Sons of the American Legion U S patent D The original terms of these patents were to have expired in but Congress has continually extended their protection The patents were extended for an additional fourteen year term by an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act in that passed the Senate on June br In Frank A Redford was awarded U S patent D for the Wigwam Motel br Apple Inc owns various patents regarding the design of the iPhone smartphone line and its related products br br br Other forms of protection br br br Utility patents br US utility patents protect the functionality of a given item i e how a product works Providing the maintenance fees are paid utility patents are generally valid for up to years from the date of filing with some exceptions br Design patents cover the ornamental appearance of an item Design patents can be invalidated if the design is dictated solely by function e g the outline of a key blade blank Design patents are valid for years from the date of issue if filed prior to May or years from the date of issue if filed on or after May There are no maintenance fees br In general terms a utility patent protects the way an article is used and works U S C while a design patent protects the way an article looks U S C The ornamental appearance for an article includes its shape configuration or surface ornamentation applied to the article or both Both design and utility patents may be obtained on an article if its novelty resides both in its utility and ornamental appearance MPEP Distinction Between Design and Utility Patents br br br Copyright br Copyright prevents nonfunctional items from being copied To show copyright infringement the plaintiff must show the infringing item was copied from the original The copyrighted artistic expression must either have no substantial practical utility e g a statue or be separable from the useful substrate e g picture on a coffee mug br Design patents on the other hand protect the ornamental aspects of an article of manufacture from being infringed One does not have to show that the infringing item was copied from the original Thus a design that was arrived at independently can still infringe a design patent br Many objects can be covered by both copyright and design patents The Statue of Liberty is one such example br br br Trademark and trade dress br Trademarks and trade dress are used to protect consumers from confusion as to the source of specified goods To get trademark protection the trademark owner must show that the mark is non functional is distinctive and is not likely to be confused with other trademarks for items in the same general class The trademarks can last indefinitely as long as they are used in commerce br Design patents are only granted if the design is novel and not obvious over prior art designs generally even those of different articles of manufacture than the patented object An actual shield of a given shape for example might be cited as prior art against a design patent on a computer icon with a shield shape However recent case law has held that the shape of an art tool cannot be cited as anticipatory prior art against the substantially identical shape of a lip implant The validity of design patents is not affected by whether or not the design is commercialized br Items can be covered by both trademarks and design patents The contour bottle of Coca Cola for example was covered by a now expired design patent U S patent D but is still however protected by at least a US registered trademark br br br See also br Geschmacksmuster br Industrial design rights br Intellectual property organizations br Office for Harmonization in
