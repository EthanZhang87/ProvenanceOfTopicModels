id: 252054
In video games a power up is an object that adds temporary benefits or extra abilities to the player character as a game mechanic This is in contrast to an item which may or may not have a permanent benefit that can be used at any time chosen by the player Although often collected directly through touch power ups can sometimes only be gained by collecting several related items such as the floating letters of the word EXTEND in Bubble Bobble Well known examples of power ups that have entered popular culture include the power pellets from Pac Man regarded as the first power up and the Super Mushroom from Super Mario Bros which ranked first in UGO Networks Top Video Game Powerups br Items that confer power ups are usually pre placed in the game world spawned randomly dropped by beaten enemies or picked up from opened or smashed containers They can be differentiated from items in other games such as role playing video games by the fact that they take effect immediately feature designs that do not necessarily fit into the game world often used letters or symbols emblazoned on a design and are found in specific genres of games Power ups are mostly found in action oriented games such as maze games run and guns shoot em ups first person shooters and platform games br br br History and influence br br br Origins of the term br The term power up is an example of wasei eigo Japanese pseudo Anglicisms the sense was coined in Japanese as a compound of power paw noun and up appusuru verb literally to up someone s or something s power or abilities The general meaning of X up in Japanese is this will increase your X and this construction is regularly used in areas such as advertising br br br First instances br br Pac Man from is credited as the first video game to feature a power up mechanic Every maze in the game contains four Power Pellets which temporarily give Pac Man the ability to eat ghosts turning the tables on his pursuers The effect of the power up was illustrated by one of the first cut scenes to appear in a video game in the form of brief comical interludes about Pac Man and Blinky chasing each other around The power pellet entered popular culture with a joke on video game controversies regarding the influence of video games on children br br In Sabre Wulf introduced power ups in the form of flowers which when blossoming provided effects such as speed up and invincibility br In Super Mario Bros introduced the Super Mushroom which has entered popular culture being described as the quintessential power up The original game idea was to have an always big Mario as a technical advance but later the power up was introduced to make him super as a bonus effect The development team thought it would be interesting to have Mario grow and shrink by eating a magic mushroom just like in Alice s Adventures in Wonderland Other power ups introduced in this game were the Super Stars and Fire Flowers which gave Mario invincibility and the ability to shoot fireballs at enemies respectively br Konami s game Gradius had the first use of a selection bar where the player could select which power up effect to trigger instead of having a fixed instant effect br In and the years after the concept of permanent power ups appeared in the action role playing genre in the form of perks br br br Types of power ups br Power ups can be classified according to the type of benefit they give the player br br br Offensive abilities br Power ups can give players a new weapon or transform the player character into a more aggressive form that increases its attack power or makes some enemies vulnerable This also includes nukes which are weapons that destroy every enemy on the screen at once these are prevalent in many different genres including vehicular combat run and guns and platform games The effect of the power up can be time limited have a limited number of uses last until the player is hit last until the player is killed or last until game over br Examples br br Mega Man series Weapons are earned from the Robot Masters Mavericks upon defeating them The weapons are kept until the game is turned off unless a password is used which can bring the player back to a point after the weapon was acquired or when the game is completed br Donkey Kong The hammer that Mario Jumpman can use to destroy barrels and fireballs br Pac Man Power pellets can be picked up by Pac Man allowing him to attack ghosts This also makes Pac Man temporarily invulnerable br Super Mario Bros The player can smash overhead bricks by jumping into them after picking up a Super Mushroom and can throw fireballs at enemies after picking up a Fire Flower In addition to those two there are ice flowers mini mushrooms mega mushrooms hammer power etc Mario loses the Super Mario effect after being hit if he has also collected a Fire Flower then this is lost along with it br Jak and Daxter In the first game collecting Red Eco increases Jak s attack power while Yellow Eco gives the ability to shoot fireballs from his hands In the next two games Dark Eco can be used to transform into Dark Jak giving a more powerful melee attack and access to additional unlockable abilities br br br Defensive abilities br Defensive power ups typically consist of items like shields usually a force field surrounding the character that deflects projectiles or absorbs a certain amount of damage or invincibility invulnerability In the case of invincibility this is nearly always granted as a temporary bonus otherwise it would negate the challenge of the game br Invincibility or invulnerability comes in two main forms either the player character merely becomes intangible to harmful things or can also damage enemies by contact In either case the character is often still vulnerable to some threats such as bottomless pits In many games invulnerability is also temporarily granted after the player gets hit or loses a life so that the character will not be hurt killed twice in quick succession The effect is commonly indicated by making the player character flash or blink or by musical cues br Examples br br Mario The Starman which grants temporary invulnerability and the ability to defeat enemies by touch br Sonic the Hedgehog There are several kinds of defensive power ups in the Sonic franchise The first game introduced the Shield which would protect Sonic from being hit one time This would prevent the player from losing Rings and lives enclosing Sonic in a spherical barrier There are several variations of this item

to a room with the real power up br Rise of the Triad Items like the Shrooms and Elasto reduces the player control br br br Attaining power ups br There are many different methods of obtaining power ups br br In many games particularly platform games there is one prevalent object scattered throughout each level that serves as a container for power ups In series such as the Castlevania and Ninja Gaiden games this object is a candle or lantern while in the Mario franchise the oft used container is the question block In the Sonic the Hedgehog series the power ups in the D titles are usually found in cubic static TVs named monitors while in D games they are enclosed in capsule like boxes br In beat em up games level themed objects such as crates barrels or mailboxes serve as containers br In many games such as the Mega Man series power ups can be obtained through the elimination of enemies br In some games power ups may be left within plain view such as in R C Pro Am It is also typical for games to require the player to travel a certain way or perform a specific action in order to attain said power up such as bombing through specific blocks in Super Metroid br Power ups can also be obtained by interacting with certain objects at specific points in the level e g the tractor trailer truck in Spy Hunter br br br Treasure chests br In many video games especially role playing video games treasure chests contain various items currency and sometimes monsters For certain role playing games some chests are actually mimics in which a monster looks like a chest but will attack the player when they attempt to open it This is notably seen in the Seiken Densetsu and Dragon Quest series br Treasure chests provide a means for the player to obtain items without paying for them in stores In some cases these chests contain items that cannot be purchased at stores Chests may be locked requiring a key of some sort For certain games keys can only be used once and the key is destroyed during its use For other games having a particular type of key means that the player can open any of the chests with a matching lock br For most games once a chest has been opened the contents remain empty although they may be repopulated with possibly different items during different stages of the game This is different from perishable containers such as crates and jars which tend to reappear if the player exits the area and then returns br br br Selection bar br br Instead of having players collect a power up that is instantly activated the players may be allowed to select which power ups they want to use This is commonly implemented through a selection bar which contains a number of power up effects To access the bar the player must collect power up items the more they collect the further along the bar they can access The more powerful power ups are traditionally placed further along the bar so that more effort is required to obtain them The selection bar was first used in Konami s game Gradius br br br Perks br br Perks are a variation of the power up mechanic but permanent rather than temporary The concept of permanent power ups dates back to the early NES action RPGs Deadly Towers and Rygar which blurred the line between the power ups used in action adventures and the experience points used in console RPGs An early video game that used perks and named it as such was the computer RPG game Fallout Perks have been used in various other video games in recent times including first person shooters such as Call of Duty Modern Warfare Modern Warfare and Killing Floor as well as action games like Metal Gear Online br br br
