id: 29104117
Cloud gaming sometimes called gaming on demand or game streaming is a type of online gaming that runs video games on remote servers and streams the game s output video sound etc directly to a user s device or more colloquially playing a game remotely from a cloud It contrasts with traditional means of gaming wherein a game is run locally on a user s video game console personal computer or mobile device br br br Background br Cloud gaming platforms operate in a similar manner to remote desktops and video on demand services games are stored and executed remotely on a provider s dedicated hardware and streamed as video to a player s device via client software The client software handles the player s inputs which are sent back to the server and executed in game Some cloud gaming services are based on access to a virtualized Windows environment allowing users to download and install games and software as they normally would on a local computer br Cloud gaming can be advantageous as it eliminates the need to purchase expensive computer hardware or install games directly onto a local game system Cloud gaming can be made available on a wide range of computing devices including mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets digital media players or proprietary thin client like devices Some services may offer additional features to take advantage of this model including the ability for a viewer to join a player s session and temporarily take control of the game br Due to their dependency on high quality streaming video cloud gaming services typically require reliable high speed internet connections with low latency Even with high speed connections available traffic congestion and other issues affecting network latency can affect the performance of cloud gaming and the ability to use a service regularly may also be limited by data caps enforced by some internet service providers br Further the costs of cloud gaming shift from traditional distribution through retail outlets and digital storefronts to the data servers that run the cloud gaming services Novel cost structures are required to cover these operating costs compared to traditional distribution br br br Infrastructure considerations br Cloud gaming requires significant infrastructure for the services to work as intended including data centers and server farms for running the games and high bandwidth internet connections with low latency for delivering the streams to users The network infrastructure required to make cloud gaming feasible was for many years not available in most geographic areas or unavailable to consumer markets br A major factor in the quality of a cloud gaming service is latency as the amount of delay between the user s inputs and when they take effect can affect gameplay especially in fast paced games dependent on precise inputs such as first person shooters and fighting games Attempts to reduce latency include the use of caching as the cached data can be stored locally and can be retrieved when required br The provider s dedicated hardware can be upgraded over time in order to support higher resolutions and frame rates for the rendering and streams The Quality of Experience QoE that measures the user s general level of satisfaction also needs to be brought into consideration during the development phase of cloud gaming br br br History br br br Early attempts br The first demonstrated approach of cloud gaming technology was by startup G cluster short for Game Cluster which introduced its product at the E and released around In their initial model around G cluster provided PC games that ran on their servers using video on demand service providers set top box manufacturers and middleware software providers to help provide their service to network operators and then offered the games through portals to end users By due to changes in the market G cluster changed their model to work through a large server manufacturer to provide their games to the network operators and directly to users This refocusing was necessitated by the increased available of free to play games available for personal computers drawing them away from G cluster s service so G cluster opted to focus on Internet Protocol television IPTV users instead which had a potential target of about three million users in French telco SFR launched G cluster gaming service in for its end users and Orange followed suit in offering the gaming service for its customers Both services have been commercially operational ever since offering cloud gaming for their customers on TV and mobile br In early another attempt was announced by American company Infinium Labs which intended to revolutionize the market of home entertainment with their Phantom video game console a device that was envisioned to be capable of providing an on demand video game delivery service via monthly online subscription The Phantom was designed to run PC games thus making it compatible with hundreds of titles from the start and was to be sold at a much lower price than high end PC gaming rigs A functioning prototype was first presented at the E running Unreal Tournament and then again at QuakeCon where it was shown to be capable of perfectly operating Quake Arena on a dedicated server After a couple years of setbacks the company bankrupted in with the Phantom console never officially released to the market becoming one of the most popular vaporware of recent times br Video game developer Crytek began the research on a cloud gaming system in for Crysis but according to their CEO Cevat Yerli they halted development in to wait until the infrastructure and cable Internet providers were able to complete the task and the cost of bandwidth to decline br br br OnLive and Gaikai br Entrepreneur Steve Perlman revealed OnLive at the March Game Developers Conference Perlman stated that with improvements in data and video compression as well as capabilities of smartphones the potential for cloud gaming was now timely OnLive was officially launched in June alongside sale of its OnLive microconsole While OnLive had acquired some support from large publishers like Ubisoft K Games and THQ they found it difficult to get other publishers onboard as they were wary of the subscription price model br Simultaneous to OnLive another startup Gaikai was announced by David Perry in Gaikai opted to approach streaming of game demos rather than full games making the service a form of online advertising for games Gaikai gained far more publisher support including Electronic Arts which OnLive had been trying to bring back to their service Gaikai was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment in July for million and by October was offering PlayStation games Ultimately the technology behind Gaikai was used as the foundation for PlayStation Now first introduced in br OnLive was never profitable and after a possible acquisition by HP Inc fell through OnLive s assets were acquired by a newly formed entity named OL which was capitalized by Gary Lauder of Lauder Partners in at million a fraction of OnLive s valuation from A mass layoff of staff was conducted to reduce operating costs Under Lauder Partners the new OL attempted to pivot its business model to allow streaming of games already owned by the user but this failed to be profitable OnLive and OL s intellectual property was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment in April but then closed it down about a month later As stated by The Verge the acquisition of both Gaikai and OnLive s intellectual property gave Sony access to a range of patents covering cloud gaming br br br Recent advances br Nvidia first announced its cloud gaming service Nvidia Grid later rebranded as GeForce Now as a combination of hardware using its graphics processing units and software in May initially intending to partner with Gaikai for games on the service Ubitus GameCloud was also introduced alongside Nvidia s Grid GameCloud was designed as white label service based on Nvidia s Grid that other providers could use to offer game streaming to their customers br Grid was formally introduced as part of its Nvidia Shield Android TV device during the International Consumer Electronics Show Grid GeForce Now launched with services provided by several cloud gaming partners including Agawi Cloudunion Cyber Cloud G cluster Playcast and Ubitus The Grid service was first launched in North America in November where a limited number of games were made available and then later expanded to computers in including support for importing a user s Steam and Epic Games Store library to run on the remote instance This importing model was criticized by publishers including Activision Blizzard and Bethesda Softworks as purchases were only intended for personal computers and not through cloud gaming The publishers forced NVidia to pull these games from their service br In Dragon Quest X was brought to Nintendo DS in Japan using Ubitus for the streaming technology br In the French startup Blade launched a service known as Shadow where users are able to rent a remote Windows instance on a datacenter with allocated access to an Intel Xeon processor and Nvidia Quadro graphics The service is geographically limited based on proximity to one of its datacenters it initially launched in France but began expanding into the United States in br In May Electronic Arts acquired cloud gaming assets and talent from GameFly for an undisclosed amount EA subsequently announced Project Atlas a project to explore the integration of artificial intelligence machine learning and Frostbite engine technology to create a unified platform to remotely process and stream blockbuster multiplayer HD games with the lowest possible latency and also to unlock even more possibilities for dynamic social and cross platform play That month Google and Microsoft also announced cloud gaming initiatives with Google beginning to pilot Project Stream including a closed beta featuring Assassin s Creed Odyssey running via a client in the Google Chrome web browser and Microsoft announced the upcoming Project xCloud leveraging Microsoft Azure technology br At the Game Developers Conference in Google officially announced its cloud gaming service Stadia which officially launched on November of that year In May Sony announced a partnership with Microsoft to co develop cloud solutions between divisions including gaming br Apple Inc which makes the iOS platform for iPhones and iPads had looked to block cloud gaming apps on its service in mid They argued that cloud gaming services allowed developers to add games onto the iOS system that bypassed the normal checks they perform on any app before it is added to the App Store and thus violated their terms of service However in September Apple altered its rules that allowed cloud gaming apps to work on iOS with restrictions that each game must be offered as an individual download on the iOS store which the user must use before playing though catalog apps as part of the service can list and link to these games Both GeForce Now and Stadia announced plans in November to release iOS versions of their streaming services as progressive web applications that would be run through a Chrome or Safari browser on iOS devices as allowed for by Apple to support cloud gaming Microsoft has also announced plans to use a similar approach to bring the xCloud game streaming technology to iOS via the browser sometime in early br Amazon introduced its own cloud gaming service Luna in September Games on the service will be offered via a channel style subscription service with Amazon s own games and those from Ubisoft available at the service s launch br Asus and Intel announced ongoing hardware supply research development and software optimization alongside Boosteroid cloud gaming platform in November br Nintendo currently has games on Nintendo Switch that primarily run on cloud gaming such as Control Hitman Marvel s Guardians of the Galaxy and the Kingdom Hearts franchise using Ubitus br br br Future br br br GPU resource sharing br A proposed method to improve game streaming s scalability is adaptive graphics processing unit GPU resource scheduling Most cloud gaming providers are using dedicated GPUs to each person playing a game This leads to the best performance but can waste resources With better GPU resource scheduling algorithms if the game does not fully utilize that GPU it can be used to help run someone else s game simultaneously In the past GPU virtualization was not used due to the inferior performance of the resource scheduling algorithm However new resource management algorithms have been developed that can allow up to of the GPUs original power to be utilized even while being split among many users br br br Predictive input br Algorithms could be used to help predict a player s next inputs which could overcome the impact of latency in cloud gaming applications Stadia s head of engineering Majd Bakar foresaw the future possibility of using such a concept to reduce latency to the point where it s basically nonexistent referring to this concept as negative latency br br br See also br s in video games br s in video games br Remote mobile
