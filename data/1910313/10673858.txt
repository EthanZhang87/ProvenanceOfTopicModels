id: 10673858
The video game industry in Mainland China currently is one of the major markets for the global video game industry where more than half a billion people play video games Revenues from China make up around of the nearly US billion global video game industry as of and since has exceeded the contribution to the global market from the United States Because of its market size China has been described as the Games Industry Capital of the World and is home to some of the largest video game companies China has also been a major factor in the growth of esports both in player talent and in revenue br China has not always been a major factor in the industry having been on the verge of economic recovery during the industry s formulative years in the s and s With the introduction of the second generation home gaming consoles in the mid s a new black market of illegally imported goods and video game clones arose to avoid the high costs of imports driving away foreign companies Notably China imposed a near complete ban on video game consoles in fearing the addiction like impact of games on its youths the ban was ultimately lifted in During that time China s video game market greatly expanded in the area of computer games including massively multiplayer online games browser games social network games etc and later mobile games all which could be free to play titles with monetization to appeal to the average lower income of Chinese players This massive growth from to led the games publishers and operating companies like Tencent and NetEase to become large global companies Despite the legitimate growth of the industry China s video game market continues to be offset by illegal importing copyright violation and intellectual property theft br As with other parts of its media China s government has strong oversight of the video game industry all new titles go through a governmental approval process to assure that content aligns with the nation s values In an approvals freeze due to the reorganisation of China s content vetting agencies caused numerous game releases to be held up The video game market plummeted for a year The government also fears the potential for its youths to become addicted to video games and have required games to include anti addiction measures User verification is used to enforce playtime restrictions which currently limit minors to three hours per week br br br History br Broadly the growth of the video game market in China is tied to expansion of its technology and digital economy from the s to present day which by represented over of its gross domestic product br br br Initial growth s br br At the time that the video game industry was being established in North America in the s China was in the midst of major political and economic reform following the death of Mao Zedong in The country was technologically behind much of the rest of the world in terms of its media Part of the reform was modernization of its media systems helping to boost economic prosperity for citizens As such China saw little of arcade games or the first generation of home consoles like the Atari br After the video game crash of which devastated the North American video game market Japan became a dominant factor in the global market leading off the third generation of consoles such as Nintendo s Famicom By this point China s economy had significantly improved and Japan started to make inroads into selling consoles into China However importing these into China was costly with a tariff on hardware and games along with value added taxes Console systems were in high demand but because of the high costs of importing only few foreign companies did so This created the video game clone grey market in China manufacturing of reverse engineered consoles and games at much lower costs than imported system even if this required dubious or illegal copyright infringement Outright copyright theft piracy was also rampant in China due to the country s poor intellectual property controls The sales of cloned console hardware and games outpaced that of legitimate imports and further drove many foreign companies away since they could not compete with this area such that by the s most video game systems in China were manufactured there br Console games continued to grow in popularity through the s which created a broader concern in the media of video game addiction with terms like digital heroin being used to describe video games Even before the s there had been a broader stance in China that video games created negative effects on those that played them which only grew during this decade The impact on youth was particularly of concern as video games were known to detract students from schoolwork leaving them unprepared to enter China s college system This situation was partially created by China s one child policy with sibling less children having few others to interact with and little to do outside of school The anti addiction facet also discouraged foreign companies from trying to break into the Chinese market br br br Chinese console ban br The concerns about video game addiction and negative influence on the youth came to a head in June The State Council passed a bill crafted by seven ministries specifically aimed at video games The bill established certain provisions on video game content and regulations on operations of Internet caf s and arcades The most significant facet of this bill was a ban on the production import and sale of consoles and arcade machines This ban was not absolute as it allowed for some consoles to be released in China notably Sony s PlayStation in and several of Nintendo s consoles rebranded under the iQue partnership However with the restriction on game imports and their content these consoles did not catch on in China The ban did not include games available on personal computers PC and as a result the PC video game market in China flourished over the next fifteen years Internet caf s flourished growing from in to over by and have remained numerous since br The ban on arcade machines was dropped in but while arcade were permitted to operate they had to take several safeguards to prevent excessive use by youth However since such arcades offered a low cost way to play games without a PC they still became a thriving industry comparable to PC gaming at internet caf s As a result Chinese gamers frequently visit the arcades to play action games particularly fighting games and occasionally unlicensed arcade ports of popular PC or mobile games such as Angry Birds or Plants vs Zombies br br br Online gaming br br Legitimate acquisition of games and the hardware to play them was still relatively expensive in China which continued to fuel the video game clone market in China A large number of PC gamers in China acquired software through illegal downloads and pirated software websites to avoid the cost Developers of legitimate games in China recognized that to compete with this black market they had to develop games that had a free or low upfront cost model but offered a way to monetize their games over time Many Chinese developed games became online games offering numerous microtransactions to recoup costs such games could be offered at Internet caf s which became a popular option for Chinese players that could not afford computer hardware even as the price of computing equipment dropped over the next decade This created a boom of massively multiplayer online games MMOs in the Chinese market and which helped to establish market dominance of companies like Tencent Perfect World and NetEase PC caf s proliferated in urban centers as China s population continued to grow Western free to play and subscription based games like Dota and World of Warcraft poised to take advantage of this model also became successful It also prompted Chinese developers to develop numerous clones of popular Western games that they would offer at low cost an issue that still persists presently br Online gaming became of serious concern to the government around re raising the issues of gaming addiction that had prompted the console ban A government report claimed that of teenage internet users amounting to million young people were playing online games more than hours a week In July the government required that online game publishers and operates incorporate anti addiction software on their games specifically by monitoring how long underaged persons played If a minor played for more than three hours straight the game was to wipe half of any in game currency that had earned that session and lose all credits if played for more than five hours Additionally these systems were required to have the player to log in using their national identification However at the time of implementation not all publishers incorporated the required controls and for those that did players would find ways around the limitations such as using family member IDs or otherwise would simply play past the time requirements as there was nothing else to do beyond the video game br br br Social and mobile gaming br br By the size of the Chinese video game market was estimated to be about US billion with around million players having grown from the previous year mostly driven by online gaming At this stage China s impact on the larger global market valued at US billion was not considered significant as much of it was still driven by the grey market for clones and pirated games However the rapid growth led to forecasts that China would be a major contributor to the global market within five years time br Online gaming readily led way to the rise of social network games in China around given that players were accustomed to free to play nature of online gaming The Chinese game Happy Farm was included in Wired s list of The Most Influential Games of the Decade at for its major influence on global social network games particularly for having inspired a dozen Facebook clones the largest being Zynga s FarmVille A number of other games have since used similar game mechanics such as Sunshine Farm Happy Farmer Happy Fishpond Happy Pig Farm Farm Town Country Story Barn Buddy Sunshine Ranch and Happy Harvest as well as parodies such as Jungle Extreme and Farm Villain br This further prepared the China market for mobile games around where there are about one billion mobile phone subscriptions according to a United Nations report and after Apple secured deals to distribute their iPhones within China Mobile devices in China are less expensive than computer or console hardware and also provide Internet functionality for many they are the only form of Internet connectivity they have making them popular gaming devices Mobile games in China grew rapidly over the next several years growing from about of the Chinese video game market in to in This expanded to more than by Furthering the growth of the social and mobile game markets was the fact that the anti addiction measures applied to online games did not apply to these types of titles it was not until where renewed concerns about mobile titles like Honour of Kings led Tencent to implement a similar anti addiction system for its portfolio br Social and mobile gaming significantly grew the Chinese video game market beyond earlier estimates By the Chinese market for video games saw nearly a ten fold growth since valued at US billion of the global US billion with over million players counting only those on personal computers since consoles were still banned these numbers do not take console players into account br br br Lifting of the console ban br In China partially eased the restrictions on video game hardware by allowing game consoles to be manufactured in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone FTZ and sold in the rest of China subject to cultural inspections In July the ban on video game consoles within the country was completely lifted According to a statement from the country s Ministry of Culture companies like Sony Nintendo and Microsoft among others were now allowed to manufacture and sell video game consoles anywhere in the country br Microsoft and Sony quickly took advantage of the lifting of the ban announcing sales of the Xbox One and PlayStation platforms within the FTZ shortly after the announcement Microsoft established a partnership with BesTV New Media Co a subsidiary of the Shanghai Media Group to sell Xbox One units in China with units first shipping by September Sony worked with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Media in May to establish manufacturing in the FTZ with the PlayStation and PlayStation Vita shipping into China by March CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Andrew House explained in September that the company intended to use the PlayStation Vita TV as a low cost alternative for consumers in an attempt to penetrate the Chinese video game market Both Microsoft and Sony have identified China as a key market for their next generation of consoles the Xbox Series X and PlayStation respectively br Nintendo did not initially seek to bring the Wii U into China Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aim stated that China was of interest to the company after the ban was lifted but considered that there were similar difficulties with establishing sales there as they had recently had with Brazil Later Nintendo had teamed up with Tencent by April to help sell and distribute the Nintendo Switch as well as aid its games through the Chinese government approval process led by National Radio and Television Administration The Nintendo Switch went on sale in China on December though unlike the international version this unit included several concessions to region lock it to China Even with the ban lifted console sales were slow as consoles require dedicated space in home and did not have additional functionality like personal computers and further slowed by continued popularity of Internet caf s The hardware grey market also persisted drawing away legitimate sales of consoles Of the US billion industry revenue in only about billion was attributed to console sales It is expected that as interest in legitimate sales of consoles increases in the future the grey market will wane Despite official availability of the Switch imported and grey market sales of Switch consoles still dominated China while Nintendo and Tencent reported that a million Switch consoles had been sold by January the total number of Switch consoles in use within the country was estimated to be at least twice as high due to imported non region locked versions br br br Approvals freeze and further steps to restrict youth gaming present br In March after the structural re organization of State Administration of Radio and Television SART over a period of several months no new game licenses were given out Further MOC had made the process of getting these licenses more stringent This period has significantly impacted Tencent one of the largest publishers of video games for China In August Tencent was forced to pull from sale their version of Monster Hunter World from China as they had not got their license for it and the government received complaints about its content Tencent were also blocked from publishing personal computer versions of PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds and Fortnite Battle Royale The license freezes was reported to have significant effects on those game publishers and developers that rely on Chinese sales In late August the Chinese Ministry of Education called on the Chinese government and SART to also address the growing issue of myopia in children which was attributed to long hours of gaming on small screens like with mobile devices The Ministry of Education had asked SART to consider placing restrictions on the number of hours each young player can play a game On news of this Tencent shares lost of their value an estimated US billion on the stock market the next day A further approval route was closed by Chinese authorities in October this green channel route which had been in place by August allowed a game to have a period of one month on the market for purposes of consumer testing without having full government approval but had been seen by game publishers as temporary relief from the current ban Tencent had been planning on distributing and monetizing from Fortnite Battle Royale via this method before this route was closed br With China s effective ban of new games continuing into October Chinese players have found other routes of getting new games which include using Steam which uses overseas servers Further existing titles released before the freeze that continue to offer new content have seen a resurgence in players and spending as a result To comply with the planned new rules Tencent announced that all mobile games it manages in China will require users to use their Chinese ID to play This will be used by Tencent to track the time that minors play the game and implement time limitations on them among other steps to meet new regulations br By December the Chinese government had formed the Online Game Ethics Committee falling under the National Radio and Television Administration which will review all games to be published in China for appropriate content as well as issues related to childhood myopia The committee by the end of the year had restarted the approval process and will be working through a backlog of submissions to review in an expedited manner to allow new games to be released Initial approvals to back logged titles was granted within days but notably lacked games published by Tencent and Netease the two largest publishers in China After several more rounds Tencent had two games approved near the end of January but did not include either Fortnite Battle Royale or PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds two major titles that were financial drivers in other countries br A second freeze on approvals started in February as any further approvals on new games were suspending until the committee has been able to clear the backlog of the titles from the prior freeze By this point only about games had been approved from the previous freeze br According to China s State Administration of Press and Publication the freezes were put in place as the video game industry had grown too rapidly in China at a rate that passed the capabilities for regulation to keep up The second freeze that started in February was to put in place to give regulators a change to tune the game approval process to meet the current market size The freeze is expected to be lifted in April alongside a new set of regulations for game approvals These new changes include limiting the number of games that can be approved each year to around games strictly banning video game clones and games with obscene content and placing more anti addiction controls on mobile titles aimed at younger players br The nearly year long freeze has had rippling effects on the global video game industry Whereas in around new games were approved only around were approved within Tencent had been one of the top companies in the world at the start of but by October its stock had dropped in value by an estimated US billion and knocked the company out of the top ten Apple attributed revenue loss in the fourth quarter of to China s approval freeze which had also affected mobile video game apps The freeze was expected to impact total revenues of the video game industry in with one analysis projecting a decline in revenue from the previous year the first time in only a decade br The Chinese government continued to push on restrictions on gaming after the approvals freeze was lifted asserting its efforts were to restrict the influence of gaming on youth The government has place restrictions on the amount of time minors can play video games first in to minutes per day on weekdays and three hours on weekends and then to only one hour per day on weekends by The government has required that all online games to implement strong authentication protocols developed by the government as to track players time in a game as well Additionally the government banned minors under the age of from registering for livestreaming services br Since March there had been new pressure on video games kicked off by statements made by General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping during the annual Two Sessions meetings where he claimed that video games could have a bad influence on the minds of children who are psychologically immature The government had stopped approval of games starting in August in an apparent new lockdown related to game content The continued pressure by the government on the Chinese game sector started to take an effect on the economic valuation of the largest companies An article published by the state owned newspaper Economic Information Daily published a report in August that initially stated that online video games were an opium for the mind that gaming addiction was on the rise and that there should be stronger government regulations While the article was pulled and later republished without the opium statement its effects caused shares of Tencent to drop by initially that day in trading though had recovered some after the revised article was published Similar drops were seen with NetEase and Bilibili Later in September when both Tencent and Netease were notified by the government of an upcoming hearing and reminding them than violations of their youth gaming restrictions would be seriously dealt with both companies stocks dropped by about due to fears that the government may be clamping down more on gaming in the future including another potential approvals freeze Over Chinese game companies including Tencent and NetEase signed a statement that month pledging that they will work to regulate youth gaming under the government s new regulations as well as to enforce new rules relating to games involved effeminate portrayal of men in games As reported by the South China Morning Post an internal memo sent by the state s gaming trade organization to game companies in September for purposes of training further clarified that that government saw video games not as pure entertainment but as a form of art and thus works that must uphold a correct set of values related to China s heritage and culture and would be more restrictive in what games they would approve within the country The memo described games that have blurred moral boundaries where the player has an option of being good or bad within the game and suggested that such games may need instead to restrict players to a specific moral path Further the memo identified that games that gave a revisionist form of history or appeared more Japanese than Chinese would likely fail to be approved br According to the South China Morning Post the approvals for new games persisted through the end of and due to the lack of approvals more than game related companies were deregistered in China through The approvals freeze was lifted by April when new approvals were announced Additionally players within China reported that the government had modified the country s network so that the international version of Steam was inaccessible from within the country leaving only the Steam China client with limited selection of games that were already approved by the government The government also banned the live streaming of unapproved games in April br A report issued in November by research firm CNG and the China Game Industry Group Committee both with strong associations with the Chinese regulatory bodies stated that the steps taken to reduce youth video game addiction had been working with more than of the country s youth gaming less than three hours a week The report suggested that the regulatory bodies should be able to back off on the tight restrictions they had placed on publishers like Tencent and NetEase over the prior few years br The NPPA issued new proposed rules in December aimed to further reduce the amount of time citizens play games and reduce in game spending These rules would prevent games from having daily or first time login rewards and limit how much virtual currency that players could keep within in game wallets These rules appeared to be directly aimed at MMOs and gacha games both popular titles within China and as a result both Tencent and NetEase saw major stock losses at the announcement of these rules totalling billion The government quickly walked back on these recommendations and reported let go of the official that had drawn them by January br br br Online gaming br Online gaming in China represents one of the largest and fastest growing Internet business sectors in the world With million Internet users currently active in China the country now has the largest online user base in world of which two thirds engage in online game play The average online gamer in China is relatively young to years old male and has at least completed a secondary level of education Demographically the online gaming user base in China is very similar to base of China Internet users most of whom live in larger cities br Online games in China fall into two primary categories MMORPGs and MOCGs The former have a predilection for persistent online worlds where hundreds to thousands of game players can interact simultaneously the latter is a generic term for games played competitively online without the existence of a persistent online realm games as simple as online Ma Jiang and online competitive card games would fall under this category In there were over million Chinese MMO gamers br Official Chinese statistics regarding online gaming state that as of the close of revenue from China s online gaming industry reached RMB billion or around US billion with earnings reaching around RMB billion or US billion Additionally while Japanese American and South Korean companies have traditionally dominated the market Chinese developed software now holds a market share on the mainland with an additional million in revenue generated by users outside of China br The online gaming market in China grew to billion in and is expected to exceed billion in According to another estimate in China s online games market was worth about million with over million gamers br China is now the world s largest online gaming market contributing one third to the global revenue in this sector in or percent of the Asia Pacific total br There are million Internet users playing online games in the country and the industry was worth billion in About of gamers are male br br br Games br QQ Games is one such popular online client Growth was driven in part by China s most popular online game Netease s Fantasy Westward Journey which now has million peak concurrent users Another contributor is Giant s Zhengtu Online which has million peak concurrent users br br br The video game industry in China br br br Publishers br Today the video game market is dominated by the Tencent Games division of Tencent Holdings which is estimated to contribute to of the overall revenue in China and nearly of the global video game market as of making it the largest video game company in the world NetEase which contributes to around of overall revenue in China is the second largest video game company in China as well as the seventh largest in the world as of Other major players include Perfect World Shunrong and Shanda br These companies are noted for having made aggressive investments in foreign video game developers particularly from South Korea and the United States and for making strategic agreements with other entities to serve as the China based operating arm for foreign interests to meet Chinese government regulations Notably Tencent s acquisitions have included US million to acquire Riot Games in to gain right to the online game League of Legends and US billion for Supercell in for its mobile game Clash of Clans Among major investments include approximately of Activision in a interest in Epic Games in and a interest in Ubisoft in br The largest online game companies by revenue in are br br Tencent Tencent Games is the Interactive Entertainment Division aka IED of Tencent br NetEase a popular online portal in China also branched out in the space of MMORPGs with the release of Westward Journey The game based on ancient westward travels on the Silk Road a popular theme from Chinese developed MMORPGs has gone through two iterations it was re released as Westward Journey II due to numerous problems with the initial release and its game engine was used to develop Fantasy Westward Journey which is currently the most popular MMORPG in China based on PCU numbers br YY br Interactive br Perfect World br Elex br IGG br Alpha Group br Century Huatong Group owner of Shanda Shanda produces and supports many popular MMORPGs The company is significant because it introduced a new online payment system with the release of Legend of Mir in Instead of charging users for the initial purchase of the game Shanda gave the software away free of charge and decided to charge users for time spent playing in game This payment system specifically counteracted piracy because the company could maintain easier control over the time users spent in the game rather than attempt to limit the game s distribution Shanda maintains a large number of MMORPGs in China developed by Western Korean and native Chinese companies the latter two regions produce Shanda s most popular games The company also maintains numerous casual games as well with platforms supporting chess and other non persistent world games br Kunlun Tech br The is similar to Shanda Entertainment it specifically maintains and produces MMORPG content for the Chinese gamer base The is notable because of its partnership with Blizzard Entertainment in bringing World of Warcraft the most popular MMORPG outside of Asia to China World of Warcraft is the most popular western MMORPG in Asia and one of the most popular in China in general Recent statistics place its peak concurrent users at around easily among the top MMORPGs in the country The also implemented a pay for time system for the game which differs from the monthly subscription payment structure used by Blizzard in other territories In April World of Warcraft owner Activision Blizzard announced it had selected The competitor NetEase to operate the game in China The s license expired on June br br br Popularity statistics br In order to gauge the popularity of online games both in China and internationally three benchmarks are commonly implemented The first is peak concurrent users PCU which is the maximum numbers of players online simultaneously at a given time A high PCU number signifies that a game has a large base of constant user participation which is essential for the survival of an online world The second statistic used is the daily active player base this number is essentially a count of the number of disparate users who sign on in a given hour period This statistic differs from PCU simply because of its longer time span but the daily user base is still a good quantifier of popularity and usage br The third statistic is simply the total number of registered users for a specific game or service this statistic is significantly more problematic because most if not all online games do not limit the user to a single account or user name For example some games claim millions of registered users a disingenuous statistic given that the most popular MMORPGs in China usually garner only to one million peak concurrent users Thus while registered user numbers can be quite impressive they are not as accurate a gauge of popularity as the other aforementioned statistics br br br Investment br In there were investments made into Chinese online gaming companies Of the investments of these deal disclosed financial details As a group these deals combined for a total of US million in investment br br br Developers br China has domestically produced a number of games including Arena of Valor Westward Journey The Incorruptible Warrior and Crazy Mouse There are a large number of domestically made massively multiplayer online role playing game MMORPGs in China although many generally remain unheard of outside of the country br China does have a small but growing indie game scene The growth of China s indie game scene is considered to have been through hobbyist programmers starting around the s and into the s after the console ban where personal computer games became more popular An early well known indie developer Coconut Island was founded in the mid s and through its success starting a number of game jams around the country starting in and eventually established the China Indie Game Alliance one of the country s largest developer communities Further interest in indie game development came with the popularity of mobile games in the country The title Monument Valley developed by Ustwo in the United Kingdom is considered to have been an influential title as it was able to tell an emotional story through the game medium and drew more interest in the indie game scene Indie game development is challenged by the governmental approval process requiring resources that many indie developers do not have As with mainstream commercial games indie games must be approved and get a license to be sold or otherwise may be offered freely which does not require a license This has led to a black market around obtaining licenses using non China controlled platforms like Steam to distribute games or other questionable means to get their game into players hands As Valve has been working with Perfect World to create a China specific client for Steam which would be limited to games approached by the Chinese government several indie developers fear this may harm the indie scene within China br br br Manufacturers br Most of the major video game systems in the world since the s have been manufactured in China by of all video game consoles were manufactured in China generally taking advantage of the net lower income labor available in the country Some of the larger manufacturers based in China or with factories within China creating video game consoles include Foxconn Hosiden and Flex Because of this trade relations between China and other countries can have an impact on video game console pricing Around as Sony Microsoft and Nintendo were preparing their next generation systems a trade war between the United States and China was threatening to create a import tariff on electronic goods shipped into the U S from China which would have significantly affected the prices of these new consoles There had already been an impact on personal computer components prior leading to speculation on the impact on consoles Sony Microsoft and Nintendo jointly petitioned the U S government to not go through with this plan in addition to other electronics vendors in the U S By January the U S government affirmed it had backed off this planned tariff Despite this Sony Microsoft and Nintendo have all expressed plans to divest some of the Chinese manufacturing to other countries in southeast Asia such as Vietnam br br br Esports br Esports in China had been significant since as the country gained access to the Internet and PC gaming cafes began appearing across the county also added by the popularity of QQ a Chinese instant messaging client that helped with long distance communications Players quickly flocked to existing Western games that supported competitive Internet play such as Command Conquer Red Alert and Quake II However it was the release of StarCraft in that established the formation of organized competitive esports in China including the formation of the China StarCraft Association to arrange unofficial tournaments for and onward That same year was also the first official esports tournament in China based on Quake II By the China E Sports Association formed from StarCraft players was established and Chinese players and teams participated and won medals starting with the World Cyber Games By the Chinese government recognized the success that Chinese players had in these games and despite the stigma that the government had towards the addicting qualities of video games recognized esports as an official sport in encouraging youth to excel in this area and that participating in esports was training the body for China br China continued to expand its esports engagement alongside South Korea over the next several years with its growth occurring alongside the growth of other online games in China China became more involved with planning of the World Cyber Games along South Korea who had founded the event in The growth was further fueled by China s large Internet companies investing in esports teams and players establishing esport tournaments of their own and acquiring Korea developers of popular esports games These companies have also gained investment into foreign companies that have produced popular esports titles in China Notably Tencent initially acquired an investment into Riot Games in which produced League of Legends and by had fully acquired the studio Tencent has also invested into Activision Blizzard which through Blizzard Entertainment distribute StarCraft World of Warcraft Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm The Alibaba Group and other e commerce Chinese businesses have also invested heavily into the esports arena within China as early as but have made more inroads by establishing the World Electronic Sports Games in as a replacement for the World Cyber Games Alibaba s efforts have centered on making the cities of Hangzhou and Changzhou esports centers in China br Due to both government encouragement and industry investment the number of professional esports players in China grew from in to over in In early China s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security included both professional gamer and professional gaming operator as an officially recognized job on its Occupation Skill Testing Authority list by July around people had registers themselves as professional gamers under this and were making an average of three times the average salary in China The Ministry had stated they believe that the professional esports sector in China can have over million jobs in five years This expansive growth has led several local governments to offer incentives for bringing esports to their cities br In esports China has been the world leader in terms of tournament winnings possessing some of the best talents in the world across multiple video games as well as one of the largest pool of video gamers As of half of the top highest earning esports players in the world are Chinese br In addition to talent China is also one of the largest consumers of esports The League of Legends World Championship held in Beijing drew an estimated million viewers from online streaming services with of them from China a number on par with the television audience of the Super Bowl The event was seen as China establishing its place in the global esports marketplace and demonstrated how China and South Korea s leadership in this area has helped to expand esports popularity to other countries China is estimated to have about of the global revenue in esports including sponsorships merchandising and media rights with an estimated US million of the global US billion by having surpassed Europe and trailing only behind North America br Despite the popularity of esports in the country it is still not exempt from the grasp of the government s censorship This was most notable in the Blitzchung controversy in October where an American video game developer Blizzard Entertainment punished Ng Wai Chung known as Blitzchung a Hong Kongese esports player of the online video game Hearthstone for voicing his support of the Hong Kong protests during an official streaming event Despite the public s response which included a boycott and a letter from United States Congress representatives Blizzard did not remove the punishment but did slightly reduce it br br br Intellectual property protection br br As described above China has had a history of a gray market of illegal imports and video game clones both in hardware and software as well as copyright theft piracy as a result of poor intellectual property laws and enforcement in the latter part of the th century br Chinese developers have been known to copy video games from foreign developers which resulted in multiple clones of established video game franchises Some developers take inspiration from existing games and incorporate the designs gameplay and mechanics to their own IPs There have been multiple lawsuits filed by major video game companies such as the case filed by Riot Games against Moonton Technology for copying its characters featured in League of Legends Riot itself has failed to have U S courts rule in their favor due to the copyright taking happening outside of the United States but through its partner Tencent they have been successful in lawsuits filed in China There have been reports where plagiarists are credited as the original creators Analysts have attributed the rise in plagiarism to lack of knowledge of the original IPs due to non releases of games in the Chinese Markets delays or outright ban by the Chinese government br More recently with the tech industry boom in China the government has implemented stricter copyright controls and processes but it is still considered to be weaker than intellectual copyright protections in Western nations which poses a threat for foreign companies seeking to sell into China br Because of the high amount of software piracy in China many foreign game companies have been reluctant to enter the country s market with single player or console games Instead they have focused on selling online titles such as massively multiplayer online games as income from these titles comes largely from subscription fees or in game item purchases rather than the purchase price of the title itself br Nintendo claims that as of February China remains the main source of manufacturing pirated Nintendo DS and Wii games br br br Farming br br As of December there were an estimated Chinese employed as farmers video game players who work to acquire virtual currency or items in online games so they can be sold to other players for real currency br br br Government oversight br br br Responsible agencies br Video games are regulated through the government and the Chinese Communist Party as with most mass media in China but further as video games are seen as a cultural benefit additional agencies are involved in promoting the growth of video games br br br Ministry of Information Industry br The Ministry of Information Industry MII of the People s Republic of China was formed in the late s through the integration of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and the Ministry of Electronics Industry The agency s primary goals include the regulation and promotion of Chinese telecommunications and software companies which include online gaming MII is also responsible for a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the number and prominence of natively produced online games One example of such involvement is the inclusion of online gaming in the plan for software and information service development br Listed here are the ministry s stated objectives

also been instrumental in combating the growing problem of Internet addiction and game addiction in China by teaming up with eight other government outlets concerned with the growing effect of game play on China s youth Towards this end GAPP works with other agencies including the Central Civilization Office Ministry of Education Chinese Communist Youth League Ministry of Information Industry Ministry of Public Security All China Women s Federation and China s Care for the Next Generation Work Commission GAPP also initiated the China National Online Game Publication Project in The intent of the project was to promote native game development through the use of government subsidies to game developers In its third year the project is to run through at least and has provided an estimated million RMB to Chinese game development companies br br br State Administration of Radio Film and Television br China s State Administration of Radio Film and Television SARFT affected the world of Chinese online games in by instating a blanket ban on computer game related commercials in the state run media The only company to directly contradict this ban is Chinese game provider The which teamed with Coca Cola to jointly promote the release of the popular Western MMORPG World of Warcraft in Besides this instance the online game market has thrived without much media promotion br br br Crime br The Beijing Reformatory for Juvenile Delinquents claimed in that a third of its detainees were influenced by violent online games or erotic websites when committing crimes such as robbery and rape In a high profile case from October year old Qiu Chengwei was sentenced to death for murdering year old Zhu Caoyuan over a dispute regarding the sale of a virtual weapon the two had jointly won in the game Legend of Mir Also in September a Chinese man in Guangzhou died after playing Internet video games for three consecutive days in an Internet cafe br br br Content control and censorship br br As with almost all mass media in the country video games in China are subject to the national policies of censorship Content in video games is overseen by SART NRTA publishers are required to obtain a license for the game in China from SART before publishing which may be denied if the game contains elements deemed inappropriate The process to submit games for a license and put them on sale following that is overseen by MOC The State General Administration of Press and Publication and anti porn and illegal publication offices have also played a role in screening games br Examples of banned games have included br br Hearts of Iron for distorting history and damaging China s sovereignty and territorial integrity br I G I Covert Strike for intentionally blackening China and the Chinese army s image br Command Conquer Generals for smearing the image of China and the Chinese army br Battlefield for smearing the image of China and endangering national security br In addition to banning games completely several games have had their content screened to remove certain imagery deemed offensive or unfavorable Common examples include skeletons or skulls being either fleshed out or removed entirely Cases of which can be seen in Chinese versions of popular video games such as Dota and World of Warcraft br With the formation of the Online Game Ethics Committee in December nine titles reportedly were classified as prohibited or to be withdrawn but this has yet to be confirmed by reliable sources These included Fortnite PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds H Z Paladins and Ring of Elysium Eleven other titles were told that they needed to make corrective action to be sold within China including Overwatch World of Warcraft Diablo and League of Legends br Publishing a title without having government approval can lead to a company being fined from five to ten times the revenues they earned from the game br In addition to content control the Chinese government has pushed technology companies including video game distributors like Tencent into allowing the government to have partial ownership of the companies that can be used to affect the content produced in exchange such companies may gain a competitive edge over others in interactions dealing with the government br Along with guidelines to control and eliminate youth gaming issued in September the Chinese government has also issued a guidelines regarding the presentation of LGBT and effimininacy in video games are to be avoided br br br Anti addiction measures br China was one of the first countries to recognize the potential for addiction to the Internet video games and other digital media and was the first country to formally classify Internet addiction a clinical disorder by recognizing Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Internet Addiction in In the Chinese government also found that more than million citizens over five years old nearly half the population suffered from some form of near sightednessed and while video games were not solely responsible for this the government felt they needed to reduce the amount of time youth played video games br China has sought to deal with addiction to video games by its youth by enacting regulations to be implemented by video game publishers aimed to limit consecutive play time particularly for children As early as China s Ministry of Culture has enacted several public health efforts to address gaming and internet related disorders One of the first systems required by the government was launched in to regulate adolescents Internet use including limiting daily gaming time to hours and requiring users identification in online video games In an Online Game Anti Addiction System was implemented for minors restricting their use to hours or less per day The ministry also proposed a Comprehensive Prevention Program Plan for Minors Online Gaming Addiction in to promulgate research particularly on diagnostic methods and interventions China s Ministry of Education in announced that new regulations would be introduced to further limit the amount of time spent by minors in online games While these regulations were not immediately binding most large Chinese publishers took steps to implement the required features For example Tencent restricted the amount of time that children could spend playing one of its online games to one hour per day for children and under and two hours per day for children aged This is facilitated by tracking players via their state issued identification numbers This has put some pressure on Western companies that publish via partners in China on how to apply these new anti addiction requirements into their games as outside of China tracking younger players frequently raises privacy concerns Specialized versions of games developed by the Chinese partner have been made to meet these requirements without affecting the rest of the world Riot Games let its China based studio implement the requirements into League of Legends for specialized release in China br A new law enacted in November limits children under to less than minutes of playing video games on weekdays and three hours on weekends with no video game playing allowed between p m to a m These are set by requiring game publishers to enforce these limits based on user logins Additionally the law limits how much any player can spend on microtransactions ranging from about to per month depending on the age of the player In September the government implemented its own name based authentication system to be made available to all companies to uphold these laws Chinese regulators further reduced the amount of time minors are allowed to play online games in August to one hour each day on Friday Saturday and Sunday as well as on public holidays from to pm The measures also capped how much minors could spend on such games with those between and limited to yuan per month and those between and to yuan per month Implementation measures were not described as part of this regulation In September GAPP launched a website that allowed for any Chinese citizen to report on games that appeared to be in violation of these anti addiction measures classified between those that failed to perform proper identity checks those that failed limit minors hours and those that failed to limit minors spending within the game br br br Data privacy br Most of the large publishers in China routinely collect data on players and how they play their game One primary reason is that this is information that may be mandated by the government due to its mass surveillance programs and for implementing systems such as for the anti addiction measures Secondly many of these large companies not only provide video games but a range of media across the spectrum including online video music and books and these companies couple that data to have better reach of targeted advertising as to increase revenues There are fears but no reported cases of these large companies sharing data with the government from foreign users These fears have had impacts for companies that are fully or partially controlled by Chinese companies For example Epic Games in released its own digital storefront the Epic Games Store which came under some criticism by players in the West partially due to fear that Epic would share their data with Tencent and subsequently to the Chinese government and have called the Store spyware br br br Foreign ownership br With the rising success of online games from onwards some foreign companies sought to invest full or partial ownership of Chinese companies to help capture a portion of the growing market The Chinese government concerned that these foreign companies would have influence on how the Chinese companies manage their video games passed a law that banned any foreign company from investing or having any type of ownership in a Chinese company with the General Administration of Press and Publication serving as the watchdog for such violations This still allows for foreign companies to bring games into China but only through operating agreements and partnerships with wholly owned Chinese companies For example Blizzard Entertainment s World of Warcraft an extremely popular MMO in China was run initially through The and later by NetEase both companies making necessary changes to parts of the game to adhere to Chinese content regulations br br br Content ratings br China introduced a pilot version of its first content rating system in December the Online Game Age Appropriateness Warning system It uses three color based classifications green for games appropriate for ages and up blue for and yellow for Games with online components are required to display these labels on packaging their website registration pages and other relevant materials The rating system was developed by the Audio Video and Digital Publishing Association
