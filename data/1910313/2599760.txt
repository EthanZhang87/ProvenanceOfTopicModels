Design science refers to a scientific i e rational and systematic approach to designing An early concept of design science was introduced in by R Buckminster Fuller who defined it as a systematic form of designing which he applied especially in innovative engineering design The concept has been more broadly defined by the Design Science journal as quantitative and qualitative research in the creation of artifacts and systems and their embedding in our physical virtual psychological economic and social environment br br br Design science relationship br There has been recurrent concern to differentiate design from science Nigel Cross differentiated between scientific design design science and a science of design A science of design the scientific study of design does not require or assume that the acts of designing are themselves scientific and an increasing number of research programs take this view To some extent the two uses of the term design science systematic designing and the study of designing have co mingled to the point where there can be some confusion and design science sometimes may be referred to either as meaning a science of design or design as a science br br br A science of design br Simon s The Sciences of the Artificial first published in built on previous developments and motivated the further development of systematic and formalized design methodologies relevant to many design disciplines for example architecture engineering urban planning computer science and management studies Simon s ideas about the science of design also encouraged the development of design research and the scientific study of designing br br br Design as a science br The design science relationship continues to be debated and there continue to be many efforts to reframe or reform design as science For example the axiomatic theory of design by Suh presents a domain independent theory that can explain or prescribe the design process The Function Behavior Structure FBS ontology by Gero presenting a domain independent ontology of design and designing is another example There have also been many domain specific developments of design science for example in architectural design product design and information systems design br br br Design science in information systems br There has been a particular emphasis on design as a science within information systems Hevner and Chatterjee provide a reference on design science research DSR in Information Systems including a selection of papers from the DESRIST conferences a look at key principles of DSR and the integration of action research with design research Vaishnavi and Kuechler offer a resource on design science research in information systems that outlines the origins and philosophical grounding for design science research explains the design science methodology and offers a bibliography of articles that discuss design science methods or offer exemplars of design science In German professors promoted design science in information system research by signing a memorandum subsequently submitted in english to the European Journal of Information Systems In the same issue the then Editor in Chief of the European Journal of Information Systems EJIS Rickard Baskerville along with the then Editor in Chief of the Information Systems Research ISR Vallabh Sambamurthy with the then Editor in Chief of Management Information Systems Quarterly MISQ Detmar Straub and the former Editor in Chief of the Journal of the Association for Information Systems JAIS Kalle Lyytinen together authored a rebuttal to some of the claims made in the memorandum regarding bias against DSR br Hevner et al provide a set of seven guidelines which help information systems researchers conduct evaluate and present design science research The seven guidelines address design as an artifact problem relevance design evaluation research contributions research rigor design as a search process and research communication br Later extensions of the design science research approach detail how design and research problems can be rationally decomposed by means of nested problem solving It is also explained how the regulative cycle problem investigation solution design design validation solution implementation and implementation evaluation fits in the framework Peffers et al developed a model for producing and presenting information systems research that they called the design science research process The Peffers et al model has been used extensively and Adams provides an example of the process model being applied to create a digital forensic process model br br br See also br Citizen Design Science br Descriptive science Descriptive versus design sciences br Design methods br Design research br Design science research br Design thinking br br br
