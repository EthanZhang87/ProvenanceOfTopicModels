In the video game industry AAA Triple A is an informal classification used to classify video games produced or distributed by a mid sized or major publisher which typically have higher development and marketing budgets than other tiers of games In the mid s the term AAA was used to describe AAA type games that generated additional revenue over time in a similar fashion to massively multiplayer online games by using games as a service methods such as season passes and expansion packs The similar construction III Triple I has also been used to describe high production value games in the indie game industry br br br History br The term AAA began to be used in the late s by game retailers attempting to gauge interest in upcoming titles and first appeared in print in a press release from Infogrames in June The term was likely borrowed from the credit industry s bond ratings where AAA bonds represent the safest investment opportunity and are the most likely to meet their financial goals br One of the first video games to be produced at a blockbuster or AAA scale was Squaresoft s Final Fantasy VII which cost an estimated million inflation adjusted million to develop making it the most expensive video game ever produced up until then with its unprecedented cinematic CGI production values movie like presentation orchestral music and innovative blend of gameplay with dynamic cinematic camerawork Its expensive advertisement campaign was also unprecedented for a video game with a combined production and marketing budget estimated to be million inflation adjusted million as of Its production budget record was later surpassed by Sega AM s Shenmue estimated to have cost million inflation adjusted million as of br By the seventh generation of video game consoles late s AAA game development on the Xbox or PlayStation game consoles typically cost in the low tens of millions of dollars m to m for a new game with some sequels having even higher total budgets for example Halo is estimated to have had a development cost of m and a marketing budget of m According to a whitepaper published for EA games Dice Europe the seventh generation saw a contraction in the number of video game developing houses creating AAA level titles reducing from an estimated to around but with a roughly corresponding fourfold increase in staffing required for game development br Triple A titles produced during the late s and early s brought a shift towards more narrative driven games that mixed storytelling elements with gameplay The earlier widespread adoption of optical media from early s had brought elements like cutscenes and the advances in real time D graphics in the mid s further drove new ways to present stories both elements were incorporated into Final Fantasy VII With larger budgets developers were able to find new innovative ways to present narrative as a direct part of gameplay rather than interspersed into pre rendered cutscenes with Half Life one of the first of these new narrative games to nearly eliminate cutscenes in favor of interactive storytelling mechanisms br During the seventh generation AAA or blockbuster games had marketing at a similar level to high profile films with television billboard and newspaper advertising a corresponding increasing reliance on sequels reboots and similarly franchised IP was also seen in order to minimize risk Costs at the end of the generation had risen as high as the hundreds of millions of dollars the estimated cost of Grand Theft Auto V was approximately m The same conditions also drove the growth of the indie game scene at the other end of the development spectrum where lower costs enabled innovation and risk taking br At around the period of transition from seventh to eighth generation of consoles the cost of AAA development was considered by some to be a threat to the stability of the industry Staffing and costs for eighth generation games increased at Ubisoft AAA game development involved to persons for open world games split across multiple locations and countries The failure of a single game to meet production costs could lead to the failure of a studio Radical Entertainment was closed by parent Activision despite selling an estimated one million units on console in a short period after release Triple A games also began to lose uniqueness and novelty a common trend were a range of grey brown first person shooters that drew on the popularity of the Medal of Honor and Call of Duty series but did little to advance gameplay improvements Ubisoft game director Alex Hutchinson described the AAA franchise model as potentially harmful stating he thought it led to either focus group tested products aimed at maximizing profit and or a push towards ever higher graphics fidelity and impact at a cost of depth or gameplay br The limited risk taking in the AAA arena and stagnation of new gameplay concepts led to the rise of indie games in the early s which were seen as more experimental This also led to the creation of the AA market in the industry larger studios that were not at the scale of AAA developers but had more experience funding and other factors to make them distinct from the smaller teams usually associated with indie studios br AAA game development has been identified as one environment where crunch time and other working pressures that negatively affect employees are particularly evident br In a report by the UK Competition and Markets Authority which blocked the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft it was stated that AAA games that were greenlit for a potential release in and received an average development budget of million and up an increase from an average of a million to million from br br br Related terms br br br AAA br In general use the term AAA Triple A Plus may refer to a subset of AAA games that are the highest selling or have the highest production values However there are at least two more specific meanings br The first describes AAA games with additional methods of revenue generation generally through purchases in addition to the cost of the base game The desire for profitability has caused publishers to look at alternative revenue models where players continued to contribute revenue after the initial purchase either by premium models DLC online passes and other forms of subscription In the mid s large publishers began a focus on games engineered to have a long tail in terms of revenue from individual consumers similar to the way MMO games generate income these included those with expansion or season pass content such as with Destiny Battlefield and the Call of Duty series and those which generated revenue from selling in game items sometimes purely cosmetic such as Overwatch or League of Legends Titles of this type are sometimes referred to as AAA In Gameindustry biz described AAA games as products that combine AAA production values and aesthetics with Software as a Service SaaS principles to keep players engaged for months or even years br br br AA Double A br AA or Double A games are mid market video games that typically have some type of professional development though typically outside of the large first party studios of the major developers these may be from larger teams of indie developers in addition to larger non indie studios Double A studios tend to range from to people in size A double A development studio will typically be backed by a publisher but not fundamentally part of that publisher and thus have somewhat more freedom to innovate and experiment compared to triple A studios though will still be constrained by specific risk limiting targets and goals from their funding source Double A games generally tend to be priced lower compared to triple A games Examples of games considered to be double A titles include PUBG Battlegrounds and DayZ br As of game publishers and studios that are currently considered to be AA include Devolver Digital Warhorse Studios Obsidian Entertainment Hazelight Studios and PlatinumGames br br br III br III Triple I has been used to refer to independently funded indie games that meet an analogous quality level in their field i e indie games that have relatively high budget scope and ambition often the development team includes staff who have experience working on full AAA titles br Examples of III games include Ancestors The Humankind Odyssey Hellblade Senua s Sacrifice and The Witness br br br AAAA br Starting in leading up to the launch of the PS and the Xbox Series X two studios started using the term AAAA Quadruple A to describe upcoming games in development Microsoft s studio The Initiative is working on its debut title Perfect Dark for Xbox that s self described as being a AAAA game while Ubisoft announced Beyond Good and Evil and Skull and Bones would both be AAAA games Despite the announcements there is no agreed upon definition for the term AAAA or what it entails Olivia Harris of Screen Rant noted in September that it hasn t been adopted by the game industry at large adding that perhaps it s just the latest self aggrandizing buzzword conjured up to help games stand out in their incredibly competitive field br br br Other terms br The console video game industry lacks the equivalent of a B movie made for TV or direct to video scene However titles such as Deadly Premonition and Binary Domain have been dubbed B games due to developing cult followings or accruing significant amounts of critical praise despite widely acknowledged flaws with critics often noting that such a game s ambitions in the face of budget limitations add to the game s charm a trait common among B movies Games like this are the exception and when they are not critically well received are often referred to as bargain bin titles The term shovelware has also been used to describe games that are quickly made without great care for the quality of the product as to make easy sales to consumers as a metaphor for shoveling material onto a pile Licensed video game tie ins for films often tend to be considered shovelware for example br br br See also br Nintendo
