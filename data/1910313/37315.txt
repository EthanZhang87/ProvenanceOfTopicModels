Computer aided design CAD is the use of computers or workstations to aid in the creation modification analysis or optimization of a design This software is used to increase the productivity of the designer improve the quality of design improve communications through documentation and to create a database for manufacturing Designs made through CAD software help protect products and inventions when used in patent applications CAD output is often in the form of electronic files for print machining or other manufacturing operations The terms computer aided drafting CAD and computer aided design and drafting CADD are also used br Its use in designing electronic systems is known as electronic design automation EDA In mechanical design it is known as mechanical design automation MDA which includes the process of creating a technical drawing with the use of computer software br CAD software for mechanical design uses either vector based graphics to depict the objects of traditional drafting or may also produce raster graphics showing the overall appearance of designed objects However it involves more than just shapes As in the manual drafting of technical and engineering drawings the output of CAD must convey information such as materials processes dimensions and tolerances according to application specific conventions br CAD may be used to design curves and figures in two dimensional D space or curves surfaces and solids in three dimensional D space br CAD is an important industrial art extensively used in many applications including automotive shipbuilding and aerospace industries industrial and architectural design building information modeling prosthetics and many more CAD is also widely used to produce computer animation for special effects in movies advertising and technical manuals often called DCC digital content creation The modern ubiquity and power of computers means that even perfume bottles and shampoo dispensers are designed using techniques unheard of by engineers of the s Because of its enormous economic importance CAD has been a major driving force for research in computational geometry computer graphics both hardware and software and discrete differential geometry br The design of geometric models for object shapes in particular is occasionally called computer aided geometric design CAGD br br br Overview br Computer aided design is one of the many tools used by engineers and designers and is used in many ways depending on the profession of the user and the type of software in question br CAD is one part of the whole digital product development DPD activity within the product lifecycle management PLM processes and as such is used together with other tools which are either integrated modules or stand alone products such as br br Computer aided engineering CAE and finite element analysis FEA FEM br Computer aided manufacturing CAM including instructions to computer numerical control CNC machines br Photorealistic rendering and motion simulation br Document management and revision control using product data management PDM br CAD is also used for the accurate creation of photo simulations that are often required in the preparation of environmental impact reports in which computer aided designs of intended buildings are superimposed into photographs of existing environments to represent what that locale will be like where the proposed facilities are allowed to be built Potential blockage of view corridors and shadow studies are also frequently analyzed through the use of CAD br br br Types br br There are several different types of CAD each requiring the operator to think differently about how to use them and design their virtual components in a different manner Virtually all of CAD tools rely on constraint concepts that are used to define geometric or non geometric elements of a model br br br D CAD br There are many producers of the lower end D sketching systems including a number of free and open source programs These provide an approach to the drawing process where scale and placement on the drawing sheet can easily be adjusted in the final draft as required unlike in hand drafting br br br D CAD br D wireframe is an extension of D drafting into a three dimensional space Each line has to be manually inserted into the drawing The final product has no mass properties associated with it and cannot have features directly added to it such as holes The operator approaches these in a similar fashion to the D systems although many D systems allow using the wireframe model to make the final engineering drawing views br D dumb solids are created in a way analogous to manipulations of real world objects Basic three dimensional geometric forms e g prisms cylinders spheres or rectangles have solid volumes added or subtracted from them as if assembling or cutting real world objects Two dimensional projected views can easily be generated from the models Basic D solids do not usually include tools to easily allow the motion of the components set their limits to their motion or identify interference between components br There are several types of D solid modeling br br Parametric modeling allows the operator to use what is referred to as design intent The objects and features are created modifiable Any future modifications can be made by changing on how the original part was created If a feature was intended to be located from the center of the part the operator should locate it from the center of the model The feature could be located using any geometric object already available in the part but this random placement would defeat the design intent If the operator designs the part as it functions the parametric modeler is able to make changes to the part while maintaining geometric and functional relationships br Direct or explicit modeling provide the ability to edit geometry without a history tree With direct modeling once a sketch is used to create geometry it is incorporated into the new geometry and the designer only has to modify the geometry afterward without needing the original sketch As with parametric modeling direct modeling has the ability to include the relationships between selected geometry e g tangency concentricity br Assembly modelling is a process which incorporates results of the previous single part modelling into a final product containing several parts Assemblies can be hierarchical depending on the specific CAD software vendor and highly complex models can be achieved e g in building engineering by using computer aided architectural design software br br br Freeform CAD br br Top end CAD systems offer the capability to incorporate more organic aesthetic and ergonomic features into the designs Freeform surface modeling is often combined with solids to allow the designer to create products that fit the human form and visual requirements as well as they interface with the machine br br br Technology br br Originally software for CAD systems was developed with computer languages such as Fortran ALGOL but with the advancement of object oriented programming methods this has radically changed Typical modern parametric feature based modeler and freeform surface systems are built around a number of key C modules with their own APIs A CAD system can be seen as built up from the interaction of a graphical user interface GUI with NURBS geometry or boundary representation B rep data via a geometric modeling kernel A geometry constraint engine may also be employed to manage the associative relationships between geometry such as wireframe geometry in a sketch or components in an assembly br Unexpected capabilities of these associative relationships have led to a new form of prototyping called digital prototyping In contrast to physical prototypes which entail manufacturing time in the design That said CAD models can be generated by a computer after the physical prototype has been scanned using an industrial CT scanning machine Depending on the nature of the business digital or physical prototypes can be initially chosen according to specific needs br Today CAD systems exist for all the major platforms Windows Linux UNIX and Mac OS X some packages support multiple platforms br Currently no special hardware is required for most CAD software However some CAD systems can do graphically and computationally intensive tasks so a modern graphics card high speed and possibly multiple CPUs and large amounts of RAM may be recommended br The human machine interface is generally via a computer mouse but can also be via a pen and digitizing graphics tablet Manipulation of the view of the model on the screen is also sometimes done with the use of a Spacemouse SpaceBall Some systems also support stereoscopic glasses for viewing the D model Technologies that in the past were limited to larger installations or specialist applications have become available to a wide group of users These include the CAVE or HMDs and interactive devices like motion sensing technology br br br Software br br Starting with the IBM Drafting System in the mid s computer aided design systems began to provide more capabilitties than just an ability to reproduce manual drafting with electronic drafting and the cost benefit for companies to switch to CAD became apparent The software automated many tasks that are taken for granted from computer systems today such as automated generation of bills of materials auto layout in integrated circuits interference checking and many others Eventually CAD provided the designer with the ability to perform engineering calculations During this transition calculations were still performed either by hand or by those individuals who could run computer programs CAD was a revolutionary change in the engineering industry where draftsman designer and engineer roles that had previously been separate began to merge CAD is an example of the pervasive effect computers were beginning to have on the industry br Current computer aided design software packages range from D vector based drafting systems to D solid and surface modelers Modern CAD packages can also frequently allow rotations in three dimensions allowing viewing of a designed object from any desired angle even from the inside looking out Some CAD software is capable of dynamic mathematical modeling br CAD technology is used in the design of tools and machinery and in the drafting and design of all types of buildings from small residential types houses to the largest commercial and industrial structures hospitals and factories br CAD is mainly used for detailed design of D models or D drawings of physical components but it is also used throughout the engineering process from conceptual design and layout of products through strength and dynamic analysis of assemblies to definition of manufacturing methods of components It can also be used to design objects such as jewelry furniture appliances etc Furthermore many CAD applications now offer advanced rendering and animation capabilities so engineers can better visualize their product designs D BIM is a type of virtual construction engineering simulation incorporating time or schedule related information for project management br CAD has become an especially important technology within the scope of computer aided technologies with benefits such as lower product development costs and a greatly shortened design cycle CAD enables designers to layout and develop work on screen print it out and save it for future editing saving time on their drawings br br br License management software br In the s some CAD system software vendors shipped their distributions with a dedicated license manager software that controlled how often or how many users can utilize the CAD system It could run either on a local machine by loading from a local storage device or a local network fileserver and was usually tied to a specific IP address in latter case br br br List of software packages br CAD software enables engineers and architects to design inspect and manage engineering projects within an integrated graphical user interface GUI on a personal computer system Most applications support solid modeling with boundary representation B Rep and NURBS geometry and enable the same to be published in a variety of formats br Based on market statistics commercial software from Autodesk Dassault Systems Siemens
