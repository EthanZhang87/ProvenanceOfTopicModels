 Game over is a message in video games which informs the player that their play session has ended usually because the player has reached a loss condition It also sometimes appears at the successful completion of a session especially in games designed for arcades after the player has exhausted the game s supply of new challenges The phrase has since been turned into quasi slang usually describing an event that will cause significant harm injury bad luck or even death to a person br br br History br The phrase was used as early as in devices such as electro mechanical pinball machines which would light up the phrase with a lamp lightbulb Before the advent of home consoles and personal computing arcades were the predominant platform for playing games which required users to deposit a token or coin into an arcade game machine to play Most early arcade video games typically had the game end when a timer ran out with shoot em up game Space Invaders later popularizing a game over triggered by the player getting killed by enemies either by being shot or enemies reaching the player with the player given a finite number of lives before the game ends br During the golden age of arcade video games players would usually be given a finite number of lives or attempts to progress through the game the exhaustion of which would usually result in the display of the message Game over indicating that the game had ended The phrase might also be followed by the message Play Again and a prompt asking the player to insert additional tokens to prevent the game from terminating and instead allowing the player to continue their progress The message can also be seen flashing on certain arcade games while in attract mode until a player inserts a credit at this point the message would change to the number of credits inserted and Press or player start or some variation thereof br As these games were ported to home consoles the Game over screen and Continue prompt remained but often required only the press of a button to keep the game going while the video game industry shifted away from being arcade focused to being home gaming focused the inclusion of such a screen was no longer as critical since it offered no financial benefit However the concept of Game Over remained imbued in the medium thereafter as a way to add an element of risk a player who is unsuccessful at carrying out the game s objective possibly repeatedly will be faced with such a screen and be forced to start over from either the beginning of the game or level or to a previous saved state br br Certain games ask players with no more lives to continue or to choose game over in a menu Kamen no Ninja Akakage released in by Toei for the Famicom has game over on top of continue with a cursor to be properly positioned to get the desired choice br With the development of the aforementioned save function complemented by the less popular password system which is now seen as archaic the Game Over message has become less common as players are allowed to respawn at a previous state of the game which has been stored in memory either through a player deliberately saving the game or reaching a checkpoint which causes the game to save automatically Many modern games do not technically end until they are completed and although Game over screens remain present in many of them in some form or another it is uncommon for them to signify a forced return to the beginning of the game and only marginally more common for them to signify a substantial loss of progress Roguelikes are the most common exception to this rule permadeath is often a staple of the genre br br br Variations br Game over has seen many variations For instance in Little King s Story the message LIFE OVER appears upon the death of the player s character Nights into Dreams and Nights Journey of Dreams use NIGHT OVER Antarctic Adventure and Sonic the Hedgehog use TIME OVER Screens that display at equivalent points are considered Game over screens even if the message that is displayed is entirely different such as YOU ARE DEAD used in Resident Evil God of War and Left Dead YOU DIED seen in Dark Souls Cuphead and Minecraft though Minecraft uses Game over if one dies in hardcore mode GOOD NIGHT seen in Klonoa and Luigi s Mansion The Nintendo DS game The Queen TV Game uses FUCK to parody player frustration The arcade game Missile Command uses The End a game over screen that is usually seen upon achieving victory Another variation includes THE WITCH HUNTS ARE OVER used in the Bayonetta series YOU WERE SLAIN in Terraria and DRIVER DOWN in Hill Climb Racing br Some games give specific loss condition messages pattern screen and sequence exclusive to a level mission game mode or situation For example Plants vs Zombies give a game over dialog box saying All your pet zombies have perished in Zombiquarium mini game br br br Outside video gaming br br The phrase is occasionally used to indicate the end of an argument or process in real life In January protesters and rioters in several North African and Middle Eastern countries used the slogan Game over on banners to express their anti government sentiments br Game over is also sometimes used as a phrase to concede defeat as for example in the movie Aliens where one of the protagonists Private William Hudson Bill Paxton shouts Game over man
