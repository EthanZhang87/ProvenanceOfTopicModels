Line of sight sometimes written line of sight or abbreviated to LoS is the visibility that is who can see what on the playing field in wargames and some role playing games RPGs Many abilities can only be used on entities within a character s line of sight br In some games miniature figures are used to determine line of sight Many wargames use counters to represent units and determine line of sight A common technique is to hold a length of thread between two counters If the thread held straight doesn t encounter any obstacles the line of sight is valid br The first computer game to implement line of sight graphics was Dungeon which was played on a PDP mainframe computer br br br Examples br A tank behind a tall hill would not be able to see an enemy tank on the other side of the hill Therefore the first tank does not have a line of sight to the enemy tank Conversely a squad of soldiers atop the hill may be able to see both tanks though the tanks may not be able to see them since the tank s upward line of sight is limited br In an RPG players may not see doors objects or monsters located around the corner in a dungeon br Line of sight is crucial to many types of video games including but not limited to first person shooters strategy games stealth games and role playing video games In simplistic games with a top down perspective such as roguelikes Bresenham s line algorithm can be used to determine line of sight In first person games such as battlefield and flight simulators an implicit min max kd tree may be used to efficiently evaluate terrain line of sight queries br In some live action role playing games such as NERO International the line of sight is used as the duration for some spells and abilities For example a paralyze spell only lasts as long as the target remains within line of sight of the spell s caster br On the other hand line of sight can be used offensively like luring a player behind a pillar in order to set a trap his teammate being out of line of sight won t be able to help out until he gets in LoS which in turn takes time This time is usually the key moment to strike and go for a kill if said player falls in said trap br One algorithm for calculating dimensional line of sight is given in the StraightEdge project br br br
