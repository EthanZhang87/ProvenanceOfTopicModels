The Design Research Society DRS founded in the United Kingdom in is an international society for developing and supporting the interests of the design research community The primary purpose of the DRS as embodied in its first statement of rules is to promote the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields This established the intention of being an interdisciplinary learned society taking a scholarly and domain independent view of the process of designing Membership is open to anyone interested in design research and members with established experience and a strong background in design research may apply to be elected as a DRS Fellow br br br Origins br The origins of the Society lay in the first conference on design methods full title The Conference on Systematic and Intuitive Methods in Engineering Industrial Design Architecture and Communications held at Imperial College in London in which enabled a core of people to be identified who shared interests in new approaches to the process of designing br br br Early history br Initially the DRS promoted its aims through a series of one day conferences and the publication of a quarterly newsletter to members However within a few years unsuccessful attempts to establish a published journal and fruitless internal debate about the Society s goals led to inactivity The Society was revived by its first major international conference on design participation held in Manchester in At that conference a meeting of DRS members led to a call for a special general meeting of the Society and to changes of officers and council members Subsequently a series of conferences was held through the s and s in London Portsmouth Istanbul and Bath br In the mid s DRS also collaborated with the Design Methods Group based in the USA including publishing a joint journal Design Research and Methods br The DRS has had four honorary Presidents Bruce Archer Richard Buchanan Nigel Cross Rachel Cooper to the present br br br Publications and conferences br By the late s there was enough enthusiasm and evidence of design research activity around the world for the DRS to approach IPC Press now Elsevier Science with a successful proposal for its own journal Design Studies the international journal for design research was launched in A monthly internet news bulletin DesignResearchNews was started in and has over subscribers Between and the Society also published a quarterly newsletter Design Research Quarterly br A new biennial series of DRS conferences began in with the Common Ground conference in London Subsequent ones have been held at venues around the world with a variety of themes See the Table below In DRS was one of the founding members of the International Association of Societies of Design Research IASDR which also holds biennial international conferences In as a result of the COVID pandemic the conference that was due to be hosted by Griffith University in Brisbane was converted to a virtual event In it was held as a hybrid event br br br Design Studies and Elsevier Controversy br In Design Studies was acquired by the Dutch publishing company Elsevier As of the journal received around paper submissions annually and published around papers per year with an impact factor of In February Elsevier informed the Editor In Chief Peter Lloyd that the journal needed to increase its acceptance rate or risk closure with the expectation that it needed to publish approximately papers per year translating to an acceptance rate of around To facilitate growth without compromising the quality of the journal the editorial board agreed to increase publication to around papers annually br On June the editors were notified that Elsevier had installed a new Editor in Chief prompting the Society to issue a statement condemning this action on the basis that they had not been consulted and that the new editor was not a member of the DRS as was the journal s practice On July the DRS Executive Board issued a statement condemning Elsevier s interference and its treatment of Editor in Chief Peter Lloyd Elsevier s actions received widespread condemnation from the academic community many of whom drew comparisons with the controversy earlier that year surrounding Neuroimage another prestigious academic journal in Elsevier s stable br On July Peter Lloyd resigned as the Editor in Chief of Design Studies along with all other editors and editorial board members This included five editors Associate Editors Robin Adams Colin Gray Ann Heylighen Deputy Editor Fernando Secomandi and Emeritus Editor in Chief Nigel Cross and members of the Editorial Board A statement published on the Society s website explained this was due to the unacceptable actions of Elsevier of demanding a seven fold increase in publications or facing closure appointing a new Editor in Chief without experience of publishing in the journal and without notification and changing the scope of the journal without consultation either with the editorial team or the Design Research Society br br br Special Interest Groups br Special Interest Groups provide a forum for specific areas of research which are of interest to the Design Research Community and its members SIGs organise events and discussion in a number of ways to facilitate the exchange and development of best practice in the field Each SIG is organised by a convenor who is supported by an organising group and the SIG members DRS members are invited to join any Special Interest Group to contribute actively to research in the subject area of their chosen group br br br Special Interest Group on Experiential Knowledge EKSIG br EKSIG is concerned with the understanding and role of knowledge in research and professional practice in design in order to clarify fundamental principles and practices of using design practice within research both with regard to research regulations and requirements and research methodology br The main aims of EKSIG are br br Investigate and advance the understanding of knowledge and contribution to knowledge in design research especially in areas where designing forms part of the research process br Develop principles and criteria of research in design for employing different kinds of knowledge and means for the communication of knowledge br Promote the implementation of such principles and criteria within current research policy to promote quality and standards in research br Promote the implementation of such principles and criteria within research practice through the development of appropriate methodology to promote quality and best practice in research br EKSIG runs a biennial conference series special strands at the DRS and IASDR conferences It also runs a discussion list which is used for announcements and debate about the core issues of knowledge and methodology in research and practice in the creative disciplines br br All papers selected for presentation at the conference are published in the conference proceedings an abstract booklet with a CD or USB of the full papers and post conference online publication the preferred format of the DRS Selected papers from each conference have been published in an appropriate journal as a special issue Journal of Visual Arts Practice Archived at the Wayback Machine in Journal of Research

Journal of Research Practice br br br Special Interest Group on Wellbeing and Happiness SIGWELL br SIGWELL focuses on bringing together designers design researchers landscape architects and others who aim to improve personal and societal wellbeing through design br br br Design Pedagogy Special Interest Group PedSIG br This SIG on design pedagogy aims to bring together design researchers teachers and practitioners and others responsible for the delivery of design education to clarify and develop the role of design research in providing the theoretical underpinning for design education br The DRS Design Pedagogy Special Interest Group is bringing together other research which is directed to similar ends Design research is not an irrelevant activity living in its own little ghetto but rather it provides the basis for the academic core of design teaching and pedagogic innovation By that means through the provision of the next generation of designers it links into design practice br The DRS PedSIG runs special streams at DRS biannual conferences It also organised symposia which were hosted by the Coventry University on March and January br In the DRS PedSIG and CUMULUS Association have join forces to develop a bi annual international research events The st International Symposium for Design Education Researchers in collaboration with CUMULUS Association DRS five other international universities which included Aalto University L cole de Design Nantes Atlantique Coventry University L cole Parsons Paris and Politecnico di Milano the Lieu de Design Chambre de commerce et d industrie de Paris and AVA Publishing The symposium was held in a prestigious location of fr Bourse de commerce de Paris in May A special issue of Collection a research journal has been produced featuring a selection of contributions The nd International Conference for Design Research Educators DRS CUMULUS was hosted by the Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences br br br Special Interest Group for Objects Practices Experiences Networks OPENSIG br The OPENSiG was originally launched in under the name Emotion Experience and Interaction A special strand at the DRS conference and two successful workshops at Sheffield Hallam University and Nottingham Trent University served to define the group s interest in broad questions about human object interactions focusing on Objects and engaging with social Practices which involve Experiences with of objects in Networks of relationship br br br Inclusive Design Special Interest Group Inclusive SIG br The Inclusive Design Research Special Interest Group InclusiveSIG aims to provide an international platform for researchers design practitioners design educators and students and the general public to exchange knowledge about inclusive design and to empower wider participation in design br br br Design Research Society s Design Innovation Management Special Interest Group DIMSIG br Design Research Society s Design Innovation Management Special Interest Group DIMSIG in collaboration with the Design Society s Design Management Special Interest Group DeMSIG formed a cross societal working party named the Design Management Academy DMA The Design School at Hong Kong Polytechnic hosted the first Design Management Academy international conference in June br br br Design for Policy and Governance Special Interest Group PoGoSIG br The PoGoSIG was launched in It seeks to engage academics and practitioners in the field of design for policy and governance to study the effect of design on innovation in policy and governance This group aims to advance the field by creating a community and developing collaborative actions in research practice and education br br br Sustainable Special Interest Group
