High level design HLD explains the architecture that would be used to develop a system The architecture diagram provides an overview of an entire system identifying the main components that would be developed for the product and their interfaces br The HLD can use non technical to mildly technical terms which should be understandable to the administrators of the system In contrast low level design further exposes the logical detailed design of each of these elements for use by engineers and programmers HLD documentation should cover the planned implementation of both software and hardware br br br Purpose br Preliminary design In the preliminary stages of system development the need is to size the project and to identify those parts which might be risky or time consuming br Design overview As the project proceeds the need is to provide an overview of how the various sub systems and components of the system fit together br In both cases the high level design should be a complete view of the entire system breaking it down into smaller parts that are more easily understood To minimize the maintenance overhead as construction proceeds and the lower level design is done it is best that the high level design is elaborated only to the degree needed to satisfy these needs br br br High level design document br A high level design document or HLDD adds the necessary details to the current project description to represent a suitable model for building This document includes a high level architecture diagram depicting the structure of the system such as the hardware database br architecture application architecture layers application flow navigation security architecture and technology architecture br br br Design overview br A high level design provides an overview of a system product service or process br Such an overview helps supporting components be compatible to others br The highest level design should briefly describe all platforms systems products services and processes that it depends on and include any important changes that need to be made to them br In addition there should be brief consideration of all significant commercial legal environmental security safety and technical risks along with any issues and assumptions br The idea is to mention every work area briefly clearly delegating the ownership of more detailed design activity whilst also encouraging effective collaboration between the various project teams br Today most high level designs require contributions from a number of experts representing many distinct professional disciplines br Finally every type of end user should be identified in the high level design and each contributing design should give due consideration to customer experience br br br See also br Software development process br Systems development life cycle br br br br br br External links br High Level Design Document sample format
