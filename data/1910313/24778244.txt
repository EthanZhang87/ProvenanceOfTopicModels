control scheme Slide to Play noted that some control schemes worked better in certain circumstances than others and criticized the inability to switch control schemes mid game Kotaku found some levels impossible to complete with the tilt or touch options but the D pad controls were too easy for those who could not handle the former albeit necessary for the aforementioned impossible levels Chris Watters made note that the game had a vague clumsiness to it no matter the chosen control scheme due to the cube s rolling momentum Zachary Miller in particular criticized the game s ability to hold onto moving blocks by balancing the cube s edge against it and also found the minimap unhelpful at times br The Edge Extended expansion s iOS release received universal acclaim according to video game
