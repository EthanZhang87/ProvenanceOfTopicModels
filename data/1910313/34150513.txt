An art game or arthouse game is a work of interactive new media digital software art as well as a member of the art game subgenre of the serious video game The term art game was first used academically in and it has come to be understood as describing a video game designed to emphasize art or whose structure is intended to produce some kind of reaction in its audience Art games are interactive usually competitive against the computer self or other players and the result of artistic intent by the party offering the piece for consideration They also typically go out of their way to have a unique unconventional look often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design The concept has been extended by some art theorists to the realm of modified modded gaming when modifications have been made to existing non art games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as video game art br Art games are often considered a means of demonstrating video games as works of art br br br Overview br A definition of the art game was first proposed by Professor Tiffany Holmes School of the Art Institute of Chicago in her paper for the Melbourne DAC Conference Arcade Classics Span Art Current Trends in the Art Game Genre Holmes defined the art game as an interactive work usually humorous by a visual artist that does one or more of the following challenges cultural stereotypes offers meaningful social or historical critique or tells a story in a novel manner The paper stated that an art game must contain at least two of the following a defined way to win or experience success in a mental challenge passage through a series of levels that may or may not be hierarchical a central character or icon that represents the player This definition was narrowed by Rebecca Cannon in an October paper where she highlighted the competitive goal oriented nature of the genre in defining art games as compris ing an entire to some degree playable game Art games are always interactive and that interactivity is based on the needs of competing Art games explore the game format primarily as a new mode for structuring narrative cultural critique In a article Colombian video game theorist Carlos D az placed importance on the reflection experience as an integral aspect of the art game This experience can pertain to a variety of cultural avenues but it transcends the medium and its structure br Within the topic of the art game further subdivisions have been proposed In her paper Holmes identified two common art game types as the feminist art game an art game that generates thinking about gender and typecasting and the retro styled art game an art game that juxtaposes low resolution graphics with academic or theoretical content and that creatively subverts the format of an arcade classic to support a conceptual creative agenda In art theorist Pippa Tshabalala n e Stalker broadly defined the art game as a video game normally PC as opposed to console based that generally but not exclusively explores social or political issues through the medium of video games She proposed two different categorical schemes to further subdivide the genre by theme and by type Subdividing by theme Stalker defined aesthetic art games to include games that deal with using the game medium to express an artistic purpose and she defined political or agenda based art games as art games that have some sort of ulterior motive other than aesthetics and whose basis is in using the medium of the computer games to bring an issue to the public s or at least the art world s attention in order to attract support and understanding for a cause Subdividing by type Stalker identified the art mod the physical manifestation art game the player is involved physically in the game often experiencing physical consequences such as pain for their actions machinima and D real time art game an art game that displays all the characteristics of a complete level based commercial game both on the programming and commercial side The identification of art mods and machinima as forms of the art game conflicts with Cannon s definition of the art mod that highlights the non interactive and non competitive nature of these forms of media br Distinctions are drawn in describing the art game as a genre compared to traditional video game genres such as the platformer or first person shooter Rather than describing the game on a surface level descriptions focus on the artistic intent as well as the execution and implementation of the gameplay For instance Bethesda s release Fallout is considered to be a role playing game with first person shooter elements but it could also be considered to have elements consistent with art games it implements moral player choices for the sole purpose of provoking emotion or thought in the player There are several recent instances of video games that similarly involve the characteristics of art games such as Braid and Undertale Games like these aren t necessarily created or marketed under the classification of art game but are still created for artistic purposes that transcend their respective structures The potentials and limitations of the medium are increasingly discovered as the video game industry develops therefore resulting in the recent popularity of art game elements If nothing else the genre can be seen as a means to push the medium to its conceptual limit br Since the development of these early definitions art theorists have emphasized the role of artistic intent of author or curator and further definitions have emerged from both the art world and the video game world that draw a clear distinction between the art game and its predecessor video game art At the core of the matter lies an intersection between art and the video game Easily confused with its often non interactive sibling art form video game art and the concept of video games as an art form irrespective of artistic intent the essential position that art games take in relation to video games is analogous with the position that art film takes in relation to film ACM SIGGRAPH opened an online exhibit The Aesthetics of Gameplay in March featuring independently developed games selected via a nomination process where the mechanics of gameplay are in part tied to the visuals and audio of the game Greg Garvey the curator of this exhibit compared this to the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk where the work attempts to encompass other art forms though as Garvey comments the merger of interaction with the aesthetics drives these games beyond this concept br br br Art game versus game art br Due to the contemporaneous improvement of graphic capabilities and other aspects of game art design with the trend toward recognition of games as art and the increases in video game art production and art game releases discussions of these topics are often closely interleaved This has led to the drawing of a number of critical distinctions between the art game and the various kinds of game art br In drawing a distinction between games with artistic imagery and art games commentators have compared the art to sculpture and have emphasized the concept of artistic intent in the creation of the art game This difference has been described by Justin McElroy of Joystiq as the same as that between a sculpture and a building Though a building game can be aesthetically pleasing an art game sculpture is using its very structure to produce some kind of reaction This same comparison has been used by Jenova Chen in an interview discussing art games and the prominence of non games to the artistic gamer community Along with expanding on the notion of art games as comparable to architecture in a interview with Nora Young for Spark Jim Munroe stated that whereas video games such as the art game are shifting in the direction of the high arts within the realm of art generally traditionally video games have occupied a position in the cultural gutter making up the low arts br Another key distinction that has been made between art games and games with artistic imagery and indeed all games viewed as art is that art games are intended as artistic creations from the outset whereas traditional games are often commercially motivated and play oriented Thus the game portion of game art is merely the means to an artistic end This has been expanded by some commentators to include the artistic intention of the curator as well as the original creator This distinction also brings into focus the concept of serious play Graham and Elizabeth Coulter Smith of Southampton Solent University and The University of Northampton respectively define serious play as a mode of communication that is not instrumental and not overbearingly focused on the linguistic model a communicative medium that involves the concrete action of the participants rather than abstracts such as language This holds significant implications for an artistic medium as it facilitates communication of meaning through increasingly more empathetic and concrete means Unlike other media players of games must expend not only time but effort in the form of problem solving or the application of timed reflexes This participatory element demonstrates that adding effort as an element in an art work results in a higher degree of emotional investment and therefore a higher potential impact of artistic intent on the participant br In distinguishing between art games and video game art the elements of interactivity and often competition or goals are frequently emphasized Because art games are games and because games are interactive definitions for the art game tend to require interactivity whereas video game art can be either interactive or non interactive Beyond this the questions of whether competition rules and goals are intrinsic to games and to what extent play is even definable in the context of an art game raise thorny problems for critics who compare a game like chess to a game like Sim City and who question the playfulness of a game like Escape From Woomera A number of commentators have included the concept of competition as part of the definition of the art game to distinguish it from video game art An example of such a definition is offered by Professor John Sharp Artgames are games in the formal sense of maintaining the experiential and formal characteristics of videogames rules game mechanics goals etc as an expressive form in the same way other artists might use painting film or literature Thus game art pieces can be seen to employ traditional non art games as the canvas or artistic medium whereas art games employ the formal qualities of the game as the artistic medium br br br Art game versus art mod br The idea of a distinction between art games and artistic modifications to existing games is one that several commentators including Rebecca Cannon and Matteo Bittanti have found useful in further discussing the related topics Using Tiffany Holmes original definition of the art game as a starting point Cannon emphasized that whereas art games always comprise an entire to some degree playable game and may be made from scratch art mods by definition always modify or reuse an existing computer game but only rarely include a reward system and if so only when of thematic relevance Likewise whereas interactivity and playability are defining characteristics of the art game they are often of no consequence for the art mod br For Cannon the nature of a work as a modification is not alone determinative of the question of whether the work is an art game or an art mod Some modifications are art games despite being mods according to her definition In addressing the potential for confusion on this point she has stated that at the most basic level art games explore the game format primarily as a new mode for structuring narrative and or cultural critique whilst art mods employ game media attributes for extensive artistic expressions Thus whereas art games explore the game format art mods explore game media and whereas art mods always exploit existing games art games often replace them Fluxus scholar Celia Pearce describes the art mod or patch as an interventional strategy referencing the Dadaist concept She argues that the art mod is an example of this pseudo vandalism involving subversion and reflection within the cultural context of video games br Other art theorists including Pippa Tshabalala have rejected this narrow definition of the art game and have instead adopted a broad definition under the theory that the concept of the game is not limited to systems where the author has created rules and goals but that games emerge whenever the observer self limits play experience Thus observers experiencing the Jodi art mod SOD a modification of Wolfenstein D can experience it as an art game as soon as they decide that their goal will be to progress to the next level br br br History br br br Origins and first wave art games br The art game genre has emerged most directly from the intersection of commercial culture specifically commercial video games and contemporary digital art In attempting to determine the earliest origins of the genre however art theorists including Tiffany Holmes and Greg Costikyan have identified its earliest roots in Dada and the collaborative drawing games of the Surrealist artists of the s Others have drawn still broader connections to literary games invented by the author for the reader in th and th century literature By treating the game as a topic of artistic utility these earlier art movements legitimized the concept of the game as an artistically explorable form and as more than simply idle amusement br At the Art History of Games conference in Atlanta Georgia Professor Celia Pearce further noted that since the Fluxus movement of the s and Marcel Duchamp s art productions procedurality has taken a central position in certain forms of art The artistically motivated imposition of strict rules of creation for an art piece in this case the restriction by the author to the format or medium of the video game brought video games and art into a collision resulting in the first true art games Although early game like programs such as Conway s zero player Game of Life were foundational to later art games Pearce identifies the earliest true art games as originating in a small wave in the early s with games such as Bernie DeKoven and Jaron Lanier s Alien Garden Other early art games from this period include Jane Veeder s Warpitout Lanier s Moondust and Lynn Hershman Leeson s Laserdisc games LORNA and Deep Contact Following this period of activity art game production would see a lull until the end of the s br Video games were first displayed in the art museum setting during the s in retrospective exhibitions like Corcoran Gallery of Art s ARTcade and Museum of the Moving Image s Hot Circuits A Video Arcade However just as with the production of art games the practice became much more common during the late s and early s Exhibitions like the Walker Art Center s Beyond Interface the online Synreal and Cracking the Maze Game Plug Ins as Hacker Art shift e V s RELOAD the UCI Beall Centre s Shift Ctrl and several others in were among the first wave of video game exhibitions that popularized the concept This expanded to exhibitions heavily featuring or exclusive to art game content in the early s with shows like MASS MoCA s GameShow San Francisco MOMA s Art in Technological Times the Whitney Museum s Bitstreams and the New York Museum of the Moving Image s ALT Digital Media br br br Rise of the artist game br Drawing from the modern traditions of the s New Games Movement where the playing of a game could be regarded as a form of performance art art pieces such as Frank Lantz Pac Manhattan Blast Theory s Can You See Me Now and similar hybrid performance art art games including Painstation Go Fish and Vagamundo came in the early years of the modern period of art game production The burgeoning video game art movement also provided direct inspiration for art game development particularly in the creation of art mods Art theorist Rebecca Cannon identifies the earliest example of a purposeful art mod to be Iimura Takahiko s AIUEOUNN Six Features a modification of Sony s System G although the transgressive capability of mods like Castle Smurfenstein had already been recognized during the first period of art game creation Online artist collectives including Jodi org and the Australian SelectParks soon began production of art games in the studio setting repurposing older games through the use of interactive art mods br The use of mods within art games became one of the primary tools for art game creators who designed games with a message such as the addition of female characters to a traditionally male centric game or to force the audience to re examine a familiar work in a different light Consequently the early history of art games is intimately connected to the history of commercial video games and the establishment of video gaming conventions and significant events in the history of video games have corresponding significance to art games This is true both in terms of the level of technological advancement that make up the substance of art games as well as by providing cultural touchstones such as the classic arcade games and blockbuster titles from the s like Doom and Myst that art games may use referentially or as the subject of an homage Art games of this kind have been defined by theorists as artist games art games created by non developer contemporary artists rather than by game developers Typically produced on a smaller budget and with less technical coding knowledge than art games emerging from the game scene itself artist games are often more explicit in terms of their artistic ambitions and commonly occupy the grey area between modification and original game because they are frequently based on classic arcade titles from the s Early examples of this kind of game include Thompson and Craighead s Trigger Happy Esc to Begin s Font Asteroids and Natalie Bookchin s The Intruder br As video games became increasingly common as a form of media throughout the s video games that deemphasized the game portion of the medium such as serious games non games and art games saw a rise in production This in turn led to recognition of the game as a vehicle for ideas instead of simply an entertaining diversion The term art game was first used in the scholarly setting by Professor Tiffany Holmes in her paper Art games and Breakout New media meets the American arcade Holmes presented this paper at the Computer Games and Digital Cultures conference in Tampere Finland and at SIGGRAPH later expanding it by defining the term in a paper for the Melbourne DAC Conference Further refinements to the definition were made by theorist Rebecca Cannon in her late paper Introduction to Artistic Computer Game Modification br br br Rise of the indie art game br Beginning in the early to mid s with games such as Samorost and The Endless Forest a strong overlap developed between art games and indie games This meeting of the art game movement and the indie game movement brought art games to the attention of the video game culture at large and sparked large debates regarding whether or not video games can be fairly considered as works of art as well as a backlash against use of the term These debates have in turn led to the retrospective determination of numerous older commercial video games prior to the use of the term art game as art games As indie art games have seen a dramatic rise in production in the late s especially from and onwards indie game developers like Jenova Chen Molleindustria Jason Nelson Jason Rohrer and Tale of Tales have become established and artist games have become relatively less common br Discussions over the commercial viability of art games have led to speculation concerning the potential for the commercial video game industry to fund the development of prestige games games that are unlikely to be commercially successful but whose artistic vision marks them as important to the development of the medium These considerations are generally regarded as premature as the concept of prestige hasn t yet taken hold for publishers as it has for developers in the nascent industry Consequently publishers are generally unwilling to take on commercially risky high concept games the same way that major film studios who often have arthouse divisions might for art films that could enhance their prestige The need for adequate funding to produce high quality art games has been recognized by art game creators like Florent Deloison and Mark Essen who in joined designer game firms where individualized art games can be commissioned as luxury items by art patrons for a substantial price br br br Criticism of the term art game br Alongside the growing use of the term art game numerous members of the video game culture have reacted negatively to its application Critics have noted that the term turns away a certain segment of the gamer population who reject the notion that games can be works of art and who equate art games with elitist gaming This kind of reaction has in turn caused some game developers to reject the use of the term to describe their games instead using terms like not game un game or simply refusing to accept any categorical label for their work Some common criticisms of the term include br br A view from some within the gaming community that describing a game as an art game means that it s pretentious and not fun br A view that those who play and enjoy art games known as art gamers are snobby and not to be emulated br A view that the term art game needlessly introduces the distinction between high art and low art within video games where it has never existed previously br A view that the term art game is over broad and that it is incorrectly used synonymously with indie game thereby improperly co opting the concept of innovation when innovation itself is not art br The idea that the term art game implies an exclusive claim to artistry within the medium of the video game and that art games are therefore superior to other forms br The idea that works today labeled as art games lack the formal properties to properly be called games or art at all br br br List of art games br br br See also br Art film br Auteur
