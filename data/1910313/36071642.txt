Public interest design is a human centered and participatory design practice that places emphasis on the triple bottom line of sustainable design that includes ecological economic and social issues and on designing products structures and systems that address issues such as economic development and the preservation of the environment Projects incorporating public interest design focus on the general good of the local citizens with a fundamentally collaborative perspective br Starting in the late s several books convenings and exhibitions have generated new momentum and investment in public interest design Since then public interest design frequently described as a movement or field has gained public recognition br br br History br Public interest design grew out of the community design movement which got its start in after American civil rights leader Whitney Young issued a challenge to attendees of the American Institute of Architects AIA national convention br you are not a profession that has distinguished itself by your social and civic contributions to the cause of civil rights and I am sure this does not come to you as any shock You are most distinguished by your thunderous silence and your complete irrelevance br The response to Young s challenge was the establishment of community design centers CDCs across the United States CDCs which were often established with the support of area universities provided a variety of design services such as affordable housing within their own neighborhoods br In architecture schools design build programs provided outreach to meet local design needs particularly in low income and underserved areas One of the earliest design build programs was Yale University s Vlock Building Project The project which was initiated by students at Yale University School of Architecture in requires graduate students to design and build low income housing br One of the most publicized programs is the Auburn University Rural Studio design build program which was founded in Samuel Mockbee and D K Ruth created the program to inspire hands on community outreach and service based architectural opportunities for students The program gained traction due to Mockbee investing in the low income housing aesthetics an aspect previously downplayed in architectural design of houses for the poor Mockbee and Ruth expressed their understanding of the communities through their architectural designs the visuals and functionality address the needs of the citizens The Rural Studio s first project Bryant House was completed in for br br br Public Interest Design from the s Present br Interest in public interest design particularly socially responsible architecture began to grow during the s and continued into the first decade of the new millennium in reaction to the expansive globalization Conferences books and exhibitions began to showcase the design work being done beyond the community design centers which had greatly decreased in numbers since their peak in the seventies br Non profit organizations including Architecture for Humanity BaSiC Initiative Design Corps Public Architecture Project H Project Locus and MASS Design Group began to provide design services that served a larger segment of the population than had been served by traditional design professions br Many public interest design organizations also provide training and service learning programs for architecture students and graduates In the Enterprise Rose Architectural Fellowship was established giving young architects the opportunity to work on three year long design and community development projects in low income communities br Two of the earliest formal public interest design programs include the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio at Mississippi State University and the Public Interest Design Summer Program at the University of Texas br In February Portland State University launched the first graduate certificate program in Public Interest Design in the United States br The first professional level training was conducted in July by the Public Interest Design Institute PIDI and held at the Harvard Graduate School of Design br Also in a survey of American Institute of Architects AIA of AIA members agreed that the mission of the professional practice of public interest design could be defined as the belief that every person should be able to live in a socially economically and environmentally healthy community br br br Conferences and exhibits br The annual Structures for Inclusion conference showcases public interest design projects from around the world The first conference which was held in was called Design for the Without Architects Speaking at the conference Rural Studio co founder Samuel Mockbee challenged attendees to serve a greater segment of the population I believe most of us would agree that American architecture today exists primarily within a thin band of elite social and economic conditions in creating architecture and ultimately community it should make no difference which economic or social type is served as long as the status quo of the actual world is transformed by an imagination that creates a proper harmony for both the affluent and the disadvantaged br In the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum held an exhibition titled Design for the Other curated by Cynthia Smith Following the success of this exhibit Smith developed the Design Other initiative into an ongoing series the second of which was titled Design for the Other CITIES held at the United Nations headquarters In Andres Lipek of the Museum of Modern Art in New York curated an exhibit called Small Scale Big Change New Architectures of Social Engagement br br br Professional Networks br One of the oldest professional networks related to public interest design is the professional organization Association for Community Design ACD which was founded in br In adopting a term coined by architect Kimberly Dowdell the Social Economic Environmental Design SEED Network was co founded by a group of community design leaders during a meeting hosted by the Loeb Fellowship at the Harvard Graduate School of Design The SEED Network established a common set of five principles and criteria for practitioners of public interest design An evaluation tool called the SEED Evaluator is available to assist designers and practitioners in developing projects that align with SEED Network goals and criteria br In the Open Architecture Network was launched by Architecture for Humanity in conjunction with co founder Cameron Sinclair s TED Wish Taking on the name Worldchanging in the network is an open source community dedicated to improving living conditions through innovative and sustainable design Designers of all persuasions can share ideas designs and plans as well as collaborate and manage projects while protecting their intellectual property rights using the Creative Commons some rights reserved licensing system br In DESIGN Social Design Network an online platform built in partnership with UNESCO was launched br In the Design Other Network was launched by the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum in conjunction with its Design with the Other CITIES exhibition br In IDEO org with the support of The Bill Melinda Gates Foundation launched HCD Connect a network for social sector leaders committed to human centered design In this context human centered design begins with the end user of a product place or system taking into account their needs behaviors and desires The fast growing professional network of builds on The Human Centered Design Toolkit which was designed specifically for people nonprofits and social enterprises that work with low income communities throughout the world People using the HCD Toolkit or human centered design in the social sector now have a place to share their experiences ask questions and connect with others working in
