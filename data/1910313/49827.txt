An arcade video game takes player input from its controls processes it through electrical or computerized components and displays output to an electronic monitor or similar display All arcade video games are coin operated or accept other means of payment housed in an arcade cabinet and located in amusement arcades alongside other kinds of arcade games Until the early s arcade video games were the largest and most technologically advanced segment of the video game industry br Early prototypical entries Galaxy Game and Computer Space in established the principle operations for arcade games and Atari s Pong in is recognized as the first successful commercial arcade video game Improvements in computer technology and gameplay design led to a golden age of arcade video games the exact dates of which are debated but range from the late s to the early s This golden age includes Space Invaders Pac Man and Donkey Kong The arcade industry had a resurgence from the early s to mid s including Street Fighter II Mortal Kombat and Dance Dance Revolution but ultimately declined in the Western world as competing home video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox increased in their graphics and gameplay capability and decreased in cost Nevertheless Japan China and South Korea retain a strong arcade industry in the present day br br br History br br Games of skill were popular amusement park midway attractions from the th century on With the introduction of electricity and coin operated machines they facilitated a viable business When pinball machines with electric lights and displays were introduced in but without the user controller flippers which would not be invented until these machines were seen as games of luck Numerous states and cities treated them as amoral playthings for rebellious young people and banned them into the s and s br Electro mechanical games EM games appeared in arcades in the mid th century Following Sega s EM game Periscope the arcade industry experienced a technological renaissance driven by audio visual EM novelty games establishing the arcades as a suitable environment for the introduction of commercial video games in the early s In the late s college student Nolan Bushnell had a part time job at an arcade where he became familiar with EM games such as Chicago Coin s racing game Speedway watching customers play and helping to maintain the machinery while learning the game business br The early mainframe game Spacewar inspired the first commercial arcade video game Computer Space created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney and released by Nutting Associates It was demonstrated at the Amusement Music Operators Association AMOA show in October Another Spacewar inspired coin operated video game Galaxy Game was demonstrated at Stanford University in November Bushnell and Dabney followed their Computer Space success to create with the help of Allan Alcorn a table tennis game Pong released in Pong became a commercial success leading numerous other coin op manufacturers to enter the market br br The video game industry transitioned from discrete integrated circuitry to programmable microprocessors in the mid s starting with Gun Fight in The arcade industry entered a Golden Age in with the release of Taito s Space Invaders which introduced many novel gameplay features including a scoreboard From to several other major arcade games from Namco Atari Williams Electronics Stern Electronics and Nintendo were all considered blockbusters particularly Namco s Pac Man which became a fixture in popular culture Across North America and Japan dedicated video game arcades appeared and arcade game cabinets appeared in many smaller storefronts By the arcade video game industry was worth US billion in the US br The novelty of arcade games waned sharply after due to several factors including market saturation of arcades and arcade games a moral panic over video games similar to fears raised over pinball machines in the decades prior and the video game crash as the home console market impacted arcades The arcade market had recovered by with the help of software conversion kits the arrival of popular beat em up games such as Kung Fu Master and Renegade and advanced motion simulator games such as Sega s taikan games including Hang On Space Harrier and Out Run However the growth of home video game systems such as the Nintendo Entertainment System led to another brief arcade decline toward the end of the s br Arcade games continued to improve with the development of technology and of gameplay In the early s the release of Capcom s Street Fighter II established the modern style of fighting games and led to a number of similar games such as Mortal Kombat Fatal Fury Killer Instinct Virtua Fighter and Tekken creating a new renaissance in the arcades Another factor was realism including the D Revolution from D and pseudo D graphics to true real time D polygon graphics This was largely driven by a technological arms race between Sega and Namco During the early s games such as Sega s Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter popularized D polygon technology in arcades D graphics later became popular in console and computer games by the mid s though arcade systems such as the Sega Model remained considerably more advanced than home systems in the late s Until about arcade video games had remained the largest segment of the global video game industry Arcades declined in the late s surpassed by the console market for the first time around br Since the s arcade games have taken different routes globally In the United States arcades have become niche markets as they compete with the home console market and they have adapted other business models such as providing other entertainment options or adding prize redemptions In Japan where arcades continue to flourish games like Dance Dance Revolution and The House of the Dead aim to deliver tailored experiences that players cannot easily have at home br br br Technology br br Virtually all modern arcade games other than the very traditional fair midway make extensive use of solid state electronics integrated circuits and monitor screens all installed inside an arcade cabinet br With the exception of Galaxy Game and Computer Space which were built around small form factor mainframe computers the first arcade games are based on combinations of multiple discrete logic chips such as transistor transistor logic TTL chips Designing an arcade game was more about the combination of these TTL chips and other electronic components to achieve the desired effect on screen More complex gameplay required significantly more TTL components to achieve this result By the mid s the first inexpensive programmable microprocessors had arrived on the market The first microprocessor based video game is Midway s Gun Fight in a conversion of Taito s Western Gun and with the advent of Space Invaders and the golden era microprocessor based games became typical Early arcade games were also designed around raster graphics displayed on a cathode ray tube CRT display Many games of the late s and early s use special displays that rendered vector graphics though these waned by the mid s as display technology on CRTs improved Prior to the availability of color CRT or vector displays some arcade cabinets have a combination of angled monitor positioning one way mirrors and clear overlays to simulate colors and other graphics onto the gameplay field br Coin operated arcade video games from the s to the s generally use custom hardware often with multiple CPUs highly specialized sound and graphics chips and the latest in expensive computer graphics display technology This allows more complex graphics and sound than contemporary video game consoles or personal computers Many arcade games since the s run on modified video game console hardware such as the Sega NAOMI or Triforce or gaming PC components such as the Taito Type X Many arcade games have more immersive and realistic game controls than PC or console games This includes specialized ambiance or control accessories such as fully enclosed dynamic cabinets with force feedback controls dedicated lightguns rear projection displays reproductions of automobile or airplane cockpits motorcycle or horse shaped controllers or highly dedicated controllers such as dancing mats and fishing rods These accessories are usually too bulky expensive and specialized to be used with typical home PCs and consoles Arcade makers experiment with virtual reality technology Arcades have progressed from using coins as credits to smart cards that hold the virtual currency of credits br Modern arcade cabinets use flat panel displays instead of cathode ray tubes Internet services such as ALL Net NESiCAxLive e Amusement and NESYS allow the cabinets to download updates or new games do online multiplayer gameplay save progress unlock content or earn credits br br br Genres br br Many arcade games have short levels simple and intuitive control schemes and rapidly increasing difficulty The classic formula for a successful arcade video game is easy to learn difficult to master along with a multiple life progressively difficult level paradigm This is due to the environment of the arcade where the player is essentially renting the game for as long as their in game avatar can stay alive or until they run out of tokens Games on consoles or PCs can be referred to as arcade games if they share these qualities or are direct ports of arcade games br Arcade racing games often have sophisticated motion simulator arcade cabinets a simplified physics engine and short learning time when compared with more realistic racing simulations Cars can turn sharply without braking or understeer and the AI rivals are sometimes programmed so they are always near the player with a rubberband effect Other types of arcade style games include music games particularly rhythm games and mobile and casual games with intuitive controls and short sessions br br br Action br The term arcade game can refer to an action video game designed to play similarly to an arcade game with frantic addictive gameplay The focus of arcade action games is on the user s reflexes and many feature very little puzzle solving complex thinking or strategy skills These include fighting games often played with an arcade controller beat em up games including fast paced hack and slash games and light gun rail shooters and bullet hell shooters with intuitive controls and rapidly increasing difficulty br Many arcade combat flight simulation games have sophisticated hydraulic motion simulator cabinets and simplified physics and handling Arcade flight games are meant to have an easy learning curve in order to preserve their action component Increasing numbers of console flight video games such as Crimson Skies Ace Combat and Secret Weapons Over Normandy indicate the falling of manual heavy flight sim popularity in favor of instant arcade flight action br A modern subgenre of action games called hack and slash or character action games represent an evolution of traditional arcade action games and are sometimes considered a subgenre of beat em up brawlers This subgenre of games was largely defined by Hideki Kamiya creator of the Devil May Cry and Bayonetta franchises br br br Industry br Arcade games are found in restaurants bowling alleys college campuses video rental shops dormitories laundromats movie theaters supermarkets shopping malls airports and other retail environments They are popular in public places where people are likely to have free time br Their profitability is expanded by the popularity of conversions of arcade games for home based platforms In WMS Industries parent company of Midway Games reported that if more than arcade units are sold at least home version units will be sold br The American Amusement Machine Association AAMA is a trade association established in that represents the American coin operated amusement machine industry including arcade game distributors and manufacturers The Japan Amusement Machine and Marketing Association JAMMA represents the Japanese arcade industry Arcade machines may have standardized connectors or interfaces such as JAMMA or JVS that help with quick replacement of game systems or boards in arcade cabinets The game boards or arcade boards may themselves allow for games to be replaced via game cartridges or discs br br br Conversions emulators and recreations br Prior to the s successful video games were often converted to a home video game console or home computer Many of the initial Atari VCS games for example were conversions of Atari s success arcade games Arcade game manufacturers that were not in the home console or computer business found licensing of their games to console manufacturers to be a successful business model as console manufacturer competitors would vie for rights to more popular games Coleco famously bested Atari to secure the rights to convert Nintendo s Donkey Kong which it subsequently included as a pack in game for the ColecoVision to challenge the VCS br Arcade conversions typically had to make concessions for the lower computational power and capabilities of the home console such as limited graphics or alterations in gameplay Such conversions had mixed results The Atari VCS conversion of Space Invaders was considered the VCS s killer application helping to quadruple the VCS sales in In contrast the VCS conversion of Pac Man in was highly criticized for technical flaws due to VCS limitations such as flickering ghosts and simplified gameplay Though Pac Man was the best selling game on the VCS it eroded consumer confidence in Atari s games and partially contributed to the crash br The need for arcade conversions began to wane as arcade game manufacturers like Nintendo Sega and SNK entered the home console market and used similar technology within their home consoles as found at the arcade negating the need to simplify the game Concessions still may be made for a home release notably the Super Nintendo Entertainment System conversion of Mortal Kombat removed much of the gore from the arcade version to meet Nintendo s quality control standards br br Exact copies of arcade video games can be run through emulators such as MAME on modern devices An emulator is an application that translates foreign software onto a modern system in real time Emulated games appeared legally and commercially on the Macintosh in with Williams floppy disks Sony PlayStation in and Sega Saturn in with CD ROM compilations such as Williams Arcade s Greatest Hits and Arcade s Greatest Hits The Atari Collection and on the PlayStation and GameCube with DVD ROM compilations such as Midway Arcade Treasures Arcade games are downloaded and emulated through the Nintendo Wii Virtual Console service starting in br Using emulation companies like Arcade Up have produced at scale or reduced scale recreations of arcade cabinets using modern technology such as LCD monitors and lightweight construction These cabinets are typically designed to resemble the original arcade game cabinets but may also support multiple related games These cabinets can be offered in diverse and miniaturized styles such as table mounted and wall mounted versions br br br Highest grossing br br For arcade games success is usually judged by either the number of arcade hardware units sold to operators or the amount of revenue generated The revenue can include the coin drop earnings from coins such as quarters dollars or yen coins inserted into machines and or the earnings from hardware sales with each unit costing thousands of dollars Most of the revenue figures listed below are incomplete as they only include hardware sales revenue due to a lack of available data for coin drop earnings which typically account for the majority of a hit arcade game s gross revenue This list only includes arcade games that either sold more than hardware units or generated a revenue of more than million Most of the games listed were released between the golden age of arcade video games and the s br br br Franchises br br These are the combined hardware sales of at least two or more arcade games that are part of the same franchise This list only includes franchises that have sold at least hardware units or grossed at least million revenues br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br br The Video Arcade
