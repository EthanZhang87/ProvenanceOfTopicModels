Design flows are the explicit combination of electronic design automation tools to accomplish the design of an integrated circuit Moore s law has driven the entire IC implementation RTL to GDSII design flows from one which uses primarily stand alone synthesis placement and routing algorithms to an integrated construction and analysis flows for design closure The challenges of rising interconnect delay led to a new way of thinking about and integrating design closure tools br The RTL to GDSII flow underwent significant changes from through The continued scaling of CMOS technologies significantly changed the objectives of the various design steps The lack of good predictors for delay has led to significant changes in recent design flows New scaling challenges such as leakage power br variability and reliability will continue to require significant changes to the design closure process in the future Many factors describe what drove the design flow from a set of separate design steps to a fully integrated approach and what further changes are coming to address the latest challenges In his keynote at the th Design Automation Conference entitled The Tides of EDA Alberto Sangiovanni Vincentelli distinguished three periods of EDA br br The Age of Invention During the invention era routing placement static timing analysis and logic synthesis were invented br The Age of Implementation In the age of implementation these steps were drastically improved by designing sophisticated data structures and advanced algorithms This allowed the tools in each of these design steps to keep pace with the rapidly increasing design sizes However due to the lack of good predictive cost functions it became impossible to execute a design flow by a set of discrete steps no matter how efficiently each of the steps was implemented br The Age of Integration This led to the age of integration where most of the design steps are performed in an integrated environment driven by a set of incremental cost analyzers br There are differences between the steps and methods of the design flow for analog and digital integrated circuits Nonetheless a typical VLSI design flow consists of various steps like design conceptualization chip optimization logical physical implementation and design validation and verification br br br See also br Floorplan microelectronics creates the physical infrastructure into which the design is placed and routed br Placement EDA an essential step in Electronic Design Automation EDA br Routing EDA a crucial step in the design of integrated circuits br Power optimization EDA the use of EDA tools to optimize reduce the power consumption of a digital design while preserving its functionality br Post silicon validation the final step in the EDA design flow br br br br br Electronic Design Automation For Integrated Circuits Handbook by Lavagno Martin and Scheffer ISBN A survey of the field from which this summary was derived with permission
