title: Form factor (design)
id: 50797595
Form factor is a hardware design aspect that defines and prescribes the size shape and other physical specifications of components particularly in electronics A form factor may represent a broad class of similarly sized components or it may prescribe a specific standard It may also define an entire system as in a computer form factor br br br Evolution and standardization br As electronic hardware has become smaller following Moore s law and related patterns ever smaller form factors have become feasible Specific technological advances such as PCI Express have had a significant design impact though form factors have historically evolved slower than individual components Standardization of form factors is vital for hardware compatibility between different manufacturers br br br Trade offs br Smaller form factors may offer more efficient use of limited space greater flexibility in the placement of components within a larger assembly reduced use of material and greater ease of transportation and use However smaller form factors typically incur greater costs in the design manufacturing and maintenance phases of the engineering lifecycle and do not allow the same expansion options as larger form factors In particular the design of smaller form factor computers and network equipment must entail careful consideration of cooling End user maintenance and repair of small form factor electronic devices such as mobile phones is often not possible and may be discouraged by warranty voiding clauses such devices require professional servicing or simply replacement when they fail br br br Examples br br Computer form factors comprise a number of specific industry standards for motherboards specifying dimensions power supplies placement of mounting holes and ports and other parameters Other types of form factors for computers include br br Small form factor SFF a more loosely defined set of standards that may refer to both motherboards and computer cases SFF devices include mini towers and home theater PCs br Pizza box form factor a wide flat case form factor used for computers and network switches often sized for installation in a inch rack br All in one PC br Lunchbox portable computer br br br Components br Hard disk drive form factors the physical dimensions of a computer hard drive br Hard disk enclosure form factor the physical dimensions of a computer hard drive enclosure br Motherboard form factor the physical dimensions of a computer motherboard br Memory module form factors br br br Mobile form factors br Laptop or notebook a form of portable computer with a clamshell design br Subnotebook ultra mobile PC netbook and tablet computer various form factors for devices that are smaller and often cheaper than a typical notebook br Mobile phone including a wide range of sizes and layouts Broad categories of form factors include bars flip phones and sliders with many subtypes and variations Also include phablets small tablets and industrial handheld devices br Stick PC a single board computer in a small elongated casing resembling a stick br br br See also br Computer hardware br Electronic packaging br Packaging engineering br List of computer size categories br List of integrated circuit package dimensions br br br Notes br br br
