id: 25818098
Corrugated box design is the process of matching design factors for corrugated fiberboard sometimes called corrugated cardboard or corrugated plastic boxes with the functional physical processing and end use requirements Packaging engineers work to meet the performance requirements of a box while controlling total costs throughout the system Corrugated boxes are shipping containers used for transport packaging and have important functional and economic considerations br In addition to the structural design discussed in this article printed bar codes labels and graphic design are also vital br br br Functions br br Corrugated boxes are used frequently as shipping containers Boxes need to contain the product from manufacturing through distribution to sale and sometimes end use Boxes provide some measure of product protection by themselves but often require inner components such as cushioning bracing and blocking to help protect fragile contents The shipping hazards depend largely upon the particular logistics system being employed For example boxes unitized into a unit load on a pallet do not encounter individual handling while boxes sorted and shipped through part of their distribution cycle as mixed loads or express carriers can receive severe shocks kicks and so forth br Ordinary shipping containers require printing and labels to identify the contents provide legal and regulatory information and bar codes for routing Boxes that are used for marketing merchandising and point of sale often have high graphics to help communicate the contents Some boxes are designed for the display of contents on the shelf known as Retail Ready Packaging Others are designed to help dispense the contents Popular for their strength durability lightness recyclability and cost effectiveness corrugated boxes are used for the shipping of a variety of items Due to the quality and safety of packaging items in corrugated boxes they are used widely in the food industry The boxes handle the pressure that comes with stacking making them ideal for easy transporting br More than of all products in the United States are shipped in corrugated boxes Corrugated paperboard accounts for more than half of all the paper recycled in the US br br br Stacking strength br One of the important functions of a corrugated box is to provide crush resistance product protection and adequate strength for stacking in warehouses If long term storage of corrugated boxes in high humidity is expected extra strength and moisture resistance is called for The method of loading boxes on pallets strongly affects stacking Vertical columns provide the best box performance while interlocking patterns of boxes significantly reduce performance The interaction of the boxes and pallets is also important br A box can be designed by optimizing the grade of corrugated board box design flute direction and inner supports Support from the product also provides load sharing and can be an important factor Box closures sometimes can have effects on box stacking strength br Box compression testing is a means of evaluating boxes stacks of boxes and unit loads under controlled conditions Field conditions of stacking and dynamic compression do not have the same degree of control Compression strength can be estimated based on container construction size and use parameters actual package testing is often conducted to verify these estimates br br br Handling strength br br Many items are shipped individually in part or entirely by express carrier mail or other mixed logistics systems The demands of multiple manual handlings automated sortation and uncontrolled stacking in trucks or air containers put severe stress on boxes box closures and the contents Boxes designed for unit load handling and storage may not be suited to mixed logistics systems Less than truckload shipping puts more stress on corrugated shipping containers than shipment by uniform pallet loads in trucks or intermodal containers Boxes sometimes need to be heavier construction to match the needs of the distribution system Package testing is often matched to the expected shipping hazards ASTM International and the International Safe Transit Association test protocols reflect this br br br Other factors br Several texts offer guidance on the box design process The Wiley Handbook of Packaging Technology offers guidance on considerations and options ASTM D Standard Practice for Selection of Corrugated Fiberboard Materials and Box Construction Based on Performance Requirements discusses material choices and box structures which may be good options for specified package performance br Depending on the contents some corrugated boxes need extra stiffness or a heavier grade of board Boxes with hand holes or handles sometimes need higher strength board reinforcement attached with adhesives or embedded fibers br br br Process br br Several packaging texts discuss factors to consider in the design of packages ASTM International has standards D Standard Guide for Transport Packaging Design and D Standard Practice for Selection of Corrugated Fiberboard Materials and Box Construction Based on Performance Requirements These suggest factors including cost materials labor capital utility package performance machinability marketing requirements logistics factors transport hazards compression impact rupture humidity condensation temperature pilferage regulations and others br Packaging engineers and designers start with the needs of the particular project cost constraints machinery capabilities product characteristics logistics needs applicable regulations consumer needs etc Often designs are made with Computer Aided Design programs connected to automated sample making tables Several design and construction options might be considered Samples are often submitted to package testing based on ASTM or other standard test protocols such as the International Safe Transit Association Structural design is matched with graphic design For consumer based designs marketing personnel sometimes use Focus groups or more quantitative means of assessing acceptance Test markets are employed for major programs br The process starts by making corrugated board on a corrugating line a long series of linked machines which may be the size of an American football field A finished piece of single wall corrugated board is a single corrugated layer sandwiched between two liners br Skilled workers prepare job tickets for each stack of box blanks and route the blanks to fabrication machines Printing dies and patterns are prepared on large flexible rubber or tin sheets They are loaded onto rollers and the box blanks are fed through it where each is trimmed printed cut scored folded and glued to form a box Finished boxes are then stacked and sent to a banding machine to be wrapped and shipped br br br Design br br The most common box style is the Regular Slotted Container RSC All flaps are the same length from score to edge Typically the major flaps meet in the middle and the minor flaps do not unless the width is equal to the length The size of a box can be measured for either internal for product fit or external for handling machinery or palletizing dimensions The manufacturer s joint is most often joined with adhesive but may also be taped or stitched The box is shipped flat knocked down to the packager who sets up the box fills it and closes it for shipment Box closure may be by tape adhesive staples strapping etc br Boxes are usually specified and ordered by the internal dimensions Box styles in Europe are typically specified by a digit code provided by the European Federation of Corrugated Board Manufacturers FEFCO an RSC is coded br Many other styles of corrugated boxes and structures are available One common source is the Fibre Box Association br br FOL Full Overlap A Full Overlap Box is similar to an RSC except the major flaps fully overlap Full overlap flaps provide extra stacking strength and edge protection br HSC Half Slotted Container Half Slotted Containers HSC are similar to an RSC but with only one set of flaps They are useful when an open top container is desired HSCs can be used to create a telescope box br A Full Telescope Box has two fully telescoping sections The sections may be formed by staples die cut locks adhesive etc br A Partial Telescope Box has two sections The top telescopes partially over the bottom Commonly used for holding printing paper br A corrugated tray is often used for display purposes or used with a shrink wrap br Corrugated corner pads can be used for product support and cushioning br Special die cut shapes have almost endless designs and uses br etc br br br Examples of container

to be delivered to them in shipping containers which allow the easy stocking of full caseloads The goal is to put the case directly onto shelves and stocking locations without individually handling the unit packs or primary packages Retailers often require products to come in shelf ready packaging to reduce stocking costs and save labor expenses br Several specialized box designs are available br br br Government military and export br Many items being supplied to governments are handled very well boxes are unitized shipped on covered trucks or intermodal containers and storage is in warehouses Normal domestic boxes and commercial packaging are acceptable br Military materiel field supplies and humanitarian aid often encounter severe handling and uncontrolled storage Special box specifications for government shipments are often applicable Weather resistant fiberboards box construction box closure and unitizing are needed br br br Dangerous and hazardous goods br br Shipment of dangerous goods or hazardous materials are highly regulated Based on the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods model regulations each country has coordinated design and performance requirements for shipment For example in the US the Department of Transportation has jurisdiction and published requirements in Title of the Code of Federal Regulations Corrugated boxes are described in G requirements Performance severe drop test etc needs to be certified for the box and contents br Some carriers have additional requirements br br br Box closure br The means of closing a box is an important aspect of design It is affected by the types of equipment available to production lines the measured laboratory performance the field performance and the ability of end users to easily and safely open the box br Box closures include br br Adhesive water based or hot melt adhesive Adhesives are applied manually or by machine Starch based adhesives are the choice of a corrugator as it is economic Starch works as a medium for molds lichens and fungus so to prevent it antifungals are added in it before use br Staples staples are used to attach the box flaps Small nominally inch crown staples can be applied to a box with a post stapler Wider crown nominally inch staples can be applied with a blind clincher br Box sealing tape pressure sensitive tapes are available in various widths i e and mm widths and several thicknesses BOPP and PET are used as a backing Taping is done either manually or by semi automatic Case sealer br Filament tape reinforced pressure sensitive tape used to close boxes br Gummed paper tape consists of a heavy paper in which adhesive is activated by water and bonds the tape to the box br Reinforced water activated gummed tape Two plies of paper with reinforcing filaments embedded between them br Strapping straps are generally used for unitizing made up of plastic PP PE PET PVC metal SS steel etc and are available in various widths br Shrink wrap it is a thin film of LLDPE LDPE etc which shrinks with the application of heat resulting in wrapping a box from all sides Shrink wrapping is generally more expensive as it needs a hot tunnel and requires more material than the alternatives However the packed box will be better protected from the environment as the wrap works as a barrier br br br br br br Books general references br Fibre Box
