Human centered design HCD also human centred design as used in ISO standards is an approach to problem solving commonly used in process product service and system design management and engineering frameworks that develops solutions to problems by involving the human perspective in all steps of the problem solving process Human involvement typically takes place in initially observing the problem within context brainstorming conceptualizing developing concepts and implementing the solution br br Human centered design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users their needs and requirements and by applying human factors ergonomics and usability knowledge and techniques This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency improves human well being user satisfaction accessibility and sustainability and counteracts possible adverse effects of use on human health safety and performance br Human centered design builds upon participatory action research by moving beyond participants involvement and producing solutions to problems rather than solely documenting them Initial stages usually revolve around immersion observing and contextual framing in which innovators immerse themselves in the problem and community Subsequent stages may then focus on community brainstorming modeling and prototyping and implementation in community spaces br br br Development br Human centered design has its origins at the intersection of numerous fields including engineering psychology anthropology and the arts As an approach to creative problem solving in technical and business fields its origins are often traced to the founding of the Stanford University design program in by Professor John E Arnold who first proposed the idea that engineering design should be human centered This work coincided with the rise of creativity techniques and the subsequent design methods movement in the s Since then as creative design processes and methods have been increasingly popularized for business purposes the standardized and defined human centered design is mistakenly equated with the vaguely outlined design thinking br In Architect or Bee Mike Cooley coined the term human centered systems in the context of the transition in his profession from traditional drafting at a drawing board to computer aided design Human centered systems as used in economics computing and design aim to preserve or enhance human skills in both manual and office work in environments in which technology tends to undermine the skills that people use in their work br br Human centeredness asserts firstly that we must always put people before machines however complex or elegant that machine might be and secondly it marvels and delights at the ability and ingenuity of human beings The Human Centered Systems movement looks sensitively at these forms of science and technology which meet our cultural historical and societal requirements and seeks to develop more appropriate forms of technology to meet our long term aspirations In the Human Centered System there exists a symbiotic relation between the human and the machine in which the human being would handle the qualitative subjective judgements and the machine the quantitative elements It involves a radical redesign of the interface technologies and at a philosophical level the objective is to provide tools in the Heidegger sense which would support human skill and ingenuity rather than machines which would objectivise that knowledge br br br User participation br br The user oriented framework relies heavily on user participation and user feedback in the planning process Users are able to provide new perspective and ideas which can be considered in a new round of improvements and changes It is said that increased user participation in the design process can garner a more comprehensive understanding of the design issues due to more contextual and emotional transparency between researcher and participant A key element of human centered design is applied ethnography which is a research method adopted from cultural anthropology This research method requires researchers to be fully immersed in the observation so that implicit details are also recorded br br br Rationale for adoption br Even after decades of thought on Human Centered Design management and finance systems still believe that another s liability is one s asset could be true of porous human bodies embedded in nature and inseparable from each other On the contrary our biological and ecological interconnections ensure that another s liability is our liability Sustainable business systems can only emerge if these biological and ecological interconnections are accepted and accounted for br Using a human centered approach to design and development has substantial economic and social benefits for users employers and suppliers Highly usable systems and products tend to be more successful both technically and commercially In some areas such as consumer products purchasers will pay a premium for well designed products and systems Support and help desk costs are reduced when users can understand and use products without additional assistance In most countries employers and suppliers have legal obligations to protect users from risks to their health and safety and human centered methods can reduce these risks e g musculoskeletal risks Systems designed using human centered methods improve quality for example by br br increasing the productivity of users and the operational efficiency of organizations br being easier to understand and use thus reducing training and support costs br increasing usability for people with a wider range of capabilities and thus increasing accessibility br improving user experience br reducing discomfort and stress br providing a competitive advantage for example by improving brand image br contributing towards sustainability objectives br Human centered design may be utilized in multiple fields including sociological sciences and technology It has been noted for its ability to consider human dignity access and ability roles when developing solutions Because of this human centered design may more fully incorporate culturally sound human informed and appropriate solutions to problems in a variety of fields rather than solely product and technology based fields Because human centered design focuses on the human experience researchers and designers can address issues of social justice and inclusion and encourage ethical reflexive design br Human centered design arises from underlying principles of human factors When it comes to those two concepts they are quite interconnected human factors are about discovering the attributes of human cognition and behavior that are important for making technology work for people It is what allows humans as a species to innovate over time Human centered design was used to discover that Blackberries have less human usability than an iPhone and that important controls on a panel that look too similar will be easily confused and may cause an increased risk of human error br An important distinction between human centered design and any other form of design is that human centered design is not just about aesthetics and is not always designing for interfaces It could be designing for controls in the world tasks in the world hardware decision making or cognition For instance if a nurse is too tired from a long shift they might confuse the pumps through which might be administered a bag of penicillin to a patient In this case the human centered design would encompass a task redesign a possible institute policy redesign and an equipment redesign br Typically human centered design is more focused on methodologies and techniques for interacting with people in such a manner as to facilitate the detection of meanings desires and needs either by verbal or non verbal means In contrast user centered design is another approach and framework of processes which considers the human role in product use but focuses largely on the production of interactive technology designed around the user s physical attributes rather than social problem solving br br br Human centered design approach in Health br In the context of health seeking behaviors Human Centered Design can be used to understand why people do or do not seek out health services even when those services are available and affordable Human centered design is a powerful tool for improving health seeking behaviors This understanding can then be used to develop interventions to address the barriers and promote desired behaviors Demand related challenges associated with the acceptability responsiveness and quality of services can be addressed by working directly with users to understand their needs and perspectives HCD can help in designing interventions that are more likely to be effective br br br Critiques br Human centered design has been both lauded and criticised for its ability to actively solve problems with affected communities Criticisms include the inability of human centered design to push the boundaries of available technology by solely tailoring to the demands of present day solutions rather than focus on possible future solutions In addition human centered design often considers context but does not offer tailored approaches for very specific groups of people New research on innovative approaches include youth centered health design which focuses on youth as the central aspect with particular needs and limitations not always addressed by human centered design approaches Nevertheless human centered design that doesn t reflect very specific groups of users and their needs is human centered design poorly executed since the principles of human system interaction require the reflection of those specified needs br Whilst users are very important for some types of innovation namely incremental innovation focusing too much on the user may result in producing an outdated or no longer necessary product or service This is because the insights that you achieve from studying the user today are insights that are related to the users of today and the environment she or he lives in today If your solution will be available only two or three years from now your user may have developed new preferences wants and needs by then br br br See also br User centered design br Design thinking br Human Centered
