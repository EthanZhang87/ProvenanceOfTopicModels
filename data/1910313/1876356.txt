id: 1876356
Architectural lighting design is a field of work or study that is concerned with the design of lighting systems within the built environment both interior and exterior It can include manipulation and design of both daylight and electric light or both to serve human needs br Lighting design is based in both science and the visual arts The basic aim of lighting within the built environment is to enable occupants to see clearly and without discomfort The objective of architectural lighting design is to balance the art and the science of lighting to create mood visual interest and enhance the experience of a space or place whilst still meeting the technical and safety requirements br br br Overview br br The purpose of architectural lighting design is to balance the characteristics of light within a space to optimize the technical the visual and most recently the non visual components of ergonomics with respect to illumination of buildings or spaces br The technical requirements include the amount of light needed to perform a task the energy consumed by the lighting within the space and the relative distribution and direction of travel for the light so as not to cause unnecessary glare and discomfort The visual aspects of the light are those that are concerned with the aesthetics and the narrative of the space e g the mood of a restaurant the experience of an exhibition within a museum the promotion of goods within a retail space the reinforcement of corporate brand and the non visual aspects are those concerned with human health and well being br As part of the lighting design process both cultural and contextual factors also need to be considered For example bright lighting was a mark of wealth through much of Chinese history but if uncontrolled bright lights are known to be detrimental to insects birds and the view of stars br br br History br The history of electric light is well documented and with the developments in lighting technology the profession of lighting developed alongside it The development of high efficiency low cost fluorescent lamps led to a reliance on electric light and a uniform blanket approach to lighting but the energy crisis of the s required more design consideration and reinvigorated the use of daylight br The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America IESNA was formed in and the UK version was established in now known as the Society of Light and Lighting and part of CIBSE The International Commission on Illumination CIE was established in and has become a professional organization accepted as representing the best authority on the subject matter of light and lighting The Institution of Lighting Professionals was established as the Association of Public Lighting Engineers in Around the world similar professional organizations evolved br Initially these industry organizations were primarily focused on the science and engineering of lighting rather than the aesthetic design but in a group of designers established the International Association of Lighting Designers IALD Other associations purely for lighting design include the Professional Lighting Designers Association PLDA established in the Association de Concepteurs Eclairage ACE in France established the Associazione Professionisti dell Illuminazione APIL in Italy established in the Associa o Brasileira de Arquitetos de Ilumina o in Brazil in and the Professional Association of Lighting Designers in Spain APDI established in br br br As a profession br br Architectural lighting designer is a stand alone profession that sits alongside the professions of architecture interior design landscape architecture and electrical engineering br One of the earliest proponents of architectural lighting design was Richard Kelly who established his practice in Kelly developed an approach to architectural lighting that is still used today based on the perception of three visual elements as presented in a joint meeting of The American Institute of Architects the American Society of Industrial Designers now the Industrial Designers Society of America and the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America in Cleveland br br br Education br While many architectural lighting designers have a background in electrical engineering architectural engineering architecture or luminaire manufacturing several universities and technical schools now offer degree programs specifically in architectural lighting design br br br Process br The process of architectural lighting design generally follows the architect s plan of works in terms of key project stages feasibility concept detail construction documentation site supervision and commissioning br After the feasibility stage where the parameters for the project are set the concept stage is when the lighting design is developed in terms of lit effect technical lighting targets and overall visual strategy usually using concept sketches renderings or mood boards br br br Day lighting br The source for daylight or natural lighting is the sun Sunlight provides the greatest quality of light rated on the electromagnetic spectrum There are psychological and physical health benefits that come from using daylight in a space For example it can help to ease seasonal affective disorder SAD it can provide people with the necessary vitamin D and can assist in regulating circadian rhythms or daily light and dark cycles Using daylight as a light source can eliminate the use of energy Daylighting can also cause deterioration of materials and finishes and an increased use of energy for cooling a space The architectural makeup of a space impacts the day lighting It can be used in a space through windows openings of the interior skylights and reflective surfaces br br br Electric lighting br Electric lighting or artificial lighting is a type of architectural lighting that includes electric light sources The overall purpose of electric lighting is to allow the user of the space to see at various times in the day but especially at night when daylight is no longer a possible source of light Artificial lighting helps to create or enhance the aesthetic of a space Various techniques can be implemented when it comes to electric lighting since users have more control over the light This can include dimming or increasing the brightness of a lamp diffusion of the light source and the use of different lamp hues The main sources used for electric lighting include incandescent lamps solid state lamps and gas discharge lamps br br br Fixtures br br Lighting fixtures come in a wide variety of styles for various functions The most important functions are as a holder for the light source to provide directed light and to avoid visual glare Some are very plain and functional while some are pieces of art in themselves Nearly any material can be used so long as it can tolerate the excess heat and is in keeping with safety codes br An important property of light fixtures is the luminous efficacy or wall plug efficiency meaning the amount of usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy usually measured in lumen per watt A fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the bulb to the surroundings The more transparent the lighting fixture is the higher efficacy Shading the light will normally decrease efficiency but increase the directionality and the visual comfort probability br The PH lamps are a series of light fixtures designed by Danish designer and writer Poul Henningsen from onwards The lamp is designed with multiple concentric shades to eliminate visual glare only emitting reflected light obscuring the light source br br br Lighting design layers br Designers utilize the idea of lighting layers when creating a lighting plan for a space Lighting layers include task layer focal layer ambient layer decorative layer and daylight layer Each layer contributes a function to the space and often they work together to create a well composed lighting design The task layer is lighting that serves a purpose to perform a certain job or task Typically in this layer there tends to be a need for more light An example of this would be the use of under cabinet lighting in a kitchen The focal layer is when lighting is used to highlight a certain feature in a room such as a fireplace This type of lighting draws the eye to that certain area The ambient layer provides for background or general lighting This layer has a strong influence on the brightness of a space In the decorative layer lighting is used as an ornament to the space and can help develop the style The daylight layer uses natural light or the sun to light a space Using the layering technique helps to develop the aesthetic and functionality of lighting br br br Photometric studies br br Photometric studies are performed to simulate lighting designs for projects before they are built or renovated This enables architects lighting designers and engineers to determine whether a proposed lighting layout will deliver the amount of light intended They will also be able to determine the contrast ratio between light and dark areas In many cases these studies are referenced against IESNA or CIBSE recommended lighting practices for the type of application Depending on the type of area different design aspects may be emphasized for safety or practicality i e such as maintaining uniform light levels avoiding glare or highlighting certain areas A specialized lighting design application is often used to create these which typically combine the use of two dimensional digital CAD drawings and lighting simulation software br Color temperature for white light sources also affects their use for certain applications The color temperature of a white light source is the temperature in kelvin of a theoretical black body emitter that most closely matches the spectral characteristics of the lamp Incandescent light bulbs have a color temperature around to kelvin daylight is around kelvin Lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue white appearance For critical inspection or color matching tasks or for retail displays of food and clothing the color temperature of the lamps will be selected for the best overall lighting effect Color may also be used for functional reasons For example blue light makes it difficult to see veins and thus may be used to discourage drug use br br br Correlated color temperature br br The correlated color temperature CCT of a light source is the temperature of an ideal black body radiator that radiates light of comparable hue to that of the light source Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting photography videography publishing manufacturing astrophysics horticulture and other fields In practice color temperature is only meaningful for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body i e those on a line from red orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white it does not make sense to speak of the color temperature of e g a green or a purple light Color temperature is conventionally stated in the unit of absolute temperature the kelvin having the unit symbol K br For lighting building interiors it is often important to take into account the color temperature of illumination For example a warmer i e lower color temperature light is often used in public areas to promote relaxation while a cooler higher color temperature light is used to enhance concentration in offices br CCT dimming for LED technology is regarded as a difficult task since binning age and temperature drift effects of LEDs change the actual color value output Here feedback loop systems are used for example with color sensors to actively monitor and control the color output of multiple color mixing LEDs br The color temperature of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from an ideal black body is defined as its surface temperature in Kelvin or alternatively in mireds micro reciprocal kelvin This permits the definition of a standard by which light sources are compared br br br Methods br For simple installations hand calculations based on tabular data can be used to provide an acceptable lighting design More critical or optimized designs now routinely use mathematical modeling on a computer br Based on the positions and mounting heights of the fixtures and their photometric characteristics the proposed lighting layout can be checked for uniformity and quantity of illumination For larger projects or those with irregular floor plans lighting design software can be used Each fixture has its location entered and the reflectance of walls ceiling and floors can be entered The computer program will then produce a set of contour charts overlaid on the project floor plan showing the light level to be expected at the working height More advanced programs can include the effect of light from windows or skylights allowing further optimization of the operating cost of the lighting installation The amount of daylight received in an internal space can typically be analyzed by undertaking a daylight factor calculation br The Zonal Cavity Method is used as a basis for both hand tabulated and computer calculations This method uses the reflectance coefficients of room surfaces to model the contribution to useful illumination at the working level of the room due to light reflected from the walls and the ceiling Simplified photometric values are usually given by fixture manufacturers for use in this method br Computer modeling of outdoor flood lighting usually proceeds directly from photometric data The total lighting power of a lamp is divided into small solid angular regions Each region is extended to the surface which is to be lit and the area calculated giving the light power per unit of area Where multiple lamps are used to illuminate the same area each one s contribution is summed Again the tabulated light levels in lux or foot candles can be presented as contour lines of constant lighting value overlaid on the project plan drawing Hand calculations might only be required at a few points but computer calculations allow a better estimate of the uniformity and lighting level br br br Design media terminology br Adjustable accent fixture br Used to point at certain design elements br Bollard br A type of architectural outdoor lighting that is a short upright ground mounted unit typically used to provide cutoff type illumination for egress lighting to light walkways steps or other pathways br Cans with a variety of lamps br Jargon for inexpensive downlighting products that are recessed into the ceiling or sometimes for uplights placed on the floor The name comes from the shape of the housing The term pot lights is often used in Canada and parts of the US br Chandelier br A branched ornamental light fixture designed to be mounted on ceilings or walls br Cove light br Recessed into the ceiling in a long box against a wall br Emergency lighting or exit sign br Connected to a

floor and flatly illuminates the wall br br br Lamp types br Different types of electric lighting have vastly differing efficacy and color temperature br br Color temperature is defined as the temperature of a black body emitting a similar spectrum these spectra are quite different from those of black bodies br The most efficient source of electric light is the low pressure sodium lamp It produces for all practical purposes a monochromatic yellow light which gives a similarly monochromatic perception of any illuminated scene For this reason it is generally reserved for outdoor public lighting usages Low pressure sodium lights are favored for public lighting by astronomers since the light pollution that they generate can be easily filtered contrary to broadband or continuous spectra br br br Incandescent light bulb br br The modern incandescent light bulb with a coiled filament of tungsten was commercialized in the s developed from the carbon filament lamp introduced in about As well as bulbs for normal illumination there is a very wide range including low voltage low power types often used as components in equipment but now largely displaced by LEDs br br br Fluorescent lamp br br Fluorescent lamps consist of a glass tube that contains mercury vapor or argon under low pressure Electricity flowing through the tube causes the gases to give off ultraviolet energy The inside of the tubes are coated with phosphors that give off visible light when struck by ultraviolet energy br br br LED lamp br br Light emitting diodes LEDs became widespread as indicator lights in the s With the invention of high output LEDs by Shuji Nakamura LEDs are now in use as solid state lighting for general lighting applications br Initially due to relatively high cost per lumen LED lighting was most used for lamp assemblies of under W such as flashlights Development of higher output lamps was motivated by programs such as the U S L Prize br br br See also br br br br
