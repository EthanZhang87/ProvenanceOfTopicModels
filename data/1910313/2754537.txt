title: Tableless web design
id: 2754537
Tableless web design or tableless web layout is a web design method that avoids the use of HTML tables for page layout control purposes Instead of HTML tables style sheet languages such as Cascading Style Sheets CSS are used to arrange elements and text on a web page br br br History br HTML is a markup language whose visual presentation was initially left up to the user However as the Internet expanded from the academic and research world into the mainstream in the mid s and became more media oriented graphic designers sought ways to control the visual appearance of their Web pages As popularised especially by the designer David Siegel in his book Creating Killer Web sites tables and spacers usually transparent single pixel GIF images with explicitly specified width height or margins were used to create and maintain page layouts br In the late s the first reasonably powerful WYSIWYG editors arrived on the market which meant Web designers no longer needed a technical understanding of HTML to build web pages Such editors indirectly encouraged extensive use of nested tables to position design elements As designers edited their documents in these editors unnecessary code and empty elements were added to the document Furthermore unskilled designers were likely to use tables more than required when using a WYSIWYG editor This practice frequently led to many tables nested within tables as well as tables with unnecessary rows and columns The use of graphic editors with slicing tools that output HTML and images directly also promoted poor code with tables often having many rows of pixel height or width Sometimes many more lines of code were used to render content than the actual content itself br The reliance on tables for layout purposes caused a number of problems Many web pages were designed with tables nested within tables resulting in large HTML documents that use more bandwidth than documents with simpler formatting Furthermore when a table based layout is linearized for example when being parsed by a screen reader or a search engine the resulting order of the content can be somewhat jumbled and confusing br Cascading Style Sheets CSS were developed to improve the separation between design and content and move back towards a semantic organization of content on the Web The term tableless design implies the use of CSS rather than layout tables to position HTML elements on the page HTML tables still have their legitimate place when presenting tabular information within web pages and are also sometimes still used as layout devices in situations for which CSS support is poor or problematical like vertically centering an element Another area where tables are still used is e mailers because many popular Email clients have not kept up with modern HTML and CSS rendering In such a scenario complex e mailers lose some of their structural and creative alignment br br br Adoption br The CSS specification was published in December by the W C with the aim of improving web accessibility and emphasising the separation of presentational details in style sheets from semantic content in HTML documents CSS in May later revised in CSS and CSS extended CSS with facilities for positioning and table layout br The preference for using HTML tables rather than CSS to control the layout of whole web pages was due to several reasons br br the desire of content publishers to replicate their existing corporate design elements on their web site br the limitations at the time of CSS support in browsers br the installed base of browsers that did not support CSS br the new web designers lack of familiarity with the CSS standards br the lack of knowledge of or concern for the reasons including HTML semantics and web accessibility to use CSS instead of what was perceived as an easier way to quickly achieve the intended layouts and br a new breed of WYSIWYG web design tools that encouraged this practice br Landmarks in the adoption of CSS based layouts include the Web Standards Project s Browser Upgrade campaign of February and the web design magazine A List Apart s simultaneous redesign followed by the Wired redesign in The CSS Zen Garden website launched in has been credited with popularising tableless layouts br br br Rationale br The intended and semantic purpose of HTML tables lies in presenting tabular data rather than laying out pages br The benefits of using CSS for page layout include improved accessibility of the information to a wider variety of users using a wide variety of user agents There are bandwidth savings as large numbers of semantically meaningless table tr and td tags are removed from dozens of pages leaving fewer but more meaningful headings paragraphs and lists Layout instructions are transferred into site wide CSS stylesheets which can be downloaded once and cached for reuse while each visitor navigates the site Sites may become more maintainable as the whole site can be restyled or re branded in a single pass merely by altering the mark up of the specific CSS affecting every page which relies on that stylesheet New HTML content can be added in such a way that consistent layout rules are immediately applied to it by the existing CSS without any further effort br br br Advantages br br br Accessibility br br Because of the Internet s rapid growth expanding disability discrimination legislation and the increasing use of mobile phones and PDAs it is necessary for Web content to be made accessible to users operating a wide variety of devices beyond the relatively uniform desktop computer and CRT monitor ecosystem the web first became popular on Tableless Web design considerably improves Web accessibility in this respect as tables too wide for a screen need to be scrolled sideways to be read in entirety whereas text can wrap around br Screen readers and braille devices have fewer problems with tableless designs because they follow a logical structure The same is true for search engine Web crawlers the software agents that most web site publishers hope will find their pages classify them accurately and so enable potential users to find them easily in appropriate searches br As a result of the separation of design CSS and structure HTML it is also possible to provide different layouts for different devices e g handhelds mobile phones etc It is also possible to specify a different style sheet for print e g to hide or modify the appearance of advertisements or navigation elements that are irrelevant and a nuisance in the printable version of the page br The W C s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines guideline no states use markup and style sheets and do so properly br The guideline s checkpoint a priority checkpoint says use style sheets to control layout and presentation br br br Bandwidth savings br Tableless design produces web pages with fewer HTML tags used purely to position content This normally means that the pages themselves become smaller to download The philosophy implies that all the instructions regarding layout and positioning be moved into external style sheets According to the basic capabilities of HTTP as these rarely change and they apply in common to many web pages they will be cached and reused after the first download This further reduces bandwidth and download times across the site br br br Maintainability br Maintaining a website may require frequent changes both small and large to the visual style of a website depending on the purpose of the site Under table based layout the layout is part of the HTML itself As such without the aid of template based visual editors such as HTML editors changing the positional layout of elements on a whole site may require a great deal of effort depending on the amount of repetitive changes required Even employing sed or similar global find and replace utilities cannot alleviate the problem entirely br In tableless layout using CSS the layout information may reside in a CSS document Because the layout information may be centralized it is possible that these changes can be made quickly and globally by default The HTML files themselves may not need to be adjusted when making layout changes br Also because the layout information may be stored externally to the HTML it may be quite easy to add new content in a tableless design whether modifying an existing page or adding a new page By contrast without such a design the layout for each page may require a more time consuming manual changing of each instance or use of global find and replace utilities However site owners often want particular pages to be different from others on the site either for a short period or long term This will often necessitate a separate style sheet to be developed for that page The page or template content usually can remain unaltered however which is not the case in a tables based design br br br See also br Framing World Wide Web br Responsive
