title: Video game development
id: 700265
Video game development sometimes shortened to gamedev is the process of creating a video game It is a multidisciplinary practice involving programming design art audio user interface and writing Each of those may be made up of more specialized skills art includes D modeling of objects character modeling animation visual effects and so on Development is supported by project management production and quality assurance Teams can be many hundreds of people a small group or even a single person br Development of commercial video games is normally funded by a publisher and can take two to five years to reach completion Game creation by small self funded teams is called independent development The technology in a game may be written from scratch or use proprietary software specific to one company As development has become more complex it has become common for companies and independent developers alike to use off the shelf engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine br Commercial game development began in the s with the advent of arcade video games first generation video game consoles like the Atari and home computers like the Apple II Into the s a lone programmer could develop a full and complete game such as Pitfall By the second and third generation of video game consoles in the late s the growing popularity of D graphics on personal computers and higher expectations for visuals and quality it became difficult for a single person to produce a mainstream video game The average cost of producing a high end often called AAA game slowly rose from US million in to over million and up by At the same time independent game development has flourished The best selling video game of all time Minecraft was initially written by one person then supported by a small team before the company was acquired by Microsoft and greatly expanded br Mainstream commercial video games are generally developed in phases A concept is developed which then moves to pre production where prototypes are written and the plan for the entire game is created This is followed by full scale development or production then sometimes a post production period where the game is polished It has become common for many developers especially smaller developers to publicly release games in an early access form where iterative development takes place in tandem with feedback from actual players br br br Overview br Games are produced through the software development process Games are developed as a creative outlet and to generate profit Game making is considered both art and science Development is normally funded by a publisher Well made games bring profit more readily However it is important to estimate a game s financial requirements such as development costs of individual features Failing to provide clear implications of game s expectations may result in exceeding allocated budget In fact the majority of commercial games do not produce profit Most developers cannot afford to change their development schedule midway and require estimating their capabilities with available resources before production br The game industry requires innovations as publishers cannot profit from the constant release of repetitive sequels and imitations Every year new independent development companies open and some manage to develop hit titles Similarly many developers close down because they cannot find a publishing contract or their production is not profitable It is difficult to start a new company due to the high initial investment required Nevertheless the growth of the casual and mobile game market has allowed developers with smaller teams to enter the market Once the companies become financially stable they may expand to develop larger games Most developers start small and gradually expand their business A developer receiving profit from a successful title may store up capital to expand and re factor their company as well as tolerate more failed deadlines br An average development budget for a multiplatform game is US M with high profile games often exceeding M br In the early era of home computers and video game consoles in the early s a single programmer could handle almost all the tasks of developing a game programming graphical design sound effects etc It could take as little as six weeks to develop a game However the high user expectations and requirements of modern commercial games far exceed the capabilities of a single developer and require the splitting of responsibilities A team of over a hundred people can be employed full time for a single project br Game development production or design is a process that starts from an idea or concept Often the idea is based on a modification of an existing game concept The game idea may fall within one or several genres Designers often experiment with different combinations of genres A game designer generally writes an initial game proposal document that describes the basic concept gameplay feature list setting and story target audience requirements and schedule and finally staff and budget estimates Different companies have different formal procedures and philosophies regarding game design and development There is no standardized development method however commonalities exist br A game developer may range from a single individual to a large multinational company There are both independent and publisher owned studios Independent developers rely on financial support from a game publisher They usually have to develop a game from concept to prototype without external funding The formal game proposal is then submitted to publishers who may finance the game development from several months to years The publisher would retain exclusive rights to distribute and market the game and would often own the intellectual property rights for the game franchise The publisher may also own the development studio or it may have internal development studio s Generally the publisher is the one who owns the game s intellectual property rights br All but the smallest developer companies work on several titles at once This is necessary because of the time taken between shipping a game and receiving royalty payments which may be between and months Small companies may structure contracts ask for advances on royalties use shareware distribution employ part time workers and use other methods to meet payroll demands br Console manufacturers such as Microsoft Nintendo or Sony have a standard set of technical requirements that a game must conform to in order to be approved Additionally the game concept must be approved by the manufacturer who may refuse to approve certain titles br Most modern PC or console games take from three to five years to complete where as a mobile game can be developed in a few months The length of development is influenced by a number of factors such as genre scale development platform and number of assets br Some games can take much longer than the average time frame to complete An infamous example is D Realms Duke Nukem Forever announced to be in production in April and released fourteen years later in June Planning for Maxis game Spore began in late the game was released nine years later in September The game Prey was briefly profiled in a issue of PC Gamer but was not released until and only then in highly altered form Finally Team Fortress was in development from until its release and emerged from a convoluted development process involving probably three or four different games according to Gabe Newell br The game revenue from retail is divided among the parties along the distribution chain such as developer publisher retail manufacturer and console royalty Many developers fail to profit from this and go bankrupt Many seek alternative economic models through Internet marketing and distribution channels to improve returns as through a mobile distribution channel the share of a developer can be up to of the total revenue and through an online distribution channel owned by the developer almost br br br History br The history of game making begins with the development of the first video games although which video game is the first depends on the definition of video game The first games created had little entertainment value and their development focus was separate from user experience in fact these games required mainframe computers to play them OXO written by Alexander S Douglas in was the first computer game to use a digital display In a game called Tennis for Two which displayed its output on an oscilloscope was made by Willy Higinbotham a physicist working at the Brookhaven National Laboratory In a mainframe computer game called Spacewar was developed by a group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology students led by Steve Russell br True commercial design and development of games began in the s when arcade video games and first generation consoles were marketed In Computer Space was the first commercially sold coin operated video game It used a black and white television for its display and the computer system was made of series TTL chips In the first home console system was released called Magnavox Odyssey developed by Ralph H Baer That same year Atari released Pong an arcade game that increased video game popularity The commercial success of Pong led other companies to develop Pong clones spawning the video game industry br Programmers worked within the big companies to produce games for these devices The industry did not see huge innovation in game design and a large number of consoles had very similar games Many of these early games were often Pong clones Some games were different however such as Gun Fight which was significant for several reasons an early on foot multi directional shooter which depicted game characters game violence and human to human combat Tomohiro Nishikado s original version was based on discrete logic which Dave Nutting adapted using the Intel making it the first video game to use a microprocessor Console manufacturers soon started to produce consoles that were able to play independently developed games and ran on microprocessors marking the beginning of second generation consoles beginning with the release of the Fairchild Channel F in br The flood of Pong clones led to the video game crash of which eventually came to an end with the mainstream success of Taito s arcade shooter game Space Invaders marking the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games and inspiring dozens of manufacturers to enter the market Its creator Nishikado not only designed and programmed the game but also did the artwork engineered the arcade hardware and put together a microcomputer from scratch It was soon ported to the Atari becoming the first killer app and quadrupling the console s sales At the same time home computers appeared on the market allowing individual programmers and hobbyists to develop games This allowed hardware manufacturer and software manufacturers to act separately A very large number of games could be produced by an individual as games were easy to make because graphical and memory limitation did not allow for much content Larger companies developed who focused selected teams to work on a title The developers of many early home video games such as Zork Baseball Air Warrior and Adventure later transitioned their work as products of the early video game industry br The industry expanded significantly at the time with the arcade video game sector alone representing the largest share of the gaming industry generating higher revenues than both pop music and Hollywood films combined The home video game industry however suffered major losses following the video game crash of In Jon Freeman warned in Computer Gaming World br br Q Are computer games the way to fame and fortune br br A No Not unless your idea of fame is having your name recognized by one or two astute individuals at Origins I ve been making a living after a fashion designing games for most of the last six years I wouldn t recommend it for someone with a weak heart or a large appetite though br Chris Crawford and Don Daglow in similarly advised prospective designers to write games as a hobby first and to not quit their existing jobs early The home video game industry was revitalized soon after by the widespread success of the Nintendo Entertainment System br Compute s Gazette in stated that although individuals developed most early video games It s impossible for one person to have the multiple talents necessary to create a good game By a video game required months to develop and another six to plan marketing Projects remained usually solo efforts with single developers delivering finished games to their publishers With the ever increasing processing and graphical capabilities of arcade console and computer products along with an increase in user expectations game design moved beyond the scope of a single developer to produce a marketable game The Gazette stated The process of writing a game involves coming up with an original entertaining concept having the skill to bring it to fruition through good efficient programming and also being a fairly respectable artist This sparked the beginning of team based development In broad terms during the s pre production involved sketches and test routines of the only developer In the s pre production consisted mostly of game art previews In the early s pre production usually produced a playable demo br In a to month development project was funded by a publisher for US M M Additionally k M were spent on marketing and sales development In over games were released for PC and from about games turning profit only about made significant profit In the early s it became increasingly common to use middleware game engines such as Quake engine or Unreal Engine br In the early s also mobile games started to gain popularity However mobile games distributed by mobile operators remained a marginal form of gaming until the Apple App Store was launched in br In a mainstream console video game cost from US M to M to develop Some games cost as much as M to develop In the profit from a console game sold at retail was divided among parties of distribution chain as follows developer publisher retail manufacturer console royalty In a developer would retain around of retail price and around if sold online br Since the third generation of consoles the home video game industry has constantly increased and expanded The industry revenue has increased at least five fold since the s In the software portion of video game revenue was billion exceeding that of the movie industry br The Apple App Store introduced in was the first mobile application store operated directly by the mobile platform holder It significantly changed the consumer behaviour more favourable for downloading mobile content and quickly broadened the markets of mobile games br In games market annual value was estimated between billion depending on which sales figures are included This is on par with films box office market A publisher would typically fund an independent developer for k M for a development of a title In the total value had already reached billion and by then the video game markets were no longer dominated by console games According to Newzoo the share of MMO s was PC MAC s tablets smartphones handhelds consoles only and online casual games The fastest growing market segments being mobile games with an average annual rate of for smartphones and for tablets br In the past several years many developers opened and many closed down Each year a number of developers are acquired by larger companies or merge with existing companies For example in Blizzard Entertainment s parent company Vivendi Games merged with Activision In Electronic Arts nearly acquired Take Two Interactive In Midway Games was acquired by Time Warner and Eidos Interactive merged with Square Enix br br br Roles br br br Producer br br Development is overseen by internal and external producers The producer working for the developer is known as the internal producer and manages the development team schedules reports progress hires and assigns staff and so on The producer working for the publisher is known as the external producer and oversees developer progress and budget Producer s responsibilities include PR contract negotiation liaising between the staff and stakeholders schedule and budget maintenance quality assurance beta test management and localization This role may also be referred to as project manager project lead or director br br br Publisher br br A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally or have had developed by an external video game developer As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies video game publishers are responsible for their product s manufacturing and marketing including market research and all aspects of advertising br They usually finance the development sometimes by paying a video game developer the publisher calls this external development and sometimes by paying an internal staff of developers called a studio Consequently they also typically own the IP of the game Large video game publishers also distribute the games they publish while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies or larger video game publishers to distribute the games they publish br Other functions usually performed by the publisher include deciding on and paying for any license that the game may utilize paying for localization layout printing and possibly the writing of the user manual and the creation of graphic design elements such as the box design br Large publishers may also attempt to boost efficiency across all internal and external development teams by providing services such as sound design and code packages for commonly needed functionality br Because the publisher usually finances development it usually tries to manage development risk with a staff of producers or project managers to monitor the progress of the developer critique ongoing development and assist as necessary Most video games created by an external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties These advances are paid when the developer reaches certain stages of development called milestones br Independent video game developers create games without a publisher and may choose to digitally distribute their games br br br Development team br Developers can range in size from small groups making casual games to housing hundreds of employees and producing several large titles Companies divide their subtasks of game s development Individual job titles may vary however roles are the same within the industry The development team consists of several members Some members of the team may handle more than one role similarly more than one task may be handled by the same member Team size can vary from to or more members depending on the game s scope The most represented are artists followed by programmers then designers and finally audio specialists with one to three producers in management Many teams also include a dedicated writer with expertise in video game writing These positions are employed full time Other positions such as testers may be employed only part time Use of contractors for art programming and writing is standard within the industry Salaries for these positions vary depending on both the experience and the location of the employee br A development team includes these roles or disciplines br br br Designer br br A game designer is a person who designs gameplay conceiving and designing the rules and structure of a game Development teams usually have a lead designer who coordinates the work of other designers They are the main visionary of the game One of the roles of a designer is being a writer often employed part time to conceive game s narrative dialogue commentary cutscene narrative journals video game packaging content hint system etc In larger projects there are often separate designers for various parts of the game such as game mechanics user interface characters dialogue graphics etc br br br Artist br br A game artist is a visual artist who creates video game art The art production is usually overseen by an art director or art lead making sure their vision is followed The art director manages the art team scheduling and coordinating within the development team br The artist s job may be D oriented or D oriented D artists may produce concept art sprites textures environmental backdrops or terrain images and user interface D artists may produce models or meshes animation D environment and cinematics Artists sometimes occupy both roles br br br Programmer br br A game programmer is a software engineer who primarily develops video games or related software such as game development tools The game s codebase development is handled by programmers There are usually one to several lead programmers who implement the game s starting codebase and overview future development and programmer allocation on individual modules An entry level programmer can make on average around annually and an experienced programmer can make on average around annually br Individual programming disciplines roles include br br Physics the programming of the game engine including simulating physics collision object movement etc br AI producing computer agents using game AI techniques such as scripting planning rule based decisions etc br Graphics the managing of graphical content utilization and memory considerations the production of graphics engine integration of models textures to work along the physics engine br Sound integration of music speech effect sounds into the proper locations and times br Gameplay implementation of various games rules and features sometimes called a generalist br Scripting development and maintenance of high level command system for various in game tasks such as AI level editor triggers etc br UI production of user interface elements like option menus HUDs help and feedback systems etc br Input processing processing and compatibility correlation of various input devices such as keyboard mouse gamepad etc br Network communications the managing of data inputs and outputs for local and internet gameplay br Game tools the production of tools to accompany the development of the game especially for designers and scripters br br br Level designer br br A level designer is a person who creates levels challenges or missions for video games using a specific set of programs These programs may be commonly available commercial D or D design programs or specially designed and tailored level editors made for a specific game br Level designers work with both incomplete and complete versions of the game Game programmers usually produce level editors and design tools for the designers to use This eliminates the need for designers to access or modify game code Level editors may involve custom high level scripting languages for interactive environments or AIs As opposed to the level editing tools sometimes available to the community level designers often work with placeholders and prototypes aiming for consistency and clear layout before required artwork is completed br br br Sound engineer br br Sound engineers are technical professionals responsible for sound effects and sound positioning They are sometimes involved in creating haptic feedback as was the case with the Returnal game sound team at PlayStation Studios Creative Arts in London br They sometimes oversee voice acting and other sound asset creation Composers who create a game s musical score also comprise a game s sound team though often this work is outsourced br br br Tester br br The quality assurance is carried out by game testers A game tester analyzes video games to document software defects as part of a quality control Testing is a highly technical field requiring computing expertise and analytic competence br The testers ensure that the game falls within the proposed design it both works and is entertaining This involves testing of all features compatibility localization etc Although necessary throughout the whole development process testing is expensive and is often actively utilized only towards the completion of the project br br br Development process br Game development is a software development process as a video game is software with art audio and gameplay Formal software development methods are often overlooked Games with poor development methodology are likely to run over budget and time estimates as well as contain a large number of bugs Planning is important for individual and group projects alike br Overall game development is not suited for typical software life cycle methods such as the waterfall model br One method employed for game development is agile development It is based on iterative prototyping a subset of software prototyping Agile development depends on feedback and refinement of game s iterations with gradually increasing feature set This method is effective because most projects do not start with a clear requirement outline A popular method of agile software development is Scrum br Another successful method is Personal Software Process PSP requiring additional training for staff to increase awareness of project s planning This method is more expensive and requires commitment of team members PSP can be extended to Team Software Process where the whole team is self directing br Game development usually involves an overlap of these methods For example asset creation may be done via waterfall model because requirements and specification are clear but gameplay design might be done using iterative prototyping br Development of a commercial game usually includes the following stages br br br Pre production br Pre production or design phase is a planning phase of the project focused on idea and concept development and production of initial design documents The goal of concept development is to produce clear and easy to understand documentation which describes all the tasks schedules and estimates for the development team The suite of documents produced in this phase is called production plan This phase is usually not funded by a publisher however good publishers may require developers to produce plans during pre production br The concept documentation can be separated into three stages or documents high concept pitch and concept however there is no industry standard naming convention for example both Bethke and Bates refer to pitch document as game proposal yet Moore Novak refers to concept document as game proposal br The late stage of pre production may also be referred to as proof of concept or technical review when more detailed game documents are produced br Publishers have started to expect broader game proposals even featuring playable prototypes br br br High concept br High concept is a brief description of a game The high concept is the one or two sentence response to the question What is your game about br br br Pitch br A pitch concept document proposal document or game proposal is a short summary document intended to present the game s selling points and detail why the game would be profitable to develop br Verbal pitches may be made to management within the developer company and then presented to publishers A written document may need to be shown to publishers before funding is approved A game proposal may undergo one to several green light meetings with publisher executives who determine if the game is to be developed The presentation of the project is often given by the game designers Demos may be created for the pitch however may be unnecessary for established developers with good track records br If the developer acts as its own publisher or both companies are subsidiaries of a single company then only the upper management needs to give approval br br br Concept br Concept document game proposal or game plan is a more detailed document than the pitch document This includes all the information produced about the game This includes the high concept game s genre gameplay description features setting story target audience hardware platforms estimated schedule marketing analysis team requirements and risk analysis br Before an approved design is completed a skeleton crew of programmers and artists usually begins work Programmers may develop quick and dirty prototypes showcasing one or more features that stakeholders would like to see incorporated in the final product Artists may develop concept art and asset sketches as a springboard for developing real game assets Producers may work part time on the game at this point scaling up for full time commitment as development progresses Game producers work during pre production is related to planning the schedule budget and estimating tasks with the team The producer aims to create a solid production plan so that no delays are experienced at the start of the production br br br Game design document br br Before a full scale production can begin the development team produces the first version of a game design document incorporating all or most of the material from the initial pitch The design document describes the game s concept and major gameplay elements in detail It may also include preliminary sketches of various aspects of the game The design document is sometimes accompanied by functional prototypes of some sections of the game The design document remains a living document throughout the development often changed weekly or even daily br Compiling a list of game s needs is called requirement capture br br br Prototype br br Writing prototypes of gameplay ideas and features is an important activity that allows programmers and game designers to experiment with different algorithms and usability scenarios for a game A great deal of prototyping may take place during pre production before the design document is complete and may in fact help determine what features the design specifies Prototyping at this stage is often done manually paper prototyping not digitally as this is often easier and faster to test and make changes before wasting time and resources into what could be a canceled idea or project Prototyping may also take place during active development to test new ideas as the game emerges br Prototypes are often meant only to act as a proof of concept or to test ideas by adding modifying or removing some of the features Most algorithms and features debuted in a prototype may be ported to the game once they have been completed br Often prototypes need to be developed quickly with very little time for up front design around to minutes of testing Therefore usually very prolific programmers are called upon to quickly code these testbed tools RAD tools may be used to aid in the quick development of these programs In case the prototype is in a physical form programmers and designers alike will make the game with paper dice and other easy to access tools in order to make the prototype faster br A successful development model is iterative prototyping where design is refined based on current progress There are various technology available for video game development br br br Production br Production is the main stage of development when assets and source code for the game are produced br Mainstream production is usually defined as the period of time when the project is fully staffed Programmers write new source code artists develop game assets such as sprites or D models Sound engineers develop sound effects and composers develop music for the game Level designers create levels and writers write dialogue for cutscenes and NPCs Game designers continue to develop the game s design throughout production br br br Design br br Game design is an essential and collaborative process of designing the content and rules of a game requiring artistic and technical competence as well as writing skills Creativity and an open mind is vital for the completion of a successful video game br During development the game designer implements and modifies the game design to reflect the current vision of the game Features and levels are often removed or added The art treatment may evolve and the backstory may change A new platform may be targeted as well as a new demographic All these changes need to be documented and disseminated to the rest of the team Most changes occur as updates to the design document br br br Programming br br The programming of the game is handled by one or more game programmers They develop prototypes to test ideas many of which may never make it into the final game The programmers incorporate new features demanded by the game design and fix any bugs introduced during the development process Even if an off the shelf game engine is used a great deal of programming is required to customize almost every game br br br Level creation br br From a time standpoint the game s first level takes the longest to develop As level designers and artists use the tools for level building they request features and changes to the in house tools that allow for quicker and higher quality development Newly introduced features may cause old levels to become obsolete so the levels developed early on may be repeatedly developed and discarded Because of the dynamic environment of game development the design of early levels may also change over time It is not uncommon to spend upwards of twelve months on one level of a game developed over the course of three years Later levels can be developed much more quickly as the feature set is more complete and the game vision is clearer and more stable br br br Art production br br During development artists make art assets according to specifications given by the designers Early in production concept artists make concept art to guide the artistic direction of the game rough art is made for prototypes and the designers work with artists to design the visual style and visual language of the game As production goes on more final art is made and existing art is edited based on player feedback br br br Audio production br br Game audio may be separated into three categories sound effects music and voice over br Sound effect production is the production of sounds by either tweaking a sample to a desired effect or replicating it with real objects Sound effects include UI sound design which effectively conveys information both for visible UI elements and as an auditory display It provides sonic feedback for in game interfaces as well as contributing to the overall game aesthetic Sound effects are important and impact the game s delivery br Music may be synthesized or performed live br There are four main ways in which music is presented in a game br br Music may be ambient especially for slow periods of game where the music aims to reinforce the aesthetic mood and game setting br Music may be triggered by in game events For example in such games as Pac Man or Mario player picking up power ups triggered respective musical scores br Action music such as chase battle or hunting sequences is fast paced hard changing score br Menu music similar to credits music creates aural impact while relatively little action is taking place br A game title with hours of single player gameplay may feature around hour br br br Testing br br Quality assurance of a video game product plays a significant role throughout the development cycle of a game though comes more significantly into play as the game nears completion Unlike other software products or productivity applications video games are fundamentally meant to entertain and thus the testing of video games is more focused on the end user experience rather than the accuracy of the software code s performance which leads to differences in how game software is developed br Because game development is focused on the presentation and gameplay as seen by the player there often is little rigor in maintaining and testing backend code in early stages of development since such code may be readily disregarded if there are changes found in gameplay Some automated testing may be used to assure the core game engine operates as expected but most game testing comes via game tester who enter the testing process once a playable prototype is available This may be one level or subset of the game software that can be used to any reasonable extent The use of testers may be lightweight at the early stages of development but the testers role becomes more predominant as the game nears completion becoming a full time role alongside development Early testing is considered a key part of game design the most common issue raised in several published post mortems on game development was the failure to start the testing process early br As code matures and the gameplay features solidify then development typically includes more rigorous test controls such as regression testing to make sure new updates to the code base do not change working parts of the game Games are complex software systems and changes in one code area may unexpected cause a seemingly unrelated part of the game to fail Testers are tasked to repeatedly play through updated versions of games in these later stages to look for any issues or bugs not otherwise found from automated testing Because this can be a monotonous task of playing the same game over and over this process can lead to games frequently being released with uncaught bugs or glitches br There are other factors simply inherent to video games that can make testing difficult This includes the use of randomized gameplay systems which require more testing for both game balance and bug tracking than more linearized games the balance of cost and time to devote to testing as part of the development budget and assuring that the game still remains fun and entertaining to play as changes are made to it br Despite the dangers of overlooking regression testing some game developers and publishers fail to test the full feature suite of the game and ship a game with bugs This can result in customers dissatisfaction and failure to meet sales goals When this does happen most developers and publishers quickly release patches that fix the bugs and make the game fully playable again Certain publishing models are designed specifically to accommodate the fact that first releases of games may be bug ridden but will be fixed post release The early access model invites players to pay into a game before its planned release and help to provide feedback and bug reports Mobile games and games with live services are also anticipated to be updated on a frequent basis offset pre release testing with live feedback and bug reports br br br Milestones br br Commercial game development projects may be required to meet milestones set by publisher Milestones mark major events during game development and are used to track game s progress Such milestones may be for example first playable alpha or beta game versions Project milestones depend on the developer schedules br Milestones are usually based on multiple short descriptions for functionality examples may be Player roaming around in game environment or Physics working collisions vehicle etc numerous descriptions are possible These milestones are usually how the developer gets paid sometimes as an advance against royalty These milestones are listed anywhere from three to twenty depending on developer and publisher The milestone list is usually a collaborative agreement between the publisher and developer The developer usually advocates for making the milestone descriptions as simple as possible depending on the specific publisher the milestone agreements may get very detailed for a specific game When working with a good publisher the spirit of the law is usually adhered to regarding milestone completion in other words if the milestone is complete the milestone is usually paid with the understanding that it will be complete by the next due milestone It is a collaborative agreement between publisher and developer and usually but not always the developer is constrained by heavy monthly development expenses that need to be met Also sometimes milestones are swapped the developer or publisher may mutually agree to amend the agreement and rearrange milestone goals depending on changing requirements and development resources available Milestone agreements are usually included as part of the legal development contracts After each milestone there is usually a payment arrangement Some very established developers may simply have a milestone agreement based on the amount of time the game is in development monthly quarterly and not specific game functionality this is not as common as detailed functionality milestone lists br There is no industry standard for defining milestones and such vary depending on publisher year or project Some common milestones for two year development cycle are as follows br br br First playable br The first playable is the game version containing representative gameplay and assets this is the first version with functional major gameplay elements It is often based on the prototype created in pre production Alpha and first playable are sometimes used to refer to a single milestone however large projects require first playable before feature complete alpha First playable occurs to months before code release It is sometimes referred to as the Pre Alpha stage br br br Alpha br br Alpha is the stage when key gameplay functionality is implemented and assets are partially finished A game in alpha is feature complete that is game is playable and contains all the major features These features may be further revised based on testing and feedback Additional small new features may be added similarly planned but unimplemented features may be dropped Programmers focus mainly on finishing the codebase rather than implementing additions br br br Code freeze br Code freeze is the stage when new code is no longer added to the game and only bugs are being corrected Code freeze occurs three to four months before code release br br br Beta br br Beta is feature and asset complete version of the game when only bugs are being fixed This version contains no bugs that prevent the game from being shippable No changes are made to the game features assets or code Beta occurs two to three months before code release br br br Code release br Code release is the stage when many bugs are fixed and game is ready to be shipped or submitted for console manufacturer review This version is tested against QA test plan First code release candidate is usually ready three to four weeks before code release br br br Gold master br br Gold master is the final game s build that is used as a master for production of the game br br br Release schedules and crunch time br br In most AAA game development games are announced a year or more in advance and given a planned release date or approximate window so that they can promote and market the game establish orders with retailers and entice consumers to pre order the game Delaying the release of a video game can have negative financial impact for publishers and developers and extensive delays may lead to project cancellation and employee layoffs To assure a game makes a set release date publishers and developers may require their employees to work overtime to complete the game which is considered common in the industry This overtime is often referred to it as crunch time or crunch mode In and afterwards the culture of crunch time in the industry came under scrutiny leading to many publishers and developers to reduce the expectation on developers for overtime work and better schedule management though crunch time still can occur br br br Post production br After the game goes gold and ships some developers will give team members comp time perhaps up to a week or two to compensate for the overtime put in to complete the game though this compensation is not standard br br br Maintenance br Once a game ships the maintenance phase for the video game begins br Games developed for video game consoles have had almost no maintenance period in the past The shipped game would forever house as many bugs and features as when released This was common for consoles since all consoles had identical or nearly identical hardware making incompatibility the cause of many bugs a non issue In this case maintenance would only occur in the case of a port sequel or enhanced remake that reuses a large portion of the engine and assets br In recent times popularity of online console games has grown and online capable video game consoles and online services such as Xbox Live for the Xbox have developed Developers can maintain their software through downloadable patches These changes would not have been possible in the past without the widespread availability of the Internet br PC development is different Game developers try to account for majority of configurations and hardware However the number of possible configurations of hardware and software inevitably leads to discovery of game breaking circumstances that the programmers and testers did not account for br Programmers wait for a period to get as many bug reports as possible Once the developer thinks they ve obtained enough feedback the programmers start working on a patch The patch may take weeks or months to develop but it is intended to fix most accounted bugs and problems with the game that were overlooked past code release or in rare cases fix unintended problems caused by previous patches Occasionally a patch may include extra features or content or may even alter gameplay br In the case of a massively multiplayer online game MMOG such as a MMORPG or MMORTS the shipment of the game is the starting phase of maintenance The maintenance staff for such an online game can number in the dozens sometimes including members of the original programming team as the game world is continuously changed and iterated and new features are added Some developers implement a public test realm or player test realm PTR in order to test out significant upcoming changes prior to release These specialized servers offer similar benefits as beta testing where players get to preview new features while the developer gathers data about bugs and game balance br br br Outsourcing br Several development disciplines such as audio dialogue or motion capture occur for relatively short periods of time Efficient employment of these roles requires either large development house with multiple simultaneous title production or outsourcing from third party vendors Employing personnel for these tasks full time is expensive so a majority of developers outsource a portion of the work Outsourcing plans are conceived during the pre production stage where the time and finances required for outsourced work are estimated br br The music cost ranges based on length of composition method of performance live or synthesized and composer experience In a minute of high quality synthesized music cost between US k A title with hours of gameplay and minutes of music may have cost k k for its musical score br Voice acting is well suited for outsourcing as it requires a set of specialized skills Only large publishers employ in house voice actors br Sound effects can also be outsourced br Programming is generally outsourced less than other disciplines such as art or music However outsourcing for extra programming work or savings in salaries has become more common in recent years br br br Ghost development br Outsourced work is sometimes anonymous i e not credited on the final product This might go against the wishes of the developer or it is something they reluctantly consent to because it is the only work they can get See Video game controversies Lack of crediting for more information on this br However anonymity can also be agreed upon or even desired by the outsourced party A Polygon article stated that this practice is known as ghost development Ghost developers are hired by other developers to provide assistance by publishers to develop a title they designed or by companies outside the gaming industry These businesses prefer to keep this hidden from the public to protect their brand equity not wanting consumers or investors to know that they rely on external help Ghost development can involve small portions of a project but there have been instances of entire games being outsourced without the studio being credited br Ghost development has a particular long history in the Japanese video game industry Probably the best known example is Tose Founded in this behind the scenes agent has either developed or helped develop over games as of most of them anonymously This includes uncredited contributions to multiple Resident Evil Metal Gear and Dragon Quest titles Another example is Tokyo based Hyde which worked on Final Fantasy Persona and Yakuza games Its president Kenichi Yanagihara stated that the approach stems from Japanese culture in which many people prefer not to seek the limelight br br br Marketing br The game production has similar distribution methods to those of music and film industries br The publisher s marketing team targets the game for a specific market and then advertises it The team advises the developer on target demographics and market trends as well as suggests specific features The game is then advertised and the game s high concept is incorporated into the promotional material ranging from magazine ads to TV spots Communication between developer and marketing is important br The length and purpose of a game demo depends on the purpose of the demo and target audience A game s demo may range between a few seconds such as clips or screenshots to hours of gameplay The demo is usually intended for journalists buyers trade shows general public or internal employees who for example may need to familiarize with the game to promote it Demos are produced with public relations marketing and sales in mind maximizing the presentation effectiveness br br br Trade show demo br As a game nears completion the publisher will want to showcase a demo of the title at trade shows Many games have a Trade Show demo scheduled br The major annual trade shows are for example Electronic Entertainment Expo E or Penny Arcade Expo PAX E is the largest show in North America E is hosted primarily for marketing and business deals New games and platforms are announced at E and it received broad press coverage Thousands of products are on display and press demonstration schedules are kept In the s E became a more closed door event and many advertisers have withdrawn reducing E s budget PAX created by authors of Penny Arcade blog and web comic is a mature and playful event with a player centred philosophy br br br Localization br br A game created in one language may also be published in other countries which speak a different language For that region the developers may want to translate the game to make it more accessible For example some games created for PlayStation Vita were initially published in Japanese language like Soul Sacrifice Non native speakers of the game s original language may have to wait for the translation of the game to their language But most modern big budget games take localization into account during the development process and the games are released in several different languages simultaneously br Localization is the process of translating the language assets in a game into other languages By localizing games they increase their level of accessibility where games could help to expend the international markets effectively Game localization is generally known as language translations yet a full localization of a game is a complex project Different levels of translation range from zero translation being that there is no translation to the product and all things are sent raw basic translation where only a few text and subtitles are translated or even added and a full translation where new voice overs and game material changes are added br There are various essential elements on localizing a game including translating the language of the game to adjusting in game assets for different cultures to reach more potential consumers in other geographies or globalization for short Translation seems to fall into the scope of localization which itself constitutes a substantially broader endeavor These include the different levels of translation to the globalization of the game itself However certain developers seem to be divided on whether globalization falls under localization or not br Moreover in order to fit into the local markets game production companies often change or redesign the graphic designs or the packaging of the game for marketing purposes For example the popular game Assassin s Creed has two different packaging designs for the European and US market By localizing the graphics and packaging designs companies might arouse better connections and attention from the consumers from various regions br br br Development costs br br The costs of developing a video game varies widely depending on several factors including team size game genre and scope and other factors such as intellectual property licensing costs Most video game consoles also require development licensing costs which include game development kits for building and testing software Game budgets also typically include costs for marketing and promotion which can be on the same order in cost as the development budget br Prior to the s game development budgets when reported typically were on the average of US million with known outliers such as the million that Atari had paid to license the rights for E T the Extra Terrestrial in addition to development costs The adoption of technologies such as D hardware rendering and CD ROM integration by the mid s enabling games with more visual fidelity compared to prior titles caused developers and publishers to put more money into game budgets as to flesh out narratives through cutscenes and full motion video and creating the start of the AAA video game industry Some of the most expensive titles to develop around this time approaching costs typical of major motion picture production budgets included Final Fantasy VII in with an estimated budget of million and Shenmue in with an estimated budget of million Final Fantasy VII with its marketing budget had a total estimated cost of million br Raph Koster a video game designer and economist evaluated published development budgets less any marketing for over games in and reported that since the mid s there has been a type of Moore s Law in game budgets with the average budget doubling about every five years after accounting for inflation Koster reported average budgets were around million by and could reach over million by the early s Koster asserts these trends are partially tied to the technological Moore s law that gave more computational power for developers to work into their games but also related to expectations for content from players in newer games and the number of players games are expected to draw Shawn Layden former CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment affirmed that the costs for each generation of PlayStation consoles nearly doubled with PlayStation games have average budgets of million and anticipating that PlayStation games could reach million br The rising costs of budgets of AAA games in the early s led publishers to become risk averse staying to titles that were most likely to be high selling games to recoup their costs As a result of this risk aversion the selection of AAA games in the mid s became rather similar and gave the opportunity for indie games that provided more experimental and unique gameplay concepts to expand around that time br Costs of development for AAA games continued to rise over the next two decades a report by the United Kingdom s Competition and Markets Authority regarding the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft in Costs slowing increased from million in to over million in then to over million by followed by million to million by and million and up by In some cases several AAA games exceeded billion to make split between M to develop and a similar amount for marketing In court documents from regulatory review of the Activision Blizzard merger reviewed by The Verge the costs of Sony s first party games like Horizon Forbidden West and The Last of Us Part II had exceeded million br br br Indie development br br Independent games or indie games are produced by individuals and small teams with no large scale developer or publisher affiliations Indie developers generally rely on Internet distribution schemes Many hobbyist indie developers create mods of existing games Indie developers are credited for creative game ideas for example Darwinia Weird Worlds World of Goo Current economic viability of indie development is questionable however in recent years internet delivery platforms such as Xbox Live Arcade and Steam have improved indie game success In fact some indie games have become very successful such as Braid World of Goo and Minecraft In recent years many communities have emerged in support of indie games such as the popular indie game marketplace Itch io indie game YouTube channels and a large indie community on Steam It is common for indie game developers to release games for free and generate revenue through other means such as microtransactions in game transactions in game advertisements and crowd funding services like Patreon and Kickstarter br br br Game industry br br The video game industry formally referred to as interactive entertainment is the economic sector involved with the development marketing and sale of video games The industry sports several unique approaches br br br Locales br br br United States br br In the United States in the early history of video game development the prominent locale for game development was the corridor from San Francisco to Silicon Valley in California Most new developers in the US open near such hot beds br At present many large publishers still operate there such as Activision Blizzard Capcom Entertainment Crystal Dynamics Electronic Arts Namco Bandai Games Sega of America and Sony Computer Entertainment America However due to the nature of game development many publishers are present in other regions such as Big Fish Games Washington Majesco Entertainment New Jersey Microsoft Corporation Washington Nintendo of America Washington and Take Two Interactive New York br br br Education br Many universities and design schools are offering classes specifically focused on game development Some have built strategic alliances with major game development companies These alliances ensure that students have access to the latest technologies and are provided the opportunity to find jobs within the gaming industry once qualified Many innovative ideas are presented at conferences such as Independent Games Festival IGF or Game Developers Conference GDC br Indie game development may motivate students who produce a game for their final projects or thesis and may open their own game company br br br Stability br Video game industry employment is fairly volatile similar to other artistic industries including television music etc Scores of game development studios crop up work on one game and then quickly go under This may be one reason why game developers tend to congregate geographically if their current studio goes under developers can flock to an adjacent one or start another from the ground up br In an industry where only the top of products make a profit it is easy to understand this fluctuation Numerous games may start development and are cancelled or perhaps even completed but never published Experienced game developers may work for years and yet never ship a title such is the nature of the business br br br See also br br International Game Developers
