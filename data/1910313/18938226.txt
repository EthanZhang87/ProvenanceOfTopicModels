Digital rights management DRM is the management of legal access to digital content Various tools or technological protection measures TPM such as access control technologies can restrict the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works DRM technologies govern the use modification and distribution of copyrighted works e g software multimedia content and of systems that enforce these policies within devices DRM technologies include licensing agreements and encryption br Laws in many countries criminalize the circumvention of DRM communication about such circumvention and the creation and distribution of tools used for such circumvention Such laws are part of the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA and the European Union s Information Society Directive with the French DADVSI an example of a member state of the European Union implementing that directive br Copyright holders argue that DRM technologies are necessary to protect intellectual property just as physical locks prevent personal property from theft For examples they can help the copyright holders for maintaining artistic controls and supporting licenses modalities such as rentals Industrial users i e industries have expanded the use of DRM technologies to various hardware products such as Keurig s coffeemakers Philips light bulbs mobile device power chargers and John Deere s tractors For instance tractor companies try to prevent farmers from making repairs via DRM br DRM is controversial There is an absence of evidence about the DRM capability in preventing copyright infringement some complaints by legitimate customers for caused inconveniences and a suspicion of stifling innovation and competition Furthermore works can become permanently inaccessible if the DRM scheme changes or if a required service is discontinued DRM technologies have been criticized for restricting individuals from copying or using the content legally such as by fair use or by making backup copies DRM is in common use by the entertainment industry e g audio and video publishers Many online stores such as OverDrive use DRM technologies as do cable and satellite service operators Apple removed DRM technology from iTunes around Typical DRM also prevents lending materials out through a library or accessing works in the public domain br br br Introduction br The rise of digital media and analog to digital conversion technologies has increased the concerns of copyright owners particularly within the music and video industries While analog media inevitably lose quality with each copy generation and during normal use digital media files may be duplicated without limit with no degradation Digital devices make it convenient for consumers to convert rip media originally in a physical analog or broadcast form into a digital form for portability or later use Combined with the Internet and file sharing tools made unauthorized distribution of copyrighted content digital piracy much easier br br br History br DRM became a major concern with the growth of the Internet in the s as piracy crushed CD sales and online video became popular It peaked in the early s as various countries attempted to respond with legislation and regulations and dissipated in the s as social media and streaming services largely replaced piracy and content providers elaborated next generation business models br br br Early efforts br In the Software Service System SSS devised by the Japanese engineer Ryuichi Moriya was the first example of DRM technology It was subsequently refined under the name superdistribution The SSS was based on encryption with specialized hardware that controlled decryption and enabled payments to be sent to the copyright holder The underlying principle was that the physical distribution of encrypted digital products should be completely unrestricted and that users of those products would be encouraged to do so br An early DRM protection method for computer and Nintendo Entertainment System games was when the game would pause and prompt the player to look up a certain page in a booklet or manual that came with the game if the player lacked access to the material they would not be able to continue br An early example of a DRM system is the Content Scramble System CSS employed by the DVD Forum on DVD movies CSS uses an encryption algorithm to encrypt content on the DVD disc Manufacturers of DVD players must license this technology and implement it in their devices so that they can decrypt the content The CSS license agreement includes restrictions on how the DVD content is played including what outputs are permitted and how such permitted outputs are made available This keeps the encryption intact as the content is displayed br In May the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA passed as an amendment to US copyright law It had controversial possibly unintended implications Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested for alleged DMCA infringement after a presentation at DEF CON The DMCA has been cited as chilling to legitimate users such as security consultants including Niels Ferguson who declined to publish vulnerabilities he discovered in Intel s secure computing scheme due to fear of arrest under DMCA and blind or visually impaired users of screen readers or other assistive technologies br In Jon Lech Johansen released DeCSS which allowed a CSS encrypted DVD to play on a computer running Linux at a time when no compliant DVD player for Linux had yet been created The legality of DeCSS is questionable one of its authors was sued and reproduction of the keys themselves is subject to restrictions as illegal numbers br More modern examples include ADEPT FairPlay Advanced Access Content System br The World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty WCT was passed in The US Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA was passed in The European Union enacted the Information Society Directive In the lower house of the French parliament adopted such legislation as part of the controversial DADVSI law but added that protected DRM techniques should be made interoperable a move which caused widespread controversy in the United States The Tribunal de grande instance de Paris concluded in that the complete blocking of any possibilities of making private copies was an impermissible behaviour under French copyright law br br br s br The broadcast flag concept was developed by Fox Broadcasting in and was supported by the MPAA and the U S Federal Communications Commission FCC A ruling in May by a United States courts of appeals held that the FCC lacked authority to impose it on the US TV industry It required that all HDTVs obey a stream specification determining whether a stream can be recorded This could block instances of fair use such as time shifting It achieved more success elsewhere when it was adopted by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project DVB a consortium of about broadcasters manufacturers network operators software developers and regulatory bodies from about countries involved in attempting to develop new digital TV standards br In January the Workshop on Digital Rights Management of the World Wide Web Consortium was held br On May the European Union passed the Information Society Directive with copyright protections br In the European Committee for Standardization Information Society Standardization System CEN ISSS DRM Report was published br In the Consultation process of the European Commission and the DG Internal Market on the Communication COM by the European Commission on Management of Copyright and Related Rights closed br In DRM Workshops of Directorate General for Information Society and Media European Commission and the work of the High Level Group on DRM were held br In Sony BMG installed DRM software on users computers without clearly notifying the user or requiring confirmation Among other things the software included a rootkit which created a security vulnerability When the nature of the software was made public much later Sony BMG initially minimized the significance of the vulnerabilities but eventually recalled millions of CDs and made several attempts to patch the software to remove the rootkit Class action lawsuits were filed which were ultimately settled by agreements to provide affected consumers with a cash payout or album downloads free of DRM br Microsoft s media player Zune released in did not support content that used Microsoft s PlaysForSure DRM scheme br Windows Media DRM reads instructions from media files in a rights management language that states what the user may do with the media Later versions of Windows Media DRM implemented music subscription services that make downloaded files unplayable after subscriptions are cancelled along with the ability for a regional lockout Tools like FairUse WM strip Windows Media of DRM restrictions br The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property by the British Government from Andrew Gowers was published in with recommendations regarding copyright terms exceptions orphaned works and copyright enforcement br DVB DVB CPCM is an updated variant of the broadcast flag The technical specification was submitted to European governments in March As with much DRM the CPCM system is intended to control use of copyrighted material by the end user at the direction of the copyright holder According to Ren Bucholz of the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF You won t even know ahead of time whether and how you will be able to record and make use of particular programs or devices The normative sections were approved for publication by the DVB Steering Board and formalized by ETSI as a formal European Standard TS X where X refers to the Part number Nobody has yet stepped forward to provide a Compliance and Robustness regime for the standard so it is not presently possible to fully implement a system as no supplier of device certificates has emerged br In December the industrial grade Advanced Access Content System AACS for HD DVD and Blu ray Discs a process key was published by hackers which enabled unrestricted access to AACS protected content br In January EMI stopped publishing audio CDs with DRM stating that the costs of DRM do not measure up to the results In March Musicload de one of Europe s largest internet music retailers announced their position strongly against DRM In an open letter Musicload stated that three out of every four calls to their customer support phone service are as a result of consumer frustration with DRM br Apple Inc made music DRM free after April and labeled all music as DRM Free after Other works sold on iTunes such as apps audiobooks movies and TV shows are protected by DRM br A notable DRM failure happened in November when videos purchased from Major League Baseball prior to became unplayable due to a change to the servers that validate the licenses br In the European Parliament supported the EU s direction on copyright protection br Asus released a soundcard which features a function called Analog Loopback Transformation to bypass the restrictions of DRM This feature allows the user to record DRM restricted audio via the soundcard s built in analog I O connection br Digital distributor GOG com formerly Good Old Games specializes in PC video games and has a strict non DRM policy br Baen Books and O Reilly Media dropped DRM prior to when Tor Books a major publisher of science fiction and fantasy books first sold DRM free e books br The Axmedis project completed in It was a European Commission Integrated Project of the FP has as its main goal automating content production copy protection and distribution to reduce the related costs and to support DRM at both B B and B C areas harmonizing them br The INDICARE project was a dialogue on consumer acceptability of DRM solutions in Europe that completed in br In mid the Windows version of Mass Effect marked the start of a wave of titles primarily making use of SecuROM for DRM and requiring authentication with a server The use of the DRM scheme in s Spore led to protests resulting in searches for an unlicensed version This backlash against the activation limit led Spore to become the most pirated game in topping the top list compiled by TorrentFreak However Tweakguides concluded that DRM does not appear to increase video game piracy noting that other games on the list such as Call of Duty and Assassin s Creed use DRM without limits or online activation Additionally other video games that use DRM such as BioShock Crysis Warhead and Mass Effect do not appear on the list br Many mainstream publishers continued to rely on online DRM throughout the later half of and early including Electronic Arts Ubisoft Valve and Atari The Sims being a notable exception in the case of Electronic Arts Ubisoft broke with the tendency to use online DRM in late with the release of Prince of Persia as an experiment to see how truthful people really are regarding the claim that DRM was inciting people to use illegal copies Although Ubisoft has not commented on the results of the experiment Tweakguides noted that two torrents on Mininova had over people downloading the game within hours of its release br In Amazon remotely deleted purchased copies of George Orwell s Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty Four from customers Amazon Kindles after refunding the purchase price Commentators described these actions as Orwellian and compared Amazon to Big Brother from Nineteen Eighty Four Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos then issued a public apology FSF wrote that this was an example of the excessive power Amazon has to remotely censor content and called upon Amazon to drop DRM Amazon then revealed the reason behind its deletion the e books in question were unauthorized reproductions of Orwell s works which were not within the public domain and that the company that published and sold on Amazon s service had no right to do so br br br present br Ubisoft formally announced a return to online authentication on February through its Uplay online game platform starting with Silent Hunter The Settlers and Assassin s Creed II Silent Hunter was first reported to have been compromised within hours of release but users of the cracked version soon found out that only early parts of the game were playable The Uplay system works by having the installed game on the local PCs incomplete and then continuously downloading parts of the game code from Ubisoft s servers as the game progresses It was more than a month after the PC release in the first week of April that software was released that could bypass Ubisoft s DRM in Assassin s Creed II The software did this by emulating a Ubisoft server for the game Later that month a real crack was released that was able to remove the connection requirement altogether br In March Uplay servers suffered a period of inaccessibility due to a large scale DDoS attack causing around of game owners to become locked out of playing their game The company later credited owners of the affected games with a free download and there has been no further downtime br In comedian Louis C K released his concert film Live at the Beacon Theater as an inexpensive US DRM free download The only attempt to deter unlicensed copies was a letter emphasizing the lack of corporate involvement and direct relationship between artist and viewer The film was a commercial success turning a profit within hours of its release The artist suggested that piracy rates were lower than normal as a result making the release an important case study for the digital marketplace br In the EU Court of Justice ruled in favor of reselling copyrighted games br In India implemented digital rights management protection br In webcomic Diesel Sweeties released a DRM free PDF e book He followed this with a DRM free iBook specifically for the iPad that generated more than downloads in three days That led Stevens to launch a Kickstarter project ebook stravaganza to fund the conversion of comics written over years into a single humongous e book to be released both for free and through the iBookstore launched February with the goal of raising in days The payment optional DRM free model in this case was adopted on Stevens view that there is a class of webcomics reader who would prefer to read in large chunks and even better would be willing to spend a little money on it br In February Double Fine asked for crowdfunding for an upcoming video game Double Fine Adventure on Kickstarter and offered the game DRM free for backers This project exceeded its original goal of in days raising in excess of million Crowdfunding acted as a pre order or alternatively as a subscription After the success of Double Fine Adventure many games were crowd funded and many offered a DRM free version br Websites such as library nu shut down by court order on February BookFi BookFinder Library Genesis and Sci Hub allowed e book downloading by violating copyright br As of other developers such as Blizzard Entertainment put most of the game logic is on the side or taken care of by the servers of the game maker Blizzard uses this strategy for its game Diablo III and Electronic Arts used this same strategy with their reboot of SimCity the necessity of which has been questioned br In the EU Court of Justice ruled that circumventing DRM on game devices was legal under some circumstances br In digital comic distributor Comixology allowed rights holders to provide the option of DRM free downloads Publishers that allow this include Dynamite Entertainment Image Comics Thrillbent Top Shelf Productions and Zenescope Entertainment br In February Comixology which was later under the ownership of Amazon ended the option of downloading DRM free downloads on all comics although any comics previously purchased prior to the date will have the option to download comics without DRM br br br Technologies br br br Verification br br br Product keys br A product key typically an alphanumerical string can represent a license to a particular copy of software During the installation process or software launch the user is asked to enter the key if the key is valid typically via internal algorithms the key is accepted and the user can continue Product keys can be combined with other DRM practices such as online activation to prevent cracking the software to run without a product key or using a keygen to generate acceptable keys br br br Activation limits br DRM can limit the number of devices on which a legal user can install content This restriction typically support devices This affects users who have more devices than the limit Some allow one device to be replaced with another Without this software and hardware upgrades may require an additional purchase br br br Persistent online DRM br br Always on DRM checks and rechecks authorization while the content is in use by interacting with a server operated by the copyright holder In some cases only part of the content is actually installed while the rest is downloaded dynamically during use br br br Encryption br Encryption alters content in a way that means that it cannot be used without first decrypting it Encryption can ensure that other restriction measures cannot be bypassed by modifying software so DRM systems typically rely on encryption in addition to other techniques br br br Copy restriction br br Microsoft PlayReady prevents illicit copying of multimedia and other files br Restrictions can be applied to electronic books and documents in order to prevent copying printing forwarding and creating backup copies This is common for both e publishers and enterprise Information Rights Management It typically integrates with content management system software br While some commentators claim that DRM complicates e book publishing it has been used by organizations such as the British Library in its secure electronic delivery service to permit worldwide access to rare documents which for legal reasons were previously only available to authorized individuals actually visiting the Library s document centre br Four main e book DRM schemes are in common use from Adobe Amazon Apple and the Marlin Trust Management Organization MTMO br br Adobe s DRM is applied to EPUBs and PDFs and can be read by several third party e book readers as well as Adobe Digital Editions ADE software Barnes Noble uses DRM technology provided by Adobe applied to EPUBs and the older PDB Palm OS format e books br Amazon s DRM is an adaption of the original Mobipocket encryption and is applied to Amazon s azw KF and Mobipocket format e books Topaz format e books have their own encryption system br Apple s FairPlay DRM is applied to EPUBs and can be read only by Apple s iBooks app on iOS devices and Mac OS computers br The Marlin DRM was developed and is maintained by open industry group Marlin Developer Community MDC and is licensed by MTMO Marlin was founded by Intertrust Panasonic Philips Samsung and Sony Online textbook publisher Kno uses Marlin to protect EPUB books These books can be read on the Kno App for iOS and Android br br br Runtime restrictions br Windows Vista contains a DRM system called Protected Media Path which contains Protected Video Path PVP PVP tries to stop DRM restricted content from playing while unsigned software is running in order to prevent the unsigned software from accessing the content Additionally PVP can encrypt information during transmission to the monitor or the graphics card which makes it more difficult to make unauthorized recordings br Bohemia Interactive have used a form of technology since Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis wherein if the game copy is suspected of being unauthorized annoyances like guns losing their accuracy or the players turning into a bird are introduced Croteam s Serious Sam BFE causes a special invincible foe in the game to appear and constantly attack the player until they are killed br br br Regional lockout br Regional lockout or region coding prevents the use of a certain product or service except in a specific region or territory Lockout may be enforced through physical means through technological means such as inspecting the user s IP address or using an identifying code or through unintentional means introduced by devices that support only region specific technologies such as video formats i e NTSC and PAL br br br Tracking br br br Watermarks br Digital watermarks can be steganographically embedded within audio or video data They can be used for recording the copyright owner the distribution chain or identifying the purchaser They are not complete DRM mechanisms in their own right but are used as part of a system for copyright enforcement such as helping provide evidence for legal purposes rather than enforcing restrictions br Some audio video editing programs may distort delete or otherwise interfere with watermarks Signal modulator carrier chromatography may separate watermarks from the recording or detect them as glitches Additionally comparison of two separately obtained copies of audio using basic algorithms can reveal watermarks br br br Metadata br Sometimes metadata is included in purchased media which records information such as the purchaser s name account information or email address Also included may be the file s publisher author creation date download date and various notes This information is not embedded in the content as a watermark is It is kept separate from the content but within the file or stream br As an example metadata is used in media purchased from iTunes for DRM free as well as DRM restricted content This information is included as MPEG standard metadata br br br Hardware br US Cable television set top boxes require a specific piece of hardware to operate The CableCard standard is used to restrict content to services to which the customer is subscribed Content has an embedded broadcast flag that the card examines to decide whether the content can be viewed by a specific user br br br Implementations br br In addition platforms such as Steam may include DRM mechanisms Most of the mechanisms above are copy protection mechanisms rather than DRM mechanisms per se br br br Laws br br The World Intellectual Property Organization supports the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty WCT which requires nations to enact laws against DRM circumvention The WIPO Internet Treaties do not mandate criminal sanctions merely requiring effective legal remedies br br br China br China s Interim Regulations ostensibly regulate digital content China claims to protect intellectual property rights although the World Trade Organization WTO determined that China s copyright laws do not provide the same efficacy to non Chinese nationals as they do to Chinese citizens as required by the Berne Convention and that China s copyright laws do not provide enforcement procedures so as to permit effective action against any act of infringement of intellectual property rights br br br European Union br br The EU operates under its Information Society Directive its WIPO implementation The European Parliament then directed member states to outlaw violation of international copyright for commercial purposes Punishments range from fines to imprisonment It excluded patent rights and copying for personal non commercial purposes Copyrighted games can be resold Circumventing DRM on game devices is legal under some circumstances protections cover only technological measures the interfere with prohibited actions br br br India br India is not a signatory to WIPO Copyright Treaty or the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty Its Copyright Act provides protections for digital content criminalizing circumvention of technical protections and distribution of illicit copies Punishment includes prison time Fair use is not explicitly addressed br br br Israel br Israel is not a signatory to the WIPO Copyright Treaty Israeli law does not expressly prohibit the circumvention of technological protection measures br br br Pakistan br Pakistan is not a signatory to the WIPO Copyright Treaty or the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty Pakistani law does not criminalize the circumvention of technological protection measures br As of January Pakistan s Intellectual Property Office intended to accede to the WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty However there has been no major progress for Pakistan to accede to the treaties and the timeline of the enactments of amendments to the Copyright Ordinance is unclear As of February Pakistan s Intellectual Property Office was currently finalizing draft amendments to its Copyright Ordinance br br br United States br br US protections are governed by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA It criminalizes the production and dissemination of technology that lets users circumvent copy restrictions Reverse engineering is expressly permitted providing a safe harbor where circumvention is necessary to interoperate with other software br Open source software that decrypts protected content is not prohibited per se Decryption done for the purpose of achieving interoperability of open source operating systems with proprietary systems is protected Dissemination of such software for the purpose of violating or encouraging others to violate copyrights is prohibited br DMCA has been largely ineffective Cirumvention software is widely available However those who wish to preserve the DRM systems have attempted to use the Act to restrict the distribution and development of such software as in the case of DeCSS DMCA contains an exception for research although the exception is subject to qualifiers that created uncertainty in that community br Cryptanalytic research may violate the DMCA although this is unresolved br br br Notable lawsuits br br br Opposition br DRM faces widespread opposition John Walker and Richard Stallman are notable critics Stallman has claimed that using the word rights is misleading and suggests that the word restrictions as in Digital Restrictions Management replace it This terminology has been adopted by other writers and critics br Other prominent critics include Ross Anderson who heads a British organization that opposes DRM and similar efforts in the UK and elsewhere and Cory Doctorow EFF and organizations such as FreeCulture org are opposed to DRM The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure criticized DRM s effect as a trade barrier from a free market perspective br Bruce Schneier argues that digital copy prevention is futile What the entertainment industry is trying to do is to use technology to contradict that natural law They want a practical way to make copying hard enough to save their existing business But they are doomed to fail He described trying to make digital files uncopyable as like trying to make water not wet br The creators of StarForce stated that The purpose of copy protection is not making the game uncrackable it is impossible br br Bill Gates spoke about DRM at CES saying that DRM causes problems for legitimate consumers br The Norwegian consumer rights organization Forbrukerr det complained to Apple in about the company s use of DRM accusing it of unlawfully restricting users access to their music and videos and of using EULAs that conflict with Norwegian consumer legislation The complaint was supported by consumers ombudsmen in Sweden and Denmark and was reviewed in the EU in The United States Federal Trade Commission held hearings in March to review disclosure of DRM limitations to customers use of media products br Valve president Gabe Newell stated most DRM strategies are just dumb because they only decrease the value of a game in the consumer s eyes Newell suggested that the goal should instead be creating greater value for customers through service value Valve operates Steam an online store for PC games as well as a social networking service and a DRM platform br At the Game Developers Conference the CEO of CD Projekt Red Marcin Iwinski announced that the company would not use DRM Iwinski stated of DRM It s just over complicating things the game is cracked in two hours Iwinski added DRM does not protect your game If there are examples that it does then people maybe should consider it but then there are complications with legit users br The Association for Computing Machinery and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers opposed DRM naming AACS as a technology most likely to fail in an issue of IEEE Spectrum br br br Public licenses br The GNU General Public License version as released by the Free Software Foundation has a provision that strips DRM of its legal value so people can break the DRM on GPL software without breaking laws such as the DMCA In May FSF launched a Defective by Design campaign against DRM br Creative Commons provides licensing options that encourage creators to work without the use of DRM Creative Commons licenses have anti DRM clauses making the use of DRM by a licensee a breach of the licenses Baseline Rights br br br DRM free works br br Many publishers and artists label their works DRM free Major companies that have done so include Apple GOG com Tor Books and Vimeo on Demand Comixology once had DRM free works available for sale until when its parent company Amazon removed the option to buy DRM free works as part of their migration to Amazon s website although previous purchases remained DRM free br br br Shortcomings br br br Availability br Many DRM systems require online authentication Whenever the server goes down or a territory experiences an Internet outage it locks out people from registering or using the material This is especially true for products that require a persistent online connection where for example a successful DDoS attack on the server essentially makes the material unusable br br br Usability br Compact discs CDs with DRM schemes are not standards compliant and are labeled CD ROMs CD ROMs cannot be played on all CD players or personal computers br br br Performance br Certain DRM systems have been associated with reduced performance some games implementing Denuvo Anti Tamper performed better without DRM However in March PC Gamer tested Final Fantasy XV for the performance effects of Denuvo which was found to cause no negative gameplay impact despite a little increase in loading time br br br Robustness br DRM copy prevention schemes can never be wholly secure since the logic needed to decrypt the content is present either in software or hardware and implicitly can be hacked An attacker can extract this information decrypt and copy the content bypassing the DRM br Satellite and cable systems distribute their content widely and rely on hardware DRM systems Such systems can be hacked by reverse engineering the protection scheme br br br Analog hole br Audio and visual material excluding interactive materials e g video games are subject to the analog hole namely that in order to view the material the digital signal must be turned into an analog signal Post conversion the material can be then be copied and reconverted to a digital format br The analog hole cannot be filled without externally imposed restrictions such as legal regulations because the vulnerability is inherent to all analog presentation The conversion from digital to analog and back reduces recording quality The HDCP attempt to plug the analog hole was largely ineffective br br br Consumer rights br br br Ownership restrictions br DRM opponents argue that it violates private property rights and restricts a range of normal and legal user activities A DRM component such as that found on a digital audio player restricts how it acts with regard to certain content overriding user s wishes for example preventing the user from copying a copyrighted song to CD as part of a compilation Doctorow described this as the right to make up your own copyright laws br Windows Vista disabled or degraded content play that used a Protected Media Path DRM restricts the right to make personal copies provisions lend copies to friends provisions for service discontinuance hardware agnosticism software and operating system agnosticism lending library use customer protections against contract amendments by the publisher and whether content can pass to the owner s heirs br br br Obsolescence br When standards and formats change DRM restricted content may become obsolete br When a company undergoes business changes or bankruptcy its previous services may become unavailable Examples include MSN Music Yahoo Music Store Adobe Content Server for Adobe PDF and Acetrax Video on Demand br br br Piracy br DRM laws are widely flouted according to Australia Official Music Chart Survey copyright infringements from all causes are practised by millions of people According to the EFF in an effort to attract customers these music services try to obscure the restrictions they impose on you with clever marketing br br br Economic implication br br br Trade offs between control and sales br Jeff Raikes ex president of the Microsoft Business Division stated If they re going to pirate somebody we want it to be us rather than somebody else An analogous argument was made in an early paper by Kathleen Conner and Richard Rummelt A subsequent study of digital rights management for e books by Gal Oestreicher Singer and Arun Sundararajan showed that relaxing some forms of DRM can be beneficial to rights holders because the losses from piracy are outweighed by the increase in value to legal buyers Even if DRM were unbreakable pirates still might not be willing to purchase so sales might not increase br Piracy can be beneficial to some content providers by increase consumer awareness spreading and popularizing content This can also increase revenues via other media such as live performances br Mathematical models suggest that DRM schemes can fail to do their job on multiple levels The biggest failure is that the burden that DRM poses on a legitimate customer reduces the customer s willingness to buy An ideal DRM would not inconvenience legal buyers The mathematical models are strictly applicable to the music industry br br br Alternatives br Several business models offer DRM alternatives br br br Subscription br Streaming services have created profitable business models by signing users to monthly subscriptions in return for access to the service s library This model has worked for music such as Spotify Apple Music etc and video such as Netflix Disney Hulu etc br br br Easy and cheap br Accessing a pirated copy can be illegal and inconvenient Businesses that charge acceptable fees for doing so tend to attract customers A business model that dissuades illegal file sharing is to make legal content downloading easy and cheap Pirate websites are often host to malware which attach themselves to the files If content is provided on legitimate sites and is reasonably priced consumers are more likely to purchase media legally br br br Crowdfunding or pre order br Crowdfunding has been used as a publishing model for digital content br br br Promotion for traditional products br Many artists give away individual tracks to create awareness for a subsequent album br br br Artistic Freedom Voucher br The Artistic Freedom Voucher AFV introduced by Dean Baker is a way for consumers to support creative and artistic work In this system each consumer receives a refundable tax credit of to give to any artist of creative work To restrict fraud the artists must register with the government The voucher prohibits any artist that receives the benefits from copyrighting their material for a certain length of time Consumers would be allowed to obtain music for a certain amount of time easily and the consumer would decide which artists receive the The money can either be given to one artist or to many and this distribution is up to the consumer br br br See also br Anti tamper software br Closed platform br Digital
