Floral design or flower arrangement is the art of using plant material and flowers to create an eye catching and balanced composition or display Evidence of refined floral design is found as far back as the culture of ancient Egypt Floral designs called arrangements incorporate the five elements and seven principles of floral design br Floral design is considered a section of floristry But floral design pertains only to the design and creation of arrangements It does not include the marketing merchandising caring of growing of or delivery of flowers br Common flower arrangements in floral design include vase arrangements wreaths nosegays garlands festoons boutonnieres corsages and bouquets br br br History br br The Eastern Western and European styles have all influenced the commercial floral design industry as it is today Western design historically is characterized by symmetrical asymmetrical horizontal and vertical style of arrangements The history of flower arrangement first dates back to Ancient Egypt and has gradually evolved over time br br br Ancient civilizations br Egyptians were among the first to place lotus flowers and buds in vases nearly years ago Egyptians also created bouquets wreaths garlands headwear and collars These arrangements often used lotus and papyrus as they were seen as sacred plants to the goddess Isis Ancient Greeks and Romans also created garlands and wreaths to wear Greeks and Romans also created cornucopias full of fruits and vegetables as religious offerings br br br Asia br br Chinese and Korean arrangements were and still are traditionally based upon the Confucian idea of reflection the Buddhist principle of preservation and Taoist symbolism The arrangements of the Chinese and Koreans often use containers of varying height and shape and use natural elements such as rocks br Ikebana is the Japanese style of floral design and incorporates the three main line placements that correspond with heaven humans and the earth br br br Europe br During the Renaissance pieces often had a degree of symbolism and used bright vivid and contrasting triadic colors Designs were symmetrical and combined fresh and dried material as well as fruits and vegetables These arrangements were often triangular arching or ellipse shaped br In French design arrangements often used soft pastel colors Arrangements were often light and airy and stressed the individual beauty of each flower itself rather than the entire arrangement Pieces were semi ovoid soft and airy had a feminine design were symmetrical and had no focal point They accentuated rhythm with curves lines and flourishes of plant material br English design drew from the vast variety of plant materials that were available in estates and the countryside Most arrangements during the various periods were formal pieces generally triangular in shape and symmetrical br br br The Americas br br In the Americas during the Colonial Period arrangements were made used gathered wildflowers grasses and seed pods These arrangements reflected a simplistic lifestyle with few luxuries a reflection of the first colonists to arrive there American arrangements then evolved from numerous influences primarily European As such American pieces began to reflect the sophistication symmetry and shapes of European design ideals of the time br br br Modern day br In the mid th century flower arranging and floral design came to be seen as an art form While modern floral designers and arrangers are still inspired by the naturalistic th century designs modern designers tend to want to break free from the rigid patterns and restrictions of past period designs This led to the creation of abstract designs in modern floral arrangement Other modern designers however did not feel inspired or drawn to abstract designs As such these designers began to create new design styles Today s floral arrangements are born out of these two factors Modern arrangements range from zero abstraction in which pieces and components are untreated and organized naturally to total abstraction which totally disregards patterns and rules br Today there are many styles of floral design including the Botanical Style the Garden Style Hand Tied Compote or Armature the Crescent Corsage the Nosegay Corsage Pot au Fleur the Inverted T Parallel Systems Western Line the Hedgerow Design Mille de Fleur and Formal Linear br br br Design br br br Principles br When creating flower arrangements there are generally seven principles that floral designers must incorporate into their arrangement to create a flattering and appealing piece These seven principles include br br Proportion the relationship between the sizes of elements used to create the design e g flowers foliage vase accessories br Scale the relationship between the overall size of the design and the setting it is placed in br Balance contains physical balance and visual balance Physical balance is the distribution of materials and weight across the arrangement the arrangement should be stable and not at risk of falling over Visual balance is the poise an arrangement contains upon first glance There are three types of visual balance symmetrical asymmetrical and open br Focal point the main feature of the design and or the first thing that attracts the viewer s eye br Rhythm the visual flow of the arrangement This element should encourage the viewer s gaze to move inward outward up and down while looking at the arrangement Achieved through colors shapes lines textures and spaces br Harmony the pleasing combination of colors material and texture used in the arrangement br Unity everything is placed with purpose achieved when the other principles are in order br It is important to keep in mind that not every arrangement will use all seven principles of design For example French Baroque and Rococo style arrangements do not include a focal point Rococo designs also disregarded proportion they were to be much taller than they were wide Some traditional designs disregarded space and therefore a part of rhythm Modern abstract designers may disregard the seven principles entirely br br br Elements br In addition to the seven principles there are also five elements of design a designer must keep in mind when arranging flowers These five elements include br br Line provides the shape and structure for the design Line also creates paths for the viewer s eye to follow when viewing the arrangement Lines can defined clearly visible or implied suggested by changes in color tone and texture Line helps build the dimensions and overall shape of the design br Color the color of the arrangement There are numerous color schemes such as monochromatic triadic analogous or complimentary Different color schemes provide different effects on the feel of the arrangement br Form the height width and depth of the arrangement Form also helps build the dimensions and overall shape of the design much like Line br Space the spacing of flowers foliage and other materials Space ensures every flower is visible and that the design is not too clumpy constricted spaced out or empty br Texture the different textures used in an arrangement Texture gives the arrangement diversity and interest Texture is one way a floral designer can achieve rhythm Textures can be smooth wrinkled rough glossy etc br br br Media br br br Fresh br The vast majority of the media used in floral design is fresh or living media Fresh media includes flowers and foliage br br br Flowers br Flowers used in floral design are often broke into four categories line flowers form flowers mass flowers and filler flowers Each category serves its own purpose in achieving an element or principle of design The four categories are listed as follows br br Line flowers are tall spikes of flowers that bloom along the stem of the plant They create the outline for an arrangement and determine the height and width of the design They can be straight or naturally curving Most line flowers have larger flowers at the bottom of the stem that gradually become smaller the closer they are located to the end of the spike This creates rhythm in the design as the eye naturally follows the progression Examples of line flowers include snapdragons delphiniums liatris gladiolus stock cattails and pussywillows br Form flowers are flowers that have interesting colors textures and or patterns that draw attention and stand out among the other pieces in the arrangement They are most often used as the focal point of the arrangement Form flowers include irises calla lilies anthurium and orchids br Mass flowers consist of a single stem with one solid rounded head at the top of the stem They add mass and visual weight to an arrangement Mass flowers are often inserted near the rim of the container to draw attention to the focal point or to serve as the focal point themselves Mass flowers are often considered the star of the show in an arrangement Oftentimes more than one type of mass flower is used to create variety and to avoid monotony or to otherwise make the arrangement less boring Mass flowers include carnations chrysanthemums daisies anemone dahlias hydrangeas and roses br Filler flowers are composed of small sprays of flowers Filler flowers are used as the name suggests to fill in empty spaces among mass flowers and the framework of the design Filler flowers also add further dimension to the arrangement Examples of filler flowers are baby s breath and statice br It is worth noting that just because a flower is defined in one category that does not exclude it from other categories For example chrysthanthemums can be considered both a mass flower or a filler flower depending on the size and variety of the bloom Anthuriums and orchids can be considered form flowers as well as mass flowers br Other flowers commonly used by floral designers include peruvian lilies cosmos freesias gardenia hyacinth kalanchoe larkspur lavender lilac lilies limonium lupine peonies phlox protea ranunculus sedum solidago sunflowers tulips and zinnias br br br Foliage br Much like flowers foliage can also be divided into the same four categories Usually they are meant to accent what is being done by their flower counterparts br br Line foliages are effective for repeating and complimenting lines established by the line flowers This creates repetition and unity within the arrangement Much like line flowers they can also be straight or curved Examples of line foliage include bear grass flax ivy and flat ferns such as sword fern br Form foliages also have unique textures patterns or colors that allow them to shine through and stand out in an arrangement Form foliage are often used to achieve the element of space They also are used to drag the viewer s eye to the focal point Form foliages include seeded eucalyptus calathea equisetum diffenbachia and galax br Mass foliages have the same purpose as mass flowers to add mass and visual weight to the arrangement However they are also effective in filling empty space not occupied by flowers and hiding the mechanics of the design e g floral foam pot tape etc Mass foliages include leatherleaf fern and salal br Filler foliages are used as accents to create harmony and unity Depending on the texture of the filler foliage there can be different effects on the feel of the arrangements Fillers like plumosa asparagus and sprengeri fern lighten and soften whereas coarse textures of plants like huckleberry and boxwood create contrast br Another similarity shared in the categorization of foliage in the same way as flowers is that a certain type of foliage may be included in more than one category Leatherleaf fern can be considered a mass foliage or a line foliage and ruscus can be considered form foliage or a line foliage br Other foliage used by floral designers today include Italian ruscus Israeli ruscus dusty miller monstera deliciosa eucalyptus including silver dollar gunnii and baby blue various types of ferns such as tree fern camellia olive branches hypericum berries and pittosporum br br br Preserved br Dried materials such as bark wood dried flowers dried and often aromatic inflorescences leaves leaf skeletons and other preserved materials are common extensions of the art and media of floral design They are of practical importance in that they last indefinitely and are independent of the seasons Their materials offer effects and associations complementary to and contrasting with fresh flowers and foliage br br br Tools br br To create an arrangement a floral designer has to use a multitude of tools In general the most common tools are floral tape pot tape glue flower frogs cutting tools floral foam containers and wire br Vases and other containers are used to hold the arrangement They often lend to the final look of a piece and come in a variety of shapes and sizes to suit numerous types of projects br Floral foam is a piece of dense foam that holds moisture and keeps flowers in place Most floral foam has a specific container that can hold the foam without anything more than placing it into the container However floral foam can be cut into any shape and therefore placed in any container In recent years there has been controversy over the environmental impact of floral foam as well as the potential negative health effects from inhaling the powder created from unsoaked foam Nevertheless floral foam is still an essential tool in floral design br Cutting tools such as floral knives floral shears pruners and ribbon scissors can be used to cut a variety of materials in floral design Knives can be used to cut flowers or floral foam Shears and pruners can also be used to trim and cut foliage and flowers Ribbon scissors are used to cut ribbon and twine br Adhesive tools include floral tape pot tape floral adhesive also known as cold glue and hot glue Floral tape is most often used to secure flowers together or to cover the mechanics of an arrangement especially when creating a boutonniere or corsage Pot tape is used to create a grid pattern in vases which helps keeps flowers and foliage in place Pot tape can also be used to secure floral foam to a container Cold glue is used to secure fresh living flowers together or in place for an arrangement Hot glue is used to glue non living media in place or together br Wire is used in floral design for a variety of purposes It can be used to secure ribbons in place fix broken stems or provide strength to weak or flimsy material Wire comes in different gauges or sizes which are used for different applications br Flower frogs are devices that keep flowers upright They usually have holes to place the flowers into or spikes to spear the cut end of the flower into br br br Education br With the ever growing interest in the natural world and flowers the floral industry continues to grow The increase in educational institutes providing training in floral design has expanded to many state universities certified design schools and even high schools worldwide Schools that teach floral design courses teach techniques to arrange flowers plant identification foliage and flower care for both fresh and preserved media retail floral shop practices and how to place and receive flower orders Most of these programs reward students with certificates or degrees in floral design shop management or artisanship Floral design course are typically cheaper than most higher education programs and can cost anywhere from US to over US Most courses take around six to eighteen months to complete br The following list is composed of schools and organizations that offer floral design courses br br Rittners School of Floral Design br Texas Tech University School of Floral Design br Golden West College br Anne Arundel Community College br New York Institute of Art Design br American Institute of Floral Designers br California Polytechnic State University br Mississippi State University br The London Flower School br Judith Blacklock Flower School br Hong Kong Academy of Flower Arrangement br Nobleman School of Floral Design br br br Community br br br Floral shops br br Floral shops are business establishments that create and sell floral designs Floral shops often have a vast variety of flowers and foliage to use in creating arrangements which can be custom ordered or pre designed Floral shops usually receive a majority of their business on the following holidays and events Christmas Valentine s Day Administrative Professionals Day Mothers Day All Souls Day Advent Easter weddings and funerals Floral shops also include the other aspects of floristry including marketing buying and selling of flowers production etc br br br Street vendors br br Street vendors that sell flowers and arrangements are called flower sellers Flower sellers are popular in countries like Mexico India Vietnam and Southwestern states in the United States br br br Associations br Prominent industry associations that promote floral design worldwide include the American Institute of Floral Designers AIFD the Society of American Florists SAF and the National Association of Flower Arranging Societies NAFAS In the United States there are also numerous floriculture and floral design organizations for nearly all of the states in the country These associations promote floral design through workshops conferences flower shows and seminars br br br Designers br Notable floral designers include Daniel
