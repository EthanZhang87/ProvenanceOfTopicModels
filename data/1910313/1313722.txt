Costume design is the creation of clothing for the overall appearance of a character or performer Costume may refer to the style of dress particular to a nation a social class or a period In many cases it may contribute to the fullness of the artistic visual world which is unique to a particular theatrical or cinematic production The most basic designs are produced to denote status provide protection or modesty or provide visual interest to a character Costumes may be for a theater cinema musical performance cosplay parties or other events Costume design should not be confused with costume coordination which merely involves altering existing clothing although both create stage clothes br Four types of costumes are used in theatrical design historical fantastical dance and modern br br br History br Ancient Greek village festivals and processions in honor of Dionysus See also Dionysia are believed to be the origin of theatre and therefore theatre costume Sculpture and vase paintings provide the clearest evidence of these costumes Ritualized masks were used giving each character a specific look They varied depending on whether they were used for comedic or dramatic purposes Some masks were constructed with a cheerful as well as a serious side on the same face in an attempt to indicate a change in emotion without a change of mask The same is true for the Romans who continued the mask tradition doubling a mask made doubling roles easier br During the Late Middle Ages in Europe dramatic enactments of Bible stories were prevalent therefore actual Christian vestments stylized from traditional Byzantine court dress were worn as costumes to keep the performances as realistic as possible Stereotypical characterization was key when clothing performers for this style of theatre In most instances actors had to supply their own costumes when playing a character found in daily life br Later in Elizabethan theatre performance during the th century and th century in England costume became the most important visual element Garments were very expensive because only the finest fabrics were used The majority of characters were clothed in contemporary Elizabethan fashion The costumes could be divided into five categories br Ancient which was out of style clothing used to represent another period Antique older additions to contemporary clothing to distinguish classical characters Dreamlike fanciful garments for supernatural or allegorical characters Traditional clothing which represented only a few specific people such as Robin Hood or National or Racial costumes that were intended to set apart a specific group of people but did not tend to be historically accurate br Ordinarily fashionable garments were used in both comedy and tragedy until when Adrienne Lecouvreur adopted the much more elaborate and formal court dress for tragedy Her practice soon became standard for all tragic heroines Major actors began to compete with one another about who would have the most lavish stage dress This practice continued until around the s when costumes became relevant to the character again Art began to copy life and realistic characteristics were favored especially during the th century For example Georg the second Duke of Saxe Meiningen took personal interest in the theatre and began managing troupes He advocated for authenticity and accuracy of the script and time period therefore he refused to let actors tamper with their own costumes He also made sure the materials were authentic and specific using real chain mail armor swords etc No cheap substitutes would be allowed br In August in an issue of The Album James Planch published an article saying that more attention should be paid to the time period of Shakespeare s plays especially when it comes to costumes In the same year a casual conversation led to one of Planch s more lasting effects on British theatre He observed to Charles Kemble the manager of Covent Garden that while a thousand pounds were frequently lavished upon a Christmas pantomime or an Easter spectacle the plays of Shakespeare were put upon the stage with makeshift scenery and at the best a new dress or two for the principal characters Kemble saw the possible advantage of correct appliances catching the taste of the town and agreed to give Planch control of the costuming for the upcoming production of King John if he would carry out the research design the costumes and superintend the production Planch had little experience in this area and sought the help of antiquaries such as Francis Douce and Sir Samuel Meyrick The research involved sparked Planch s latent antiquarian interests these came to occupy an increasing amount of his time later in life br Despite the actors reservations King John was a success and led to a number of similarly costumed Shakespeare productions by Kemble and Planch Henry IV Part I As You Like It Othello Cymbeline Julius Caesar The designs and renderings of King John Henry IV As You Like It Othello Hamlet and Merchant of Venice were published though there is no evidence that Hamlet and Merchant of Venice were ever produced with Planch s historically accurate costume designs Planch also wrote a number of plays or adaptations which were staged with historically accurate costumes Cortez The Woman Never Vext The Merchant s Wedding Charles XII The Partisans The Brigand Chief and Hofer After although he still used period costume he no longer claimed historical accuracy for his work in plays His work in King John had brought about a revolution in nineteenth century stage practice which lasted for almost a century br In the first of a series of innovative modern dress productions of Shakespeare plays Cymbeline directed by H K Ayliff opened at Barry Jackson s Birmingham Repertory Theatre in England br br Costumes in Chinese theatre are very important especially in Beijing Opera They are usually heavily patterned with intense bright colors The standard items consist of at least pieces and indicate the actors character type age and social status through ornament design color and accessories Color is always used symbolically red for loyalty and high position yellow for royalty and dark crimson for barbarians or military advisors Symbolic significance is also found in the designs used for emblems For example the tiger stands for power and masculine strength A majority of the clothing regardless of rank is made out of rich and luxurious materials Makeup is also used symbolically and completes the overall look br In Japanese Noh drama masks are always used and the prominent aspect of the costume They are made of wood and usually last for generations There are five basic types male female aged deities and monsters all with many variations The masks are changed often throughout the play br In Kabuki another form of Japanese theatre actors do not wear masks but rely heavily on makeup for the characterizations Features are exaggerated or removed and for some of the athletic roles musculature is outlined in a specific pattern Traditional costumes are used for each role based upon historical garments that are altered for dramatic effect Some costumes weigh as much as fifty pounds and stage attendants assist the actors in keeping them properly arranged while on stage br In the st century digital technologies have ushered in a new era of costume design Traditionally theater costumers were manually crafted by hand through sewing and patterns drafted on paper Now theater costumes are able to be designed using D printers modeling software and other digital tools to create costumes more efficiently Utilizing D costume modeling programs and D printers allows designers to come up with the most efficient ways to save the amount of materials used on a project Designers can optimize material usage with design softwares and reduce costs through cheaper materials printed from D printing Moreover these technologies save on time where models can be adjusted in real time to the corresponding feedback through virtual fittings and sewings br br br Design process br The costume design process involves many steps and though they differ from genre to genre a basic method is commonly used Analysis br The first step is an analysis of the script musical composition choreography etc Costume parameters for the show are established and a rough costume plot is created A costume plot outlines which character is in which scene when the actors change and what costumes are mentioned in the script br Design collaboration br An important phase in the process is when all of the designers meet with the director There must be a clear understanding of the overall show concept The designers must all get on the same page with the director in terms of themes for the show and what messages they want the audience to get from the show br Costume research br Once the director and designers are on the same page the next step is for the Costume designer to gather research Costume designers usually begin with research where they find resources to establish the world where the play takes place This helps the designers establish the rules of the world and then in turn understand the characters better The designer will then go into broad research about each character to try to establish their personalities though their costume br br Preliminary sketching and color layout br Once enough information is obtained Costume designers begin by creating preliminary sketches Beginning with very quick rough sketches the designer can get a basic idea for how the show will look put together and if the rules of the world are being maintained The Costume designer will then go into more detailed sketches and will figure out the specific costumes and colors for the character Sketches help see the show as a whole without them having to spend too much time on them br Final sketches br Once the Costume Designer and the Director agree on the costumes and the ideas are fully flushed out the designer will create final sketches These are called renderings and are usually painted with watercolors or acrylic paints These final sketches show what the designer wants the character to look like and the colors of the costume br br br Production process br br Once the show is designed it is necessary to plan where the items will be sourced There are four options Garments can be br br Pulled which refers to searching through a costume shop s stock br Rented br Shopped purchased br Constructed or also known as made to order br There are two ways a garment can begin to be constructed either pattern drafted or draped and many times both methods will be used together br Pattern drafting begins by using a set of basic pattern blocks developed from the actor s measurements They are drawn out on paper first then transferred to fabric and sewn together to test fit br Draping involves manipulating a piece of fabric on a dress form or mannequin that has measurements closely related to the actor s It is a process that takes a flat piece of cloth and shapes it to conform the fabric to a three dimensional body by cutting and pinning br Once constructed however the costume has not finished working A most important aspect of costumes is the ways they affect actors performances and function within their settings The very best costume designers build their original ideas after assessing the visual and spatial conditions of the costumes br Once constructed
