Computer Aided Industrial Design CAID is a subset of computer aided design CAD software that can assist in creating the look and feel or industrial design aspects of a product in development br CAID programs tend to provide designers with improved freedom of creativity compared to typical CAD tools However a typical workflow may follow a simple design methodology as follows br br Creating sketches using a stylus br Generating curves directly from the sketch br Generating surfaces directly from the curves br The end result is generally a D model that represents the main intent of the designer had in mind for the physical product Such models can then be saved in formats for more convenient exchange with others such as OBJ for virtual viewing in D graphics programs or manufacturing such a STL to create a real life model via a rapid prototyping machine CAID helps the designer focus on the technical aspect of the design methodology rather than the sketching and modelling aspects contributing to the selection of a better product proposal in less time When product pre requisites and parameters have been more completely defined output from the CAID software can be imported into a CAD program for pre production testing adjustment and generation of technical drawings and manufacturing data such as CNC tool paths br CAID is far more conceptual and less technically focused than CAD CAID programs tend to offer more tools that allow a designer to freely express themselves with more organic shapes and complex curves whilst CAD software tends to be more focused on tools for the simple curves and straight lines more suitable for easy manufacturing br CAD implementations have evolved dramatically since initial D offerings in the s which were typically limited to producing drawings similar to hand drafted output Advances in programming and computer hardware notably solid modelling in the s have allowed more versatile applications of computers in design activities br br br See also br Industrial Design br Freeform surface modelling br Class A Surfaces br Production br Injection molding br Automobile design Y br AliasStudio ICEM Surf NX Shape Studio CATIA Shape Design and Styling SolidThinking Rhinoceros examples of CAID software br br br br br br External links br ASIS proceedings on CAID br ACM Siggraph abstract on CAID
