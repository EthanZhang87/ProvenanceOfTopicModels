Public art is art in any media whose form function and meaning are created for the general public through a public process It is a specific art genre with its own professional and critical discourse Public art is visually and physically accessible to the public it is installed in public space in both outdoor and indoor settings Public art seeks to embody public or universal concepts rather than commercial partisan or personal concepts or interests Notably public art is also the direct or indirect product of a public process of creation procurement and or maintenance br Independent art created or staged in or near the public realm for example graffiti street art lacks official or tangible public sanction has not been recognized as part of the public art genre however this attitude is changing due to the efforts of several street artists Such unofficial artwork may exist on private or public property immediately adjacent to the public realm or in natural settings but however ubiquitous it sometimes falls outside the definition of public art by its absence of public process or public sanction as bona fide public art br br br Characteristics of public art br br Common characteristics of public art are public accessibility public realm placement community involvement public process including public funding these works can be permanent or temporary According to the curator and art architecture historian Mary Jane Jacob public art brings art closer to life br br br Public accessibility placement in public space public realm br Public art is publicly accessible both physically and or visually When public art is installed on privately owned property general public access rights still exist br Public art is characterized by site specificity where the artwork is created in response to the place and community in which it resides and by the relationship between its content and the public Cher Krause Knight states that art s publicness rests in the quality and impact of its exchange with audiences at its most public art extends opportunities for community engagement but cannot demand particular conclusion it introduces social ideas but leaves room for the public to come to their own conclusions br br br Public process public funding br br Public art is often characterized by community involvement and collaboration Public artists and organizations often work in conjunction with architects fabricators construction workers community residents and leaders designers funding organizations and others br Public art is often created and provided within formal art in public places programs that can include community arts education and art performance Such programs may be financed by government entities through Percent for Art initiatives br br br Longevity br Some public art is planned and designed for stability and permanence Its placement in or exposure to the physical public realm requires both safe and durable materials Public artworks are designed to withstand the elements sun wind water as well as human activity In the United States unlike gallery studio or museum artworks which can be transferred or sold public art is legally protected by the Visual Artists Rights Act of VARA which requires an official deaccession process for sale or removal br br br Forms of public art br br The following forms of public art identify to what extent public art may be physically integrated with the immediate context or environment These forms which can overlap employ different types of public art that suit a particular form of environment integration br br stand alone for example sculptures statues structures br integrated into fa ades pavements or landscapes for example bas reliefs Hill figure Geoglyph Petroglyph mosaics digital lighting br applied to a surface for example murals building mounted sculptures br installation where artwork and site are mutually embedded for example transit station art br ephemeral or non permanent performances temporary installations for example a precarious rock balance or an instance of colored smoke br br br History of public art br br br United States th century br In the s the production of national symbolism implied by th century monuments began being regulated by long term national programs with propaganda goals Federal Art Project United States Cultural Office Soviet Union Programs like President Roosevelt s New Deal facilitated the development of public art during the Great Depression but was wrought with propaganda goals New Deal art programs were intended to develop national pride in American culture while avoiding addressing the faltering economy Although problematic New Deal art programs such as FAP altered the relationship between the artist and society by making art accessible to all people The New Deal program Art in Architecture A i A developed percent for art programs a structure for funding public art still utilized today This program allotted one half of one percent of total construction costs of all government buildings to the purchase of contemporary American art for them A i A helped solidify the policy that public art in the United States should be truly owned by the public It also promoted site specific public art br The approach to public art radically changed during the s following the civil rights movement s claims on public space the alliance between urban regeneration programs and artistic efforts at the end of the s and revised ideas of sculpture Public art acquired a status beyond mere decoration and visualization of official national histories in public space Public art became much more about the public This perspective was reinforced in the s by urban cultural policies for example the New York based Public Art Fund and urban or regional Percent for Art programs in the United States and Europe Moreover public art discourse shifted from a national to a local level consistent with the site specific trend and criticism of institutional exhibition spaces emerging in contemporary art practices br br br Environmental public art br br Between the s and the s gentrification and ecological issues surfaced in public art practice both as a commission motive and as a critical focus by artists The individual Romantic retreat element implied in the conceptual structure of land art and its will to reconnect the urban environment with nature is turned into a political claim in projects such as Wheatfield A Confrontation by American artist Agnes Denes as well as in Joseph Beuys Oaks Both projects focus on the increase of ecological awareness through a green urban design process bringing Denes to plant a two acre field of wheat in downtown Manhattan and Beuys to plant oaks coupled with basalt blocks in Kassel Germany in a guerrilla or community garden fashion In recent years programs of green urban regeneration aiming at converting abandoned lots into green areas regularly include public art programs This is the case for High Line Art a commission program for the High Line derived from the conversion of a portion of railroad in New York City and of Gleisdreieck an urban park derived from the partial conversion of a railway station in Berlin which hosts since an open air contemporary art exhibition br The s also witnessed the institutionalization of sculpture parks as curated programs While the first public and private open air sculpture exhibitions and collections dating back to the s aimed at creating an appropriate setting for large scale sculptural forms difficult to show in museum galleries installations such as Noguchi s Garden in Queens New York reflect the necessity of a permanent relationship between the artwork and its site br This relationship also develops in Donald Judd s project for the Chinati Foundation in Texas which advocates for the permanent nature of large scale installations whose fragility may be destroyed when re locating the work br br br Sustainability and public art br Public art faces a design challenge by its very nature how best to activate the images in its surroundings The concept of sustainability arises in response to the perceived environmental deficiencies of a city Sustainable development promoted by the United Nations since the s includes economical social and ecological aspects A sustainable public art work would include plans for urban regeneration and disassembly Sustainability has been widely adopted in many environmental planning and engineering projects Sustainable art is a challenge to respond the needs of an opening space in public br In another public artwork titled Mission leopard was commissioned in in Haryana India among the remote deciduous terrain of Tikli village a team coordinated by Artist Hunny Mor painted two leopards perched on branches on a water source tank feet high The campaign was aimed to spread awareness on co habitation and environmental conservation The art work can be seen from several miles across in all directions br Ron Finley s work as the Gangsta Gardener or Guerrilla Gardener of South Central L A is an example of an artist whose works constitute temporary public art works in the form of public food gardens that addresses sustainability food security and food justice br Andrea Zittel has produced works such as Indianapolis Island that reference sustainability and permaculture with which participants can actively engage br br br Interactive public art br br Some public art is designed to encourage direct hands on interaction Examples include public art that contain interactive musical light video or water components For example the architectural centerpiece in front of the Ontario Science Centre is a fountain and musical instrument hydraulophone by Steve Mann where people can produce sounds by blocking water jets to force water through sound producing mechanisms An early and unusual interactive public artwork was Jim Pallas Century of Light in Detroit Michigan of a large outdoor mandala of lights that reacted in complex ways to sounds and movements detected by radar mistakenly destroyed years later Another example is Rebecca Hackemann s two works The Public Utteraton Machines of and The Urban Field Glass Project Visionary Sightseeing Binoculars The Public Utteraton Machines records people s opinions of other public art in New York such as Jeff Koon s Split Rocker and displays responses online br br br New genre public art br In the s some artists called for artistic social intervention in public space These efforts employed the term new genre public art in addition to the terms contextual art relational art participatory art dialog art community based art and activist art New genre public art is defined by Suzanne Lacy as socially engaged interactive art for diverse audiences with connections to identity politics and social activism Mel Chin s Fundred Dollar Bill Project is an example of an interactive social activist public art project Rather than metaphorically reflecting social issues new genre public art strove to explicitly empower marginalized groups while maintaining aesthetic appeal An example was curator Mary Jane Jacob s public art show Culture in Action that investigated social systems though engagement with audiences that typically did not visit traditional art museums br In the st Century public art has often been a significant component of public realm projects in UK cities and towns often via engagement with local residents where artists will work with the community in developing an idea or sourcing content to be featured in the artwork Examples would include Adrian Riley s Come Follow Me in Minster in Lincolnshire where a m long text artwork in the public square outside the town s Minster includes local residents own stories alongside official civic history and the town s origin myth br br br Curated public art br br The term curated public art is used to define the way of producing public art that significantly takes into account the context the process and the different actors involved It defines itself slightly differently from top down approaches of direct commissioning br If it mainly designates the fact that a curator conducts and supervises the realization of a public art work for a third party it can also mean that the art work is produced by a community or public who commissions a work in collaboration with a curator mediator br For the first significant examples of these prospective manners of commissioning art projects have been established by the Public Art Fund launched by Doris C Freedman in with a new approach in the way the percent for art was used or the public art funds of Geneva with the Neon Parallax project involving a very large urban environnement in br For the second one can refer to Les Nouveaux Commanditaires launched by Fondation de France with Fran ois Hers in with the idea a project can respond to a community s wish The New York High Line from is a good example although less art is involved The doual art project in Douala Cameroon is based on a commissioning system that brings together the community the artist and the commissioning institution for the realization of the project br br br Memorial public art br Memorials for individuals groups of people or events are sometimes represented through public art Examples are Maya Lin s Vietnam War Memorial in Washington DC Tim Tate s AIDS Monument in New Orleans and Kenz Tange s Cenotaph for the A bomb Victims in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Japan br br br Controversies br br Public art is sometimes controversial The following public art controversies have been notable br br Detroit s Heidelberg Project was controversial for several decades since its inception in due to its garish appearance br Richard Serra s minimalist piece Tilted Arc was removed from Foley Square in New York City in after office workers complained their work routine was disrupted by the piece A public court hearing ruled against continued display of the work br Victor Pasmore s Apollo Pavilion in the English New Town of Peterlee has been a focus for local politicians and other groups complaining about the governance of the town and allocation of resources Artists and cultural leaders mounted a campaign to rehabilitate the reputation of the work with the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art commissioning artists Jane and Louise Wilson to make a video installation about the piece in br Sam Durant s Scaffold installed in the Walker Art Center s garden represented the gallows used in seven government hangings Native American groups found the work offensive as Dakota people had been hung at Mankato Minnesota The artist agreed to dismantle and permit the tribal elders to burn and bury the piece br Maurice Agis Dreamspace V a huge inflatable maze erected in Chester le Street County Durham killed two women and seriously injured a three year old girl in when a strong wind broke its moorings and carried it ft m into the air with thirty people trapped inside br Ron Robertson Swann s Vault an abstract yellow polygonal structure erected in Melbourne City Square was considered so visually offensive that is was moved several times and referred by much of the public by the racist colour metaphor Yellow Peril br There have been numerous controversies regarding monuments in the United States many of which have to do with public monuments dedicated to soldiers and leaders of the Confederate States of America following the American Civil War br br br Online documentation br Online databases of local and regional public art emerged in the s and s in tandem with the development of web based data Online public art databases can be general or selective limited to sculptures or murals and they can be governmental quasi governmental or independent Some online databases such as the Smithsonian American Art Museum s Archives of American Art It currently holds over six thousand works in its database br There are dozens of non government organizations and educational institutions that maintain online public art databases of public artworks covering numerous areas including the National Endowment for the Arts WESTAF Public Art Fund Creative Time and others Public Art Online maintains a database of public art works essays and case studies with a focus on the UK The Institute for Public Art based in the UK maintains information about public art on six continents br The WikiProject Public art project began in and strove to document public art around the globe While this project received initial attention from the academic community it mainly relied on temporary student contributions Its status is currently unknown br br br See also br br br br br br Bibliography br Cartiere Cameron and Martin Zebracki eds The Everyday Practice of Public Art Art
