id: 249431
In video games a boss is a significantly powerful non player character created as an opponent to players A fight with a boss character is commonly referred to as a boss battle or boss fight Bosses are generally far stronger than other opponents the players have faced up to that point in a game Boss battles are generally seen at climax points of particular sections of games such as at the end of a level or stage or guarding a specific objective A miniboss is a boss weaker or less significant than the main boss in the same area or level though usually more powerful than the standard opponents and often fought alongside them A superboss sometimes secret hidden or raid boss is generally much more powerful than the bosses encountered as part of the main game s plot and is often an optional encounter A final boss is often the main antagonist of a game s story and the defeat of that character usually provides a positive conclusion to the game A boss rush is a stage where players face multiple previous bosses again in succession br For example in a run n gun video game all regular enemies might use pistols while the boss uses a tank A boss enemy is quite often larger in size than other enemies and the player character At times bosses are very hard to defeat without being adequately prepared and or knowing the correct fighting approach Bosses usually take strategy and special knowledge to defeat such as how to attack weak points or avoid specific attacks br Bosses are common in many genres of video games but they are especially common in story driven titles and are commonly previously established antagonists in the plot of the video game Action adventure games beat em up games fighting games platform games role playing video games RPGs and shooter games are particularly associated with boss battles They may be less common in puzzle games card video games sports games and simulation games The first video game with a boss fight was the RPG dnd br The concept has expanded to new genres like rhythm games where there may be a boss song that is more difficult In multiplayer online battle arena games defeating a map boss usually requires teamwork of or more players but it brings various benefits to the team such as buffs or lane push power Some games such as Cuphead Furi and Warning Forever are centered around continual boss fights br br br Characteristics br Bosses are usually harder to beat than regular enemies have higher health points hence can sustain more damage and are generally found at the end of a level or area While most games include a mixture of boss opponents and regular opponents some games have only regular opponents and some games have only bosses e g Shadow of the Colossus Some bosses are encountered several times through a single game typically with alternate attacks and a different strategy required to defeat it each time A boss battle can also be made more challenging if the boss in question becomes progressively stronger and or less vulnerable as their health decreases requiring players to use different strategies to win Some bosses may contain or be composed of smaller parts that can be destroyed by players in battle which may or may not grant an advantage In games such as Doom and Castlevania Symphony of the Night an enemy may be introduced via a boss battle but later appear as a regular enemy after players have become stronger or had a chance to find more powerful weaponry br Many games structure boss battles as a progression of distinct phases in which the boss produces different or additional hazards for players This is often reflected by a change in the appearance of the boss br The Legend of Zelda series and games inspired by it are recognized for having dungeons with bosses that are specifically vulnerable to a special item that is located within that dungeon Player s typically acquire this item while exploring the dungeon and is given opportunity to learn to use it to solve puzzles or defeat weaker enemies before facing the boss character br Boss battles are typically seen as dramatic events As such they are usually characterized by cutscenes before and after the boss battle and unique music Recurring bosses and final bosses may have their own specific theme music to distinguish them from other boss battles This concept extends beyond combat oriented video games For example a number of titles in the Dance Dance Revolution rhythm game series contain boss songs that are called bosses because they are exceptionally difficult to perform on br In combat focused games a boss may summon additional enemies reinforcements or minions or adds to fight players alongside the boss increasing the boss fight s difficulty These additional enemies may distract from the boss battle or give time for the boss to regain or regenerate health but may also give players opportunity to regain health from health boosters and ammo dropped by the boss s minions br br br Specific boss types br br br Miniboss br br A miniboss also known as a middle boss mid boss half boss sub boss or semi boss is a boss weaker or less significant than the main boss in the same area or level Some minibosses are stronger versions of regular enemies as in the Kirby games Others may be a recurring version of a previous boss who is either weaker than previously encountered or is less of a challenge later in the game due to character or equipment progression An example is Castlevania Symphony of the Night s Gaibon and Slogra Other video game characters who usually take the role of a miniboss are Vile Mega Man X series Allen O Neil Metal Slug and Dark Link The Legend of Zelda series though he appears as a final boss in Zelda II The Adventure of Link br br br Superboss br A superboss is a type of boss most commonly found in role playing video games They are considered optional enemies and do not have to be defeated to complete the game However not all optional bosses are superbosses They are generally much more powerful than the bosses encountered as part of the main game s plot or quest more difficult even than the final boss and often players are required to meet certain conditions in the game or complete a sidequest or the entire game to fight the superboss The first such superboss or secret boss was Akuma in Super Street Fighter II Turbo that required players meet certain conditions before he would appear as the final boss In Final Fantasy VII players may choose to seek out and fight the Ruby and Emerald Weapons Some superbosses will take the place of the final boss if certain requirements are met Some superbosses can yield special items or skills that cannot be found any other way that can give players a significant advantage during playthrough of the rest of the game such as added experience or an extremely powerful weapon For example the raid bosses from Borderlands give rare loot unavailable anywhere else Some superbosses in online games have an immense amount of health and must be defeated within a time limit by having a large number of players or parties working together to defeat the boss Examples of such superbosses can be found in games like Pok mon Go and World of Warcraft and are generally referred to as a raid Toby Fox s games Undertale and Deltarune both feature superbosses in the form of Sans Jevil and Spamton NEO Some major video game series have recurring superbosses such as the Ultima Weapon and Omega Weapon in Final Fantasy and the Amon clan in Yakuza The Warden from Minecraft could be considered a superboss as it is vastly more difficult to fight than the final boss the Ender Dragon However Mojang has explicitly stated that the Warden was not intended to be fought by players br br br Wolfpack boss br A wolfpack boss is a group of enemies who may be considered weak on their own but in large groups can be considered strong enough to be a boss They come in many variations such as the Chargin Chuck Swarm encountered in Mario Luigi Paper Jam the Armos Knights from The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past or the Battle of Heartless from Kingdom Hearts II A main requirement with most wolfpacks is that the whole group must be defeated in order to win in order to prolong the fight many wolfpacks particularly in games with turn based combat in lieu of real time will summon reinforcements to replenish their lost numbers An example of this is Astaroth in Diablo IV br br br Final boss br br The final boss last boss or end boss is typically present at or near the end of a game with completion of the game s storyline usually following victory in the battle The final boss is usually the main antagonist of the game however there are exceptions such as in Conker s Bad Fur Day in which the final boss is the antagonist s alien pet Final bosses are generally larger more detailed or better animated than lesser enemies often in order to inspire a feeling of grandeur and special significance from the encounter br In some games a hidden boss referred to as the true final boss is present These bosses only appear after the completion of specific additional levels choosing specific dialogue options or after obtaining a particular item or set of items such as the Chaos Emeralds in the Sonic the Hedgehog series or performing a series of tasks in Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker These bosses are generally more difficult to defeat In games with a true final boss victory leads to either a better ending or a more detailed version of the regular ending Examples of a true final boss include the Radiance in Hollow Knight and the Moon Presence in Bloodborne br The term Foozle is used to describe a clich final boss that exists only to act as the final problem before players can complete the game Scorpia stated in that about of all role playing video games can be summed up as follows We go out and bash on critters until we re strong enough to go bash on Foozle br br br History br A precursor to video game boss fights is Bruce Lee s Hong Kong martial arts films including The Big Boss in which Lee fights a criminal gang before battling the eponymous big boss and Game of Death where Lee fights a different boss on each level of a pagoda which later inspired the boss battles of martial arts action games such as beat em ups Another precursor is tabletop role playing games starting with Dungeons Dragons in which in a typical dungeon campaign there would be one powerful enemy acting as the boss of the weaker minions that players would face beforehand in the same sense as a crime boss which later inspired the boss battles of role playing video games br The first interactive video game to feature a boss was dnd which was released in for the PLATO system dnd was one of the earliest dungeon crawl video games and implemented many of the core concepts of Dungeons Dragons The objective of the game is to retrieve an Orb from the bottommost dungeon The orb is kept in a treasure room guarded by a high level enemy named the Gold Dragon Only by defeating the Dragon can players claim the orb complete the game and be eligible to appear on the high score list br In boss battles appeared in several arcade action games In March Sega released Samurai a jidaigeki themed martial arts action game where player samurai fight a number of swordspeople before confronting a more powerful boss samurai SNK s Sasuke vs Commander released in October is a ninja themed shooting game where the player character fights enemy ninjas before confronting bosses with various ninjutsu attacks and enemy patterns It was one of the earliest games with multiple boss encounters and one of SNK s earliest games Phoenix released in December is a fixed shooter where players s ship must fight a giant mothership in the fifth and final level At several points in Namco s vertically scrolling shooter Xevious players must defeat an Andor Genesis mothership to advance br In side scrolling character action games such as beat em ups Irem s arcade game Kung Fu Master established the end of level boss battle structure used in these games with players progressing through levels represented by floors of a temple and fighting a boss character at the end of each level in turn this end of level boss battle structure was adapted from the Bruce Lee film Game of Death where Lee s character fights a different boss character on each floor as he ascends a pagoda The game was distinctive for giving both players and each boss a health meter which leads to the game temporarily becoming a one on one fighting game during boss battles a concept that Kung Fu Master designer Takashi Nishiyama later expanded on when he created the fighting game Street Fighter at Capcom The term boss was used in reference to the game s final boss by Mike Roberts in a review of the game published in the May issue of British magazine Computer Gamer while he used the term super baddies for the end of level bosses br Sega s arcade game Fantasy Zone popularized the concept of a boss rush a stage where players face multiple previous bosses again in succession br br br Etymology br Michael Fahey of Kotaku noted in a podcast that usage of the term boss by Nintendo Power grew sharply around and that there was no clear single etymology of the term In the same podcast former Kotaku editor in chief Stephen Totilo speculated that bosses became known as such because they were in charge of all the enemies br br br See also br br Glossary of video
