title: Process design
id: 3060044
In chemical engineering process design is the choice and sequencing of units for desired physical and or chemical transformation of materials Process design is central to chemical engineering and it can be considered to be the summit of that field bringing together all of the field s components br Process design can be the design of new facilities or it can be the modification or expansion of existing facilities The design starts at a conceptual level and ultimately ends in the form of fabrication and construction plans br Process design is distinct from equipment design which is closer in spirit to the design of unit operations Processes often include many unit operations br br br Documentation br Process design documents serve to define the design and they ensure that the design components fit together They are useful in communicating ideas and plans to other engineers involved with the design to external regulatory agencies to equipment vendors and to construction contractors br In order of increasing detail process design documents include br br Block flow diagrams BFD Very simple diagrams composed of rectangles and lines indicating major material or energy flows br Process flow diagrams PFD Typically more complex diagrams of major unit operations as well as flow lines They usually include a material balance and sometimes an energy balance showing typical or design flowrates stream compositions and stream and equipment pressures and temperatures It is the key document in process design br Piping and instrumentation diagrams P ID Diagrams showing each and every pipeline with piping class carbon steel or stainless steel and pipe size diameter They also show valving along with instrument locations and process control schemes br Specifications Written design requirements of all major equipment items br Process designers typically write operating manuals on how to start up operate and shut down the process They often also develop accident plans and projections of process operation on the environment br Documents are maintained after construction of the process facility for the operating personnel to refer to The documents also are useful when modifications to the facility are planned br A primary method of developing the process documents is process flowsheeting br br br Design considerations br There are several considerations that need to be made when designing any chemical process unit Design conceptualization and considerations can begin once product purities yields and throughput rates are all defined br Objectives that a design may strive to include br br Throughput rate br Process yield br Product purity br Constraints include br br Capital cost the amount of budget or investment to construct end to end process br Available space the area of the land to build the plant br Safety concerns consideration towards risk analysis on industrial accidents or hazardous chemicals br Environmental impact and projected effluents and emissions br Waste production recycling manage waste produced as side product of the process for not to harm the surroundings br Operating and maintenance costs represent the variable cost of the operational of the plant br Other factors that designers may include are br br Reliability br Redundancy br Flexibility br Anticipated variability in feed stock and allowable variability in product br br br Sources of design information br Designers usually do not start from scratch especially for complex projects Often the engineers have pilot plant data available or data from full scale operating facilities Other sources of information include proprietary design criteria provided by process licensors published scientific data laboratory experiments and suppliers of feedstocks and utilities br br br Design process br Design starts with process synthesis the choice of technology and combinations of industrial units to achieve goals More detailed design proceeds as other engineers and stakeholders sign off on each stage conceptual to detailed design br Simulation software is often used by design engineers Simulations can identify weaknesses in designs and allow engineers to choose better alternatives However engineers still rely on heuristics intuition and experience when designing a process Human creativity is an element in
