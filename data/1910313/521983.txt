Capture the Flag CTF is a traditional outdoor sport where two or more teams each have a flag or other markers and the objective is to capture the other team s flag located at the team s base or hidden or even buried somewhere in the territory and bring it safely back to their own base Enemy players can be tagged by players when out of their home territory and depending on the rules they may be out of the game become members of the opposite team be sent back to their own territory be frozen in place or be sent to jail until freed by a member of their own team br br br Overview br Capture the Flag requires a playing field In both indoor and outdoor versions the field is divided into two clearly designated halves known as territories Players form two teams one for each territory Each side has a flag which is most often a piece of fabric but can be any object small enough to be easily carried by a person night time games might use flashlights glowsticks or lanterns as the flags Sometimes teams wear dark colors at night to make it more difficult for their opponents to see them br The objective of the game is for players to venture into the opposing team s territory grab the flag and return with it to their territory without being tagged The flag is defended mainly by tagging opposing players who attempt to take it Within their territory players are safe meaning that they cannot be tagged by opposing players Once they cross into the opposing team s territory they are vulnerable to tagging br Rules for Capture the Flag appear in in the German gymnastic manual Lehr und Handbuch der deutschen Turnkunst by Wilhelm L beck under the name Fahnenbarlauf In the th century Capture the Flag was not considered a distinct game but a variation of the European game Barlaufen Barlauf mit Fahnenraub played in France and Germany br Descriptions of Capture the Flag in English appeared in the early th century e g in Scouting for Boys written in by Robert Baden Powell the founder of the Scouting Movement under the title Flag Raiding They also appeared in the Edition of The Official Handbook for Boys published by the Boy Scouts of America br The flag is usually placed in a visibly obvious location at the rear of a team s territory In a more difficult version the flag is hidden in a place where it can only be seen from certain angles Capturing the flag also might require completing some challenge For example the flag could be hidden in the leaves up in a tall tree and the players have to see the flag then knock it out and bring it to their base br br br Jail br The rules for jail vary from game to game and deal with what happens if a player is tagged in the other team s territory Either each team can decide a designated area for the other team s players to go to when tagged or a single jail can be used for both teams When tagged a player should be trusted to go to jail on their own or should need to be escorted depending on the game Players can leave the jail after a certain time for example three minutes or can leave early if tagged by a teammate Depending on the game players can be released on the way to jail or may have to be in jail before being released br br br Capturing the flag br br The rules for the handling of the flag also vary from game to game and deal mostly with the disposition of the flag after a failed attempt at capturing it In one variant after a player is tagged while carrying the flag it is returned to its original place In another variant the flag is left in the location where the player was tagged This latter variant makes offensive play easier as the flag will tend over the course of the game to be moved closer to the dividing line between territories In some games it is possible for the players to throw the flag to teammates As long as the flag stays in play without hitting the ground the players are allowed to pass it br When the flag is captured by one player they re not safe from being tagged unless they trip Sometimes the flag holder may not be safe at all even in their home territory until they obtain both flags thus ending the game Their goal is to return to their own side or hand it off to a teammate who will then carry it to the other side In most versions the flag may be handed off while running The game is won when a player returns to their own territory with the enemy flag or both teams flags Also rarely the flag carrier may not attempt to free any of their teammates from jail br br br Variants br Alterations may include one flag Capture the Flag in which there is a defensive team and an offensive team or games with three or more flags In the case of the latter one can only win when all flags are captured br Another variation is when the players put bandannas in their pockets with about six inches sticking out Instead of tagging opponents players must pull their opponent s bandanna out of their pocket No matter where a player is when their bandanna is pulled they re captured and must either go to jail or return to their base before returning to play In this version there is no team territory only a small base where the team s flag is kept To win one team must have both of the flags in their base br In some urban settings the game is played indoors in an enclosed area with walls There is also an area in the opposing ends for the flag to be placed in In this urban variation legal checking as in hockey including against the sideboards is allowed A player who commits a foul or illegal check is placed in a penalty box for a specified amount of time depending on the severity of the foul A player who deliberately injures an opponent is expelled from the rest of the game Throwing the flag is allowed in this variation as long as the flag is caught before it hits the ground If the flag is thrown to a teammate but hits the ground before it can be caught the flag is placed from the spot of the throw If a player throws the flag but is blocked or intercepted by a player from the opposing team the flag is placed back at the base br New technologies have also led to a glow in the dark version of Capture the Flag called Capture the Flag REDUX that includes two glowing orbs as the flags color coded LED bracelets to differentiate team members and glowing jail markers br It is not uncommon for people to play airsoft paintball or Nerf variations of Capture the Flag Typically there are no territories in these versions Players who are hit must sit out a predetermined amount of time before returning to play respawning br br br Stealing sticks br Stealing sticks is a similar game played in the British Isles the United States and Australia However instead of a flag a number of sticks or other items such as coats or hats are placed in a goal on the far end of each side of the playing field or area As in Capture the Flag players are sent to a prison if tagged on the opponents side and may be freed by teammates Each player may only take one of their opponents sticks at a time The first team to take all of the opponents sticks to their own side wins br br br Software and games br br In Scholastic published Bannercatch for the Apple II and Commodore computers An edutainment game with recognizable capture the flag mechanics Bannercatch allows up to two humans each alternating between two characters in the game world to play capture the flag against an increasingly difficult team of four AI bots Bannercatch s game world is divided into quadrants home enemy and two no mans land areas which hold the jails A successful capture requires bringing the enemy flag into one team s home quadrant Players can be captured when in an enemy territory or in no mans land while holding a flag Captured players must be rescued from their designated jail by one of the other members of the team Fallen flags remain where they dropped until a time out period elapses after which the flag returns to one of several starting locations in home territory The D map also features walls trees and a moving river enabling a wide variety of strategies Special locations in the play area allow humans to query the game state such as flag status using binary messages br In Richard Carr released an MS DOS based game called Capture the Flag It is a turn based strategy game with real time network modem play or play by mail based around the traditional outdoor game The game required players to merely move one of their characters onto the same square as their opponent s flag as opposed to bringing it back to friendly territory because of difficulties implementing the artificial intelligence that the computer player would have needed to bring the enemy flag home and intercept opposing characters carrying the flag

competitors attack defense style CTFs or from the organizers jeopardy style challenges Several variations exist including hiding flags in hardware devices br br br Urban gaming br Capture the Flag is among the games that made a comeback among adults in the early st century as part of the urban gaming trend which includes games like Pac Manhattan Fugitive Unreal Tournament and Manhunt The game is played on city streets and players use cellphones to communicate News about the games spreads virally through the use of blogs and mailing lists Urban Capture the Flag has been played in cities throughout North America One long running example occurs on the Northrop Mall at the University of Minnesota on Fridays with typical attendance ranging from to several hundred br br br See also br
