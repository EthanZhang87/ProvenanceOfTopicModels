Mechanism design is a branch of economics social choice and game theory that deals with designing games or mechanisms that implement a given social choice function Because it starts with the end of the game an optimal result and then works backwards to find a game that implements it it is sometimes described as a kind of reverse game theory br Mechanism design has broad applications including traditional domains of economics such as market design but also political science through voting theory and even networked systems such as in inter domain routing br Mechanism design studies solution concepts for a class of private information games Leonid Hurwicz explains that in a design problem the goal function is the main given while the mechanism is the unknown Therefore the design problem is the inverse of traditional economic theory which is typically devoted to the analysis of the performance of a given mechanism br The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Leonid Hurwicz Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory The related works of William Vickrey that established the field earned him the Nobel prize br br br Intuition br In an interesting class of Bayesian games one player called the principal would like to condition his behavior on information privately known to other players For example the principal would like to know the true quality of a used car a salesman is pitching He cannot learn anything simply by asking the salesman because it is in the salesman s interest to distort the truth However in mechanism design the principal does have one advantage He may design a game whose rules influence others to act the way he would like br Without mechanism design theory the principal s problem would be difficult to solve He would have to consider all the possible games and choose the one that best influences other players tactics In addition the principal would have to draw conclusions from agents who may lie to him Thanks to the revelation principle the principal only needs to consider games in which agents truthfully report their private information br br br Foundations br br br Mechanism br A game of mechanism design is a game of private information in which one of the agents called the principal chooses the payoff structure Following Harsanyi the agents receive secret messages from nature containing information relevant to payoffs For example a message may contain information about their preferences or the quality of a good for sale We call this information the agent s type usually noted br br br br br br br displaystyle theta br br and accordingly the space of types br br br br br br br displaystyle Theta br br Agents then report a type to the principal usually noted with a hat br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle hat theta br br that can be a strategic lie After the report the principal and the agents are paid according to the payoff structure the principal chose br The timing of the game is br br The principal commits to a mechanism br br br br y br br br br br displaystyle y br br that grants an outcome br br br br y br br br displaystyle y br br as a function of reported type br The agents report possibly dishonestly a type profile br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle hat theta br br br The mechanism is executed agents receive outcome br br br br y br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle y hat theta br br br In order to understand who gets what it is common to divide the outcome br br br br y br br br displaystyle y br br into a goods allocation and a money transfer br br br br y br br br br br br x br br br br br t br br br br br br br x br br X br br t br br T br br br displaystyle y theta x theta t theta x in X t in T br br where br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br stands for an allocation of goods rendered or received as a function of type and br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br stands for a monetary transfer as a function of type br As a benchmark the designer often defines what would happen under full information Define a social choice function br br br br f br br br br br br displaystyle f theta br br mapping the true type profile directly to the allocation of goods received or rendered br br br br br f br br br br br br br X br br br displaystyle f theta Theta rightarrow X br br br In contrast a mechanism maps the reported type profile to an outcome again both a goods allocation br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br and a money transfer br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br br br br br br y br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Y br br br displaystyle y hat theta Theta rightarrow Y br br br br Revelation principle br br A proposed mechanism constitutes a Bayesian game a game of private information and if it is well behaved the game has a Bayesian Nash equilibrium At equilibrium agents choose their reports strategically as a function of type br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle hat theta theta br br br It is difficult to solve for Bayesian equilibria in such a setting because it involves solving for agents best response strategies and for the best inference from a possible strategic lie Thanks to a sweeping result called the revelation principle no matter the mechanism a designer can confine attention to equilibria in which agents truthfully report type The revelation principle states To every Bayesian Nash equilibrium there corresponds a Bayesian game with the same equilibrium outcome but in which players truthfully report type br This is extremely useful The principle allows one to solve for a Bayesian equilibrium by assuming all players truthfully report type subject to an incentive compatibility constraint In one blow it eliminates the need to consider either strategic behavior or lying br Its proof is quite direct Assume a Bayesian game in which the agent s strategy and payoff are functions of its type and what others do br br br br br u br br i br br br br br br br s br br i br br br br br br br i br br br br br br s br br br i

agents of course find it optimal to reveal type since the mechanism plays the strategies they found optimal anyway Formally choose br br br br y br br br br br br displaystyle y theta br br such that

theta br br This is a necessary condition and is derived from the first and second order conditions of the agent s optimization problem assuming truth telling br Its meaning can be understood in two pieces The first piece says the agent s marginal rate of substitution MRS increases as a function of the type br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br u br br br br br br x br br k

a better deal Otherwise higher types facing any mechanism that punishes high types for reporting will lie and declare they are lower types violating the truthtelling IC constraint The second piece is a monotonicity condition waiting to happen br br br br br br br br br x br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle frac partial x partial theta br br br which to be positive means higher types must be given more of the good br There is potential for the two pieces to interact If for some type range the contract offered less quantity to higher types br br br br br x br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle partial x partial theta br br it is possible the mechanism could compensate by giving higher types a discount But such a contract already exists for low type agents so this solution is pathological Such a solution sometimes occurs in the process of solving for a mechanism In these cases it must be ironed In a multiple good environment it is also possible for the designer to reward the agent with more of one good to substitute for less of another e g butter for margarine Multiple good mechanisms are an ongoing problem in mechanism design theory br br br Sufficiency br Mechanism design papers usually make two assumptions to ensure implementability br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br u br br br br br br x br br k br br br br br br br br u br br br br br t br

of the MRS br These assumptions are sufficient to provide that any monotonic br br br br x br br br br br br displaystyle x theta br br is implementable a br br br br t br br br br br br displaystyle t theta br br exists that can implement it In addition in the single good setting the single crossing condition is sufficient to provide that only a monotonic br br br br x br br br br br br displaystyle x theta br br is implementable so the designer can confine his search to a monotonic br br br br x br br br br br br displaystyle x theta br br br br br Highlighted results br br br Revenue equivalence theorem br br Vickrey gives a celebrated result that any member of a large class of auctions assures the seller of the same expected revenue and that the expected revenue is the best the seller can do This is the case if br br The buyers have identical valuation functions which may be a function of type br The buyers types are independently distributed br The buyers types are drawn from a continuous distribution br The type distribution bears the monotone hazard rate property br The mechanism sells the good to the buyer with the highest valuation br The last condition is crucial to the theorem An implication is that for the seller to achieve higher revenue he must take a chance on giving the item to an agent with a lower valuation Usually this means he must risk not selling the item at all br br br Vickrey Clarke Groves mechanisms br br The Vickrey auction model was later expanded by Clarke and Groves to treat a public choice problem in which a public project s cost is borne by all agents e g whether to build a municipal bridge The resulting Vickrey Clarke Groves mechanism can motivate agents to choose the socially efficient allocation of the public good even if agents have privately known valuations In other words it can solve the tragedy of the commons under certain conditions in particular quasilinear utility or if budget balance is not required br Consider a setting in which br br br br I br br br displaystyle I br br number of agents have quasilinear utility with private valuations br br br br v br br x br br t br br br br br br displaystyle v x t theta br br where the currency br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br is valued linearly The VCG designer designs an incentive compatible hence truthfully implementable mechanism to obtain the true type profile from which the designer implements the socially optimal allocation br br br br br br x br br I br br br br br br br br br br br br argmax br br x br br X br br br br br br br i br br I br br br v br br x br br br br br i br br br br br br displaystyle x I theta in underset x in X operatorname argmax sum i in I v x theta i br br br The cleverness of the VCG mechanism is the way it motivates truthful revelation It eliminates incentives to misreport by penalizing any agent by the cost of the distortion he causes Among the reports the agent may make the VCG mechanism permits a null report saying he is indifferent to the public good and cares only about the money transfer This effectively removes the agent from the game If an agent does choose to report a type the VCG mechanism charges the agent a fee if his report is pivotal that is if his report changes the optimal allocation x so as to harm other agents The payment is calculated br br br br br br t br br i

general class of games only dictatorial social choice functions can be implemented br A social choice function f is dictatorial if one agent always receives his most favored goods allocation br br br

and probabilistically varying valuations for it without the risk of forcing one party to trade at a loss It is among the most remarkable negative results in economics a kind of negative mirror to the fundamental theorems of welfare economics br br br Shapley value br br Phillips and Marden proved that for cost sharing games with concave cost functions the optimal cost sharing rule that firstly optimizes the worst case inefficiencies in a game the price of anarchy and then secondly optimizes the best case outcomes the price of stability is precisely the Shapley value cost sharing rule A symmetrical statement is similarly valid for utility sharing games with convex utility functions br br br Examples br br br Price discrimination br Mirrlees introduces a setting in which the transfer function t is easy to solve for Due to its relevance and tractability it is a common setting in the literature Consider a single good single agent setting in which the agent has quasilinear utility

principal here is a monopolist trying to set a profit maximizing price scheme in which it cannot identify the type of the customer A common example is an airline setting fares for business leisure and student travelers Due to the IR condition it has to give every type a good enough deal to induce participation Due to the IC condition it has to give every type a good enough deal that the type prefers its deal to that of any other br A trick given by Mirrlees is to use the envelope theorem to eliminate the transfer function from the expectation to be maximized br br br br br br let br br U

the designer can drop the IC constraint If the utility function satisfies the Spence Mirrlees condition then a monotonic br br br br x br br br br br br displaystyle x theta br br function exists The IR constraint can be checked at equilibrium and the fee schedule raised or lowered accordingly Additionally note the presence of a hazard rate in the expression If the type distribution bears the monotone hazard ratio property the FOC is sufficient to solve for t If not then it is necessary to check whether the monotonicity constraint see sufficiency above is satisfied everywhere along the allocation and fee schedules If not then the designer must use Myerson ironing br br br Myerson ironing br br In some applications the designer may solve the first order conditions for the price and allocation schedules yet find they are not monotonic For example in the quasilinear setting this often happens when the hazard ratio is itself not monotone By the Spence Mirrlees condition the optimal price and allocation schedules must be monotonic so the designer must eliminate any interval over which the schedule changes direction by flattening it br Intuitively what is going on is the designer finds it optimal to bunch certain types together and give them the same contract Normally the designer motivates higher types to distinguish themselves by giving them a better deal If there are insufficiently few higher types on the margin the designer does not find it worthwhile to grant lower types a concession called their information rent in order to charge higher types a type specific contract br Consider a monopolist principal selling to agents with quasilinear utility the example above Suppose the allocation schedule br br br br x br br br br br br displaystyle x theta br br
