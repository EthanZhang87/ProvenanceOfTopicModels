id: 28123
A sniper is a military paramilitary marksman who engages targets from positions of concealment or at distances exceeding the target s detection capabilities Snipers generally have specialized training and are equipped with telescopic sights Modern snipers use high precision rifles and high magnification optics They often also serve as scouts observers feeding tactical information back to their units or command headquarters br In addition to long range and high grade marksmanship military snipers are trained in a variety of special operation techniques detection stalking target range estimation methods camouflage tracking bushcraft field craft infiltration special reconnaissance and observation surveillance and target acquisition Snipers need to have complete control of their bodies and senses in order to be effective They also need to have the skill set to use data from their scope and monitors to adjust their aim to hit targets that are extremely far away In training snipers are given charts that they re drilled on to ensure they can make last minute calculations when they are in the field br br br Etymology br The name sniper comes from the verb to snipe which originated in the s among soldiers in British India in reference to shooting snipes a wader that was considered an extremely challenging game bird for hunters due to its alertness camouflaging color and erratic flight behavior Snipe hunters therefore needed to be stealthy in addition to being good trackers and marksmen In the th century letters sent home by English officers in India referred to a day s rough shooting as going sniping as it took a skilled flintlock sportsman a lot of patience and endurance to wing shoot a snipe in flight Accomplishing such a shot was regarded as exceptional During the late th century the term snipe shooting was simplified to sniping This evolved to the agent noun sniper first appearing by the s The term sniper was first attested militarily in becoming commonplace in the First World War br The older term sharpshooter comes from the calque of German word Scharfsch tze in use by British newspapers as early as The word alludes to good marksmanship itself descendent of the shooting competitions Sch tzenfeste that took place throughout the year in Munich in the th century Small companies of shooters Sch tzenf hnlein from the German states and Swiss cantons would form teams of Scharfsch tzen for such popular competitions proudly carrying flags depicting a crossbow on one side and a target musket on the other The earliest known date for the creation of a shooting club formed specifically for the use of firearms comes from Lucerne Switzerland where one club has a charter dating from During the American Civil War Confederate marksmen equipped with the imported Whitworth rifles were known as the Whitworth Sharpshooters br Snipers are also called hunters in many languages due to the nature of the craft with the hunting horn also being a symbol of marksmanship being called ca adores chasseurs and J ger Other words for sniper include franc tireur tireur d lite and atirador de escol Completely different and peculiar is the Italian term cecchino t ek ki no in common use since First World War The term cecchino is derived from Cecco Beppe familiarly and mockingly referring to the Austro Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph I in Italian Francesco Giuseppe I Cecco and Beppe are nicknames for Francesco and Giuseppe respectively br br br Modern warfare br br br Military doctrine br Different countries use different military doctrines regarding snipers in military units settings and tactics br A sniper s primary function in modern warfare is to stay concealed at all times and avoid detection Then from long range to provide detailed surveillance from a concealed position and if necessary to reduce the enemy s combat ability by neutralizing high value targets especially officers and other key personnel and in the process cause disruption pinning down and demoralizing the enemy Typical sniper missions include managing intelligence information they gather during reconnaissance target acquisition and impact feedback for air strikes and artillery assisting employed combat force with accurate fire support and counter sniper tactics killing enemy commanders selecting targets of opportunity and even destruction of military equipment which tend to require use of anti materiel rifles in the larger calibers such as the BMG like the Barrett M McMillan Tac and Denel NTW br Soviet and Russian derived military doctrines include squad level snipers Snipers have increasingly been demonstrated as useful by US and UK forces in the recent Iraq campaign in a fire support role to cover the movement of infantry especially in urban areas br Military snipers from the US UK and other countries that adopt their military doctrine are typically deployed in two man sniper teams consisting of a shooter and a spotter A common practice is for a shooter and a spotter to take turns to avoid eye fatigue In most recent combat operations occurring in large densely populated towns such as Fallujah Iraq two teams would be deployed together to increase their security and effectiveness in an urban environment A sniper team would be armed with a long range weapon and a rapid firing shorter ranged weapon in case of close quarter combat br The German doctrine of largely independent snipers and emphasis on concealment developed during the Second World War has been most influential on modern sniper tactics and is currently used throughout Western militaries examples are specialized camouflage clothing concealment in terrain and emphasis on coup d il br br br Sniper teams br br Sniper rifles are classified as crew served in the United States military A sniper team or sniper cell consists of a combination of at least one primary weapon operator ie the shooter with other support personnel and force protection elements such as a spotter or a flanker Within the Table of Organization and Equipment for both the United States Army and Marine Corps the shooter does not operate alone but has a backup shooter trained to fulfill multiple roles in addition to being sniper qualified in the operation of the main weapon br The shooter focuses mainly on firing the shot while the spotter assists in observation of targets accounts for atmospheric conditions and handles ancillary tasks as immediate security of their location communication with other parties e g directing artillery fire and close air support A flanker is an extra teammate who is tasked to act as a sentry observing areas not immediately visible to the sniper and spotter assisting with the team s rear security and perimeter defense and therefore are usually armed with a faster firing weapon such as an assault rifle battle rifle or designated marksman rifle Both the spotter and flanker carry additional ammunition and associated equipment br The spotter is responsible for detecting identifying and assigning priority of targets for the shooter as well as assessing the outcome of the shot Using a spotting scope and or a rangefinder the spotter will predict the external ballistics and read the wind speed using an anemometer or physical indicators like the mirage caused by ground heat Also in conjunction with the shooter the spotter will calculate the distance shooting angle slant range mil related correction interference by atmospheric factors and the required leads for moving targets It is not unusual for the spotter to be equipped with a ballistic table a notebook or a tablet computer specifically for performing these calculations br br br Law enforcement applications br br Law enforcement snipers commonly called police snipers and military snipers differ in many ways including their areas of operation and tactics A police sharpshooter is part of a police operation and usually takes part in relatively short missions Police forces typically deploy such sharpshooters in hostage scenarios This differs from a military sniper who operates as part of a larger army engaged in warfare Sometimes as part of a SWAT team police snipers are deployed alongside negotiators and an assault team trained for close quarters combat As policemen they are trained to shoot only as a last resort when there is a direct threat to life the police sharpshooter has a well known rule Be prepared to take a life to save a life Police snipers typically operate at much shorter ranges than military snipers generally under meters yd and sometimes even less than meters yd Both types of snipers do make difficult shots under pressure and often perform one shot kills br br Police units that are unequipped for tactical operations may rely on a specialized SWAT team which may have a dedicated sniper Some police sniper operations begin with military assistance Police snipers placed in vantage points such as high buildings can provide security for events In one high profile incident commonly referred to as The Shot Seen Around the World due to going viral online Mike Plumb a SWAT sniper in Columbus Ohio prevented a suicide by shooting a revolver out of the individual s hand leaving him unharmed br br The need for specialized training for police sharpshooters was made apparent in during the Munich massacre when the German police could not deploy specialized personnel or equipment during the standoff at the airport in the closing phase of the crisis and consequently all of the Israeli hostages were killed While the German army did have snipers in the use of army snipers in the scenario was impossible due to the German constitution s explicit prohibition of the use of the military in domestic matters This lack of trained snipers who could be used in civilian roles was later addressed with the founding of the specialized police counter terrorist unit GSG br br br Longest recorded sniper kill br br The longest confirmed sniper kill in combat was achieved by an undisclosed member of the Security Service of Ukraine in November hitting a Russian soldier at a distance of m yd during the Russian invasion of Ukraine br The previous record holder was a member of the Canadian JTF special forces who in June achieved a hit at a distance of m yd br br In November Craig Harrison a Corporal of Horse CoH in the Blues and Royals RHG D of the British Army struck two Taliban machine gunners consecutively south of Musa Qala in Helmand Province in Afghanistan at a range of m yd or miles using a L A Long Range Rifle br The QTU Lapua external ballistics software using continuous doppler drag coefficient Cd data provided by Lapua predicts that such shots traveling m yd

the original bore line Due to the extreme distances and travel time involved even a light cross breeze of m s mph would have diverted such shots m in off target which would have required compensation

for long range shooting no wind mild weather clear visibility In a BBC interview Harrison reported it took about nine shots for him and his spotter to initially range the target successfully br br br Military history br Before the development of rifling firearms were smoothbore and inaccurate over long distance Barrel rifling was invented at the end of the fifteenth century but was only employed in large cannons Over time rifling along with other gunnery advances has increased the performance of modern firearms br br br br Marksmanship later sharpshooting or sniping occurred as early as the mid eighteenth century br For instance in the Appin Murder Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure was shot in the back near Duror by an unknown sniper most likely from within Clan Stewart of Appin in retaliation for Campbell s role in an early version of the Highland Clearances the mass eviction of Stewart clansmen and their replacement by members of Clan Campbell br Hunting terminology was quickly adapted to warfare by British soldiers In a letter a soldier described enemies firing very accurately br br in erecting our batteries the people frequently play tricks by putting a hat with a cockade in it on a spunge staff which the enemy fire at and often hit to the diversion of the soldiery who humorously call it sniping and watch the flash to return the fire br On September during the Battle of Brandywine British Captain Patrick Ferguson had a tall distinguished American officer in his rifle s iron sights Ferguson did not take the shot as he considered shooting anyone in the back dishonourable Only later did Ferguson learn that George Washington had been on the battlefield that day br At the Battles of Saratoga Morgan s Riflemen hid in the trees and used early model rifles to shoot senior British officers Most notably Timothy Murphy shot and killed General Simon Fraser of Balnain on October at a distance of about yards br In early Colonel Coote Manningham and Lieutenant Colonel the Hon William Stewart of the British Army proposed using what they had learned while leading light infantry to establish a special unit of marksmen Subsequently raised as the Experimental Corps of Riflemen they were armed with the formidable Baker rifle rather than the inaccurate smoothbore muskets used by most troops at that time Through the combination of a leather wad and tight grooves on the inside of the barrel rifling this weapon was far more accurate though slower to load On August three companies under the command of Stewart spearheaded an amphibious landing at Ferrol Spain br br br br The term sharp shooter was in use in British newspapers as early as In the Edinburgh Advertiser June can be found the following quote in a piece about the North British Militia This Regiment has several Field Pieces and two companies of Sharp Shooters which are very necessary in the modern Stile of War The term appears even earlier around in Continental Europe translated from the German Scharfsch tze br Scouts in the Ashanti army were made up of professional hunters who used their skill as marksmen to snipe at advancing enemy forces in response to detection by the enemy They executed this often from a perch high in trees br The Whitworth rifle was arguably the first long range sniper rifle in the world A muzzleloader designed by Sir Joseph Whitworth a prominent British engineer it used polygonal rifling instead which meant that the projectile did not have to bite into grooves as was done with conventional rifling The Whitworth rifle was far more accurate than the Pattern Enfield which had shown some weaknesses during the recent Crimean War At trials in which tested the accuracy and range of both weapons Whitworth s design outperformed the Enfield at a rate of about three to one The Whitworth rifle was capable of hitting the target at a range of yards whereas the Enfield could only manage it at yards br During the Crimean War the first optical sights were designed to fit onto rifles Much of this pioneering work was the brainchild of Colonel D Davidson using optical sights produced by Chance Brothers of Birmingham This allowed a marksman to observe and target objects more accurately at a greater distance than ever before The telescopic sight or scope was originally fixed and could not be adjusted which therefore limited its range br Despite its success at the trials the rifle was not adopted by the British Army However the Whitworth Rifle Company was able to sell the weapon to the French army and also to the Confederacy during the American Civil War where both the Union and Confederate armies employed sharpshooters The most notable incident was during the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House where on May Union General John Sedgwick was killed by a Confederate Whitworth sharpshooter at a range of about yards meters after saying the enemy couldn t hit an elephant at this distance br br br Second Boer War br br During the Boer War the latest breech loading rifled guns with magazines and smokeless powder were used by both sides The British were equipped with the Lee Metford rifle while the Boers had received the latest Mauser rifles from Germany In the open terrain of South Africa the marksmen were a crucial component to the outcome of the battle br The first British sniper unit began life as the Lovat Scouts a Scottish Highland regiment formed in that earned high praise during the Second Boer War The unit was formed by Lord Lovat and reported to an American Major Frederick Russell Burnham the British Army Chief of Scouts under Lord Roberts Burnham fittingly described these scouts as half wolf and half jackrabbit Just like their Boer scout opponents these scouts were well practised in the arts of marksmanship field craft map reading observation and military tactics They were skilled woodsmen and practitioners of discretion He who shoots and runs away lives to shoot another day They were also the first known military unit to wear a ghillie suit br Hesketh Hesketh Prichard said of them that keener men never lived and that Burnham was the greatest scout of our time Burnham distinguished himself in wars in South Africa Rhodesia and in Arizona fighting the Apaches and his definitive work Scouting on Two Continents provides a dramatic and enlightening picture of what a sniper was at the time and how he operated br After the war this regiment went on to formally become the first official sniper unit then better known as sharpshooters br br br World War I br br During World War I snipers appeared as deadly sharpshooters in the trenches At the start of the war only Imperial Germany had troops that were issued scoped sniper rifles Although sharpshooters existed on all sides the Germans specially equipped some of their soldiers with scoped rifles that could pick off enemy soldiers showing their heads out of their trench At first the French and British believed such hits to be coincidental hits until the German scoped rifles were discovered During World War I the German army received a reputation for the deadliness and efficiency of its snipers partly because of the high quality lenses that German industry could manufacture br During the First World War the static movement of trench warfare and a need for protection from snipers created a requirement for loopholes both for discharging firearms and for observation Often a steel plate was used with a key hole which had a rotating piece to cover the loophole when not in use br br Soon the British army began to train their own snipers in specialized sniper schools Major Hesketh Hesketh Prichard was given formal permission to begin sniper training in and founded the First Army School of Sniping Observation and Scouting at Linghem in France in Starting with a first class of only six in time he was able to lecture to large numbers of soldiers from different Allied nations proudly proclaiming in a letter that his school was turning out snipers at three times the rate of any such other school in the world br He also devised a metal armoured double loophole that would protect the sniper observer from enemy fire The front loophole was fixed but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves Only when the two loopholes were lined up a one to twenty chance could an enemy shoot between them Another innovation was the use of a dummy head to find the location of an enemy sniper The papier m ch figures were painted to resemble soldiers to draw sniper fire Some were equipped with rubber surgical tubing so the dummy could smoke a cigarette and thus appear realistic Holes punched in the dummy by enemy sniper bullets then could be used for triangulation purposes to determine the position of the enemy sniper who could then be attacked with artillery fire He developed many of the modern techniques in sniping including the use of spotting scopes and working in pairs and using Kim s Game to train observational skills br In he wrote his account of his war time activities in his book Sniping in France to which reference is still made by modern authors regarding the subject br The main sniper rifles used during the First World War were the German Mauser Gewehr the British Pattern Enfield and Lee Enfield SMLE Mk III the Canadian Ross rifle the American M Springfield the Italian M Carcano and the Russian M Mosin Nagant br br br World War II br br During the interbellum most nations dropped their specialized sniper units notably the Germans Effectiveness and dangers of snipers once again came to the fore during the Spanish Civil War The only nation that had specially trained sniper units during the s was the Soviet Union Soviet snipers were trained in their skills as marksmen in using the terrain to hide themselves from the enemy and the ability to work alongside regular forces This made the Soviet sniper training focus more on normal combat situations than those of other nations br Snipers reappeared as important factors on the battlefield from the first campaign of World War II During Germany s campaigns lone well hidden French and British snipers were able to halt the German advance for a considerable amount of time For example during the pursuit to Dunkirk British snipers were able to significantly delay the German infantry s advance This prompted the British once again to increase training of specialized sniper units Apart from marksmanship British snipers were trained to blend in with the environment often by using special camouflage clothing for concealment However because the British Army offered sniper training exclusively to officers and non commissioned officers the resulting small number of trained snipers in combat units considerably reduced their overall effectiveness br During the Winter War Finnish snipers took a heavy toll of the invading Red Army Simo H yh is credited with confirmed kills most with the Finnish version of the iron sighted bolt action Mosin Nagant The most successful German sniper was Matth us Hetzenauer with confirmed kills In Germany confirmed kills are only valid in the presence of an officer so Hetzenauer s estimated kills are many times higher His longest confirmed kill was reported at meters yards Hetzenauer received the Knight s Cross of the Iron Cross on April br br One of the best known battles involving snipers and the battle that made the Germans reinstate their specialized sniper training was the Battle of Stalingrad Their defensive position inside a city filled with rubble meant that Soviet snipers were able to inflict significant casualties on the Wehrmacht troops Because of the nature of fighting in city rubble snipers were very hard to spot and seriously dented the morale of the German attackers The best known of these snipers was probably Vasily Zaytsev featured in the novel War of the Rats and the subsequent film Enemy at the Gates br German Scharfsch tzen were prepared before the war equipped with Karabiner and later Gewehr rifles but there were often not enough of these weapons available and as such some were armed with captured scoped Mosin Nagant SVT Czech Mauser rifles or scoped Gewehr from WW The Wehrmacht re established its sniper training in drastically increasing the number of snipers per unit with the creation of an additional sniper training companies by German snipers were at the time the only snipers in the world issued with purpose manufactured sniping ammunition known as the effect firing sS round The effect firing sS round featured an extra carefully measured propellant charge and seated a heavy gram gr full metal jacketed boat tail projectile of match grade build quality lacking usual features such as a seating ring to improve the already high ballistic coefficient of G further For aiming optics German snipers used the Zeiss Zielvier x ZF telescopic sight which had bullet drop compensation in m increments for ranges from m up to m or in some variations from m up to m or m There were ZF Zielfernrohr ZF Zeiss Zielsechs x Zeiss Zielacht x and other telescopic sights by various manufacturers like the Ajack x Hensoldt Dialytan x and Kahles Heliavier x with similar features employed on German sniper rifles Several different mountings produced by various manufacturers were used for mounting aiming optics to the rifles In February the Zielger t active infrared aiming device was issued for night sniping with the StG assault rifle br A total of individuals received Red Army sniper training including Soviet and non Soviet partisans with receiving the sniping higher qualification During World War two six month training courses for women alone trained nearly snipers of which more than two thousand later served in the army On average there was at least one sniper in an infantry platoon and one in every reconnaissance platoon including in tank and even artillery units Some used the PTRD anti tank rifle with an adapted scope as an early example of an anti materiel rifle br br In the United States Armed Forces sniper training was only very elementary and was mainly concerned with being able to hit targets over long distances Snipers were required to be able to hit a body over meters away and a head over meters away There was almost no instruction in blending into the environment Sniper training varied from place to place resulting in wide variation in the qualities of snipers The main reason the US did not extend sniper training beyond long range shooting was the limited deployment of US soldiers until the Normandy Invasion During the campaigns in North Africa and Italy most fighting occurred in arid and mountainous regions where the potential for concealment was limited in contrast to Western and Central Europe br br The U S Army s lack of familiarity with sniping tactics proved disastrous in Normandy and the campaign in Western Europe where they encountered well trained German snipers In Normandy German snipers remained hidden in the dense vegetation and were able to encircle American units firing at them from all sides The American and British forces were surprised by how near the German snipers could approach in safety and attack them as well as by their ability to hit targets at up to m A notable mistake made by inexperienced American soldiers was to lie down and wait when targeted by German snipers allowing the snipers to pick them off one after another German snipers often infiltrated Allied lines and sometimes when the front lines moved they continued to fight from their sniping positions refusing to surrender until their rations and munitions were exhausted br Those tactics were also a consequence of changes in German enlistment After several years of war and heavy losses on the Eastern Front the German army was forced to rely more heavily on enlisting teenage soldiers Due to lack of training in more complex group tactics and thanks to rifle training provided by the Hitlerjugend those soldiers were often used as autonomous left behind snipers While an experienced sniper would take a few lethal shots and retreat to a safer position those young boys due both to a disregard for their own safety and to lack of tactical experience would frequently remain in a concealed position and fight until they ran out of ammunition or were killed or wounded While this tactic generally ended in the demise of the sniper giving rise to the nickname Suicide Boys that was given to those soldiers this irrational behavior proved quite disruptive to the Allied forces progress After World War II many elements of German sniper training and doctrine were copied by other countries br In the Pacific War the Empire of Japan trained snipers In the jungles of Asia and the Pacific Islands snipers posed a serious threat to U S British and Commonwealth troops Japanese snipers were specially trained to use the environment to conceal themselves Japanese snipers used foliage on their uniforms and dug well concealed hide outs that were often connected with small trenches There was no need for long range accuracy because most combat in the jungle took place within a few hundred meters Japanese snipers were known for their patience and ability to remain hidden for long periods They almost never left their carefully camouflaged hiding spots This meant that whenever a sniper was in the area the location of the sniper could be determined after the sniper had fired a few shots The Allies used their own snipers in the Pacific notably the U S Marines who used M Springfield rifles br Common sniper rifles used during the Second World War include the Soviet M Mosin Nagant and to a lesser extent the SVT the German Mauser Karabiner k and Gewehr the British Lee Enfield No and Pattern Enfield the Japanese Arisaka the American M A Springfield and M C Garand The Italians trained few snipers and supplied them with a scoped Carcano Model br br br Training br br Military sniper training aims to teach a high degree of proficiency in camouflage and concealment stalking observation and map reading as well as precision marksmanship under various operational conditions Trainees typically shoot thousands of rounds over a number of weeks while learning these core skills br Snipers are trained to squeeze the trigger straight back with the ball of their finger to avoid jerking the gun sideways The most accurate position is prone with a sandbag supporting the stock and the stock s cheek piece against the cheek In the field a bipod can be used instead Sometimes a sling is wrapped around the weak arm or both to reduce stock movement Some doctrines train a sniper to breathe deeply before shooting then hold their lungs empty while they line up and take their shot Other doctrines assert that exhausting the lungs results in an accelerated heart rate and suggest only a partial exhale before firing Some go further teaching their snipers to shoot between heartbeats to minimize barrel motion br br br Accuracy br br The key to sniping is accuracy which applies to both the weapon and the shooter The weapon should be able to consistently place shots within tight tolerances The sniper in turn must use the weapon to accurately place shots under varying conditions br A sniper must have the ability to accurately estimate the various factors that influence a bullet s trajectory and point of impact such as range to the target wind direction wind velocity altitude and elevation of the sniper and the target and ambient temperature Mistakes in estimation compound over distance and can decrease lethality or cause a shot to miss completely br Snipers zero their weapons at a target range or in the field This is the process of adjusting the scope so that the bullets points of impact are at the point of aim centre of scope or scope s cross hairs for a specific distance A rifle and scope should retain its zero as long as possible under all conditions to reduce the need to re zero during missions br A sandbag can serve as a useful platform for shooting a sniper rifle although any soft surface such as a rucksack will steady a rifle and contribute to consistency In particular bipods help when firing from a prone position and enable the firing position to be sustained for an extended period of time Many police and military sniper rifles come equipped with an adjustable bipod Makeshift bipods known as shooting sticks can be constructed from items such as tree branches or ski poles Some military snipers use three legged shooting sticks br br br U S military br Servicemen volunteer for the rigorous sniper training and are accepted on the basis of their aptitude physical ability marksmanship patience and mental stability Military snipers may be further trained as forward air controllers FACs to direct air strikes or forward observers FOs to direct artillery or mortar fire br br br Russian Army br From the Russian armed forces have run newly developed sniper courses in military district training centres In place of the Soviet practice of mainly squad sharpshooters which were often designated during initial training and of whom only few become snipers per se these new army snipers are trained intensively for three months for conscripts or longer for contract soldiers The training program includes theory and practice of countersniper engagements artillery spotting and coordination of air support The first instructors are the graduates of the Solnechnogorsk sniper training centre br The method of sniper deployment according to the Ministry of Defence is likely to be one three platoon company at the brigade level with one of the platoons acting independently and the other two supporting the battalions as needed br br br Targeting tactics and techniques br br br Range finding br The range to the target is measured or estimated as precisely as conditions permit and correct range estimation becomes absolutely critical at long ranges because a bullet travels with a curved trajectory and the sniper must compensate for this by aiming higher at longer distances If the exact distance is not known the sniper may compensate incorrectly and the bullet path may be too high or low As an example for a typical military sniping cartridge such as mm NATO Winchester M Special Ball round this difference or drop from to meters yd is millimetres in This means that if the sniper incorrectly estimated the distance as meters when the target was in fact meters away the bullet will be millimeters lower than expected by the time it reaches the target br Laser rangefinders may be used and range estimation is often the job of both parties in a team One useful method of range finding without a laser rangefinder is comparing the height of the target or nearby objects to their size on the mil dot scope or taking a known distance and using some sort of measure utility poles fence posts to determine the additional distance The average human head is millimeters in in width average human shoulders are millimeters in apart and the average distance from a person s pelvis to the top of their head is millimeters in br To determine the range to a target without a laser rangefinder the sniper may use the mil dot reticle on a scope to accurately find the range Mil dots are used like a slide rule to measure the height of a target and if the height is known the range can be as well The height of the target in yards divided by the height of the target in mils gives the range in yards This is only in general however as both scope magnification and mil dot spacing change The USMC standard is that mil that is milliradian equals MOA minute of arc or equivalently minute of angle while the US Army standard is MOA chosen so as to give a diameter of yard at a distance of yards or equivalently a diameter of meter at a range of kilometer Many commercial manufacturers use splitting the difference since it is easier to work with br It is important to note that angular mil mil is only an approximation of a milliradian and different organizations use different approximations br At longer ranges bullet drop plays a significant role in targeting The effect can be estimated from a chart which may be memorized or taped to the rifle although some scopes come with Bullet Drop Compensator BDC systems that only require the range be dialed in These are tuned to both a specific class of rifle and specific ammunition Every bullet type and load will have different ballistics Federal grain g BTHP match shoots at ft s m s Zeroed at yards m a MOA adjustment would have to be made to hit a target at yards m If the same bullet was shot with grain g a MOA adjustment would be necessary br Shooting uphill or downhill is confusing for many because gravity does not act perpendicular to the direction the bullet is traveling Thus gravity must be divided into its component vectors Only the fraction of gravity equal to the cosine of the angle of fire with respect to the horizon affects the rate of fall of the bullet with the remainder adding or subtracting negligible velocity to the bullet along its trajectory To find the correct zero the sniper multiplies the actual distance to the range by this fraction and aims as if the target were that distance away For example a sniper who observes a target meters away at a degree angle downhill would multiply the range by the cosine of degrees which is The resulting distance will be meters This number is equal to the horizontal distance to the target All other values such as windage time to target impact velocity and energy will be calculated based on the actual range of meters Recently a small device known as a cosine indicator has been developed This device is clamped to the tubular body of the telescopic sight and gives an indicative readout in numerical form as the rifle is aimed up or down at the target This is translated into a figure used to compute the horizontal range to the target br Windage plays a significant role with the effect increasing with wind speed or the distance of the shot The slant of visible convections near the ground can be used to estimate crosswinds and correct the point of aim All adjustments for range wind and elevation can be performed by aiming off the target called holding over or Kentucky windage Alternatively the scope can be adjusted so that the point of aim is changed to compensate for these factors sometimes referred to as dialing in The shooter must remember to return the scope to zeroed position Adjusting the scope allows for more accurate shots because the cross hairs can be aligned with the target more accurately but the sniper must know exactly what differences the changes will have on the point of impact at each target range br For moving targets the point of aim is ahead of the target in the direction of movement Known as leading the target the amount of lead depends on the speed and angle of the target s movement as well as the distance to the target For this technique holding over is the preferred method Anticipating the behavior of the target is necessary to accurately place the shot br br br Hide sites and hiding techniques br br The term hide site refers to a covered and concealed position from which a sniper and his team can conduct surveillance or fire at targets A good hide conceals and camouflages the sniper effectively provides cover from enemy fire and allows a wide view of the surrounding area br The main purpose of ghillie suits and hide sites is to break up the outline of a person with a rifle br Many snipers use ghillie suits to hide and stay hidden Ghillie suits vary according to the terrain into which the sniper wishes to blend For example in dry grassland the sniper will typically wear a ghillie suit covered in dead grass br br br Shot placement br Shot placement which is where on the body the sniper is aiming varies with the type of sniper Military snipers who generally do not shoot at targets at less than m yd usually attempt body shots aiming at the chest These shots depend on tissue damage organ trauma and blood loss to kill the target Body shots are used because the chest is a larger target br Police snipers who generally shoot at much shorter distances may attempt a more precise shot at particular parts of body or particular devices in one incident in in Marseille a GIPN sniper took a shot from m yd at the pistol of a police officer threatening to commit suicide destroying the weapon and preventing the police officer from killing himself br In a high risk or hostage taking situation where a suspect is imminently threatening to kill a hostage police snipers may take head shots to ensure an instant kill The snipers aim for the medulla oblongata to sever the spine from the brain While this is believed to prevent the target from reflexively firing their weapon there is evidence that any brain hit is sufficient br br br Target acquisition br br Snipers are trained for the detection identification and location of a targeted soldier in sufficient detail to permit the effective employment of lethal and non lethal means Since most kills in modern warfare are by other crew served weapons reconnaissance is one of the most effective uses of snipers They use their aerobic conditioning infiltration skills and excellent long distance observation equipment optical scopes and tactics to approach and observe the enemy In this role their rules of engagement typically let them shoot at high value targets of opportunity such as enemy officers br The targets may be personnel or high value materiel military equipment and weapons but most often they target the most important enemy personnel such as officers or specialists e g communications operators so as to cause maximum disruption to enemy operations Other personnel they might target include those who pose an immediate threat to the sniper like dog handlers who are often employed in a search for snipers A sniper identifies officers by their appearance and behavior such as symbols of rank talking to radio operators sitting as a passenger in a car sitting in a car with a large radio antenna having military servants binoculars map cases or talking and moving position more frequently If possible snipers shoot in descending order by rank or if rank is unavailable they shoot to disrupt communications br Some rifles such as the Denel NTW and Vidhwansak are designed for a purely anti materiel AM role e g shooting turbine disks of parked aircraft missile guidance packages expensive optics and the bearings tubes or wave guides of radar sets A sniper equipped with the correct rifle can target radar dishes water containers the engines of vehicles and any number of other targets Other rifles such as the caliber rifles produced by Barrett and McMillan are not designed exclusively as AM rifles but are often employed in such a way providing the range and power needed for AM applications in a lightweight package compared to most traditional AM rifles Other calibers such as the Cheyenne Tactical and the Lapua Magnum are designed to be capable of limited AM application but are ideally suited as long range anti personnel rounds br br br Relocating br Often in situations with multiple targets snipers use relocation After firing a few shots from a certain position snipers move unseen to another location before the enemy can determine where they are and mount a counter attack Snipers will frequently use this tactic to their advantage creating an atmosphere of chaos and confusion In other rarer situations relocation is used to eliminate the factor of wind br br br Sound masking br As sniper rifles are often extremely powerful and consequently loud it is common for snipers to use a technique known as sound masking When employed by a highly skilled marksman this tactic can be used as a substitute for a noise suppressor Very loud sounds in the environment such as artillery shells air bursting or claps of thunder can often mask the sound of the shot This technique is frequently used in clandestine operations infiltration tactics and guerrilla warfare br br br Psychological warfare br br Due to the surprise nature of sniper fire high lethality of aimed shots and frustration at the inability to locate and counterattack snipers sniper tactics have a significant negative effect on morale Extensive use of sniper tactics can be used to induce constant stress and fear in opposing forces making them afraid to move about or leave cover In many ways the psychological impact imposed by snipers is quite similar to those of landmines booby traps and IEDs constant threat high per event lethality inability to strike back br Historically captured snipers are often summarily executed This happened during World War I and World War II for example the second Biscari Massacre when suspected snipers were lined up and shot on July br As a result if a sniper is in imminent danger of capture he may discard any items sniper rifle laser rangefinder etc which might indicate his status as a sniper The risk of captured snipers being summarily executed is explicitly referred to in Chapter of US Army doctrine document FM entitled SNIPER AND COUNTERSNIPER TACTICS TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES br br Historically units that suffered heavy and continual casualties from urban sniper fire and were frustrated by their inability to strike back effectively often have become enraged Such units may overreact and violate the laws of land warfare concerning the treatment of captured snipers This tendency is magnified if the unit has been under the intense stress of urban combat for an extended time It is vital that commanders and leaders at all levels understand the law of land warfare and understand the psychological pressures of urban warfare It requires strong leadership and great moral strength to prevent soldiers from releasing their anger and frustration on captured snipers or civilians suspected of sniping at them br The negative reputation and perception of snipers can be traced back to the American Revolution when American Marksmen intentionally targeted British officers an act considered uncivilized by the British Army at the time this reputation was cemented during the Battle of Saratoga when Benedict Arnold allegedly ordered his marksmen to target British General Simon Fraser an act that won the battle and French support The British side used specially selected sharpshooters as well often German mercenaries br To demoralize enemy troops snipers can follow predictable patterns During the th of July Movement in the Cuban Revolution the revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro always killed the foremost man in a group of President Batista s soldiers Realizing this none of Batista s men would walk first as it was suicidal This effectively decreased the army s willingness to search for rebel bases in the forests and mountains An alternative approach to this psychological process is to kill the second man in the row leading to the psychological effect of nobody wanting to follow the leader br br br Counter sniper tactics br br The occurrence of sniper warfare has led to the evolution of many counter sniper tactics in modern military strategies These aim to reduce the damage caused by a sniper to an army which can often be harmful to both combat capabilities and morale br The risk of damage to a chain of command can be reduced by removing or concealing features that would otherwise indicate an officer s rank Modern armies tend to avoid saluting officers in the field and eliminate rank insignia on battle dress uniforms Officers can seek maximum cover before revealing themselves as good candidates for elimination through actions such as reading maps or using radios br Friendly snipers can be used to hunt the enemy sniper Besides direct observation defending forces can use other techniques These include calculating the trajectory of a bullet by triangulation Traditionally triangulation of a sniper s position was done manually though radar based technology has recently become available Once located the defenders can attempt to approach the sniper from cover and overwhelm them The United States military is funding a project known as RedOwl Robot Enhanced Detection Outpost With Lasers which uses laser and acoustic sensors to determine the exact direction from which a sniper round has been fired br The more rounds fired by a sniper the greater the chance the target has of locating him Thus attempts to draw fire are often made sometimes by offering a helmet slightly out of concealment a tactic successfully employed in the Winter War by the Finns known as Kylm Kalle Cold Charlie They used a shop mannequin or other doll dressed as a tempting target such as an officer The doll was then presented as if it were a real man sloppily covering himself Usually Soviet snipers were unable to resist the temptation of an apparently easy kill Once the angle where the bullet came from was determined a large caliber gun such as a Lahti L Norsupyssy Elephant rifle anti tank rifle was fired at the sniper to kill him br Other tactics include directing artillery or mortar fire onto suspected sniper positions the use of smoke screens placing tripwire operated munitions mines or other booby traps near suspected sniper positions Even dummy trip wires can be placed to hamper sniper movement If anti personnel mines are unavailable it is possible to improvise booby traps by connecting trip wires to hand grenades smoke grenades or flares Though these may not kill a sniper they will reveal their location Booby trap devices can be placed near likely sniper hides or along the probable routes to and from positions Knowledge of sniper field craft will assist in this task br The use of canine units had been very successful especially during the Vietnam War br br br Irregular and asymmetric warfare br br The use of sniping in the sense of shooting at relatively long range from a concealed position to murder came to public attention in a number of sensational U S criminal cases including the Austin sniper incident of Charles Whitman the John F Kennedy assassination Lee Harvey Oswald and the Beltway sniper attacks of late Lee Boyd Malvo However these incidents usually do not involve the range or skill of military snipers in all three cases the perpetrators had U S military training but in other specialties News reports will often inaccurately use the term sniper to describe anyone shooting with a rifle at another person br Sniping has been used in asymmetric warfare situations for example in the Northern Ireland Troubles where in the bloodiest year of the conflict the majority of the soldiers killed were shot by concealed IRA riflemen There were some instances in the early s of British soldiers and RUC personnel being shot with caliber Barrett rifles by sniper teams collectively known as the South Armagh sniper br The sniper is particularly suited to combat environments where one side is at a disadvantage A careful sniping strategy can use a few individuals and resources to thwart the movement or other progress of a much better equipped or larger force Sniping enables a few persons to instil terror in a much larger regular force regardless of the size of the force the snipers are attached to It is widely accepted that sniping while effective in specific instances is much more effective as a broadly deployed psychological attack or as a force multiplier br Snipers are less likely to be treated mercifully than non snipers if captured by the enemy The rationale for this is that ordinary soldiers shoot at each other at equal opportunity whilst snipers take their time in tracking and killing individual targets in a methodical fashion with a relatively low risk of retaliation br br br War in Iraq br br In the U S led multinational coalition composed of primarily U S and UK troops occupied Iraq and attempted to establish a new government in the country However shortly after the initial invasion violence against coalition forces and among various sectarian groups led to asymmetric warfare with the Iraqi insurgency and civil war between many Sunni and Shia Iraqis br br Through to November the Army had attributed of U S deaths to enemy snipers In it was claimed that one insurgent sniper Juba had shot up to American soldiers br Training materials obtained by U S intelligence had among its tips for shooting U S troops Killing doctors and chaplains is suggested as a means of psychological warfare suggesting that those
