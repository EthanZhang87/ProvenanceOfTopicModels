Electrical system design is the design of electrical systems This can be as simple as a flashlight cell connected through two wires to a light bulb or as involved as the Space Shuttle Electrical systems are groups of electrical components connected to carry out some operation Often the systems are combined with other systems They might be subsystems of larger systems and have subsystems of their own For example a subway rapid transit electrical system is composed of the wayside electrical power supply wayside control system and the electrical systems of each transit car Each transit car s electrical system is a subsystem of the subway system Inside of each transit car there are also subsystems such as the car climate control system br br br Design br The following would be appropriate for the design of a moderate to large electrical system br br A specification document is written It probably would have been written by the customer The specification document states in plain language and numerical detail what the customer expects If it is well written it will be used as a reference throughout the electrical system design br A functional specification design document that goes into more technical details may be created It uses the specification document as its basis Here calculations may be used or referenced to support design decisions br Functional diagrams may be made These use block diagrams indicating information and electrical power flow from component to component They are similar to the functional flow block diagrams used with computer programs br Schematic diagrams showing the electrical interconnections between the components are made They may not show all the conductors and termination points Except for one line diagrams this should show all the circuit nodes One line diagrams represent the three or four conductors of three phase power circuits with one line br Wiring diagrams are sometimes made These show and name the termination points and names of each conductor In some systems enough information can be put onto the schematics so that wiring diagrams are not needed br Physically smaller systems that are built many times may use a cable harness A full sized to scale wiring diagram can be made of a cable harness This wiring diagram can then be laid on a peg board and used to guide the construction of more cable harnesses Harnesses can be inserted into their equipment as an assembly Cable harnesses that are reused many times like automobile wiring harnesses are created with automated machinery br A wire list is made in spreadsheet or list format It shows the electrical assembly people what wires are to be connected and to where When it is printed out on paper it is easy for the assembly people to check off conductors as they are connected The wire list contains at a minimum each wire name terminal name and wire model number or gage It may also contain the wire termination device model numbers voltage classes conductor class high voltage medium voltage or control wiring etc br br br br Bosela Ayanda Voyi Theodore R Electrical Systems Design Prentice Hall ISBN pages
