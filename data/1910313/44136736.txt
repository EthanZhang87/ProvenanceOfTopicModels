title: Research-based design

The research based design process is a research process proposed by Teemu Leinonen inspired by several design theories It is strongly oriented towards the building of prototypes and it emphasizes creative solutions exploration of various ideas and design concepts continuous testing and redesign of the design solutions br The method is firmly influenced by the Scandinavian participatory design approach Therefore most of the activities take place in a close dialogue with the community that is expected to use the tools or services designed br br br Phases br The process can be divided into four major phases although they all happen concurrently and side by side At different times of the research researchers are asked to put more effort into different phases The continuous iteration however asks researchers to keep all the phases alive all the time contextual inquiry participatory design product design prototype as hypothesis br br br Contextual inquiry br br Contextual inquiry refers to the exploration of the socio cultural context of the design The aim is to understand the environment situation and culture where the design takes place The results of the contextual inquiry are better understanding of the context by recognizing in it possible challenges and design opportunities In this phase design researchers use rapid ethnographic methods such as participatory observation note taking sketching informal conversations and interviews At the same time as the field work the design researchers are doing a focused review of the literature benchmarking existing solutions and analyzing trends in the area in order to understand and recognise design challenges br br br Participatory design br br Throughout the contextual inquiry design researchers start to develop some preliminary design ideas which would be developed during the next stage participatory design in workshops with different stakeholders The participatory design sessions tend to take place with small groups of to participants A common practice is to present the results as scenarios made by the design researchers containing challenges and design opportunities In the workshop the participants are invited to come up with design solutions to the challenges and to bring to the discussion new challenges and solutions br Since one of the main features of the research based design is its participatory nature the user s involvement is an integral part of the process In this regard participatory design workshops are organized during the different stages in order to validate initial ideas and discuss the prototypes at different stage of development br br br Product design br br The results of the participatory design are analysed in a design studio by the design researchers who use the materials from the contextual inquiry and participatory design sessions to redefine the design problems and redesign the prototypes By keeping a distance from the stakeholders in the product design phase the design researchers will get a chance to analyse the results of the participatory design categorize them use specific design language related to implementation of the prototypes and finally make design decisions br br br Prototype as hypothesis br Ultimately the prototypes are developed to be functional on a level that they can be tested with real people in their everyday situations The prototypes are still considered to be a hypothesis prototypes as hypothesis because they are expected to be part of the solutions for the challenges defined and redefined during the research It remains to the stakeholders to decide whether they support the assertions made by the design researchers Therefore the first prototypes brought to the use of the real people can be considered to be also minimum viable products br Research based design is not to be confused with design based research or educational design research In research based design which builds on art and design tradition the focus is on the artifacts the end results of the design The way the artifacts are the affordances and features they have or do not have form an important part of the research argumentation As such research based design as a methodological approach includes research design and design interventions that are all intertwined br br br
