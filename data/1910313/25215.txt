id: 25215
Quake III Arena is a multiplayer focused first person shooter developed by id Software The third installment of the Quake series Arena differs from previous games by excluding a story based single player mode and focusing primarily on multiplayer gameplay The single player mode is played against computer controlled bots It features music composed by Sonic Mayhem and Front Line Assembly founder Bill Leeb br Notable features of Quake III Arena include a minimalist design very extensively customizable settings such as field of view texture detail and enemy model and advanced movement features such as strafe jumping and rocket jumping br The game was praised by reviewers who for the most part described the gameplay as fun and engaging Many liked the crisp graphics and focus on multiplayer Quake III Arena has also been used extensively in professional electronic sports tournaments such as QuakeCon Cyberathlete Professional League DreamHack and the Electronic Sports World Cup br br br Gameplay br Unlike its predecessors Quake III Arena does not have a single player campaign Instead it simulates the multiplayer experience with computer controlled players The game s story is brief the greatest warriors of all time fight for the amusement of a race called the Vadrigar in the Arena Eternal The introduction video shows the abduction of such a warrior Sarge while making a last stand Continuity with prior games in the Quake series and even Doom is maintained by the inclusion of player models and biographical information A familiar mixture of gothic and technological map architecture as well as specific equipment is included such as the Quad Damage power up the rocket launcher and the BFG br In Quake III Arena the player progresses through tiers of maps combating different bot characters that increase in difficulty from Crash at Tier to Xaero at Tier As the game progresses the fights take place in more complex arenas and against tougher opponents While deathmatch maps are designed for up to players tournament maps are designed for duels between players and in the single player game could be considered boss battles br The weapons are balanced by role with each weapon having advantages in certain situations such as the railgun at long range and the lightning gun at close quarters The BFG super weapon is an exception to this compared to other similarly named weapons in the Doom Quake series Quake III Arena s incarnation of this weapon is basically a fast firing rocket launcher and it is found in hard to reach locations Weapons appear as level items spawning at regular intervals in set locations on the map If a player dies all of their weapons are lost and they receive the spawn weapons for the current map usually the gauntlet and machine gun Players also drop the weapon they were using when killed which other players can then pick up br Quake III Arena comes with several gameplay modes Free for All FFA a classic deathmatch where each player competes against the rest for the highest score Team Deathmatch TDM where usually two teams of four compete for the highest team frag kill total Tournament v a deathmatch between two players usually ending after a set time and Capture the Flag which is played on symmetrical maps where teams have to recover the enemy flag from the opponents base while retaining their own br Quake III Arena was specifically designed for multiplayer The game allows players whose computers are connected by a network or to the internet to play against each other in real time and incorporates a handicap system It employs a client server model requiring all players clients to connect to a server Quake III Arena s focus on multiplayer gameplay spawned a lively community similar to QuakeWorld that is still active as of br br br Characters br Quake III Arena features several characters from previous entries in the Quake series including Bitterman from Quake II the Ranger character from Quake as well as Doomguy from id Software s sister franchise Doom br br br Development br During early March ATI leaked the internal hardware vendor IHV copy of the game which unveiled to the public in Macworld Conference Expo at Moscone Center in January and Makuhari Messe in February by Steve Jobs CEO of Apple Inc at the time when it unveiled This was a functional version of the engine with a textured level and working guns The IHV contained most of the weapons excepting the Gauntlet that would make it into the final game although most were not fully modeled a chainsaw and grappling hook were also in the IHV but did not make it into the final release Many of the sounds that would make it into the final release were also included The game was developed by nine people in months br After the IHV leak id Software released a beta of the game called Quake III Arena Test on April initially only for Mac OS before expanding to Windows at a later date The Q Test started with version and included three levels that would be included in the final release dm dm and q tourney Id Software continued to update Q Test up until version br id co founder and former technical director John Carmack has stated that Quake III Arena is his favorite game he has worked on br Quake III Arena was shipped to retailers on December the official street date for the game was December although id Software chief executive officer Todd Hollenshead expected the game to be available as early as December from retailers like Babbage s and EB Games The game supported the A D HRTF technology by Aureal Semiconductor out of the box br br br Game engine br br The id Tech engine is the name given to the engine that was developed for Quake III Arena Unlike most other games released at the time Quake III Arena requires an OpenGL compliant graphics accelerator to run The game does not include a software or Direct D renderer br The graphic technology of the game is based tightly around a shader system where the appearance of many surfaces can be defined in text files referred to as shader scripts Quake also introduced spline based curved surfaces in addition to planar volumes which are responsible for many of the surfaces present within the game Quake also provided support for models animated using vertex animation with attachment tags known as the md format allowing models to maintain separate torso and leg animations and hold weapons Quake is one of the first games where the third person model is able to look up and down and around as the head torso and legs are separate Other visual features include volumetric fog mirrors portals decals and wave form vertex distortion br For networking id Tech uses a snapshot system to relay information about game frames to the client over UDP The server attempts to omit as much information as possible about each frame relaying only differences from the last frame the client confirmed as received Delta encoding id Tech uses a virtual machine to control object behavior on the server effects and prediction on the client and the user interface This presents many advantages as mod authors do not need to worry about crashing the entire game with bad code clients could show more advanced effects and game menus than was possible in Quake II and the user interface for mods was entirely customizable Unless operations which require a specific endianness are used a QVM file will run the same on any platform supported by Quake III Arena The engine also contains bytecode compilers for the x and PowerPC architectures executing QVM instructions via an interpreter br Quake III Arena features an advanced AI with five difficulty levels which can accommodate both a beginner and an advanced player though they usually do not pose a challenge to high tier or competitive players Each bot has its own often humorous personality expressed as scripted lines that are triggered to simulate real player chat If the player types certain phrases the bots may respond for example typing You bore me might cause a bot to reply You should have been here hours ago Each bot has a number of alternative lines to reduce the repetition of bot chatter The Gladiator bots from Quake II were ported to Quake III Arena and incorporated into the game by their creator Jan Paul van Waveren aka Mr Elusive Bot chat lines were written by R A Salvatore Seven Swords and Steve Winter Xaero the hardest opponent in the game was based on the Gladiator bot Zero The bot Hunter appears on magazine covers in the later id game Doom br On August id Software released the complete source code for Quake III Arena under the GNU General Public License v or later as they have for most of their prior engines As before the engine but not the content such as textures and models was released so that anyone who wishes to build the game from source will still need an original copy of the game to play it as intended br br br Mods br Like its predecessors Quake and Quake II Quake III Arena can be heavily modified allowing the engine to be used for many different games Mods range from small gameplay adjustments like Rocket Arena and Orange Smoothie Productions to total conversions such as Smokin Guns DeFRaG and Loki s Revenge The source code s release has allowed total conversion mods such as Tremulous World of Padman OpenArena and Urban Terror to evolve into free standalone games Other mods like Weapons Factory Arena have moved to more modern commercial engines Challenge ProMode Arena became the primary competitive mod for Quake III Arena since the Cyberathlete Professional League announced CPMA as its basis for competition CPMA includes alternative gameplays including air control rebalanced weapons instant weapon switching and additional jumping techniques Another mod that underwent several open beta versions and was very popular in was Quake Fortress Q F The initial version of this game was an indirect port of the Quakeworld Team Fortress mod with many clans and leagues competing in both games simultaneously Q F was eventually ported to another Quake mod Enemy Territory Fortress which had limited success The developers of Q F eventually abandoned the mod but used it to create the standalone game Wolfenstein Enemy Territory which uses the Quake engine and is still popular with approximately active players in br br br Fast inverse square root br br Fast inverse square root sometimes referred to as Fast InvSqrt or by the hexadecimal constant x F DF is an algorithm that estimates br br br br br br br br x br br br br br br displaystyle frac sqrt x br br the reciprocal or multiplicative inverse of the square root of a bit floating point number br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br in IEEE floating point format The algorithm is best known for its implementation in the source code of Quake III Arena br At the time it was generally computationally expensive to compute the reciprocal of a floating point number especially on a large scale However the fast inverse square root bypassed this step br Around initial speculation pointed to John Carmack as the probable author of the code but he demurred and suggested it was written by Terje Mathisen an accomplished assembly programmer who had previously helped id Software with Quake optimization Mathisen had written an implementation of a similar bit of code in the late s but the original authors proved to be much further back in the history of D computer graphics with Gary Tarolli s implementation for the SGI Indigo as a possible earliest known use br br br Expansion br An expansion pack titled Quake III Team Arena was released on December in North America January in Japan and January in Europe It was developed by id Software and published by Activision The expansion focused on team based gameplay through new game modes as well as the addition of three new weapons the Chaingun Nailgun and Prox Launcher and new items and player models Quake III Team Arena was criticized as its additions were long overdue and had already been implemented by fan modifications Quake III Gold was later released on September in North America March in Japan and August in Europe Quake III Gold including the full version of Quake III Arena and the Quake III Team Arena expansion pack bundled together in a Hybrid Disc CD ROM Canadian electro industrial band Front Line Assembly made the soundtrack for the expansion the counterpart to Sonic Mayhem s Quake III Arena Noize br br br Ports br br br Official br As a result of the disappointing sales of Blue Stinger Activision was discouraged from publishing further titles for the Dreamcast and relinquished the distribution of the Dreamcast version of Quake III Arena ported by Raster Productions to Sega First announced on January and released on October the Dreamcast version of Quake III featured player cross platform play between Dreamcast and PC players It is often considered one of the best PC to console ports of its time thanks to its smooth frame rate and online play There are still communities that play this version online on the remaining dedicated servers
