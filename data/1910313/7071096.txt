The engineering design process also known as the engineering method is a common series of steps that engineers use in creating functional products and processes The process is highly iterative parts of the process often need to be repeated many times before another can be entered though the part s that get iterated and the number of such cycles in any given project may vary br It is a decision making process often iterative in which the basic sciences mathematics and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated objective Among the fundamental elements of the design process are the establishment of objectives and criteria synthesis analysis construction testing and evaluation br br br Common stages of the engineering design process br It s important to understand that there are various framings articulations of the engineering design process Different terminology employed may have varying degrees of overlap which affects what steps get stated explicitly or deemed high level versus subordinate in any given model This of course applies as much to any particular example steps sequences given here br One example framing of the engineering design process delineates the following stages research conceptualization feasibility assessment establishing design requirements preliminary design detailed design production planning and tool design and production Others noting that different authors in both research literature and in textbooks define different phases of the design process with varying activities occurring within them have suggested more simplified generalized models such as problem definition conceptual design preliminary design detailed design and design communication Another summary of the process from European engineering design literature includes clarification of the task conceptual design embodiment design detail design NOTE In these examples other key aspects such as concept evaluation and prototyping are subsets and or extensions of one or more of the listed steps br br br Research br Various stages of the design process and even earlier can involve a significant amount of time spent on locating information and research Consideration should be given to the existing applicable literature problems and successes associated with existing solutions costs and marketplace needs br The source of information should be relevant Reverse engineering can be an effective technique if other solutions are available on the market Other sources of information include the Internet local libraries available government documents personal organizations trade journals vendor catalogs and individual experts available br br br Design requirements br Establishing design requirements and conducting requirement analysis sometimes termed problem definition or deemed a related activity is one of the most important elements in the design process and this task is often performed at the same time as a feasibility analysis The design requirements control the design of the product or process being developed throughout the engineering design process These include basic things like the functions attributes and specifications determined after assessing user needs Some design requirements include hardware and software parameters maintainability availability and testability br br br Feasibility br In some cases a feasibility study is carried out after which schedules resource plans and estimates for the next phase are developed The feasibility study is an evaluation and analysis of the potential of a proposed project to support the process of decision making It outlines and analyses alternatives or methods of achieving the desired outcome The feasibility study helps to narrow the scope of the project to identify the best scenario br A feasibility report is generated following which Post Feasibility Review is performed br The purpose of a feasibility assessment is to determine whether the engineer s project can proceed into the design phase This is based on two criteria the project needs to be based on an achievable idea and it needs to be within cost constraints It is important to have engineers with experience and good judgment to be involved in this portion of the feasibility study br br br Concept generation br A concept study conceptualization conceptual design is often a phase of project planning that includes producing ideas and taking into account the pros and cons of implementing those ideas This stage of a project is done to minimize the likelihood of error manage costs assess risks and evaluate the potential success of the intended project In any event once an engineering issue or problem is defined potential solutions must be identified These solutions can be found by using ideation the mental process by which ideas are generated In fact this step is often termed Ideation or Concept Generation The following are widely used techniques br br trigger word a word or phrase associated with the issue at hand is stated and subsequent words and phrases are evoked br morphological analysis independent design characteristics are listed in a chart and different engineering solutions are proposed for each solution Normally a preliminary sketch and short report accompany the morphological chart br synectics the engineer imagines him or herself as the item and asks What would I do if I were the system This unconventional method of thinking may find a solution to the problem at hand The vital aspects of the conceptualization step is synthesis Synthesis is the process of taking the element of the concept and arranging them in the proper way Synthesis creative process is present in every design br brainstorming this popular method involves thinking of different ideas typically as part of a small group and adopting these ideas in some form as a solution to the problem br Various generated ideas must then undergo a concept evaluation step which utilizes various tools to compare and contrast the relative strengths and weakness of possible alternatives br br br Preliminary design br The preliminary design or high level design includes also called FEED or Basic design often bridges a gap between design conception and detailed design particularly in cases where the level of conceptualization achieved during ideation is not sufficient for full evaluation So in this task the overall system configuration is defined and schematics diagrams and layouts of the project may provide early project configuration This notably varies a lot by field industry and product During detailed design and optimization the parameters of the part being created will change but the preliminary design focuses on creating the general framework to build the project on br S Blanchard and J Fabrycky describe it as br The whats initiating conceptual design produce hows from the conceptual design evaluation effort applied to feasible conceptual design concepts Next the hows are taken into preliminary design through the means of allocated requirements There they become whats and drive preliminary design to address hows at this lower level br br br Detailed design br Following FEED is the Detailed Design Detailed Engineering phase which may consist of procurement of materials as well br This phase further elaborates each aspect of the project product by complete description through solid modeling drawings as well as specifications br Computer aided design CAD programs have made the detailed design phase more efficient For example a CAD program can provide optimization to reduce volume without hindering a part s quality It can also calculate stress and displacement using the finite element method to determine stresses throughout the part br br br Production planning br The production planning and tool design consists of planning how to mass produce the product and which tools should be used in the manufacturing process Tasks to complete in this step include selecting materials selection of the production processes determination of the sequence of operations and selection of tools such as jigs fixtures metal cutting and metal or plastics forming tools This task also involves additional prototype testing iterations to ensure the mass produced version meets qualification testing standards br br br Comparison with the scientific method br Engineering is formulating a problem that can be solved through design Science is formulating a question that can be solved through investigation br The engineering design process bears some similarity to the scientific method Both processes begin with existing knowledge and gradually become more specific in the search for knowledge in the case of pure or basic science or a solution in the case of applied science such as engineering The key difference between the engineering process and the scientific process is that the engineering process focuses on design creativity and innovation while the scientific process emphasizes discovery observation br br br Degree programs br Methods are being taught and developed in Universities including br br Engineering Design
