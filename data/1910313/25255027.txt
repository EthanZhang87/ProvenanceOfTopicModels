A variety of computer graphic techniques have been used to display video game content throughout the history of video games The predominance of individual techniques have evolved over time primarily due to hardware advances and restrictions such as the processing power of central or graphics processing units br br br Text based br br Some of the earliest video games were text games or text based games that used text characters instead of bitmapped or vector graphics Examples include MUDs multi user dungeons where players could read or view depictions of rooms objects other players and actions performed in the virtual world and roguelikes a subgenre of role playing video games featuring many monsters items and environmental effects as well as an emphasis on randomization replayability and permanent death Some of the earliest text games were developed for computer systems which had no video display at all br Text games are typically easier to write and require less processing power than graphical games and thus were more common from to However terminal emulators are still in use today and people continue to play MUDs and explore interactive fiction Many beginning programmers still create these types of games to familiarize themselves with a programming language and contests are still held even today on who can finish programming a roguelike within a short time period such as seven days br br br Vector graphics br br Vector graphics refer to the use of geometrical primitives such as points lines and curves i e shapes based on mathematical equations instead of resolution dependent bitmap graphics to represent images in computer graphics In video games this type of projection is somewhat rare but has become more common in recent years in browser based gaming with the advent of Flash and HTML Canvas as these support vector graphics natively An earlier example for the personal computer is Starglider br Vector game can also refer to a video game that uses a vector graphics display capable of projecting images using an electron beam to draw images instead of with pixels much like a laser show Many early arcade games used such displays as they were capable of displaying more detailed images than raster displays on the hardware available at that time Many vector based arcade games used full color overlays to complement the otherwise monochrome vector images Other uses of these overlays were very detailed drawings of the static gaming environment while the moving objects were drawn by the vector beam Games of this type were produced mainly by Atari Cinematronics and Sega Examples of vector games include Asteroids Armor Attack Aztarac Eliminator Lunar Lander Space Fury Space Wars Star Trek Tac Scan Tempest and Zektor The Vectrex home console also used a vector display After the use of vector graphics declined substantially due to improvements in sprite technology rasterized D Filled Polygon Graphics returned to the arcades and were so popular that vector graphics could no longer compete br br br Full motion video br br Full motion video FMV games are video games that rely upon pre recorded television or movie quality recordings and animations rather than sprites vectors or D models to display action in the game FMV based games were popular during the early s as CD ROMs and Laserdiscs made their way into the living rooms providing an alternative to the low capacity ROM cartridges of most consoles at the time Although FMV based games did manage to look better than many contemporary sprite based games they occupied a niche market and a vast majority of FMV games were panned at the time of their release with many gamers citing their dislike for the lack of interaction inherent in these games As a result the format became a well known failure in video gaming and the popularity of FMV games declined substantially after as more advanced consoles started to become widely available br A number of different types of games utilized this format Some resembled modern music dance games where the player timely presses buttons according to a screen instruction Others included early rail shooters such as Tomcat Alley Surgical Strike and Sewer Shark Full motion video was also used in several interactive movie adventure games such as The Beast Within A Gabriel Knight Mystery and Phantasmagoria br br br D br br Games utilizing parallel projection typically make use of two dimensional bitmap graphics as opposed to D rendered triangle based geometry allowing developers to create large complex gameworlds efficiently and with relatively few art assets by dividing the art into sprites or tiles and reusing them repeatedly though some games use a mix of different techniques br br br Top down perspective br br Top down perspective also sometimes referred to as bird s eye view Overworld Godview overhead view or helicopter view when used in the context of video games refers to a camera angle that shows players and the areas around them from above While not exclusive to video games utilizing parallel projection it was at one time common among D role playing video games wargames and construction and management simulation games such as SimCity Pok mon and Railroad Tycoon as well as among action and action adventure games such as the early The Legend of Zelda Metal Gear and Grand Theft Auto games br br br Side scrolling game br br A side scrolling game or side scroller is a video game in which the viewpoint is taken from the side and the onscreen characters generally can only move to the left or right Games of this type make use of scrolling computer display technology and sometimes parallax scrolling to suggest added depth br In many games the screen follows the player character such that the player character is always positioned near the center of the screen In other games the position of the screen will change according to the player character s movement such that the player character is off center and more space is shown in front of the character than behind Sometimes the screen will scroll not only forward in the speed and direction of the player character s movement but also backwards to previously visited parts of a stage In other games or stages the screen will only scroll forwards not backwards so that once a stage has been passed it can no longer be visited In games such as shoot em ups like R type the screen scrolls forward by itself at a steady rate and the player must keep up with the screen attempting to avoid obstacles and collect things before they pass off screen br Examples of side scrolling games include platform games such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Ori and the Blind Forest beat em ups such as the popular Double Dragon and Battletoads and shooters such as R Type and more recently Jets n Guns The Super Mario Bros series has used all three types of side scrolling at some time in its history br br br D perspective and pseudo D br br D two and a half dimensional perspective and pseudo D are informal terms used to describe graphical projections and techniques that try to fake three dimensionality typically by using some form of parallel projection wherein the point of view is from a fixed perspective but also reveals multiple facets of an object Examples of pseudo D techniques include isometric axonometric projection oblique projection orthographic projection billboarding parallax scrolling scaling skyboxes and skydomes In addition D graphical techniques such as bump mapping and parallax mapping are often used to extend the illusion of three dimensionality without substantially increasing the resulting computational overhead introduced by larger numbers of polygons also known as the polygon count br These terms sometimes possess a second meaning wherein the gameplay in an otherwise D game is forcibly restricted to a two dimensional plane br Examples of games that make use of pseudo D techniques include Zaxxon The Sims and Diablo isometric axonometric projection Ultima VII and Paperboy oblique projection Sonic the Hedgehog and Street Fighter II parallax scrolling Fonz and Space Harrier scaling and Half Life skyboxes In addition to axonometric projection games such as The Sims and Final Fantasy Tactics also make use of a combination of pre drawn D sprites and real time polygonal graphics instead of relying entirely on D sprites as is the norm br br br D br br With the advent of D accelerated graphics video games could expand beyond the typically sprite based D graphics of older graphics technologies to describe a view frequently more true to reality and lifelike than their predecessors Federica Romagnoli has stated that in her opinion high budget D game graphics display levels of artistry once more commonly found in films because of their capability to render complex cinematography and CG characters and the optimization of video game consoles and PCs to be able to handle such content Perspective projection has also been used in some earlier titles to present a D view from a fixed and thus somewhat less hardware intensive perspective with a limited ability to move br br br Voxel engines br Instead of using triangle meshes voxel engines use voxels br br br Fixed D br Fixed D refers to a three dimensional representation of the game world where foreground objects i e game characters are typically rendered in real time against a static background The principal advantage of this technique is its ability to display a high level of detail on minimal hardware The main disadvantage is that the player s frame of reference remains fixed at all times preventing players from examining or moving about the environment from multiple viewpoints br Backgrounds in fixed D games tend to be pre rendered two dimensional images but are sometimes rendered in real time e g Blade Runner The developers of SimCity took advantage of fixed perspective by not texturing the reverse sides of objects and thereby speeding up rendering which players could not see anyway Fixed D is also sometimes used to fake areas which are inaccessible to players The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time for instance is nearly completely D but uses fixed D to represent many of the building interiors as well as one entire town this technique was later dropped in favor of full D in the game s successor The Legend of Zelda Majora s Mask A similar technique the skybox is used in many D games to represent distant background objects that are not worth rendering in real time br Used heavily in the survival horror genre fixed D was first seen in Infogrames Alone in the Dark series in the early s and imitated by titles such as Ecstatica It was later brought back by Capcom in the Resident Evil series Gameplay wise there is little difference between fixed D games and their D precursors Players ability to navigate within a scene still tends to be limited and interaction with the gameworld remains mostly point and click br Further examples include the PlayStation era titles in the Final Fantasy series Square the role playing games Parasite Eve and Parasite Eve II Square the action adventure games Ecstatica and Ecstatica Andrew Spencer Psygnosis as well as Little Big Adventure Adeline Software International the graphic adventure Grim Fandango LucasArts and D Movie Maker Microsoft Kids br Pre rendered backgrounds are also found in some isometric video games such as the role playing game The Temple of Elemental Evil Troika Games and the Baldur s Gate series BioWare though in these cases the form of graphical projection used is not different br br br First person perspective br br First person refers to a graphical perspective rendered from the viewpoint of the player character In many cases this may be the viewpoint from the cockpit of a vehicle Many different genres have made use of first person perspectives including adventure games flight simulators and the highly popular first person shooter genre br Games with a first person perspective are usually avatar based wherein the game displays what the player s avatar would see with the avatar s own eyes In many games players cannot see the avatar s body though they may be able to see the avatar s weapons or hands This viewpoint is also frequently used to represent the perspective of a driver within a vehicle as in flight and racing simulators and it is common to make use of positional audio where the volume of ambient sounds varies depending on their position with respect to the player s avatar br Games with a first person perspective do not require sophisticated animations for the player s avatar and do not need to implement a manual or automated camera control scheme as in third person perspective A first person perspective allows for easier aiming since there is no representation of the avatar to block the player s view However the absence of an avatar can make it difficult to master the timing and distances required to jump between platforms and may cause motion sickness in some players br Players have come to expect first person games to accurately scale objects to appropriate sizes However key objects such as dropped items or levers may be exaggerated in order to improve their visibility br br br Third person perspective br br Third person refers to a graphical perspective rendered from a view that is some distance away usually behind and slightly above from the player s character This viewpoint allows players to see a more strongly characterized avatar and is most common in action and action adventure games This viewpoint poses some difficulties however in that when the player turns or stands with his back to a wall the camera may jerk or end up in awkward positions Developers have tried to alleviate this issue by implementing intelligent camera systems or by giving the player control over the camera There are three primary types of third person camera systems fixed camera systems in which the camera positions are set during the game creation tracking camera systems in which the camera simply follows the player s character and interactive camera systems that are under the player s control br Examples of games utilizing third person perspective include Super Mario the Tomb Raider series the D installments of the Legend of Zelda series and Crash Bandicoot br br br Other topics br br br Stereo graphics br br Stereoscopic video games use stereoscopic technologies to create depth perception for the player by any form of stereo display Such games are not to be confused with video games that use D computer graphics which although they feature graphics on screen do not give the illusion of depth beyond the screen br br br Virtual reality headset br br The graphics for virtual reality gaming consist of a special kind of stereo D graphics to fit the up close display The requirements for latency are also higher to reduce the potential for virtual reality sickness br br br Multi monitor setup br br Many games can run multi monitor setups to achieve very high display resolutions Running games in this way can create a greater sense of immersion e g when playing a video racing game or flight simulator or give a tactical advantage due to the higher field of view br br br Augmented reality br br Augmented reality games typically use D graphics on a single flat screen on a smartphone or tablet or in a head mounted display When playing an AR game on a head mounted device the visuals are displayed on transparent glass that overlays the real world and has D depth through stereoscopic display br br br See also br br br
