A side scrolling video game alternatively side scroller is a game viewed from a side view camera angle where the screen follows the player as they move left or right The jump from single screen or flip screen graphics to scrolling graphics during the golden age of arcade games was a pivotal leap in game design comparable to the move to D graphics during the fifth generation br Hardware support of smooth scrolling backgrounds is built into many arcade video games some game consoles and home computers Examples include bit systems like the Atari bit computers and Nintendo Entertainment System and bit consoles such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis These bit consoles added multiple layers which can be scrolled independently for a parallax scrolling effect br br br History br br br Side scrolling space vehicle games br br Sega s Bomber was a side scrolling shooter video game released for arcades in April Side scrolling was later popularized by side scrolling shoot em ups in the early s Defender demonstrated by Williams Electronics in late and entering production in early allowed side scrolling in both directions in a wrap around game world extending the boundaries of the game world while also including a mini map radar Scramble released by Konami in early had continuous scrolling in a single direction and was the first side scroller with multiple distinct levels br The first scrolling platform game was Jump Bug a platform shooter released in Players controlled a bouncing car and navigated it to jump on various platforms like buildings clouds and hills While it primarily scrolls horizontally one section includes coarse vertical scrolling Taito s first attempt at a side scrolling platformer was the arcade game Jungle King later altered and renamed to Jungle Hunt due to legal controversy over similarities to Tarzan br The side scrolling format was enhanced by parallax scrolling which gives an illusion of depth The background images are presented in multiple layers that scroll at different rates so objects closer to the horizon scroll slower than objects closer to the viewer Some parallax scrolling was used in Jump Bug It used a limited form of parallax scrolling with the main scene scrolling while the starry night sky is fixed and clouds move slowly adding depth to the scenery The following year Irem s Moon Patrol implemented a full form of parallax scrolling with three separate background layers scrolling at different speeds simulating the distance between them Moon Patrol is often credited with popularizing parallax scrolling Jungle Hunt also had parallax scrolling and was released the same month as Moon Patrol in June br Activision published two side scrolling racing games for the Atari VCS in the biplane based Barnstorming and the top view Grand Prix By there were other racing games played from a side scrolling view including Nintendo s Excitebike SNK s Jumping Cross and Mystic Marathon from Williams Electronics a footrace between fantasy creatures br In Konami s side scrolling shooter Gradius gave the player greater control over the choice of weaponry thus introducing another element of strategy The game also introduced the need for the player to memorize levels in order to achieve any measure of success Gradius with its iconic protagonist defined the side scrolling shoot em up and spawned a series spanning several sequels br br br Side scrolling character action games br br In the mid s side scrolling character action games also called side scrolling action games or side scrolling character driven games emerged combining elements from earlier side view single screen character action games such as single screen platform games with the side scrolling of space vehicle games such as scrolling space shoot em ups These new side scrolling character driven action games featured large characters sprites in colorful side scrolling environments with the core gameplay consisting of fighting large groups of weaker enemies using attacks weapons such as punches kicks guns swords ninjutsu or magic br The most notable early example was Irem s Kung Fu Master the first and most influential side scrolling martial arts action game It adapted combat mechanics similar to single screen fighting game Karate Champ for a side scrolling format along with adapting elements from two Hong Kong martial arts films Bruce Lee s Game of Death and Jackie Chan s Wheels on Meals and had elements such as end of level boss battles as well as health meters for the player character and bosses br The side scrolling character action game format was popular from the mid s to the s Popular examples included ninja action games such as Taito s The Legend of Kage and Sega s Shinobi beat em up games such as Techn s Japan s Renegade and Double Dragon and run and gun video games such as Namco s Rolling Thunder and Treasure s Gunstar Heroes Legend of Kage notably had levels that extend in all directions while maintained a side view format On home computers such as the martial arts game Karateka successfully experimented with adding plot to its fighting game action and was also the first side scroller to include cutscenes br Character action games also include scrolling platform games like Super Mario Bros Sonic the Hedgehog and Bubsy Super Mario Bros in particular released for the Nintendo Entertainment System NES console had a significant impact on the game industry establishing the conventions of the scrolling platform genre and helping to reinvigorate the North American home video game market which had crashed in It combined the platform gameplay of Donkey Kong and Mario Bros with side scrolling elements from the racer Excitebike and the beat em up Kung Fu Master and was more expansive than earlier side scrollers striking a balance between arcade like action and longer play sessions suited for home systems br br br Beat em ups br br In Hong Kong cinema inspired Kung Fu Master laid the foundations for side scrolling beat em ups by simplifying the combat of Karate Champ and introducing numerous enemies along a side scrolling playfield In Techn s Japan s Nekketsu K ha Kunio kun introduced street brawling to the genre The Western adaptation Renegade released the same year added an underworld revenge plot that proved more popular with gamers than the principled combat sport of other games Renegade set the standard for future beat em up games as it introduced the ability to move both horizontally and vertically br In the release of Double Dragon ushered in a Golden Age for the beat em up a genre that lasted nearly years The game was designed as Technos Japan s spiritual successor to Renegade but it took the genre to new heights with its detailed set of martial arts attacks and its outstanding two player cooperative gameplay Double Dragon s success largely resulted in a flood of beat em ups that came in the late s where acclaimed titles such as Golden Axe and Final Fight both distinguished themselves from the others Final Fight was Capcom s intended sequel to Street Fighter provisionally titled Street Fighter but the company ultimately gave it a new title Acclaimed as the best game in the genre Final Fight spawned two sequels and was later ported to other systems Golden Axe was acclaimed for its visceral hack and slash action and cooperative mode and was influential through its selection of multiple protagonists with distinct fighting styles It is considered one of the strongest beat em up titles for its fantasy elements distinguishing it from the urban settings seen in other beat em ups br br br Scrolling platform games br br In Pac Land took the scrolling platform game a step further It was not only a successful title but it more closely resembled later scrolling platformers like Wonder Boy and Super Mario Bros It also has multi layered parallax scrolling The same year Sega released Flicky a simple platformer with horizontally scrolling levels and first mascot character Namco followed up Pac Land with the fantasy themed Dragon Buster the following year br Nintendo s platform game Super Mario Bros designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in became the archetype for many scrolling platformers to follow It established many of the conventions of the side scrolling platform genre and struck a balance between arcade like action and longer play sessions suited for home systems helping to reinvigorate the North American home video game market Compared to earlier platformers Super Mario Bros was more expansive with the player having to strategize while scrolling sideways over long distances across colorful levels aboveground as well as underground Its side scrolling elements were influenced by two earlier side scrollers that Miyamoto s team worked on the racer Excitebike and the NES port of beat em up Kung Fu Master It used the same game engine as Excitebike which allowed Mario to accelerate from a walk to a run rather than move at a constant speed like earlier platformers br Super Mario Bros went on to sell over million copies according to the Guinness Book of World Records Its success contributed greatly to popularizing the genre during the bit console generation Sega attempted to emulate this success with their Alex Kidd series as well as with the Wonder Boy series The later Wonder Boy games were also notable for combining adventure and role playing elements with traditional platforming br br br Run and gun br br In Hover Attack for the Sharp X was an early run gun shooter that freely scrolled in all directions and allowed the player to shoot diagonally as well as straight ahead saw the release of Thexder a breakthrough title for platform shooters br Run and gun video games became popular during the mid to late s with titles such as Konami s Green Beret and Namco s Rolling Thunder s Contra was acclaimed for its multi directional aiming and two player cooperative gameplay However by the early s and with the popularity of bit consoles the scrolling shooter genre was overcrowded with developers struggling to make their games stand out br br br IBM PC br Side scrolling was a well known phenomenon in arcades and various home computer and console games of the s as they often possessed hardware optimized for the task like the Atari bit computers and Commodore but IBM compatibles did not Smooth scrolling on IBM PCs in software was a challenge for developers There were a small number of PC ports of smooth scrolling arcade games in the early s including Moon Patrol and Defender The second version of Sopwith released in also featured smooth scrolling br In John Carmack then working for Softdisk developed a smooth scrolling technique known as adaptive tile refresh The technique was demonstrated in the proof of concept game Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement which was a clone of the first level of Super Mario Bros but with Mario replaced by the character Dangerous Dave of earlier Softdisk games The success of the demonstration led Carmack and others at Softdisk to resign and form their own company id Software Id Software went on to develop Commander Keen that same year which was the first publicly available PC platform game to feature smoothly scrolling graphics br br br See also br D
