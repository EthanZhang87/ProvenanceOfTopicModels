Autodesk Softimage or simply Softimage was a D computer graphics application for producing D computer graphics D modeling and computer animation Now owned by Autodesk and formerly titled Softimage XSI the software has been predominantly used in the film video game and advertising industries for creating computer generated characters objects and environments br Released in as the successor to Softimage D Softimage XSI was developed by its eponymous company then a subsidiary of Avid Technology On October Autodesk acquired the Softimage brand and D animation assets from Avid for approximately million thereby ending Softimage Co as a distinct entity In February Softimage XSI was rebranded Autodesk Softimage br A free version of the software called Softimage Mod Tool was developed for the game modding community to create games using the Microsoft XNA toolset for PC and Xbox or to create mods for games using Valve s Source engine Epic Games s Unreal Engine and others It was discontinued with the release of Softimage br On March it was announced that Autodesk Softimage would be discontinued after the release of the version providing product support until April br br br Overview br Autodesk Softimage is a D animation application comprising a suite of computer graphics tools br Modeling tools allow the generation of polygonal or NURBS models Subdivision modeling requires no additional operators and works directly on the polygonal geometry Each modeling operation is tracked by a construction history stack which enables artists to work non destructively Operators in history stacks can be re ordered removed or changed at any time and all adjustments propagate to the final model br Control rigs are created using bones with automatic IK constraints and specialized solvers like spine or tail Optionally the ICE system can be used to create light weight rigs in a node based environment The rigging process can be sped up through the use of adaptable biped and quadruped rigs FaceRobot for facial rigs and automatic lip syncing br Animation features include layers and a mixer which allows combining animation clips non linearly Animation operators are tracked in a construction history stack that is separate from the modeling stack enabling users to change the underlying geometry of already animated characters and objects MOTOR is a feature that transfers animation between characters regardless of their size or proportions GATOR can transfer attributes such as textures UVs weight maps or envelopes between different models Softimage also contains tools to simulate particles particle strands rigid body dynamics soft body dynamics cloth hair and fluids br The default and tightly integrated rendering engine in Softimage is mental ray Materials and shaders are built in a node based fashion When users activate a so called render region in a camera view it will render this section of the scene using the specified rendering engine and update completely interactively A secondary rendering mode is available for rendering real time GPU shaders written in either the Cg or HLSL languages br Also included is the FX Tree which is a built in node based compositor that has direct access to image clips used in the scene It can thus not only be used to finalize and composite rendered frames but also as an integral part of scene creation The FX Tree can be used to apply compositing effects to image clips being used in the fully rendered scene allowing Softimage to render scenes using textures authored or modified in various ways within the same scene br In addition to the node based ICE platform described below Softimage has an extensive API and scripting environment that can be used to extend the software The available scripting languages include C Python VBScript and JScript A C SDK is also available for plug in developers with online documentation available to the public br br br ICE Interactive Creative Environment br br On July the Softimage Co announced Softimage XSI which introduced the ICE Interactive Creative Environment architecture ICE is a visual programming platform that allows users to extend the capabilities of Softimage quickly and intuitively using a node based dataflow diagram This enables artists to create complex D effects and tools without scripting Among the main uses for ICE are procedural modeling deformation rigging and particle simulation It can also be used to control scene attributes without the need to write expressions for example to add camera wiggle or make a light pulsate ICE is a parallel processing engine that takes advantage of multi core CPUs giving users highly scalable performance br ICE represents Softimage functionality using a collection of nodes each with its own specific capabilities Users can connect nodes together visually representing the data flow to create powerful tools and effects Softimage ships with several hundred nodes among them are both low level nodes such as Multiply or Boolean as well as a number of high level nodes called compounds Compounds serve as wrapper nodes to collapse ICE graphs into a single node Softimage allows users to add custom compounds to its main menu system for easy reusability br The screenshot on the right shows an example of a simple geometry deformation ICE graph In a practical scenario one would collapse the graph into a compound and expose important parameters for instance the deformation intensity After adding the tool to the user interface it can easily be applied to other objects Compounds can also be shared between installations because their entire functionality is stored in XML files br The graph based approach of ICE allows for the creation of effects previously attainable only through the use of scripting and or compiled code Due to its visual nature and interactivity it is very accessible for users with no programming experience Many free and commercial ICE tools have been made available by users and rd party developers Softimage contains an ICE based fluid and physics simulator called Lagoa as well as an ICE based version of the Syflex cloth simulator br br br Industry usage br Softimage was primarily used in the film video game and advertising industries as a tool to generate digital characters environments and visual effects Examples of films and other media made with the help of Softimage are Jurassic Park Thor Predators District White House Down Yakuza and Elysium br br br Releases br Autodesk Softimage released April br Autodesk Softimage
