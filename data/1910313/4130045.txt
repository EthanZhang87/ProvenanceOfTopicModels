Signage is the design or use of signs and symbols to communicate a message Signage also means signs collectively or being considered as a group The term signage is documented to have been popularized in to br Signs are any kind of visual graphics created to display information to a particular audience This is typically manifested in the form of wayfinding information in places such as streets or on the inside and outside buildings Signs vary in form and size based on location and intent from more expansive banners billboards and murals to smaller street signs street name signs sandwich boards and lawn signs Newer signs may also use digital or electronic displays br The main purpose of signs is to communicate to convey information designed to assist the receiver with decision making based on the information provided Alternatively promotional signage may be designed to persuade receivers of the merits of a given product or service Signage is distinct from labeling which conveys information about a particular product or service br br br Definition and etymology br The term sign comes from the old French signe noun signer verb meaning a gesture or a motion of the hand This in turn stems from Latin signum indicating an identifying mark token indication symbol proof military standard ensign a signal an omen sign in the heavens constellation In the English the term is also associated with a flag or ensign In France a banner not infrequently took the place of signs or sign boards in the Middle Ages Signs however are best known in the form of painted or carved advertisements for shops inns cinemas etc They are one of various emblematic methods for publicly calling attention to the place to which they refer br The term signage appears to have come into use in the th century as a collective noun used to describe a class of signs especially advertising and promotional signs which came to prominence in the first decades of the twentieth century The Oxford Dictionary defines the term signage as Signs collectively especially commercial or public display signs br br br History br br Some of the earliest signs were used informally to denote the membership of specific groups Early Christians used the sign or a cross or the Ichthys i e fish to denote their religious affiliations whereas the sign of the sun or the moon would serve the same purpose for pagans br The use of commercial signage has a very ancient history Retail signage and promotional signs appear to have developed independently in the East and the West In antiquity the ancient Egyptians Romans and Greeks were known to use signage In ancient Rome signboards were used for shop fronts as well as to announce public events Roman signboards were usually made from stone or terracotta Alternatively they were whitened areas known as albums on the outer walls of shops forums and marketplaces Many Roman examples have been preserved among them the widely recognized bush to indicate a tavern from which is derived the proverb A good wine needs no bush Apart from the bush certain identifiable trade signs that survive into modern times include the three balls of pawnbrokers and the red and white barber s pole Of the signs identified with specific trades some of these later evolved into trademarks This suggests that the early history of commercial signage is intimately tied up with the history of branding and labelling br Recent research suggests that China exhibited a rich history of early retail signage systems One well documented early example of a highly developed brand associated with retail signage is that of the White Rabbit brand of sewing needles from China s Song Dynasty period CE A copper printing plate used to print posters contained message which roughly translates as Jinan Liu s Fine Needle Shop We buy high quality steel rods and make fine quality needles to be ready for use at home in no time The plate also includes a trademark in the form of a white rabbit which signified good luck and was particularly relevant to the primary purchasers women with limited literacy Details in the image show a white rabbit crushing herbs and included advice to shoppers to look for the stone white rabbit in front of the maker s shop Thus the image served as an early form of brand recognition Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song Dynasty Chinese society developed a consumerist culture where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite The rise of a consumer culture prompted the commercial investment in carefully managed company image retail signage symbolic brands trademark protection and sophisticated brand concepts br During the Medieval period the use of signboards was generally optional for traders However publicans were on a different footing As early as the th century English law compelled innkeepers and landlords to exhibit signs In King Richard II of England compelled landlords to erect signs outside their premises The legislation stated Whosoever shall brew ale in the town with intention of selling it must hang out a sign otherwise he shall forfeit his ale Legislation was intended to make public houses easily visible to passing inspectors of the quality of the ale they provided during this period drinking water was not always good to drink and ale was the usual replacement In a publican was prosecuted for failing to display signs The practice of using signs spread to other types of commercial establishments throughout the Middle Ages Similar legislation was enacted in Europe For instance in France edicts were issued and compelling innkeepers and tavern keepers to erect signs br br Large towns where many premises practiced the same trade and especially where these congregated in the same street a simple trade sign was insufficient to distinguish one house from another Thus traders began to employ a variety of devices to differentiate themselves Sometimes the trader used a rebus on his own name e g two cocks for the name of Cox sometimes he adopted a figure of an animal or other object or portrait of a well known person which he considered likely to attract attention Other signs used the common association of two heterogeneous objects which apart from those representing a rebus were in some cases merely a whimsical combination but in others arose from a popular misconception of the sign itself e g the combination of the leg and star may have originated in a representation of the insignia of the garter or from corruption in popular speech e g the combination goat and compasses is said by some to be a corruption of God encompasses br Around this time some manufacturers began to adapt the coats of arms or badges of noble families as a type of endorsement These would be described by the people without consideration of the language of heraldry and thus such signs as the Red Lion the Green Dragon etc have become familiar especially as pub signs By the th and th centuries the number of commercial houses actively displaying the royal arms on their premises packaging and labelling had increased but many claims of royal endorsement were fraudulent By the rules surrounding the display of royal arms were tightened to prevent false claims By the early th century the number of Royal Warrants granted rose rapidly when Queen Victoria granted some royal warrants during her reign of years br Since the object of signboards was to attract the public they were often of an elaborate character Not only were the signs themselves large and sometimes of great artistic merit especially in the th and th centuries when they reached their greatest vogue but the posts or metal supports protruding from the houses over the street from which the signs were swung were often elaborately worked and many beautiful examples of wrought iron supports survive both in England and continental Europe br Exterior signs were a prominent feature of the streets of London from the th century Large overhanging signs became a danger and a nuisance in the narrow ways as the city streets became more congested with vehicular traffic Over time authorities were forced to regulate the size and placement of exterior signage In a French royal order prohibited the excessive size of sign boards and their projection too far over the streets In Paris in and in London about laws were introduced which gradually compelled sign boards to be removed or fixed flat against the wall br For the most part signs only survived in connection with inns for which some of the greatest artists of the time painted sign boards usually representing the name of the inn With the gradual abolition of sign boards the numbering of houses began to be introduced in the early th century in London It had been attempted in Paris as early as and had become almost universal by the close of the th century though not enforced until Another important factor was that during the Middle Ages a large percentage of the population was illiterate and so pictures were more useful as a means of identifying a public house For this reason there was often no reason to write the establishment s name on the sign and inns opened without a formal written name the name being derived later from the illustration on the public house s sign In this sense a pub sign can be thought of as an early example of visual branding br br During the th century some artists specialized in the painting of signboards such as the Austro Hungarian artist Demeter Laccataris Pending this development houses which carried on trade at night e g coffee houses brothels etc had various specific arrangements of lights and these still survive to some extent as in the case of doctors surgeries and chemists dispensaries br Several developments in the early th century provided the impetus for widespread commercial adoption of exterior signage The first spectaculars erected in Manhattan in became commonplace in the first decade of the th century and by the skies were awash with a blaze of illuminated animated signs In the s the newly developed neon sign was introduced to the United States Its flexibility and visibility led to widespread commercial adoption and by the s neon signs were a standard feature of modern building around the world Privilege signs which employed the manufacturer s brand as a form of retail endorsement were common on retail stores during the th century but their use has waned as retailers gained increasing power in the late th century A small number of privilege signs are still present but most have become abandoned ghost signs br An early computer generated hard copy of various size metal printed characters for displays was introduced and patented in Patent US A may have been the first data driven printed example of signage in the USA br Historic retail sign boards br br br br br br br

information about services and facilities such as maps directories instructional signs or interpretive signage used in museums galleries zoos parks and gardens exhibitions tourist and cultural attractions that enhance the customer s experience Retail signage state product names or simply the prices Highway signs Billboards digital displays of stock market quotes etc br Persuasion promotional signage designed to persuade users of the relative merits of a company product or brand br Direction Navigation signs showing the location of services facilities functional spaces and key areas such as sign posts or directional arrows br Identification signs indicating services and facilities such as room names and numbers restroom signs or floor designations br Safety and Regulatory signs giving warning or safety instructions such as warning signs traffic signs exit signs signs indicating what to do in an emergency or natural disaster or signs conveying rules and regulations br Navigation may be exterior or interior e g with interactive screens in the floor as with informational footsteps found in some tourist attractions museums and the like or with other means of dynamic wayfinding br Signs may be used in exterior spaces or on premises locations Signs used on the exterior of a building are often designed to encourage people to enter and on the interior to encourage people to explore the environment and participate in all that the space has to offer Any given sign may perform multiple roles simultaneously For example signage may provide information but may also serve to assist customers navigate their way through a complex service or retail environment br br br Signage conventions br br br Pictograms br br Pictograms are images commonly used to convey the message of a sign In statutory signage pictograms follow specific sets of colour shape and sizing rules based on the laws of the country in which the signage is being displayed For example In UK and EU signage the width of a sign s pictogram must be the height of the area it is printed to In the US in order to comply with the ADA Accessibility Guidelines the same pictogram must be located within its own defined field with raised characters and braille located beneath the field br For a pictogram to be successful it must be recognizable across cultures and languages even if there is no text present Following standard color and shape conventions increases the likelihood that the pictogram and sign will be universally understood br br br Sign shape br The shape of a sign can help to convey its message Shape can be brand or design based or can be part of a set of signage conventions used to standardize sign meaning Usage of particular shapes may vary by country and culture br Some common signage shape conventions are as follows br br Rectangular signs are often used to portray general information to an audience br Circular signs often represent an instruction that must be followed either mandatory or prohibitive br Triangular signs are often warning signs used to convey danger or caution br br br Sign technology br br br Materials br Below is a list of commonly used materials
