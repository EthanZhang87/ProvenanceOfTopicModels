Engineering is the practice of using natural science mathematics and the engineering design process to solve technical problems increase efficiency and productivity and improve systems Modern engineering comprises many subfields which include designing and improving infrastructure machinery vehicles electronics materials and energy systems br The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics applied science and types of application See glossary of engineering br The term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium meaning cleverness br br br Definition br The American Engineers Council for Professional Development ECPD the predecessor of ABET has defined engineering as br br The creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures machines apparatus or manufacturing processes or works utilizing them singly or in combination or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions all as respects an intended function economics of operation and safety to life and property br br br History br br Engineering has existed since ancient times when humans devised inventions such as the wedge lever wheel and pulley etc br The term engineering is derived from the word engineer which itself dates back to the th century when an engine er literally one who builds or operates a siege engine referred to a constructor of military engines In this context now obsolete an engine referred to a military machine i e a mechanical contraption used in war for example a catapult Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps e g the U S Army Corps of Engineers br The word engine itself is of even older origin ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium c meaning innate quality especially mental power hence a clever invention br Later as the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline the term civil engineering entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non military projects and those involved in the discipline of military engineering br br br Ancient era br br The pyramids in ancient Egypt ziggurats of Mesopotamia the Acropolis and Parthenon in Greece the Roman aqueducts Via Appia and Colosseum Teotihuac n and the Brihadeeswarar Temple of Thanjavur among many others stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers Other monuments no longer standing such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Pharos of Alexandria were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World br The six classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East The wedge and the inclined plane ramp were known since prehistoric times The wheel along with the wheel and axle mechanism was invented in Mesopotamia modern Iraq during the th millennium BC The lever mechanism first appeared around years ago in the Near East where it was used in a simple balance scale and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology The lever was also used in the shadoof water lifting device the first crane machine which appeared in Mesopotamia c BC and then in ancient Egyptian technology c BC The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early nd millennium BC and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty BC The screw the last of the simple machines to be invented first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo Assyrian period BC The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines the inclined plane the wedge and the lever to create structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza br The earliest civil engineer known by name is Imhotep As one of the officials of the Pharaoh Djos r he probably designed and supervised the construction of the Pyramid of Djoser the Step Pyramid at Saqqara in Egypt around BC The earliest practical water powered machines the water wheel and watermill first appeared in the Persian Empire in what are now Iraq and Iran by the early th century BC br Kush developed the Sakia during the th century BC which relied on animal power instead of human energy Hafirs were developed as a type of reservoir in Kush to store and contain water as well as boost irrigation Sappers were employed to build causeways during military campaigns Kushite ancestors built speos during the Bronze Age between and BC Bloomeries and blast furnaces were also created during the th centuries BC in Kush br Ancient Greece developed machines in both civilian and military domains The Antikythera mechanism an early known mechanical analog computer and the mechanical inventions of Archimedes are examples of Greek mechanical engineering Some of Archimedes inventions as well as the Antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or epicyclic gearing two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial Revolution and are widely used in fields such as robotics and automotive engineering br Ancient Chinese Greek Roman and Hunnic armies employed military machines and inventions such as artillery which was developed by the Greeks around the th century BC the trireme the ballista and the catapult In the Middle Ages the trebuchet was developed br br br Middle Ages br The earliest practical wind powered machines the windmill and wind pump first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age in what are now Iran Afghanistan and Pakistan by the th century AD The earliest practical steam powered machine was a steam jack driven by a steam turbine described in by Taqi al Din Muhammad ibn Ma ruf in Ottoman Egypt br The cotton gin was invented in India by the th century AD and the spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early th century both of which were fundamental to the growth of the cotton industry The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny which was a key development during the early Industrial Revolution in the th century br The earliest programmable machines were developed in the Muslim world A music sequencer a programmable musical instrument was the earliest type of programmable machine The first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers described in their Book of Ingenious Devices in the th century In Al Jazari invented programmable automata robots He described four automaton musicians including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns br br Before the development of modern engineering mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen such as millwrights clockmakers instrument makers and surveyors Aside from these professions universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology br A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise De re metallica which also contains sections on geology mining and chemistry De re metallica was the standard chemistry reference for the next years br br br Modern era br br The science of classical mechanics sometimes called Newtonian mechanics formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering With the rise of engineering as a profession in the th century the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends Similarly in addition to military and civil engineering the fields then known as the mechanic arts became incorporated into engineering br Canal building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the Industrial Revolution br John Smeaton was the first self proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the father of civil engineering He was an English civil engineer responsible for the design of bridges canals harbors and lighthouses He was also a capable mechanical engineer and an eminent physicist Using a model water wheel Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years determining ways to increase efficiency Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the Newcomen steam engine Smeaton designed the third Eddystone Lighthouse where he pioneered the use of hydraulic lime a form of mortar which will set under water and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse He is important in the history rediscovery of and development of modern cement because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain hydraulicity in lime work which led ultimately to the invention of Portland cement br Applied science led to the development of the steam engine The sequence of events began with the invention of the barometer and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by Evangelista Torricelli in demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by Otto von Guericke using the Magdeburg hemispheres in laboratory experiments by Denis Papin who built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a piston which he published in Edward Somerset nd Marquess of Worcester published a book of inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a coffee percolator Samuel Morland a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that Thomas Savery read In Savery built a steam pump called The Miner s Friend It employed both vacuum and pressure Iron merchant Thomas Newcomen who built the first commercial piston steam engine in was not known to have any scientific training br br The application of steam powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for blast furnaces lead to a large increase in iron production in the late th century The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in blast furnaces which enabled the transition from charcoal to coke These innovations lowered the cost of iron making horse railways and iron bridges practical The puddling process patented by Henry Cort in produced large scale quantities of wrought iron Hot blast patented by James Beaumont Neilson in greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron With the development of the high pressure steam engine the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible New steel making processes such as the Bessemer process and the open hearth furnace ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late th century br One of the most famous engineers of the mid th century was Isambard Kingdom Brunel who built railroads dockyards and steamships br br The Industrial Revolution created a demand for machinery with metal parts which led to the development of several machine tools Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until John Wilkinson invented his boring machine which is considered the first machine tool Other machine tools included the screw cutting lathe milling machine turret lathe and the metal planer Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the th century These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing interchangeable parts lead to large scale factory production by the late th century br The United States Census of listed the occupation of engineer for the first time with a count of There were fewer than engineering graduates in the U S before In there were a dozen U S mechanical engineering graduates with that number increasing to per year in In there were engineers in civil mining mechanical and electrical br There was no chair of applied mechanism and applied mechanics at Cambridge until and no chair of engineering at Oxford until Germany established technical universities earlier br The foundations of electrical engineering in the s included the experiments of Alessandro Volta Michael Faraday Georg Ohm and others and the invention of the electric telegraph in and the electric motor in The theoretical work of James Maxwell see Maxwell s equations and Heinrich Hertz in the late th century gave rise to the field of electronics The later inventions of the vacuum tube and the transistor further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty br Chemical engineering developed in the late nineteenth century Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes br br Aeronautical engineering deals with aircraft design process design while aerospace engineering is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including spacecraft design Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the th century although the work of Sir George Cayley has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the th century Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering br The first PhD in engineering technically applied science and engineering awarded in the United States went to Josiah Willard Gibbs at Yale University in it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U S br Only a decade after the successful flights by the Wright brothers there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in World War I Meanwhile research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining theoretical physics with experiments br br br Main branches of engineering br br Engineering is a broad discipline that is often broken down into several sub disciplines Although an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline he or she may become multi disciplined through experience Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches chemical engineering civil engineering electrical engineering and mechanical engineering br br br Chemical engineering br br Chemical engineering is the application of physics chemistry biology and engineering principles in order to carry out chemical processes on a commercial scale such as the manufacture of commodity chemicals specialty chemicals petroleum refining microfabrication fermentation and biomolecule production br br br Civil engineering br br Civil engineering is the design and construction of public and private works such as infrastructure airports roads railways water supply and treatment etc bridges tunnels dams and buildings Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub disciplines including structural engineering environmental engineering and surveying It is traditionally considered to be separate from military engineering br br br Electrical engineering br br Electrical engineering is the design study and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems such as broadcast engineering electrical circuits generators motors electromagnetic electromechanical devices electronic devices electronic circuits optical fibers optoelectronic devices computer systems telecommunications instrumentation control systems and electronics br br br Mechanical engineering br br Mechanical engineering is the design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems such as power and energy systems aerospace aircraft products weapon systems transportation products engines compressors powertrains kinematic chains vacuum technology vibration isolation equipment manufacturing robotics turbines audio equipments and mechatronics br br br Bioengineering br br Bioengineering is the engineering of biological systems for a useful purpose Examples of bioengineering research include bacteria engineered to produce chemicals new medical imaging technology portable and rapid disease diagnostic devices prosthetics biopharmaceuticals and tissue engineered organs br br br Interdisciplinary engineering br br Interdisciplinary engineering draws from more than one of the principle branches of the practice Historically naval engineering and mining engineering were major branches Other engineering fields are manufacturing engineering acoustical engineering corrosion engineering instrumentation and control aerospace automotive computer electronic information engineering petroleum environmental systems audio software architectural agricultural biosystems biomedical geological textile industrial materials and nuclear engineering These and other branches of engineering are represented in the licensed member institutions of the UK Engineering Council br New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches for example Earth systems engineering and management involves a wide range of subject areas including engineering studies environmental science engineering ethics and philosophy of engineering br br br Other branches of engineering br br br Aerospace engineering br br Aerospace engineering covers the design development manufacture and operational behaviour of aircraft satellites and rockets br br br Marine engineering br br Marine engineering covers the design development manufacture and operational behaviour of watercraft and stationary structures like oil platforms and ports br br br Computer engineering br br Computer engineering CE is a branch of engineering that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering or electrical engineering software design and hardware software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering br br br Geological engineering br br Geological engineering is associated with anything constructed on or within the Earth This discipline applies geological sciences and engineering principles to direct or support the work of other disciplines such as civil engineering environmental engineering and mining engineering Geological engineers are involved with impact studies for facilities and operations that affect surface and subsurface environments such as rock excavations e g tunnels building foundation consolidation slope and fill stabilization landslide risk assessment groundwater monitoring groundwater remediation mining excavations and natural resource exploration br br br Practice br br One who practices engineering is called an engineer and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as Professional Engineer Chartered Engineer Incorporated Engineer Ingenieur European Engineer or Designated Engineering Representative br br br Methodology br br In the engineering design process engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions Engineers need proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects As a result many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their careers br If multiple solutions exist engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements The task of the engineer is to identify understand and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product rather it must also meet further requirements br Constraints may include available resources physical imaginative or technical limitations flexibility for future modifications and additions and other factors such as requirements for cost safety marketability productivity and serviceability By understanding the constraints engineers derive specifications for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated br br br Problem solving br br Engineers use their knowledge of science mathematics logic economics and appropriate experience or tacit knowledge to find suitable solutions to a particular problem Creating an appropriate mathematical model of a problem often allows them to analyze it sometimes definitively and to test potential solutions br More than one solution to a design problem usually exists so the different design choices have to be evaluated on their merits before the one judged most suitable is chosen Genrich Altshuller after gathering statistics on a large number of patents suggested that compromises are at the heart of low level engineering designs while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem br Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full scale production They use among other things prototypes scale models simulations destructive tests nondestructive tests and stress tests Testing ensures that products will perform as expected but only in so far as the testing has been representative of use in service For products such as aircraft that are used differently by different users failures and unexpected shortcomings and necessary design changes can be expected throughout the operational life of the product br Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and except those employed in specific areas of the arms industry will not harm people Engineers typically include a factor of safety in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure br The study of failed products is known as forensic engineering It attempts to identify the cause of failure to allow a redesign of the product and so prevent a re occurrence Careful analysis is needed to establish the cause of failure of a product The consequences of a failure may vary in severity from the minor cost of a machine breakdown to large loss of life in the case of accidents involving aircraft and large stationary structures like buildings and dams br br br Computer use br br As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors computers and software play an increasingly important role As well as the typical business application software there are a number of computer aided applications computer aided technologies specifically for engineering Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes which can be solved using numerical methods br br One of the most widely used design tools in the profession is computer aided design CAD software It enables engineers to create D models D drawings and schematics of their designs CAD together with digital mockup DMU and CAE software such as finite element method analysis or analytic element method allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time consuming physical prototypes br These allow products and components to be checked for flaws assess fit and assembly study ergonomics and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses temperatures electromagnetic emissions electrical currents and voltages digital logic levels fluid flows and kinematics Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of product data management software br There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as computer aided manufacturing CAM software to generate CNC machining instructions manufacturing process management software for production engineering EDA for printed circuit board PCB and circuit schematics for electronic engineers MRO applications for maintenance management and Architecture engineering and construction AEC software for civil engineering br In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as product lifecycle management PLM br br br Social context br br The engineering profession engages in a range of activities from collaboration at the societal level and smaller individual projects Almost all engineering projects are obligated to a funding source a company a set of investors or a government The types of engineering that are less constrained by such a funding source are pro bono and open design engineering br Engineering has interconnections with society culture and human behavior Most products and constructions used by modern society are influenced by engineering Engineering activities have an impact on the environment society economies and public safety br Engineering projects can be controversial Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of nuclear weapons the Three Gorges Dam the design and use of sport utility vehicles and the extraction of oil In response some engineering companies have enacted serious corporate and social responsibility policies br The attainment of many of the Millennium Development Goals requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development br br Overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios Some charitable organizations use engineering directly for development br br Engineers Without Borders br Engineers Against Poverty br Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief br Engineers for a Sustainable World br Engineering for Change br Engineering Ministries International br Engineering companies in more developed economies face challenges with regard to the number of engineers being trained compared with those retiring This problem is prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status There are negative economic and political issues that this can cause as well as ethical issues It is agreed the engineering profession faces an image crisis The UK holds the most engineering companies compared to other European countries together with the United States br br br Code of ethics br br Many engineering societies have established codes of practice and codes of ethics to guide members and inform the public at large The National Society of Professional Engineers code of ethics states br br Engineering is an important and learned profession As members of this profession engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people Accordingly the services provided by engineers require honesty impartiality fairness and equity and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health safety and welfare Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct br In Canada engineers wear the Iron Ring as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession br br br Relationships with other disciplines br br br Science br Scientists study the world as it is engineers create the world that has never been br br There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice in engineering one applies science Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations br Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes Conversely in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena thus becoming for the moment scientists or more precisely engineering scientists br br In the book What Engineers Know and How They Know It Walter Vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research First it often deals with areas in which the basic physics or chemistry are well understood but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner br There is a real and important difference between engineering and physics as similar to any science field has to do with technology Physics is an exploratory science that seeks knowledge of principles while engineering uses knowledge for practical applications of principles The former equates an understanding into a mathematical principle while the latter measures variables involved and creates technology For technology physics is an auxiliary and in a way technology is considered as applied physics Though physics and engineering are interrelated it does not mean that a physicist is trained to do an engineer s job A physicist would typically require additional and relevant training Physicists and engineers engage in different lines of work But PhD physicists who specialize in sectors of engineering physics and applied physics are titled as Technology officer R D Engineers and System Engineers br An example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the Navier Stokes equations to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft or the use of the finite element method to calculate the stresses in complex components Second engineering research employs many semi empirical methods that are foreign to pure scientific research one example being the method of parameter variation br As stated by Fung et al in the revision to the classic engineering text Foundations of Solid Mechanics br br Engineering is quite different from science Scientists try to understand nature Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature Engineers stress innovation and invention To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms and design something that people can use That something can be a complex system device a gadget a material a method a computing program an innovative experiment a new solution to a problem or an improvement on what already exists Since a design has to be realistic and functional it must have its geometry dimensions and characteristics data defined In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions Most often they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge Thus they studied mathematics physics chemistry biology and mechanics Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession Thus engineering sciences were born br Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles engineers must also take into account safety efficiency economy reliability and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution br br br Medicine and biology br br The study of the human body albeit from different directions and for different purposes is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines Medicine aims to sustain repair enhance and even replace functions of the human body if necessary through the use of technology br br Modern medicine can replace several of the body s functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as for example brain implants and pacemakers The fields of bionics and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems br Conversely some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing biology with technology This has led to fields such as artificial intelligence neural networks fuzzy logic and robotics There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine br Both fields provide solutions to real world problems This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and empirical knowledge is an integral part of both br Medicine in part studies the function of the human body The human body as a biological machine has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods br The heart for example functions much like a pump the skeleton is like a linked structure with levers the brain produces electrical signals etc These similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of engineering principles in medicine led to the development of the field of biomedical engineering that uses concepts developed in both disciplines br Newly emerging branches of science such as systems biology are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering such as systems modeling and computational analysis to the description of biological systems br br br Art br br There are connections between engineering and art for example architecture landscape architecture and industrial design even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university s Faculty of Engineering br The Art Institute of Chicago for instance held an exhibition about the art of NASA s aerospace design Robert Maillart s bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic At the University of South Florida an engineering professor through a grant with the National Science Foundation has developed a course that connects art and engineering br Among famous historical figures Leonardo da Vinci is a well known Renaissance artist and engineer and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering br br br Business br Business engineering deals with the relationship between professional engineering IT systems business administration and change management Engineering management or Management engineering is a specialized field of management concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector The demand for management focused engineers or from the opposite perspective managers with an understanding of engineering has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles During an engineering management course students will develop industrial engineering skills knowledge and expertise alongside knowledge of business administration management techniques and strategic thinking Engineers specializing in change management must have in depth knowledge of the application of industrial and organizational psychology principles and methods Professional engineers often train as certified management consultants in the very specialized field of management consulting applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector This work often deals with large scale complex business transformation or business process management initiatives in aerospace and defence automotive oil and gas machinery pharmaceutical food and beverage electrical and electronics power distribution and generation utilities and transportation systems This combination of technical engineering practice management consulting practice industry sector knowledge and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives These initiatives are typically sponsored by C level executives br br br Other fields br In political science the term engineering has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of social engineering and political engineering which deal with forming political and social structures using engineering methodology coupled with political science principles Marketing engineering and financial engineering have similarly borrowed the term br br br See
