Design bid build or design bid build and abbreviated D B B or D B B accordingly also known as Design tender or design tender traditional method or hardbid is a project delivery method in which the agency or owner contracts with separate entities for the design and construction of a project br Design bid build is the traditional method for project delivery and differs in several substantial aspects from design build br There are three main sequential phases to the design bid build delivery method br br The design phase br The bidding or tender phase br The construction phase br br br Design phase br In this phase the owner retains an architect or consulting engineer for infrastructure works to design and produce bid documents including construction drawings and technical specifications on which various general contractors will in turn bid to construct the project For building projects the architect will work with the owner to identify the owner s needs develop a written program documenting those needs and then produce a conceptual and or schematic design This early design is then developed and the architect will usually bring in other design professionals including a structural engineer sometimes a civil engineer mechanical electrical and plumbing engineers MEP engineers a fire protection engineer and often a landscape architect to help complete the construction drawings and technical specifications The finished bid documents are coordinated by the architect and owner for issuance to general contractors during the bid phase br Design fees are typically between of the total project cost br br br Bid or tender phase br br Bidding can be open in which any qualified bidder may participate or select in which a limited number of pre selected contractors are invited to bid br The various general contractors bidding on the project obtain copies of the bid or tender documents and then put them out to multiple subcontractors for bids on sub components of the project Sub components include items such as the concrete work structural steel frame electrical systems HVAC and landscaping Questions may arise during the bid or tender period and the architect will typically issue clarifications or corrections to the bid documents in the form of addenda From these elements the contractor compiles a complete bid or tender price for submission by the established closing date and time i e bid date Bids can be based on the quantities of materials in the completed construction e g as in the UK with bills of quantities the operations needed to build it e g as in operational bills or simply as a lump sum cost however these bid requirements are elucidated within the bid documents br Once bids are received the architect typically reviews the bids seeks any clarifications required of the bidders investigates contractor qualifications ensures all documentation is in order including bonding if required and advises the owner as to the ranking of the bids If the bids fall in a range acceptable to the owner the owner and architect discuss the suitability of various bidders and their proposals The owner is not obligated to accept the lowest bid and it is customary for other factors including past performance and quality of other work to influence the selection process However the project is typically awarded to the general contractor with the lowest bid br In the event that all of the bids do not satisfy the needs of the owner whether for financial reasons or otherwise the owner may choose to reject all bids The following options become available to the owner br br Re bid or re tender the construction of the project on a future date when the owner s needs are met such as when money becomes available and or construction costs go down br Abandon the project entirely br Issue a work order to have the architect revise the design sometimes at no cost to the Owner if previously negotiated so as to make the project smaller or more efficient or reduce features or elements of the project to bring the cost down The revised bid documents can then be issued again for bid or re tendered br Select a general contractor such as the lowest bidder or an experienced cost estimator to assist the architect with design changes aimed at cost reduction This process is often referred to as value engineering The revised bid documents can then be issued again for bid or re tendered br br br Construction phase br Once the construction of the project has been awarded to the contractor the bid documents e g approved construction drawings and technical specifications may not be altered The necessary permits for example a building permit must be achieved from all jurisdictional authorities in order for the construction process to begin Should design changes be necessary during construction whether initiated by the contractor owner or as discovered by the architect the architect may issue sketches or written clarifications The contractor may be required to document as built conditions to the owner br In most instances nearly every component of a project is supplied and installed by sub contractors The general contractor may provide work with its own forces but it is common for a general contractor to limit its role primarily to managing the construction process and daily activity on a construction site see also construction management br During the construction phase the architect also acts as the owner s agent to review the progress of the work as it relates to pay requests from the Contractor and to issue site instructions change orders or field orders or other documentation necessary to facilitate the construction process and certify that the project is built to the approved construction drawings br br br Potential problems of design bid build br Failure of the design team to retain current familiarity with construction costs and any potential cost increases during the design phase could cause project delays if the construction documents must be redone to reduce costs br Redesign expense can be disputed should the architect s contract not specifically address the issue of revisions required to reduce costs br Development of a cheaper is better mentality amongst the general contractors bidding the project so there is the tendency to seek out the lowest cost sub contractors in a given market In strong markets general contractors will be able to be selective about which projects to bid but in lean times the desire for work usually forces the low bidder of each trade to be selected This usually results in increased risk for the general contractor and can also compromise the quality of construction In the extreme it can lead to serious disputes involving quality of the final product or bankruptcy of a sub contractor who was on the brink of insolvency desperate for work br As the general contractor is brought to the team post design there is little opportunity for input on effective alternates being presented br Pressures may be exerted on the design and construction teams due to competing interests e g economy versus acceptable quality which may lead to disputes between the architect and the general contractor and associated delays in construction br br br Benefits of design bid build br The design team looks out for the interests of the owner br The design team prepares documents on which all general contractors place bids With this in mind the cheaper is better argument is rendered invalid since the bids are based on complete documents Incomplete incorrect or missed items are usually discovered and addressed during the bid process in the form of addenda br Ensures fairness to potential bidders and improves decision making by the owner by providing a range of potential options It also identifies new potential contractors br Assists the owner in establishing reasonable prices for the project br Uses competition both in the selection of the architect and the contractor to improve the efficiency and quality for owners br br br See also br Architectural services br Architectural engineering br Civil engineering br Construction
