A design is the concept of or proposal for an object process or system The word design refers to something that is or has been intentionally created by a thinking agent although it is sometimes used to refer to the inherent nature of something its design The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design In some cases the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan may also be considered to be a design such as in arts and crafts A design is expected to have a purpose within a certain context usually having to satisfy certain goals and constraints and to take into account aesthetic functional economic environmental or socio political considerations Traditional examples of designs include architectural and engineering drawings circuit diagrams sewing patterns and less tangible artefacts such as business process models br br br Designing br People who produce designs are called designers The term designer generally refers to someone who works professionally in one of the various design areas Within the professions the word designer is generally qualified by the area of practice for example a fashion designer a product designer a web designer or an interior designer but it can also designate others such as architects and engineers see below Types of designing A designer s sequence of activities to produce a design is called a design process with some employing designated processes such as design thinking and possibly design methods The process of creating a design can be brief a quick sketch or lengthy and complicated involving considerable research negotiation reflection modeling interactive adjustment and re design br Designing is also a widespread activity outside of the professions of those formally recognized as designers In his influential book The Sciences of the Artificial the interdisciplinary scientist Herbert A Simon proposed that Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones And according to the design researcher Nigel Cross Everyone can and does design and Design ability is something that everyone has to some extent because it is embedded in our brains as a natural cognitive function br br br History of design br br The study of design history is complicated by varying interpretations of what constitutes designing Many design historians such as John Heskett start with the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production Others subscribe to conceptions of design that include pre industrial objects and artefacts beginning their narratives of design in prehistorical times Originally situated within art history the historical development of the discipline of design history coalesced in the s as interested academics worked to recognize design as a separate and legitimate target for historical research Early influential design historians include German British art historian Nikolaus Pevsner and Swiss historian and architecture critic Sigfried Giedion br br br Design education br Institutions for design education date back to the nineteenth century The Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry was founded in followed by the United Kingdom s Government School of Design Konstfack in Sweden and Rhode Island School of Design in the United States Polish Towarzystwo Polska Sztuka Stosowana and Warsztaty Krakowskie The German art and design school Bauhaus founded in greatly influenced modern design education br Design education covers the teaching of theory knowledge and values in the design of products services and environments and focuses on the development of both particular and general skills for designing Its primary orientation is to prepare students for professional design practice based around project work and studio or atelier teaching methods br There are also broader forms of higher education in design studies and design thinking Design also features as a part of general education for example within Design and Technology The development of design in general education in the s created a need to identify fundamental aspects of designerly ways of knowing thinking and acting resulting in the establishment of design as a distinct discipline of study br br br Design process br Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields whether amateur or professional alone or in teams produce designs Design researchers Dorst and Dijkhuis acknowledged that there are many ways of describing design processes and compare and contrast two dominant but different views of the design process as a rational problem solving process and as a process of reflection in action They suggested that these two paradigms represent two fundamentally different ways of looking at the world positivism and constructionism The paradigms may reflect differing views of how designing should be done and how it actually is done and they both have a variety of names The problem solving view has been called the rational model technical rationality and the reason centric perspective The alternative view has been called reflection in action co evolution and the action centric perspective br br br Rational model br The rational model was independently developed by Herbert A Simon an American scientist and two German engineering design theorists Gerhard Pahl and Wolfgang Beitz It posits that br br Designers attempt to optimize a design candidate for known constraints and objectives br The design process is plan driven br The design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of stages br The rational model is based on a rationalist philosophy and underlies the waterfall model systems development life cycle and much of the engineering design literature According to the rationalist philosophy design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner br Typical stages consistent with the rational model include the following br br Pre production design br Design brief initial statement of intended outcome br Analysis analysis of design goals br Research investigating similar designs in the field or related topics br Specification specifying requirements of a design for a product product design specification or service br Problem solving conceptualizing and documenting designs br Presentation presenting designs br Design during production br Development continuation and improvement of a design br Product testing in situ testing of a design br Post production design feedback for future designs br Implementation introducing the design into the environment br Evaluation and conclusion summary of process and results including constructive criticism and suggestions for future improvements br Redesign any or all stages in the design process repeated with corrections made at any time before during or after production br Each stage has many associated best practices br br br Criticism of the rational model br The rational model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds br br Designers do not work this way extensive empirical evidence has demonstrated that designers do not act as the rational model suggests br Unrealistic assumptions goals are often unknown when a design project begins and the requirements and constraints continue to change br br br Action centric model br The action centric perspective is a label given to a collection of interrelated concepts which are antithetical to the rational model It posits that br br Designers use creativity and emotion to generate design candidates br The design process is improvised br No universal sequence of stages is apparent analysis design and implementation are contemporary and inextricably linked br The action centric perspective is based on an empiricist philosophy and broadly consistent with the agile approach and methodical development Substantial empirical evidence supports the veracity of this perspective in describing the actions of real designers Like the rational model the action centric model sees design as informed by research and knowledge br At least two views of design activity are consistent with the action centric perspective Both involve these three basic activities br br In the reflection in action paradigm designers alternate between framing making moves and evaluating moves Framing refers to conceptualizing the problem i e defining goals and objectives A move is a tentative design decision The evaluation process may lead to further moves in the design br In the sensemaking coevolution implementation framework designers alternate between its three titular activities Sensemaking includes both framing and evaluating moves Implementation is the process of constructing the design object Coevolution is the process where the design agent simultaneously refines its mental picture of the design object based on its mental picture of the context and vice versa br The concept of the design cycle is understood as a circular time structure which may start with the thinking of an idea then expressing it by the use of visual or verbal means of communication design tools the sharing and perceiving of the expressed idea and finally starting a new cycle with the critical rethinking of the perceived idea Anderson points out that this concept emphasizes the importance of the means of expression which at the same time are means of perception of any design ideas br br br Philosophies br Philosophy of design is the study of definitions assumptions foundations and implications of design There are also many informal philosophies for guiding design such as personal values or preferred approaches br br br Approaches to design br Some of these values and approaches include br br Critical design uses designed artefacts as an embodied critique or commentary on existing values morals and practices in a culture Critical design can make aspects of the future physically present to provoke a reaction br Ecological design is a design approach that prioritizes the consideration of the environmental impacts of a product or service over its whole lifecycle Ecodesign research focuses primarily on barriers to implementation ecodesign tools and methods and the intersection of ecodesign with other research disciplines br Participatory design originally co operative design now often co design is the practice of collective creativity to design attempting to actively involve all stakeholders e g employees partners customers citizens end users in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable Recent research suggests that designers create more innovative concepts and ideas when working within a co design environment with others than they do when creating ideas on their own br Scientific design refers to industrialised design based on scientific knowledge Science can be used to study the effects and need for a potential or existing product in general and to design products that are based on scientific knowledge For instance a scientific design of face masks for COVID mitigation may be based on investigations of filtration performance mitigation performance thermal comfort biodegradability and flow resistance br Service design is a term that is used for designing or organizing the experience around a product and the service associated with a product s use The purpose of service design methodologies is to establish the most effective practices for designing services according to both the needs of users and the competencies and capabilities of service providers br Sociotechnical system design a philosophy and tools for participative designing of work arrangements and supporting processes for organizational purpose quality safety economics and customer requirements in core work processes the quality of peoples experience at work and the needs of society br Transgenerational design the practice of making products and environments compatible with those physical and sensory impairments associated with human aging and which limit major activities of daily living br User centered design which focuses on the needs wants and limitations of the end user of the designed artefact One aspect of user centered design is ergonomics br br br Relationship with the arts br br The boundaries between art and design are blurry largely due to a range of applications both for the term art and the term design Applied arts can include industrial design graphic design fashion design and the decorative arts which traditionally includes craft objects In graphic arts D image making that ranges from photography to illustration the distinction is often made between fine art and commercial art based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded br br br Types of designing br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br br
