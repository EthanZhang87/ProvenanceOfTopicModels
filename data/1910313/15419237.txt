id: 15419237
In broad terms transformation design is a human centered interdisciplinary process that seeks to create desirable and sustainable changes in behavior and form of individuals systems and organizations It is a multi stage iterative process of applying design principles to large and complex systems br Its practitioners examine problems holistically rather than reductively to understand relationships as well as components to better frame the challenge They then prototype small scale systems composed of objects services interactions and experiences that support people and organizations in achievement of a desired change Successful prototypes are then scaled br Because transformation design is about applying design skills in non traditional territories it often results in non traditional design outputs Projects have resulted in the creation of new roles new organizations new systems and new policies These designers are just as likely to shape a job description as they are a new product br This emerging field draws from a variety of design disciplines service design user centered design participatory design concept design information design industrial design graphic design systems design interactive design experience design as well as non design disciplines including cognitive psychology and perceptual psychology linguistics cognitive science architecture haptics information architecture ethnography storytelling and heuristics br br br History br Though academics have written about the economic value of and need for transformations over the years its practice first emerged in when The Design Council the UK s national strategic body for design formed RED a self proclaimed do tank challenged to bring design thinking to the transformation of public services br This move was in response to Prime Minister Tony Blair s desire to have public services redesigned around the needs of the user the patients the passenger the victim of crime br The RED team led by Hilary Cottam studied these big complex problems to determine how design thinking and design techniques could help government rethink the systems and structures within public services and possibly redesign them from beginning to end br Between and the RED team in collaboration with many other people and groups developed techniques processes and outputs that were able to transform social issues such as preventing illness managing chronic illnesses senior citizen care rural transportation energy conservation re offending prisoners and public education br In Braunschweig University of Art Germany has launched a new MA in Transformation Design In The Glasgow School of Art launched another masters program M Des in Design Innovation and Transformation Design In the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg Germany launched a masters program in Transformation Design br br br Process br Transformation design like user centered design starts from the perspective of the end user Designers spend a great deal of time not only learning how users currently experience the system and how they want to experience the system but also co creating with them the designed solutions br Because transformation design tackles complex issues involving many stakeholders and components more expertise beyond the user and the designer is always required People such as but not limited to policy makers sector analysts psychologists economists private businesses government departments and agencies front line workers and academics are invited to participate in the entire design process from problem definition to solution development br With so many points of view brought into the process transformation designers are not always designers Instead they often play the role of moderator Though varying methods of participation and co creation these moderating designers create hands on collaborative workshops a k a charrette that make the design process accessible to the non designers br Ideas from workshops are rapidly prototyped and beta tested in the real world with a group of real end users Their experience with and opinions of the prototypes are recorded and fed back into the workshops and development of the next prototype br br br See also br Human centered design br br br Sources br RED s homepage br https www designcouncil org uk Design Council s homepage br White Paper
