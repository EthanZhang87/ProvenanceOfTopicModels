A design engineer is an engineer focused on the engineering design process in any of the various engineering disciplines including civil mechanical electrical chemical textiles aerospace nuclear manufacturing systems and structural building architectural and design disciplines like Human Computer Interaction br Design engineers tend to work on products and systems that involve adapting and using complex scientific and mathematical techniques The emphasis tends to be on utilizing engineering physics and other applied sciences to develop solutions for society br A design engineer usually works with a team of other engineers and other types of designers e g industrial designers to develop conceptual and detailed designs that ensure a product functions performs and is fit for its purpose They may also work with marketers to develop the product concept and specifications to meet customer needs and may direct the design effort In many engineering areas a distinction is made between the design engineer and other engineering roles e g planning engineer project engineer test engineer Analysis tends to play a larger role for the latter areas while synthesis is more paramount for the former nevertheless all such roles are technically part of the overall engineering design process br When an engineering project involves public safety design engineers involved are often required to be licensed for example as a Professional Engineer in the U S and Canada There is often an industrial exemption for engineers working on project only internally to their organization although the scope and conditions of such exemptions vary widely across jurisdictions br br br Design engineer tasks br Design engineers may work in a team along with other designers to create the drawings necessary for prototyping and production or in the case of buildings for construction However with the advent of CAD and solid modeling software the design engineers may create the drawings themselves or perhaps with the help of many corporate service providers br The next responsibility of many design engineers is prototyping A model of the product is created and reviewed Prototypes are either functional or non functional Functional alpha prototypes are used for testing non functional prototypes are used for form and fit checking Virtual prototyping and hence for any such software solutions may also be used This stage is where design flaws are found and corrected and tooling manufacturing fixtures and packaging are developed br Once the alpha prototype is finalized after many iterations the next step is the beta pre production prototype The design engineer working with an industrial engineer manufacturing engineer and quality engineer reviews an initial run of components and assemblies for design compliance and fabrication manufacturing methods analysis This is often determined through statistical process control Variations in the product are correlated to aspects of the process and eliminated The most common metric used is the process capability index Cpk A Cpk of is considered the baseline acceptance for full production go ahead br The design engineer may follow the product and make requested changes and corrections throughout the whole life of the product This is referred to as cradle to grave engineering The design engineer works closely with the manufacturing engineer throughout the product life cycle and is often required to investigate and validate design changes which could lead to possible production cost reductions in order to consistently reduce the price as the product becomes mature and thus subject to discounting to defend market volumes against newer competing products Moreover design changes may be also made mandatory by updates in laws and regulations br The design process is an information intensive one and design engineers have been found to spend of their time engaged in various information behaviours including actively searching for information In addition to design engineers core technical competence research has demonstrated the critical nature of their personal attributes project management skills and cognitive abilities to succeed in the role br Amongst other more detailed findings a recent work sampling study found that design engineers spend of their time engaged in technical work in social work and in computer based work There was considerable overlap between these different types of work with engineers spending of their time engaged in technical and social work in technical and non social in non technical and social and in non technical and non social br br br See also br Architectural engineering also known as building engineering br Chemical engineering br Civil engineering br Electrical engineering br Industrial design engineering br Industrial engineering br Manufacturing engineering br Mechanical engineering br New product development br Production engineering br Test engineer br Tool engineering br br br
