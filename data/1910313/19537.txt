id: 19537
A multi user dungeon MUD also known as a multi user dimension or multi user domain is a multiplayer real time virtual world usually text based or storyboarded MUDs combine elements of role playing games hack and slash player versus player interactive fiction and online chat Players can read or view descriptions of rooms objects other players and non player characters and perform actions in the virtual world that are typically also described Players typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that resemble a natural language as well as using a character typically called an avatar br Traditional MUDs implement a role playing video game set in a fantasy world populated by fictional races and monsters with players choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or powers The objective of this sort of game is to slay monsters explore a fantasy world complete quests go on adventures create a story by roleplaying and advance the created character Many MUDs were fashioned around the dice rolling rules of the Dungeons Dragons series of games br Such fantasy settings for MUDs are common while many others have science fiction settings or are based on popular books movies animations periods of history worlds populated by anthropomorphic animals and so on Not all MUDs are games some are designed for educational purposes while others are purely chat environments and the flexible nature of many MUD servers leads to their occasional use in areas ranging from computer science research to geoinformatics to medical informatics to analytical chemistry MUDs have attracted the interest of academic scholars from many fields including communications sociology law and economics At one time there was interest from the United States military in using them for teleconferencing br Most MUDs are run as hobbies and are free to play some may accept donations or allow players to purchase virtual items while others charge a monthly subscription fee MUDs can be accessed via standard telnet clients or specialized MUD clients which are designed to improve the user experience Numerous games are listed at various web portals such as The Mud Connector br The history of modern massively multiplayer online role playing games MMORPGs like EverQuest and Ultima Online and related virtual world genres such as the social virtual worlds exemplified by Second Life can be traced directly back to the MUD genre Indeed before the invention of the term MMORPG games of this style were simply called graphical MUDs A number of influential MMORPG designers began as MUD developers and or players such as Raph Koster Brad McQuaid Matt Firor and Brian Green or were involved with early MUDs like Mark Jacobs and J Todd Coleman br br br Early history br br br Origins br Colossal Cave Adventure created in by Will Crowther on a DEC PDP computer was the first widely played adventure game The game was significantly expanded in by Don Woods Also called Adventure it contained many D D features and references including a computer controlled dungeon master br Numerous dungeon crawlers were created on the PLATO system at the University of Illinois and other American universities that used PLATO beginning in Among them were pedit oubliette moria avatar krozair dungeon dnd crypt and drygulch By these games were heavily in use on various PLATO systems and exhibited a marked increase in sophistication in terms of D graphics storytelling user involvement team play and depth of objects and monsters in the dungeons br Inspired by Adventure a group of students at MIT in the summer of wrote a game for the PDP minicomputer called Zork it became quite popular on the ARPANET Zork was ported under the filename DUNGEN dungeon to FORTRAN by a programmer working at DEC in br In Roy Trubshaw a student at the University of Essex in the UK started working on a multi user adventure game in the MACRO assembly language for a DEC PDP He named the game MUD Multi User Dungeon in tribute to the Dungeon variant of Zork which Trubshaw had greatly enjoyed playing Trubshaw converted MUD to BCPL the predecessor of C before handing over development to Richard Bartle a fellow student at the University of Essex in The game revolved around gaining points till one achieved the Wizard rank giving the character immortality and special powers over mortals br br br Wider access and early derivatives br MUD better known as Essex MUD and MUD in later years ran on the University of Essex network and became more widely accessible when a guest account was set up that allowed users on JANET a British academic X computer network to connect on weekends and between the hours of AM and AM on weekdays It became the first Internet multiplayer online role playing game in and started the online gaming industry as a whole when the university connected its internal network to ARPANet br The original MUD game was closed down in late reportedly under pressure from CompuServe to whom Richard Bartle had licensed the game This left MIST a derivative of MUD with similar gameplay as the only remaining MUD running on the University of Essex network becoming one of the first of its kind to attain broad popularity MIST ran until the machine that hosted it a PDP was superseded in early br saw the origin of a number of projects inspired by the original MUD These included Gods by Ben Laurie a MUD clone that included online creation in its endgame and which became a commercial MUD in and MirrorWorld a tolkienesque MUD started by Pip Cordrey who gathered some people on a BBS he ran to create a MUD clone that would run on a home computer br Neil Newell an avid MUD player started programming his own MUD called SHADES during Christmas because MUD was closed down during the holidays Starting out as a hobby SHADES became accessible in the UK as a commercial MUD via British Telecom s Prestel and Micronet networks A scandal on SHADES led to the closure of Micronet as described in Indra Sinha s net memoir The Cybergypsies br At the same time Compunet started a project named Multi User Galaxy Game as a science fiction alternative to MUD a copy of which they were running on their system at the time When one of the two programmers left CompuNet the remaining programmer Alan Lenton decided to rewrite the game from scratch and named it Federation II at the time no Federation I existed The MUD was officially launched in Federation II was later picked up by AOL where it became known simply as Federation Adult Space Fantasy Federation later left AOL to run on its own after AOL began offering unlimited service br br br Other early MUD like games br In around the same time Roy Trubshaw wrote MUD Alan E Klietz wrote a game called Scepter Scepter of Goth and later called Milieu using Multi Pascal on a CDC Cyber series mainframe which was operated by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium Klietz ported Milieu to an IBM XT in naming the new port Scepter of Goth Scepter supported to simultaneous users typically connecting in by modem It was the first commercial MUD franchises were sold to a number of locations Scepter was first owned and run by GamBit of Minneapolis Minnesota founded by Bob Alberti GamBit s assets were later sold to Interplay Productions br In Mark Peterson wrote The Realm of Angmar beginning as a clone of Scepter of Goth In Peterson rewrote The Realm of Angmar adapting it to MS DOS the basis for many dial in BBS systems and renamed it Swords of Chaos For a few years this was a very popular form of MUD hosted on a number of BBS systems until widespread Internet access eliminated most BBSes br In Mark Jacobs created and deployed a commercial gaming site Gamers World The site featured two games coded and designed by Jacobs a MUD called Aradath which was later renamed upgraded and ported to GEnie as Dragon s Gate and a X science fiction game called Galaxy which was also ported to GEnie At its peak the site had about monthly subscribers to both Aradath and Galaxy GEnie was shut down in the late s although Dragon s Gate was later brought to AOL before it was finally released on its own Dragon s Gate was closed on February br In the summer of University of Virginia classmates John Taylor and Kelton Flinn wrote Dungeons of Kesmai a six player game inspired by Dungeons Dragons which used roguelike ASCII graphics They founded the Kesmai company in and in an enhanced version of Dungeons of Kesmai Island of Kesmai was launched on CompuServe Later its D graphical descendant Legends of Kesmai was launched on AOL in The games were retired commercially in br The popularity of MUDs of the University of Essex tradition escalated in the United States during the late s when affordable personal computers with to bit s modems enabled role players to log into multi line BBSs and online service providers such as CompuServe During this time it was sometimes said that MUD stands for Multi Undergraduate Destroyer due to their popularity among college students and the amount of time devoted to them br Avalon The Legend Lives was published by Yehuda Simmons in It was the first persistent game world of its kind without the traditional hourly resets and points based puzzle solving progression systems Avalon introduced equilibrium and balance cooldowns skill based player vs player combat and concepts such as player run governments and player housing br br br Later history br In significant usages of MUDs included online gaming education socializing and religious rituals or other religious activities br br br Popular variants br br br AberMUD br br The first popular MUD codebase was AberMUD written in by Alan Cox named after the University of Wales Aberystwyth Alan Cox had played the original University of Essex MUD and the gameplay was heavily influenced by it AberMUD was initially written in B for a Honeywell L mainframe under GCOS TSS In late it was ported to C which enabled it to spread rapidly to many Unix platforms upon its release in AberMUD s popularity resulted in several inspired works the most notable of which were TinyMUD LPMud and DikuMUD br br br TinyMUD br Monster was a multi user adventure game created by Richard Skrenta for the VAX and written in VMS Pascal It was publicly released in November Monster was disk based and modifications to the game were immediate Monster pioneered the approach of allowing players to build the game world setting new puzzles or creating dungeons for other players to explore Monster which comprised about lines of code had a lot of features which appeared to be designed to allow Colossal Cave Adventure to work in it Though there never were many network accessible Monster servers it inspired James Aspnes to create a stripped down version of Monster which he called TinyMUD br TinyMUD written in C and released in late spawned a number of descendants including TinyMUCK and TinyMUSH TinyMUCK version contained a full programming language named MUF Multi User Forth while MUSH greatly expanded the command interface To distance itself from the combat oriented traditional MUDs it was said that the D in TinyMUD stood for Multi User Domain or Dimension this along with the eventual popularity of acronyms other than MUD such as MUCK MUSH MUSE and so on for this kind of server led to the eventual adoption of the term MU to refer to the TinyMUD family UberMUD UnterMUD and MOO were inspired by TinyMUD but are not direct descendants br TinyMUD is also used to refer to the first database run under the TinyMUD codebase which is also known as TinyMUD Classic it ran from August to April and still comes back up every August during a holiday called Brigadoon Day a reference to the Scottish village in the musical Brigadoon br br br Hourglass br The first version of Hourglass was written by Yehuda Simmons and later Daniel James for Avalon The Legend Lives which debuted in at the last of the London MUD mega Meets aptly named Adventure and initially hosted on the IOWA system Initially written in ARM assembly language on the Acorn Archimedes in it made the leap from the venerable Archimedes to Debian Linux on the PC and later Red Hat where other than shifting to Ubuntu it has remained ever since An early version of Hourglass was also ported to the PC named Vortex by Ben Maizels in br Although written specifically for Avalon The Legend Lives it went on to spawn a number of games including Avalon The First Age which ran from to The now defunct Age of Thrones and notably Achaea Dreams of Divine Lands started life in Vortex prior to moving to its own Rapture engine Hourglass continues to be developed as of and Avalon The Legend Lives currently has written words and lines of game code with instructions The original game came in at KB in compared to GB in January br br br LPMud br br In LPMud was developed by Lars Pensj hence the LP in LPMud Pensj had been an avid player of TinyMUD and AberMUD and wanted to create a world with the flexibility of TinyMUD and the gameplay of AberMUD In order to accomplish this he wrote what is nowadays known as a virtual machine which he called the LPMud driver that ran the C like LPC programming language used to create the game world Pensj s interest in LPMud eventually waned and development was carried on by others such as J rn Amylaar Rennecke Felix Dworkin Croes Tim Beek Hollebeek and Lars D ning During the early s LPMud was one of the most popular MUD codebases Descendants of the original LPMud include MudOS DGD SWLPC FluffOS and the Pike programming language the latter the work of long time LPMud developer Fredrik Profezzorn H binette br br br DikuMUD br br In the release of DikuMUD which was inspired by AberMUD led to a virtual explosion of hack and slash MUDs based upon its code DikuMUD inspired numerous derivative codebases including CircleMUD Merc ROM SMAUG and GodWars The original Diku team comprised Sebastian Hammer Tom Madsen Katja Nyboe Michael Seifert and Hans Henrik Staerfeldt DikuMUD had a key influence on the early evolution of the MMORPG genre with EverQuest created by avid DikuMUD player Brad McQuaid displaying such Diku like gameplay that Verant developers were made to issue a sworn statement that no actual DikuMUD code was incorporated br br br Simutronics br br In David Whatley having previously played Scepter of Goth and Island of Kesmai founded Simutronics with Tom and Susan Zelinski In the same year they demonstrated a prototype of GemStone to GEnie After a short lived instance of GemStone II GemStone III was officially launched in February GemStone III became available on AOL in September followed by the release of DragonRealms in February By the end of GemStone III and DragonRealms had become the first and second most played games on AOL br br br Gameplay br br The typical MUD will describe to the player the room or area they are standing in listing the objects players and non player characters NPCs in the area as well as all of the exits To carry out a task the player would enter a text command such as take apple or attack dragon Movement around the game environment is generally accomplished by entering the direction or an abbreviation of it in which the player wishes to move for example typing north or just n would cause the player to exit the current area via the path to the north br MUD clients are computer applications that make the MUD telnet interface more accessible to users with features such as syntax highlighting keyboard macros and connection assistance Prominent clients include TinyTalk TinyFugue TinTin and zMUD br br br Style br While there have been many variations in overall focus gameplay and features in MUDs some distinct sub groups have formed that can be used to help categorize different game mechanics game genres and non game uses br br br Hack and slash MUDs br br Perhaps the most common approach to game design in MUDs is to loosely emulate the structure of a Dungeons Dragons campaign focused more on fighting and advancement than role playing When these MUDs restrict player killing in favor of player versus environment conflict and questing they are labeled hack and slash MUDs This may be considered particularly appropriate since due to the room based nature of traditional MUDs ranged combat is typically difficult to implement resulting in most MUDs equipping characters mainly with close combat weapons This style of game was also historically referred to within the MUD genre as adventure games but video gaming as a whole has developed a meaning of adventure game that is greatly at odds with this usage br br br Player versus player MUDs br br Most MUDs restrict player versus player combat often abbreviated as PK Player Killing This is accomplished through hard coded restrictions and various forms of social intervention MUDs without these restrictions are commonly known as PK MUDs Taking this a step further are MUDs devoted solely to this sort of conflict called pure PK MUDs the first of which was Genocide in Genocide s ideas were influential in the evolution of player versus player online gaming br br br Roleplaying MUDs br br Roleplaying MUDs generally abbreviated as RP MUDs encourage or enforce that players act out the role of their playing characters at all times Some RP MUDs provide an immersive gaming environment while others only provide a virtual world with no game elements MUDs where roleplay is enforced and the game world is heavily computer modeled are sometimes known as roleplay intensive MUDs or RPIMUDs In many cases role playing MUDs attempt to differentiate themselves from hack and slash types by dropping the MUD name entirely and instead using MUX Multi User Experience or MUSH Multi User Shared Hallucination br br br Social MUDs br br Social MUDs de emphasize game elements in favor of an environment designed primarily for socializing They are differentiated from talkers by retaining elements beyond online chat typically online creation as a community activity and some element of role playing Often such MUDs have broadly defined contingents of socializers and roleplayers Server software in the TinyMUD family or MU is traditionally used to implement social MUDs br br br Talkers br br A less known MUD variant is the talker a variety of online chat environment typically based on server software like ew too or NUTS Most of the early Internet talkers were LPMuds with the majority of the complex game machinery stripped away leaving just the communication commands The first Internet talker was Cat Chat in br br br Educational MUDs br Taking advantage of the flexibility of MUD server software some MUDs are designed for educational purposes rather than gaming or chat MicroMUSE is considered by some to have been the first educational MUD but it can be argued that its evolution into this role was not complete until which would make the first of many educational MOOs Diversity University in also the first educational MUD The MUD medium lends itself naturally to constructionist learning pedagogical approaches The Mud Institute TMI was an LPMud opened in February as a gathering place for people interested in developing LPMud and teaching LPC after it became clear that Lars Pensj had lost interest in the project TMI focussed on both the LPMud driver and library the driver evolving into MudOS the TMI Mudlib was never officially released but was influential in the development of other libraries br br br Graphical MUDs br br A graphical MUD is a MUD that uses computer graphics to represent parts of the virtual world and its visitors A prominent early graphical MUD was Habitat written by Randy Farmer and Chip Morningstar for Lucasfilm in Some graphical MUDs require players to download a special client and the game s artwork while others provide a rich experience by being website based Graphical MUDs range from simply enhancing the user interface e g Wolfery provides an option to set the room picture but otherwise remains a text based interaction to simulating D worlds with visual spatial relationships and customized avatar appearances e g Ultima Online provides a rich point and click experience br Games such as Meridian EverQuest Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot were routinely called graphical MUDs in their earlier years RuneScape was actually originally intended to be a text based MUD but graphics were added very early in development However with the increase in computing power and Internet connectivity during the late s and the shift of online gaming to the mass market the term graphical MUD fell out of favor being replaced by MMORPG massively multiplayer online role playing game a term coined by Richard Garriott in br br br Development br br Within a MUD s technical infrastructure a mudlib concatenation of MUD library defines the rules of the in game world Examples of mudlibs include Ain Soph Mudlib CDlib Discworld Mudlib Lima Mudlib LPUniversity Mudlib MorgenGrauen Mudlib Nightmare Mudlib and TMI Mudlib br MUDs that include object oriented programming can add complex features such as adding elements to the game world and giving users more ways to interact with it that MUDs without it cannot br br br Community br MUD history has been preserved primarily through community sites and blogs and not through mainstream sources with journalistic repute As of the late s a website called The Mud Connector has served as a central and curated repository for active MUDs In The Independent reported that over people regularly played about MUDs up from MUDs three years prior The Independent also noted distinct patterns of socialization within MUD communities br In MUDs were relatively popular in the United States and mostly text based br Seraphina Brennan of Massively wrote that the MUD community was in decline as of br br br Psychology and engagement br Sherry Turkle developed a theory that the constant use and in many cases overuse of MUDs allows users to develop different personalities in their environments She uses examples dating back to the text based MUDs of the mid s showing college students who simultaneously live different lives through characters in separate MUDs up to three at a time all while doing schoolwork The students claimed that it was a way to shut off their own lives for a while and become part of another reality Turkle claims that this could present a psychological problem of identity for today s youths br A Story About A Tree is a short essay written by Raph Koster regarding the death of a LegendMUD player named Karyn raising the subject of inter human relationships in virtual worlds br Observations of MUD play show styles of play that can be roughly categorized Achievers focus on concrete measurements of success such as experience points levels and wealth Explorers investigate every nook and cranny of the game and evaluate different game mechanical options Socializers devote most of their energy to interacting with other players and then there are Killers who focus on interacting negatively with other players if permitted killing the other characters or otherwise thwarting their play Few players play only one way or play one way all the time most exhibit a diverse style According to Richard Bartle People go there as part of a hero s journey a means of self discovery br Research has suggested that various factors combine in MUDs to provide users with a sense of presence rather than simply communication br br br Grammatical usage and derived terms br As a noun the word MUD is variously written MUD Mud and mud depending on speaker and context It is also used as a verb with to mud meaning to play or interact with a MUD and mudding referring to the act of doing so A mudder is naturally one who MUDs Compound words and portmanteaux such as mudlist mudsex and mudflation are also regularly coined Puns on the wet dirt meaning of mud are endemic as with for example the names of the ROM Rivers of MUD MUCK MUSH and CoffeeMUD codebases and the MUD
