An architectural design competition is a type of design competition in which an organization that intends on constructing a new building invites architects to submit design proposals The winning design is usually chosen by an independent panel of design professionals and stakeholders such as government and local representatives This procedure is often used to generate new ideas for building design to stimulate public debate generate publicity for the project and allow emerging designers the opportunity to gain exposure Architecture competitions are often used to award commissions for public buildings in some countries rules for tendering public building contracts stipulate some form of mandatory open architectural competition br Winning first prize in a competition is not a guarantee that the project will be constructed The commissioning body often has the right to veto the winning design and both requirements and finances may change thwarting the original intention The World Trade Center site design competition is an example of a highly publicized competition where only the basic elements of the winning design by Daniel Libeskind appeared in the finished project br
