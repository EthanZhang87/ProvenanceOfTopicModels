title: Easter egg (media)
id: 239803
An Easter egg is a message image or feature hidden in software a video game a film or another usually electronic medium The term used in this manner was coined around by Steve Wright the then Director of Software Development in the Atari Consumer Division to describe a hidden message in the Atari video game Adventure in reference to an Easter egg hunt br The earliest known video game Easter egg is in the video game Moonlander in which the player tries to land a Lunar module on the Moon if the player opts to fly the module horizontally through several of the game s screens they encounter a McDonald s restaurant and if they land next to it the astronaut will visit it instead of standing next to the ship The earliest known Easter egg in software in general is one placed in the make command for PDP PDP computers sometime in October October wherein if the user attempts to create a file named love by typing make love the program responds not war before proceeding br br br Origin br br The use of the term Easter egg to describe secret features in video games originates from the video game Adventure for the Atari game console programmed by the employee Warren Robinett At the time Atari did not include programmers names in the game credits both to prevent competitors from poaching its developers as well as to deny developers a means to bargain with the management of the new owners Warner Communications Robinett who disagreed with his supervisor over this lack of acknowledgment secretly programmed the message Created by Warren Robinett to appear only if a player moves their avatar over a specific pixel dubbed the Gray Dot during a certain part of the game and enters a previously forbidden part of the map where the message can be found When Robinett left Atari he did not inform the company of the acknowledgment that he included in the game Shortly after his departure the Gray Dot and his message were discovered by a player Atari s management initially wanted to remove the message and release the game again until this was deemed too costly Instead Steve Wright the Director of Software Development in the Atari Consumer Division suggested that they keep the message and in fact encourage the inclusion of such messages in future games describing them as Easter eggs for consumers to find br br br In video games br While Robinett s message in Adventure led to the first use of the phrase Easter egg Easter eggs were included in previous video games The earliest known video game Easter egg is in Moonlander in which the player tries to land a spaceship on the Moon If the player flies far enough horizontally they encounter a McDonald s restaurant and if they land next to it an astronaut will visit it instead of standing next to the ship Other early known Easter eggs include one in the first text adventure game Colossal Cave Adventure from which Adventure was fashioned which includes several secret words One of these is xyzzy a command which enables the player to move between two points in the game world According to research by Ed Fries one of the earliest Easter eggs in a graphical video games could be found in Starship programmed by Ron Milner By triggering the cabinet s controls in the right order the player can have the message Hi Ron appear on the screen Fries describes it as the earliest arcade game yet known that clearly meets the definition of an Easter egg The existence of this Easter egg was not published until leading Fries to suggest that as more than one hundred arcade games predate Starship earlier Easter eggs may still be undiscovered Fries says that some Atari arcade cabinets were resold under the Kee Games label and include changes to the hardware that make the game appear different from the Atari version Anti Aircraft II includes a means to modify the circuit board to make the airplanes in the game appear as alien UFOs Fries surmises that this feature may have been intended for a Kee Games release For this reason and because it requires a hardware modification Fries questions whether it meets the definition of an Easter egg In an Easter egg displaying programmer Bradley Reid Selth s surname was found in Video Whizball a game for the Fairchild Channel F system br Since Adventure there has been a long history of video game developers placing Easter eggs in their games Most Easter eggs are intentional an attempt to communicate with the player or a way of getting even with management for a perceived slight Easter eggs in video games take a variety of forms from purely ornamental screens to aesthetic enhancements that change some element of the game during play The Easter egg included in the original Age of Empires is an example of the latter catapult projectiles are changed from stones to cows br More elaborate Easter eggs include secret levels and developers rooms fully functional hidden areas of the game Developers rooms often include inside jokes from the fandom or development team and differ from a debug room in that they are specifically intended for the player to find Some games even include hidden minigames as Easter eggs In the LucasArts game Day of the Tentacle the original Maniac Mansion game can be played in its full version by using a home computer in a character s room Similarly a programmer included the whole of TimeSplitters within Homefront The Revolution accessed by using a special code at an in game arcade cabinet br Other Easter eggs originated unintentionally The Konami Code a type of cheat code became an intentional Easter egg in most games but it originated from Konami s Gradius for the Nintendo Entertainment System The programmer Kazuhisa Hashimoto created the code as a means to rapidly debug the game by giving the player s avatar additional health and powers to easily traverse the game These types of codes are normally removed from the game before it is shipped but in the case of Gradius Hashimoto forgot to remove it and the code was soon discovered by players Its popularity inspired Konami to reuse the code and purposely retain it for many of its future games as an Easter egg br Technical issues may also create unintentional Easter eggs Jon Burton founder of Traveller s Tales said that many seemingly apparent Easter eggs in their Sega Genesis games came about as a result of introducing programming tricks to get around some of the difficulty they had in getting Sega s strict certification for their games catching any exceptions during execution to bring the game back to a usable state as to pass certification For example hitting the side of the Sonic D Blast cartridge while it is slotted in the console will bring the game back to the Level Select screen which Burton explains is the default exception handling for any unidentified processor error such as when connectivity between the cartridge and the console s microprocessor is temporarily lost br br br In computing br br br Software br In computer software Easter eggs are secret responses that occur as a result of an undocumented set of commands The results can vary from a simple printed message or image to a page of programmer credits or a small video game hidden inside an otherwise serious piece of software br In the TOPS operating system for the DEC PDP mainframe computer the make command is used to invoke the TECO editor to create a file If given the file name argument love so that the command reads make love it will pause and respond not war before creating the file The Easter egg was added sometime between October and October by William F Weiher at the Stanford AI Lab to the COMPIL program for the PDP which was then used in the TOPS operating system making it the first Easter egg in a software program This same behavior occurs on the RSTS E operating system where TECO will provide this response Other Unix operating systems respond to why with why not a reference to The Prisoner in Berkeley Unix br Some versions of the DEC OpenVMS operating system have concealed exit status codes including a reference to the Monty Python Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook skit exit xb returns the message SYSTEM W FISH my hovercraft is full of eels while exit x b returns a reference to an early Internet meme SYSTEM F GAMEOVER All your base are belong to us br Easter eggs in the version of Microsoft Office include a hidden flight simulator in Microsoft Excel and a pinball game in Microsoft Word Since Microsoft does not allow any hidden or undocumented code as part of its trustworthy computing initiative br The Debian operating system s package tool apt get has an Easter egg involving an ASCII cow when variants on apt get moo are typed into the shell br br An Easter egg is found on all Microsoft Windows operating systems before XP In the D Text screen saver entering the text volcano will display the names of all the volcanoes in the United States Microsoft removed this Easter egg in XP but added others In Windows Vista and later by launching a screensaver executable introduced with Windows Vista on the command line with the p flag for example launching the bubbles screen saver with bubbles scr p command line parameter it runs as desktop wallpaper Microsoft Excel contains a hidden action game similar to Doom called The Hall of Tortured Souls br The Google search engine famously contains many Easter eggs given to the user in response to certain search queries br Steve Jobs banned Easter eggs from Apple products upon his return to the company br The first Easter egg to appear after his death is in a update to the Mac App Store for OS X Mountain Lion in which downloaded apps are temporarily timestamped as January the date of the sales launch of the original Macintosh br The Python programming language and its ecosystem of libraries include various Easter eggs br br br Firmware br While computer related Easter eggs are often found in installed software occasionally they exist in the firmware of certain devices On some home and early personal computers the ROM contains Easter eggs including lists of the developers names political exhortations snatches of music or images of the entire development team br The palmtop PC HP LX includes an undocumented hex calculator HEXCALC EXM The built in maze game Lair of Squid incorporates a hidden gallery of the software developers In test mode it displays several poems br Other notable examples include some errant AMI BIOS that on November proceeded to play Happy Birthday via the PC speaker repeatedly instead of booting as well as several early Apple Macintosh models that have photos of the development team in the ROM These Mac Easter eggs were well publicized in the Macintosh press at the time along with the means to access them and were later recovered by an NYC Resistor team a hacker collective through elaborate reverse engineering Similarly the Radio Shack Color Computer s ROM contains code which displays what looks like three Microware developers on a Ctrl Alt Reset keypress sequence a hard reset which discards any information currently in RAM br Several oscilloscopes contain Easter eggs One example is the HP B known to have a Tetris clone and the HP D contains an imitation of the Asteroids game named Rocks Another is the Tektronix A Vector and Waveform Monitor which displays swimming fish when Remote Software version is selected on the CONFIG menu br In the second and third hardware revision of the Minolta Dynax Maxxum Alpha introduced in SLR camera including all SSM ADI upgraded bodies since an undocumented button sequence can be utilized to reconfigure the camera to behave like the Dynax Maxxum Alpha Ti and subsequently invoke support for the limited model s extra functions also in the black model br One of Hewlett Packard s electronic pocket calculators the HP introduced in has a built in undocumented stopwatch br br br Hardware br The Commodore Amiga computer includes the signatures of the design and development team embossed on the inside of the case including Jay Miner and the paw print of his dog Mitchy The Commodore Amiga models and each feature Easter eggs in the form of song titles by the B s as white printing on the motherboards The says B Rock Lobster the says June Bug and the says Channel Z The Amiga OS software contains hidden messages br Many integrated circuit chip designers have included hidden graphics elements termed chip art including images phrases developer initials logos and more This artwork like the rest of the chip is reproduced in each copy by lithography and etching These are visible only when the chip package is opened and examined under magnification The CVAX microchip implementation of the MicroVAX CPU contains in its etchings the Russian phrase in the Cyrillic alphabet VAX When you care enough to steal the very best placed there because knowing that some CVAXs would end up in the USSR the team wanted the Russians to know that we were thinking of them br Another notable example is the pro controller for the Nintendo Switch on the controller s motherboard if a player holds down on the right stick and looks closely into the transparent plastic surrounding its socket while shining a light on it there is a hidden message that reads THX ALLGAMEFANS The message was discovered by Japanese Twitter user Geo Stream on March one day after the Switch s launch br br br Comics br American comic book artists are known to include hidden messages in their art br br In a reprint of classic Captain America comics a production artist drew a penis on Bucky Barnes br In Al Milgrom inserted a message into Universe X Spidey insulting his previous boss Marvel Editor in Chief Bob Harras following Harras termination from Marvel Comics On Page panel the spines of books on a bookshelf in the background read HARRAS HA HA HE S GONE GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD RUBBISH HE WAS A NASTY S O B The message was spotted after the book was printed but before it went on sale the copies that were printed for consumers were destroyed However preview copies were distributed to retailers as part of a First Look deal and these are today considered rare collectors items Milgrom was apparently fired and allegedly and quietly re hired several weeks later br Ethan Van Sciver hid the word sex in the background of nearly every page of New X Men November Van Sciver subsequently stated that he hid the word throughout the book because he was annoyed with Marvel at the time for reasons he cannot remember and thought it would be fun to engage in some mischief with his work br Indonesian artist Ardian Syaf is known to engage in the practice of hiding Easter egg references to political figures in the backgrounds of his artwork In Batgirl vol July Syaf included a storefront sign that referenced the President of Indonesia Joko Widodo although the text that accompanies the image of Widodo is covered by a caption In April he caused an outcry by placing Easter egg references to the November Jakarta protests into the pages of X Men Gold which were perceived by readers to be anti Semitic and anti Christian Though Syaf acknowledged the political nature of the messages he stated that they were not intended to express any anti Semitic nor anti Christian sentiment on his part In response to these Easter eggs Marvel terminated their contract with Syaf br br br Video br br br Home media br Easter eggs are found on films DVDs and Blu ray Discs often as deleted scenes or bonus features Klinger states that their presence is another signifier of artistry in the world of DVD supplements According to American film critics James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert most DVDs do not contain them and most examples are inconsequential but a few such as the one found on the Memento DVD release are worth the effort to seek out br br br Broadcast media br Unlike DVDs and computer games broadcast radio and television programs contain no executable code Easter eggs may still appear in the content itself such as a hidden Mickey in a Disney film or a real telephone number instead of a fictitious telephone number A Super Bowl advertisement was leaked online in which a lady gives a man a real telephone number which the advertiser had hidden as a marketing ploy the first caller to the number received a pair of tickets to the game The s animated series She Ra Princess of Power featured a character named Loo Kee who typically appeared once per episode hidden in a single screenshot At the end of the episode the screenshot would be shown again and Loo Kee would challenge viewers to locate him before revealing his hiding place Adventure Time also had a character known as The Snail that was hidden in almost every episode of the show br More recent broadcast media where viewers have access to high resolution digital copies or streaming services may include further Easter eggs that can only be found by freezing the show at certain points In the anthology series Black Mirror the producers have included Easter eggs that reference past episodes or tie into future episodes as a means of loosely tying together all episodes into a single Black Mirror universe The Netflix series Stranger Things had a real world Easter Egg where a pizza delivery van featured in the show s fourth season had the phone number PIZZA shown on its side If that number which translated to was dialed it led to a special message from Argyle the fictional restaurant s delivery driver br br br Security concerns br Security author Michel E Kabay discussed security concerns of Easter eggs in saying that while software quality assurance requires that all code be tested it is not known whether Easter eggs are He said that as they tend to be held as programming secrets from the rest of the product testing process a logic bomb could also bypass testing Kabay asserts that this undermined the Trusted Computing Base a paradigm of trustworthy hardware and software in place since the s and is of concern wherever personal or confidential information is stored as this may then be vulnerable to damage or manipulation Microsoft created some of the largest and most elaborate Easter eggs such as those in Microsoft Office In Larry Osterman of Microsoft acknowledged Microsoft Easter eggs and his involvement in development of one but described them as irresponsible and wrote that the company s Operating System division has a no Easter Eggs policy as part of its Trustworthy Computing initiative br In Douglas W Jones said that while some Easter eggs may be intentional tools used to detect illegal copying others are clearly examples of unauthorized functionality that has slipped through the quality control tests at the vendor While hidden Easter eggs themselves are harmless it may be possible for malware to be hidden in similar ways in voting machines or other computers br Netscape Navigator contributor Jamie Zawinski stated in an interview in that harmless Easter eggs impose a negligible burden on shipped software and serve the important purpose of helping productivity by keeping programmers happy
