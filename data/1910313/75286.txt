Landscape architecture is the design of outdoor areas landmarks and structures to achieve environmental social behavioural or aesthetic outcomes It involves the systematic design and general engineering of various structures for construction and human use investigation of existing social ecological and soil conditions and processes in the landscape and the design of other interventions that will produce desired outcomes br The scope of the profession is broad and can be subdivided into several sub categories including professional or licensed landscape architects who are regulated by governmental agencies and possess the expertise to design a wide range of structures and landforms for human use landscape design which is not a licensed profession site planning stormwater management erosion control environmental restoration public realm parks recreation and urban planning visual resource management green infrastructure planning and provision and private estate and residence landscape master planning and design all at varying scales of design planning and management A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture may be called a landscape architect however in jurisdictions where professional licenses are required it is often only those who possess a landscape architect license who can be called a landscape architect br br br Definition of landscape architecture br br Modern landscape architecture is a multi disciplinary field incorporating aspects of urban design architecture geography ecology civil engineering structural engineering horticulture environmental psychology industrial design soil sciences botany and fine arts The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks from the design of residential estates to the design of civil infrastructure and from the management of large wilderness areas to reclamation of degraded landscapes such as mines or landfills Landscape architects work on structures and external spaces in the landscape aspect of the design large or small urban suburban and rural and with hard built and soft planted materials while integrating ecological sustainability br The most valuable contribution can be made at the first stage of a project to generate ideas with technical understanding and creative flair for the design organization and use of spaces The landscape architect can conceive the overall concept and prepare the master plan from which detailed design drawings and technical specifications are prepared They can also review proposals to authorize and supervise contracts for the construction work Other skills include preparing design impact assessments conducting environmental assessments and audits and serving as an expert witness at inquiries on land use issues The majority of their time will most likely be spent inside an office building designing and preparing models for clients br br br History br br For the period before the history of landscape gardening later called landscape architecture is largely that of master planning and garden design for manor houses palaces and royal properties An example is the extensive work by Andr Le N tre for King Louis XIV of France on the Gardens of Versailles The first person to write of making a landscape was Joseph Addison in The term landscape architecture was invented by Gilbert Laing Meason in and John Claudius Loudon was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession He took up the term from Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his book on the Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton br John Claudius Loudon was an established and influential horticultural journalist and Scottish landscape architect whose writings were instrumental in shaping Victorian taste in gardens public parks and architecture In the Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton Loudon describes two distinct styles of landscape gardening existing at the beginning of the th century geometric and natural Loudon wrote that each style reflected a different stage of society The geometric style was most striking and pleasing displaying wealth and taste in an early state of society and in countries where the general scenery was wild irregular and natural and man comparatively uncultivated and unrefined The natural style was used in modern times and in countries where society is in a higher state of cultivation displaying wealth and taste through the sacrifice of profitable lands to make room for such designs br The prominent English landscape designer Humphry Repton echoed similar ideas in his work and design ideas In his writings on the use of delineated spaces e g courtyards terrace walls fences Repton states that while the motive for defense no longer exists the features are still useful in separating the gardens which belong to man and the forest or desert which belongs to the wild denizens Repton refers to Indigenous peoples as uncivilized human beings against whom some decided line of defense was absolutely necessary br The practice of landscape architecture spread from the Old to the New World The term landscape architect was used as a professional title by Frederick Law Olmsted in the United States in and Andrew Jackson Downing another early American landscape designer was editor of The Horticulturist magazine In his first book A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America was published to a great success it was the first book of its kind published in the United States During the latter th century the term landscape architect began to be used by professional landscapes designers and was firmly established after Frederick Law Olmsted Jr and Beatrix Jones later Farrand with others founded the American Society of Landscape Architects ASLA in IFLA was founded at Cambridge England in with Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe as its first president representing countries from Europe and North America Later in IFLA s Headquarters were established in Versailles br br br Fields of activity br br The variety of the professional tasks that landscape architects collaborate on is very broad but some examples of project types include br br Parks of general design and public infrastructure br Sustainable development br Stormwater management including rain gardens green roofs groundwater recharge green infrastructure and constructed wetlands br Landscape design for educational function and site design for public institutions and government facilities br Parks botanical gardens arboretums greenways and nature preserves br Recreation facilities such as playgrounds golf courses theme parks and sports facilities br Housing areas industrial parks and commercial developments br Estate and residence landscape planning and design br Landscaping and accents on highways transportation structures bridges and transit corridors br Contributions to urban design town and city squares waterfronts pedestrian schemes br Natural park tourist destination and recreating historical landscapes and historic garden appraisal and conservation studies br Reservoirs dams power stations reclamation of extractive industry applications or major industrial projects and mitigation br Environmental assessment and landscape assessment planning advice and land management proposals br Coastal and offshore developments and mitigation br Ecological design any aspect of design that minimizes environmentally destructive impacts by integrating itself with natural processes and sustainability br Landscape managers use their knowledge of landscape processes to advise on the long term care and development of the landscape They often work in forestry nature conservation and agriculture br Landscape scientists have specialist skills such as soil science hydrology geomorphology or botany that they relate to the practical problems of landscape work Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes They may also report on the impact of development or the importance of particular species in a given area br Landscape planners are concerned with landscape planning for the location scenic ecological and recreational aspects of urban rural and coastal land use Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy and their remit includes master planning for new developments landscape evaluations and assessments and preparing countryside management or policy plans Some may also apply an additional specialism such as landscape archaeology or law to the process of landscape planning br Green roof or more specifically vegetative roof designers design extensive and intensive roof gardens for stormwater management evapo transpirative cooling sustainable architecture aesthetics and habitat creation br br br Relation to urban planning br br Through the th century urban planning became a focal point and central issue in cities The combination of the tradition of landscape gardening and the emerging field of urban planning offered landscape architecture an opportunity to serve these needs In the second half of the century Frederick Law Olmsted completed a series of parks that continue to have a significant influence on the practices of landscape architecture today Among these were Central Park in New York City Prospect Park in Brooklyn New York and Boston s Emerald Necklace park system Jens Jensen designed sophisticated and naturalistic urban and regional parks for Chicago Illinois and private estates for the Ford family including Fair Lane and Gaukler Point One of the original eleven founding members of the American Society of Landscape Architects ASLA and the only woman was Beatrix Farrand She was design consultant for over a dozen universities including Princeton in Princeton New Jersey Yale in New Haven Connecticut and the Arnold Arboretum for Harvard in Boston Massachusetts Her numerous private estate projects include the landmark Dumbarton Oaks in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington D C Since that time other architects most notably Ruth Havey and Alden Hopkins changed certain elements of the Farrand design br Since this period urban planning has developed into a separate independent profession that has incorporated important contributions from other fields such as civil engineering architecture and public administration Urban Planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects and in general the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners br Landscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the th and st centuries Thomas Church was a mid century landscape architect significant in the profession Roberto Burle Marx in Brazil combined the International style and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic Innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning landscapes and gardens br Ian McHarg was known for introducing environmental concerns in landscape architecture He popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place This system became the foundation of today s Geographic Information Systems GIS McHarg would give every qualitative aspect of the site a layer such as the history hydrology topography vegetation etc GIS software is ubiquitously used in the landscape architecture profession today to analyze materials in and on the Earth s surface and is similarly used by urban planners geographers forestry and natural resources professionals etc br European nations enabled the widespread circulation of urban planning strategies by transferring landscaping ideas and practices to overseas colonies The green belt was a popular landscape practice exported by Britain onto colonial territories such as Haifa Spatial mechanisms like the green belt implemented through the Haifa Bay Plan and the British Grand Model were used to enforce political control and civic order and extend western ideas of progress and development The Greater London Regional Planning Committee accepted the green belt concept which formed the basis of the Green Belt Act The planning prototype demarcated open spaces distinguished between city and countryside limited urban growth and created zoning divisions It was used extensively in the British colonies to facilitate British rule through the organized division of landscape and populations br br br Relation to Indigenous Practices br Indigenous land management practices create constantly changing landscapes through the use of vegetation and natural systems contrasting with western epistemologies of the discipline that separate ornament from function The discipline of landscape architecture favors western designs made from structured materials and geometric forms Landscape architecture history books tend to include projects that contain constructed architectural elements that persist over time excluding many Indigenous landscape based designs br Landscape architecture textbooks often place Indigenous peoples as a prefix to the official start of the discipline The widely read landscape history text The Landscape of Man offers a global history of the designed landscape from past to present featuring African and other Indigenous peoples in its discussions of paleolithic man between and BCE in relation to human migration Indigenous land management practices are described as archaeological rather than a part of contemporary practice Gardens in Time also places Indigenous practice as prehistory at the beginning of the landscape architecture timeline Authors John and Ray Oldham describe Aborigines of Australia as survivors of an ancient way of life who provide an opportunity to examine western Australia as a meeting place of a prehistoric man br In the late th century the landscapes created by aboriginal land and fire management practices appealed to English settlers in Australia Journals from the period of early white settlement note the landscape resembling parks and popular designs in English landscape gardens of the same period In England these designs were considered sophisticated and celebrated for the intentional sacrifice of usable land In Australia the park like condition was used to justify British control citing its emptiness and lack of productive use as a basis for the dispossession of Aboriginal people br br br Education br Landscape Architects are generally required to have university or graduate education from an accredited landscape architecture degree program which can vary in length and degree title They learn how to create projects from scratch such as residential or commercial planting and designing outdoor living spaces they are willing to work with others to get a better outcome for the customers when doing a project they will have to learn the basics of how to create a project on a manner of time and will require to get your license in a certain state to be allowed to work students of Landscape Architects will learn how to interact with clients and will learn how to explain a design from scratch when giving the final project br Landscape architecture has been taught in the University of Manchester since the s The course in the Manchester School of Architecture enables students to gain various bachelor s and master s degrees including MLPM Hons which is accredited by the Landscape Institute and by the Royal Town Planning Institute br br br Profession br br In many countries a professional institute comprising members of the professional community exists in order to protect the standing of the profession and promote its interests and sometimes also regulate the practice of landscape architecture The standard and strength of legal regulations governing landscape architecture practice varies from nation to nation with some requiring licensure in order to practice and some having little or no regulation In Europe North America parts of South America Australia India and New Zealand landscape architecture is a regulated profession br br br Argentina br Since with the arrival of the French architect and urbanist landscaper Carlos Thays recommended to recreate the National Capital s parks
