Glass art refers to individual works of art that are substantially or wholly made of glass It ranges in size from monumental works and installation pieces to wall hangings and windows to works of art made in studios and factories including glass jewelry and tableware br As a decorative and functional medium glass was extensively developed in Egypt and Assyria Glassblowing was perhaps invented in the st century BC and featured heavily in Roman glass which was highly developed with forms such as the cage cup for a luxury market Islamic glass was the most sophisticated of the early Middle Ages Then the builders of the great Norman and Gothic cathedrals of Europe took the art of glass to new heights with the use of stained glass windows as a major architectural and decorative element Glass from Murano in the Venetian Lagoon also known as Venetian glass is the result of hundreds of years of refinement and invention Murano is still held as the birthplace of modern glass art br br Apart from shaping the hot glass the three main traditional decorative techniques used on formed pieces in recent centuries are enamelled glass engraved glass and cut glass The first two are very ancient but the third an English invention around From the late th century a number of other techniques have been added br The turn of the th century was the height of the old art glass movement while the factory glass blowers were being replaced by mechanical bottle blowing and continuous window glass Great ateliers like Tiffany Lalique Daum Gall the Corning schools in upper New York state and Steuben Glass Works took glass art to new levels br br br Glass vessels br br Some of the earliest and most practical works of glass art were glass vessels Goblets and pitchers were popular as glassblowing developed as an art form Many early methods of etching painting and forming glass were honed on these vessels For instance the millefiori technique dates back at least to Rome More recently lead glass or crystal glass were used to make vessels that rang like a bell when struck br In the th century mass produced glass work including artistic glass vessels was sometimes known as factory glass br br br Glass architecture br br br Stained glass windows br br Starting in the Middle Ages glass became more widely produced and used for windows in buildings Stained glass became common for windows in cathedrals and grand civic buildings br br br Glass facades and structural glass br The invention of plate glass and the Bessemer process allowed for glass to be used in larger segments to support more structural loads and to be produced at larger scales A striking example of this was the Crystal Palace in one of the first buildings to use glass as a primary structural material br In the th century glass became used for tables and shelves for internal walls and even for floors br br br Glass sculptures br br Some of the best known glass sculptures are statuesque or monumental works created by artists Livio Seguso Karen LaMonte and Stanislav Libensk and Jaroslava Brychtov Another example is Ren Roub cek s Object a blown and hot worked piece of cm in shown at the Design in an Age of Adversity exhibition at the Corning Museum of Glass in A chiselled and bonded plate glass tower by Henry Richardson serves as the memorial to the Connecticut victims of the terrorist attacks In the artist Guillaume Bottazzi created a three metre high glass sculpture on the Domaine des Diamants Blancs in the extension of the Mallet Stevens garden which adjoins the Villa Cavrois br Examples of st century glass sculpture br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Art glass and the studio glass movement br br In the early th century most glass production happened in factories Even individual glassblowers making their own personalized designs would do their work in those large shared buildings The idea of art glass small decorative works made of art often with designs or objects inside flourished Pieces produced in small production runs such as the lampwork figures of Stanislav Brychta are generally called art glass br By the s there were good designs for smaller furnaces and in the United States this gave rise to the studio glass movement of glassblowers who blew their glass outside of factories often in their own studios This coincided with a move towards smaller production runs of particular styles This movement spread to other parts of the world as well br Examples of th century studio glass br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Glass panels br br Combining many of the above techniques but focusing on art represented in the glass rather than its shape glass panels or walls can reach tremendous sizes These may be installed as walls or on top of walls or hung from a ceiling Large panels can be found as part of outdoor installation pieces or for interior use Dedicated lighting is often part of the artwork br Techniques used include stained glass carving wheel carving engraving or acid etching frosting enameling and gilding including Angel gilding An artist may combine techniques through masking or silkscreening Glass panels or walls may also be complemented by running water or dynamic lights br br br Glass paperweights br The earliest glass art paperweights were produced as utilitarian objects in the mid s in Europe Modern artists have elevated the craft to fine art Glass art paperweights can incorporate several glass techniques but the most common techniques found are millefiori and lampwork both techniques that had been around long before the advent of paperweights In paperweights the millefiori or sculptural lampwork elements are encapsulated in clear solid crystal creating a completely solid sculptural form br In the mid th century there was a resurgence of interest in paperweight making and several artist sought to relearn the craft In the US Charles Kaziun started in to produce buttons paperweights inkwells and other bottles using lampwork of elegant simplicity In Scotland the pioneering work of Paul Ysart from the s onward preceded a new generation of artists such as William Manson Peter McDougall Peter Holmes and John Deacons A further impetus to reviving interest in paperweights was the publication of Evangiline Bergstrom s book Old Glass Paperweights the first of a new genre br A number of small studios appeared in the middle th century particularly in the US These may have several to some dozens of workers with various levels of skill cooperating to produce their own distinctive line Notable examples are Lundberg Studios Orient and Flume Correia Art Glass St Clair Lotton and Parabelle Glass br Starting in the late s and early s artists such as Francis Whittemore Paul Stankard his former assistant Jim D Onofrio Chris Buzzini Delmo and daughter Debbie Tarsitano Victor Trabucco and sons Gordon Smith Rick Ayotte and his daughter Melissa the father and son team of Bob and Ray Banford and Ken Rosenfeld began breaking new ground and were able to produce fine paperweights rivaling anything produced in the classic period br br br Glass fashion br br br Jewelry br br The first uses of glass were in beads and other small pieces of jewelry and decoration Beads and jewelry are still among the most common uses of glass in art and can be worked without a furnace br It later became fashionable to wear functional jewelry with glass elements such as pocket watches and monocles br br br Wearables and couture br Starting in the late th century glass couture refers to the creation of exclusive custom fitted clothing made from sculpted glass These are made to order for the body of the wearer They are partly or entirely made of glass with extreme attention to fit and flexibility The result is usually delicate and not intended for regular use br br br Techniques and processes br br Several of the most common techniques for producing glass art include blowing kiln casting fusing slumping p t de verre flame working hot sculpting and cold working Cold work includes traditional stained glass work as well as other methods of shaping glass at room temperature Cut glass is worked with a diamond saw or copper wheels embedded with abrasives and polished to give gleaming facets the technique used in creating Waterford crystal br Fine paperweights were originally made by skilled workers in the glass factories in Europe and the United States during the classic period Since the late s a small number of very skilled artists have used this art form to express themselves using mostly the classic techniques of millefiori and lampwork br Art is sometimes etched into glass via the use of acid caustic or abrasive substances Traditionally this was done after the glass was blown or cast In the s a new mould etch process was invented in which art was etched directly into the mould so that each cast piece emerged from the mould with the image already on the surface of the glass This reduced manufacturing costs and combined with a wider use of colored glass led to cheap glassware in the s which later became known as Depression glass As the types of acids used in this process are extremely hazardous abrasive methods gained popularity br br br Knitted glass br Knitted glass is a technique developed in by artist Carol Milne incorporating knitting lost wax casting mold making and kiln casting It produces works that look knitted though they are made entirely of glass br br br Glass printing br In the Mediated Matter group and Glass Lab at MIT produced a prototype D printer that could print with glass through their G DP project This printer allowed creators to vary optical properties and thickness of their pieces The first works that they printed were a series of artistic vessels which were included in the Cooper Hewitt s Beauty exhibit in br Glass printing is theoretically possible at large and small physical scales and has the capacity for mass production However as of production still requires hand tuning and has mainly been used for one off sculptures br br br Pattern making br Methods to make patterns on glass include caneworking such as murrine engraving enameling millefiori flamework and gilding br Methods used to combine glass elements and work glass into final forms include lampworking br br br Museums br br Historical collections of glass art can be found in general museums Modern works of glass art can be seen in dedicated glass museums and museums of contemporary art These include the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk Virginia the Museum of Glass in Tacoma the Metropolitan Museum of Art the Toledo Museum of Art and Corning Museum of Glass in Corning NY which houses the world s largest collection of glass art and history with more than objects in its collection The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston features a feet m tall glass sculpture Lime Green Icicle Tower by Dale Chihuly In February the Smith Museum of Stained Glass Windows located in Chicago s Navy Pier opened as the first museum in America dedicated solely to stained glass windows The museum features works by Louis Comfort Tiffany and John Lafarge and is open daily free to the public The UK s National Glass Centre is located in the city of Sunderland Tyne and Wear br br br Blaschka models br br Among the finest and arguably the most detailed examples of glass art are the Glass sea creatures and their younger botanical cousins the Glass Flowers scientifically accurate models of marine invertebrates and various plant specimens crafted by famed Bohemian lampworkers Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka from to The Glass Flowers are a unique collection made for and located only at Harvard Museum of Natural History while the glass invertebrates are located in collections the world over Given the unmatched anatomical flawlessness of both many believe that the Blaschkas had a secret method of lampworking which they never revealed This however is not true as Leopold himself noted in an letter to Mary Lee Ware the patron sponsor of the Glass Flowers br br Many people think that we have some secret apparatus by which we can squeeze glass suddenly into these forms but it is not so We have the touch My son Rudolf has more than I have because he is my son and the touch increases in every generation The only way to become a glass modeler of skill I have often said to people is to get a good great grandfather who loved glass then he is to have a son with like tastes he is to be your grandfather He in turn will have a son who must as your father be passionately fond of glass You as his son can then try your hand and it is your own fault if you do not succeed But if you do not have such ancestors it is not your fault My grandfather was the most widely known glassworker in Bohemia br br Over the course of their collected lives Leopold and Rudolf crafted as many as ten thousand glass marine invertebrate models plus the botanical ones that are Glass Flowers The rumor of secret methods is partly owed to the fact that the family touch as Leopold described it died with the childless Rudolf meaning Blaschka glass art ceased being produced in the mid th century Regardless their work remains an inspiration to glassblowers today with the Glass Flowers being among the most popular exhibits at Harvard while invertebrate models are being remembered and rediscovered everywhere br br br See also br br Factory glass Art glass and Studio glass br Glass history br
