title: Procedural generation
id: 2215623
In computing procedural generation sometimes shortened as proc gen is a method of creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually typically through a combination of human generated content and algorithms coupled with computer generated randomness and processing power In computer graphics it is commonly used to create textures and D models In video games it is used to automatically create large amounts of content in a game Depending on the implementation advantages of procedural generation can include smaller file sizes larger amounts of content and randomness for less predictable gameplay Procedural generation is a branch of media synthesis br br br Overview br br The term procedural refers to the process that computes a particular function Fractals are geometric patterns which can often be generated procedurally Commonplace procedural content includes textures and meshes Sound is often also procedurally generated and has applications in both speech synthesis as well as music It has been used to create compositions in various genres of electronic music by artists such as Brian Eno who popularized the term generative music br br While software developers have applied procedural generation techniques for years few products have employed this approach extensively Procedurally generated elements have appeared in earlier video games The Elder Scrolls II Daggerfall takes place in a mostly procedurally generated world giving a world roughly two thirds the actual size of the British Isles Soldier of Fortune from Raven Software uses simple routines to detail enemy models while its sequel featured a randomly generated level mode Avalanche Studios employed procedural generation to create a large and varied group of detailed tropical islands for Just Cause No Man s Sky a game developed by games studio Hello Games is all based upon procedurally generated elements br The modern demoscene uses procedural generation to package a great deal of audiovisual content into relatively small programs br New methods and applications are presented annually in conferences such as the IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games and the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment br Particularly in the application of procedural generation with video games which are intended to be highly replayable there are concerns that procedural systems can generate infinite numbers of worlds to explore but without sufficient human guidance and rules to guide these The result has been called procedural oatmeal a term coined by writer Kate Compton in that while it is possible to mathematically generate thousands of bowls of oatmeal with procedural generation they will be perceived to be the same by the user and lack the notion of perceived uniqueness that a procedural system should aim for br br br Contemporary application br br br Tabletop role playing games br Using procedural generation in games had origins in the tabletop role playing game RPG venue The leading tabletop system Advanced Dungeons Dragons provided ways for the dungeon master to generate dungeons and terrain using random die rolls expanded in later editions with complex branching procedural tables Strategic Simulations under license from TSR released the Dungeon Master s Assistant a computer program that generated dungeons based on these published tables Tunnels Trolls published by Flying Buffalo was designed primarily around solitary play and used similar procedural generation for its dungeons Other tabletop RPGs borrowed similar concepts in procedural generation for various world elements br Many online tools for Dungeon Masters now use procedural generation to varying degrees br br br Video games br br br Early history br br Prior to graphically oriented video games roguelike games a genre directly inspired by Dungeons Dragons adopted for solitary play heavily utilized procedural generation to randomly produce dungeons in the same manner that tabletop systems had done Such early games include Beneath Apple Manor and the genre s namesake Rogue The procedural generation system in roguelikes would create dungeons in ASCII or regular tile based systems and define rooms hallways monsters and treasure to challenge the player Roguelikes and games based on the roguelike concepts allow the development of complex gameplay without having to spend excessive time in creating a game s world br s Maze Craze for the Atari VCS used an algorithm to generate a random top down maze for each game br Some games used pseudorandom number generators These PRNGs were often used with predefined seed values in order to generate very large game worlds that appeared to be premade The Sentinel supposedly had different levels stored in only and kilobytes An extreme case was Elite which was originally planned to contain a total of approximately trillion galaxies with solar systems each However the publisher was afraid that such a gigantic universe would cause disbelief in players and eight of these galaxies were chosen for the final version Other notable early examples include the game Rescue on Fractalus that used fractals to procedurally create in real time the craggy mountains of an alien planet and River Raid the Activision game that used a pseudorandom number sequence generated by a linear feedback shift register in order to generate a scrolling maze of obstacles br br br Modern use br br Though modern computer games do not have the same memory and hardware restrictions that earlier games had the use of procedural generation is frequently employed to create randomized games maps levels characters or other facets that are unique on each playthrough br In a PC first person shooter called kkrieger was released by a German demo group It is entirely contained in a kilobyte executable for Microsoft Windows that generates hundreds of megabytes of D and texture data when run According to one of the programmers it was a complete failure as far as the game side was concerned mostly because no one involved really deeply cared about that aspect br Naked Sky s RoboBlitz used procedural generation to maximize content in a less than MB downloadable file for Xbox Live Arcade Will Wright s Spore also makes use of procedural synthesis br Procedural generation is often used in loot systems of quest driven games such as action role playing games and massive multiplayer online role playing games Though quests may feature fixed rewards other loot such as weapons and armor may be generated for the player based on the player character s level the quest s level their performance in the quest and other random factors This often leads to loot having a rarity quality applied to reflect when the procedural generation system has produced an item with better than average attributes For example the Borderlands series is based on its procedural generation system which can create over a million unique guns and other equipment br br Many open world or survival games procedurally create a game world from a random seed or one provided by the player so that each playthrough is different These generation systems create numerous pixel or voxel based biomes with distribution of resources objects and creatures The player frequently has the ability to adjust some of the generation parameters such as specifying the amount of water coverage in a world Examples of such games include Dwarf Fortress Minecraft and Vintage Story br Procedural generation is also used in space exploration and trading games Elite Dangerous through using the billion known stars of the Milky Way Galaxy as its world basis uses procedural generation to simulate the planets in these solar systems Similarly Star Citizen uses the technology to create seamlessly loaded planets among its hand crafted universe I Novae Infinity features a plethora of planets which are procedurally generated between which the player can travel via space ships Outerra Anteworld is a video game in development that uses procedural generation and real world data to create a virtual replica of planet Earth in true scale br No Man s Sky by using procedural generation is the largest video game in history featuring a universe of quintillion planets across entire galaxies which can be explored in flight or on foot The planets all have their own uniquely diverse terrain weather flora and fauna as well as a number of space faring alien species The same content exists at the same places for all players thanks to a single random seed number to their deterministic engine which enables players to meet and share discoveries br br br Other applications br As in video games procedural generation is often used in film to create visually interesting and accurate spaces rapidly This comes in a wide variety of applications br One application is known as an imperfect factory where artists can rapidly generate many similar objects This accounts for the fact that in real life no two objects are ever exactly alike For instance an artist could model a product for a grocery store shelf and then create an imperfect factory to generate many similar objects to populate the shelf br MASSIVE is a high end computer animation and artificial intelligence software package used for generating crowd related visual effects for film and television It was developed to create fighting armies of hundreds of thousands of soldiers for Peter Jackson s The Lord of the Rings films automatically br Coherent noise can be extremely important to procedural workflow in film Simplex noise is often faster with fewer artifacts though an older function called Perlin noise may be used as well Coherent noise in this case refers to a function that generates smooth pseudo randomness in n dimensions br br br See also br Cellular automata br Computational creativity br Fractal landscape br
