title: Architectural model
id: 7742793
An architectural model is a type of scale model made to study aspects of an architectural design or to communicate design intent They are made using a variety of materials including paper plaster plastic resin wood glass and metal br Models are built either with traditional handcraft techniques or via D printing technologies such as stereolithography fused filament fabrication and selective laser sintering br br br History br The use of architectural models dates to pre history Some of the oldest standing models were found in Malta at Tarxien Temples Those models are now stored at the National Museum of Archaeology in Malta br br br Purpose br br Architectural models are used by architects for a range of purposes including br br Ad hoc or sketch models are sometimes made to study the interaction of volumes different viewpoints or concepts during the design process They re useful in explaining a complicated or unusual design to builders They also serve as a focus for discussion between architects engineers and town planners br Presentation models can be used to exhibit visualize or sell a final design br A model also serves as a show piece Once a building is finished the model is sometimes featured in a common area of the building br Types of models include br br Exterior models are models of buildings that usually include some landscaping or civic spaces around the building br Interior models are models showing interior space planning finishes colors furniture and beautification br Landscaping design models are models of landscape design and development representing features such as walkways small bridges pergolas vegetation patterns and beautification Landscape design models usually represent public spaces and in some cases include buildings as well br Urban models are typically built at a much smaller scale starting from and less and representing several city blocks even a town or village a large resort a campus an industrial facility a military base and so on Urban models are a tool for town and city planning and development Urban models of large urban areas are displayed at museums such as the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Center the Queens Museum in New York the Beijing Planning Exhibition Hall and the Singapore City Gallery br Engineering and construction models show isolated building or structure elements and components and their interactions br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Virtual modeling br Buildings are increasingly designed in software with CAD computer aided design systems Early virtual modeling involved the fixing of arbitrary lines and points in virtual space mainly to produce technical drawings Modern packages include advanced features such as databases of components automated engineering calculations visual fly throughs dynamic reflections and accurate textures and colors br As an extension to CAD computer aided design and BIM building information modeling virtual reality architectural sessions are also being adopted This technology enables participants to be immersed in a scale model essentially experiencing the building before it is built br br br List of CAD and BIM software br Autodesk Revit br AutoCAD br Rhinoceros D br SketchUp br ARCHICAD br Vectorworks br Autodesk ds Max br br br Materials br Rough study models can be made quickly using cardboard wooden blocks polystyrene foam foam boards and other materials Such models are an efficient design tool for the three dimensional understanding of a structure space or form and are used by architects interior designers and exhibit designers br Common materials used for centuries in the construction of architectural models were card stock balsa wood basswood and other woods Modern professional architectural model builders use st century materials such as Taskboard a flexible and lightweight wood fiberboard plastics wooden and wooden plastic composites foams foam board and urethane compounds br Several companies produce ready made pieces for structural components e g girders beams siding furniture figures people vehicles trees bushes and other features that are found in the models Features such as vehicles people figurines trees streetlights and others are called scenery elements and serve not only to beautify the model but also to help the observer obtain a correct feel of the scale and proportions represented by the model br Increasingly rapid prototyping techniques such as D printing and CNC routing are used to automatically construct models directly from CAD plans br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Cork models br A cork model is an architectural model made predominantly of cork The art of cork modeling is also called phelloplasty Greek phellos cork br br In Napoli in the sixteenth century cork was being used to create Christmas cribs The th and early th centuries saw an increase in the popularity of crib making there br The invention of architectural models made of cork was self attributed to Augusto Rosa but Giovanni Altieri documented and Antonio Chichi were already active in Rome as manufacturers of cork models br Chichi s models were copied by Carl May https de wikipedia org wiki Carl May and his son Georg Heinrich May br Other artists include Luigi Carotti Rome Carlo Lucangeli Rome Naples Domenico Padiglione and his sons Agostino and Felice Naples and Auguste Pelet N mes In Marseille several scale models were made representing archaeological digs by Hippolyte Augier Marseille History Museum Mus e d Histoire de Marseille or Stanislas Clastrier br Dieter C llen is an example of a contemporary phelloplast that continues the art br br br Collections br Many cork models of classical monuments in Italy were made and sold to tourists during their Grand Tour Cork especially when carefully painted was ideal to reproduce the weathered look of wall surfaces br As a rule they were produced on a large scale the Colosseum in Aschaffenburg is three meters long and one meter high and with high precision br Cork models were esteemed in the princely courts of the th century They were also acquired for their scientific value by schools of architecture in the late th and early th centuries or by institutions like the Society of Antiquaries of London and the British Museum as a way of introducing the general public to ancient architecture br Despite their fragility cork models have often survived better than wooden models threatened by wood destroying insects br Apart from kings and princes cork models were collected by people such as Filippo Farsetti in Venice Pierre Gaspard Marie Grimod d Orsay and the architect Louis Fran ois Cassas in France Charles Townley or Sir J Soane in London who turned his home into a museum and Sir John Soane s Museum housing a collection of models in cork of Roman and Greek buildings br Chichi s cork models can be found at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg Russia models made around Schloss Wilhelmsh he Kassel models made Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt models acquired and the Herzogliches Museum Gotha models acquired after see Wikipedia in German br The largest collection of cork models by Carl May with pieces after war losses is in Aschaffenburg Schloss Johannisburg another large collection of his models is in the Staatliches Museum Schwerin br In France the Mus e des Antiquit s Nationales Saint Germain en Laye has works by Rosa Lucandeli and Pelet The Mus e arch ologique de N mes Mus e arch ologique de N mes and the Marseille History Museum also have cork models br Modern cork models of antique buildings by Dieter C llen are exhibited in the Praetorium in Cologne br br br Scales br Architectural models are being constructed at a much smaller scale than their counterpart br The scales and their architectural use are broadly as follows br br full or real size for details br Details br Details br Interior spaces and furniture br Interior spaces and furniture br Interior spaces detailed floor plans and different floor levels br Building plans and layouts br Building plans and layouts br Building layouts or site plans br Urban scale for site or location plans br Site plans br Site plans and city maps br City maps Island br Sometimes model railroad scales such as and are used due to the ready availability of commercial figures vehicles and trees in those scales and models of large buildings are most often built in approximately that range of scales due to size considerations br
