ROM hacking also known as Read only memory hacking is the process of modifying a ROM image or ROM file of a video game to alter the game s graphics dialogue levels gameplay and or other elements This is usually done by technically inclined video game fans to improve an old game of importance as a creative outlet or to make new unofficial games using the old game s engine ROM hacks either re design a game for new fun gameplay while keeping most if not all of the items the same as well as unlocking reimplementing features that existed in the game s code but are not utilized in game br ROM hacking is generally accomplished through use of a hex editor a program for editing non textual data and various specialized tools such as tile editors and game specific tools which are generally used for editing levels items and the like although more advanced tools such as assemblers and debuggers are occasionally used Once ready they are usually distributed on the Internet for others to play on an emulator or games console br Fan translation known as translation hacking within the ROM hacking community is a type of ROM hacking there are also anti censorship hacks that exist to restore a game to its original state which is often seen with older games that were imported as publishers content policies for video games most notably Nintendo s were much stricter in the United States than Japan or Europe as well as randomizers for certain games which shuffle entity placements Although much of the method applies to both types of hacking this article focuses on creative hacking such as editing game levels br br br Communities br Most hacking groups offer web space for hosting hacks and screenshots sometimes only hosting hacks by the group s members and hosting almost any hack a message board and often have an IRC channel br br br Methods br Having been created by many different programmers or programming teams ROM data can be very diverse br br br Hex editing br A hex editor is one of the most fundamental tools in any ROM hacker s repertoire Hex editors are usually used for editing text and for editing other data for which the structure is known for example item properties and Assembly hacking br Editing text is one of the most basic forms of hacking Many games do not store their text in ASCII form and because of this some specialized hex editors have been developed which can be told what byte values correspond to what letter s of the alphabet to facilitate text editing a file that defines these byte letter relationships is called a table file Other games use simple text compression techniques such as byte pair encoding also called dual tile encoding or DTE in which certain combinations of two or more letters are encoded as one byte which a suitably equipped hex editor can facilitate editing br A hex editor is the tool of choice for editing things such as character item properties if the structure and location of this data are known and there is no game specific editor for the game that can edit this information Some intrepid hackers also perform level editing with a hex editor but this is extremely difficult except on games whose level storage format closely resembles how it is presented in a hex editor br br br Graphics editing br Another basic hacking skill is graphics hacking which is changing the appearance of the game s environments characters fonts or other such things The format of graphics data varies from console to console but most of the early ones NES Super NES Game Boy etc store graphics in tiles which are x pixel units of data which are arranged on screen to produce the desired result Editing these tiles is also possible with a hex editor but is generally accomplished with a tile editor such as Tile Layer or Tile Molester which can graphically display the ROM data as well as finding and editing tiles br Graphics hacks can range from simple edits such as giving Mario an afro or Luigi a golf club to porting characters from one game to another such as creating pixelated retro styled sprites of later generation Pok mon for use in Generation I V Pok mon games to full blown thematic changes usually with accompanying palette changes see below br More sophisticated graphics hacking involves changing more than just tiles and colors but also on how the tiles are arranged or tile groups generated giving more flexibility and control over the final appearance This is accomplished through hex editing or a specialized tool either for a specific game or a specific system Examples of graphics hacks include the incomplete Pok mon Torzach a hack of Pok mon FireRed which attempted to add a whole new generation of Pok mon and tiles to the game and Super Mario Land DX Golden Coins a full color version of the original game which added among others full color support the original game was greyscale only as well as fixes with screen flickering issues that were present in the original game br br br Palette editing br Another common form of hacking is palette hacking where color values are modified to change the colors a player sees in the game this often goes hand in hand with graphics hacking Palette values are commonly stored in Hex This is fairly easy for NES games the graphics of which use a pre defined set of colors among which a game selects using a YIQ based color palette palette hacking in this case entails changing which of those colors are selected The matter is slightly more complicated with Super NES and Sega Mega Drive Genesis games as well as games for other systems which store absolute RGB color values Palette editors are usually simple and often are with level editors or game specific graphics editors br br br Level editing br One of the most popular forms of ROM hacking level editing entails modifying or redesigning a game s levels or maps This is almost exclusively done with an editor specially tailored for a particular game called a level editor Level edits can be done to make the game more challenging to alter the flow of the game s plot or just to give something new to an old game Combined with extensive graphics hacking the game can take on a very different look and feel br br br Data editing br A core component of many hacks especially of role playing video games is editing data such as character item and enemy properties This is usually done either by hand with a hex editor if the location and structure of the data is known or with a game specific editor that has this functionality Through this a hacker can alter how weapons work how strong enemies are or how they act etc This can be done to make the game easier or harder or to create new scenarios for the player to face br br br Assembly hacking br The most powerful and arguably the most difficult hacking technique is editing the game s actual code a process called ASM hacking ASM means assembly referring to the low level programming language that gets executed by the CPU There is no set pattern for ASM hacking as the code varies widely from game to game but most skilled ASM hackers either use an emulator equipped with a built in debugger or tracer or run the ROM through a disassembler then analyze the code and modify it using a hex editor or assembler according to their needs While quite challenging compared to the relatively simple methods listed above anything is possible with ASM hacking of course within the limits of the hardware software of the gaming platform ranging from altering enemy AI to changing how graphics are generated Of course the possibilities are still limited by the hacker s ability to comprehend and modify the existing code br If the developers used a typed language the hacker may be able to compile their code for the game in the same language if they have access to a proper compiler One such example would be using C to hack Nintendo games since MIPS GCC can compile code for the Nintendo br br br Music hacking br Music hacks are relatively rare in most hacks due to the wide variety of ways games store music data hence the difficulty in locating and modifying this data as well as the difficulties in composing new music or porting music from another game As music cracking is very uncommon many hacks do not have any ported composed music added in Exceptions to this rule can be found in the most recent Super Mario World hacks where custom musics can have new instruments not found in the original game Other games that have music hacking as part of their research and hacking communities are the NES Mega Man games Final Fantasy VI and the Mega Drive Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog games br As many Game Boy Advance games use the M A Engine also called Sappy Driver for music the program SapTapper can be used to hack Game Boy Advance music data Various other utilities were created to work with the engine such as Sappy br Another instance of the same engine being used between games is on the Nintendo where most games use the same format however they use different sound banks A utility known as the N Midi Tool was created to edit the sequences that the majority of Nintendo games use though it does not cover the first party N titles that use a slightly different engine such as Super Mario br Several Sega Mega Drive Genesis games use a sound engine unofficially known as SMPS which were offered in both k and Z based versions As a predominant sound engine used in a variety of Japanese developed games for the system this sound engine has been researched for decades by many hackers As of today various tools exist to alter the music of games which use the SMPS engine most notably the Sonic the Hedgehog games in particular and many of them made their way to the Steam Workshop br br br ROM expansion br Generally speaking a ROM hacker cannot normally add content to a game but merely change existing content This limit can be overcome through ROM expansion whereby the total size of the ROM image is increased making room for more content and in turn a larger game The difficulty in doing this varies depending on the system for which the game was made For example expanding an NES ROM may be difficult or even impossible due to the mapper used by the game For example if a mapper allows ROM banks and all of them are used expanding the ROM further is impossible without somehow converting the game to another mapper which could be easy or extremely difficult On the other hand expanding an SNES game is relatively straightforward To utilize the added space parts of the game code have to be modified or rewritten see Assembly hacking above so the game knows where to look Another type of ROM expansion that is fairly easy is Game Boy Advance ROMs The ROMs themselves are generally small but the memory space available sometimes exceeds it by multiples of up to br br br Distribution br Once a hack is completed or an incomplete version is deemed suitable for an interim release it is released onto the Internet for others to play The generally accepted way to do this is by making an unofficial patch in IPS format or others that can be applied to the unmodified ROM This and usually some form of documentation is put in an archive file and uploaded somewhere IPS is a format for recording the differences between two binary files in this case between the unmodified and hacked ROMs and is suitable for rom hacks IPS is still used today for small patches however as ROMs became larger this format became useless leading to quite a few file formats being created such as NINJA and PPF also known as PlayStation Patch Format PPF is still used today particularly to patch large files such as ISO CD ROM images as well as Nintendo games A new patch format UPS has also been developed by the ROM hacking community designed to be the successor to IPS and PPF br A more recent patching format the APS patching system has also been developed by a devoted Game Boy Advance ROM hacker The APS system is more space efficient is reversible and is faster than its predecessor br The purpose of distributing a hack in patch form is to avoid the legal aspects of distributing entire ROM images the patch records only what has changed in the ROM hence distributing it does not usually distribute parts of the original game A patch is also normally drastically smaller than the full ROM image an NES ROM can run anywhere from KB to MB a Super NES ROM can run from KB to MB and Mega Drive Genesis ROMs can run from KB to MB As mentioned above patches usually only contained user made code changes and not copyrighted code so they were not illegal to be distributed br In a novel example of legal distribution Sega released a Steam based virtual hub for its previous collection of Mega Drive Genesis games entitled Sega Mega Drive Classics Hub The Hub besides allowing players to play emulated versions of these older games takes advantage of Steam s support for user created content through the Steam Workshop officially allowing the distribution of ROM hacks of any of the offered games br br br Usage br Patched ROMs are often played on emulators however it is possible to play patched ROMs on the original hardware The destination cartridge could be the original cartridge from which the initial unpatched ROM was pulled which involves replacing the original ROM chip with a new one or another compatible cartridge of the same type such as flash cartridges This is particularly popular for fan translations homebrew games prototypes games for which ROM cartridges were never produced or for games that require exact timing or other elements of the original hardware that are not available in emulators br br br Systems and games br The majority of ROM hacking is done on NES and SNES games including Sega Mega Drive Genesis games to an extent since such games are small and simple compared to games of more advanced consoles such as the Nintendo or Nintendo DS Games for the Game Boy Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance are also popular for hacking as well as games for the PlayStation to a lesser extent However games intended for more recent consoles are not exempt from hacking and as computers have become faster over time and more programs and utilities have been written more PlayStation Nintendo and Nintendo DS hacks have emerged br Of these popular games to play are popular games to hack many hacks have been released of games of the Sonic the Hedgehog series Mario series including Mario Bros Super Mario Bros Super Mario Bros Super Mario Bros Super Mario Land Super Mario Land Golden Coins Super Mario and Super Mario World Mario Kart series most notably Super Mario Kart Mario Kart Wii Mario Kart and Mario Kart DS Pok mon series Chip s Challenge Castlevania Final Fantasy The Legend of Zelda games from the Mega Man series Fire Emblem series EarthBound Super Metroid and many others br A notable hacked arcade game was Street Fighter II Rainbow Edition which featured increased game speed and new special moves The success of this game prompted Capcom to release Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting as an official response br Your Sinclair magazine published a monthly column called Program Pitstop This focused mainly on cheat hacks for games but also featured both a level map printer for the original Gauntlet as well as a full level editor for the same game
