acquisitions in the video game industry took place in when Japanese electronics giant Sony acquired Columbia Pictures a major Hollywood studio with a burgeoning video game division The acquisition

Employment br br br Education training br Video game designers are required to have a variety of skills and innate abilities that feature a vast amount of training in computer graphics animation and software design On top of these skills a successful designer needs a powerful imagination and knowledge of the various consoles operating systems Programming and hardware essentials are a must considering games are sophisticated computer software To get into the field many colleges offer classes certificates and degrees in computer programming computer engineering software development computer animation and computer graphics Internships or apprenticeships are important to get hands on experience If possible an aspiring American game designer should conduct freelance work There is even the possibility of designing a game independently using a wide array of available software Building an independent game can be risky yet the finished product gives employers insight on what the

games industry output br List of leading the US States with direct in state video games industry output br br br Game ratings and government oversight br br Prior to there was no standardized content rating body in the United States but with games becoming more violent and with capabilities to show more realistic graphics parents politicians and other concerned citizens called for government regulation of the industry The congressional hearings on video games putting the recently released Mortal Kombat and Night Trap in the spotlight drew attention to the industry s lack of a standardized rating system While individual publishers such as Sega and Nintendo had their own methods of rating games they were not standardized and allowed discrepancies between different console systems including sales of violent games to minors Members of Congress threatened to pass legislation that would mandate government oversight of video games if the industry did not create its own solution The industry responded in by the formation of the trade group the Interactive Digital Software Association IDSA today known as the Entertainment Software Association ESA and the creation of the voluntary Entertainment Software Ratings Board ESRB ratings system a system that met the governmental concerns of the time The ESRB focused mostly on console games at its founding Computer video game software used the Recreational Software Advisory Council RSAC through but transitioned to use ESRB in while the RSAC became more focused on rating online content from the Internet br Since several incidents of gun violence in the United States such as the Columbine School shooting of put more blame on video games for inciting these crimes thought there is no conclusive proof that violent video games lead to violent behavior Under demands of parents and concerned citizens federal and state governments have attempted to pass legislation that would enforce the ESRB rating systems for retail that would pose fines to retailers that sold mature rated games to minors This came to a head in the Supreme Court of the United States case Brown v Entertainment Merchants Association which concluded in that video games were considered a form of protected speech and regulation of their sales could only be mandated if the material passed the Miller test for obscene material br The ESRB remains a voluntary system for rating video games in the United States though nearly all major retail outlets will refuse to sell unrated games and will typically avoid selling those listed as AO for adults only Retailers are voluntarily bound by the age ratings though the Federal Trade Commission in found that the ESRB system had the best compliance of preventing sales of mature games to minors compared to the other American entertainment industries In addition to age ratings the ESRB rating includes content descriptors such as Nudity Use of Drugs and Blood and Gore to better describe the type of questionable material that may be in the game The ESRB not only rates games after reviewing material submitted by the publisher but also spot checks games after release to make sure no additional content had been added after review applying fines and penalties to publishers that do so Notably the ESRB was heavily involved over the Hot Coffee mod a user mod of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas that unlocked a sex scene that had been on the retail disc but otherwise inaccessible without the mod Currently of American parents are aware of the ESRB rating system and many are finding parental controls on video game consoles useful br In the digital storefront space including digital only games and downloadable content for retail games the ESRB does not require ratings though encourages developers and publishers to utilize the self assessment ratings tools provided by the International Age Rating Coalition to assign their game a rating which can propagate to other national and regional ratings systems such as the Pan European Game Information PEGI system br Arcade games in the United States are rated separated under a Parental Advisory System devised by the American Amusement Machine Association the Amusement Music Operators Association and the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry along with guidelines for where more mature games should be located in arcades and other code of conduct principles for arcade operators br br br See also br br History of video games br Best selling video games in the United States by year br List of video games markets by country
