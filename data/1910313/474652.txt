LightWave D is a D computer graphics program developed by LightWave Digital It has been used in films television motion graphics digital matte painting visual effects video game development product design architectural visualizations virtual production music videos pre visualizations and advertising br br br Overview br LightWave is a software package used for rendering D images both animated and static It includes a fast rendering engine that supports such advanced features as realistic reflection radiosity caustics and render nodes The D modeling component supports both polygon modeling and subdivision surfaces The animation component has features such as inverse and forward kinematics for character animation particle systems and dynamics Programmers can expand LightWave s capabilities using an included SDK which offers Python LScript a proprietary scripting language scripting and C language interfaces br br br History br br In Allen Hastings created a rendering and animation program called VideoScape D and his friend Stuart Ferguson created a complementary D modeling program called Modeler both sold by Aegis Software NewTek planned to incorporate VideoScape and Modeler into its video editing suite Video Toaster Originally intended to be called NewTek D Animation System for the Amiga Hastings later came up with the name LightWave D inspired by two contemporary high end D packages Intelligent Light and Wavefront In the Video Toaster suite was released incorporating LightWave D and running on the Amiga computer br LightWave D has been available as a standalone application since and version runs on both Mac OS X and Windows platforms Starting with the release of version the Mac OS X version has been updated to be a Universal Binary br The last known standalone revision for the Amiga was LightWave released in Shortly after the release of the first PC version NewTek discontinued the Amiga version citing the platform s uncertain future Versions were soon released for the DEC Alpha Silicon Graphics SGI and Macintosh platforms br LightWave was used to create special effects for the television series Babylon Star Trek Voyager Space Above and Beyond seaQuest DSV Lost and Battlestar Galactica The program was also utilized in the production of Titanic as well as Avatar Sin City and The short film was produced by two artists from their homes using LightWave In the Finnish Star Trek parody Star Wreck In the Pirkinning most of the visual effects were done in LightWave by Finnish filmmaker Samuli Torssonen who produced the VFX work for the feature film Iron Sky The film Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius was made entirely in LightWave and messiah Studio br In the first feature film to be D animated entirely by one person made its debut Flatland the Film by Ladd Ehlinger Jr It was animated entirely in LightWave D and br In its ninth version the market for LightWave ranges from hobbyists to high end deployment in video games television and cinema NewTek shipped a bit version of LightWave D as part of the fifth free update of LightWave D and was featured in a keynote speech by Bill Gates at WinHEC br On February NewTek announced LightWave CORE its next generation D application via a streamed live presentation to D artists around the world It featured a highly customizable and modernized user interface Python scripting integration that offered realtime code and view previews an updated file format based on the industry standard Collada format substantial revisions to its modeling technologies and a realtime iterative viewport renderer It was planned to be the first LightWave product to be available on the Linux operating system However on June CORE was cancelled as a standalone product and NewTek announced that the CORE advancements would become part of the ongoing LightWave platform starting with LightWave which was originally LightWave HC intended to be a transitional software system comprising the classical Layout and Modeler applications during the initial stages of CORE in order to supply compatibility with the existing toolset for LightWave br On December NewTek shipped LightWave It added an interactive viewport renderer VPR interactive stereoscopic camera rigs linear color space workflow real time interactive physical teleoperation input Virtual Studio Tools and data interchange upgrades br On February NewTek began shipping LightWave Software the latest version of its professional D modeling animation and rendering software LightWave incorporates many new features such as instancing flocking and fracturing tools flexible Bullet Dynamics Pixologic Zbrush support and more LightWave is used for all genres of D content creation from film and broadcast visual effects production to architectural visualization and game design br On January NewTek shipped LightWave which debuted a new modular rigging system called Genoma The flocking system was reworked gaining predator and prey behaviors The bullet dynamics system was improved to include soft body dynamics wind forces and to react to bone deformations Interlinks to After Effects and ZBrush via GoZ were added as well New tools based on a new experimental subsystem were added to Modeler It was originally thought that this subsystem would allow further enhancements to Modeler but disclosures by a developer in the main user forums since removed by moderators indicated that this approach had been too problematic and another avenue was being considered to enable Modeler to evolve FiberFX the hair fur system in LightWave also saw improvements with the release to work with soft bodies and to also directly support curves from Modeler for guiding hair Additionally braid and twist support was added to ease creation of complex hairstyles br On November NewTek shipped LightWave This release brought a new animation tool spline control along with improvements to ray casting to enable items in the scene to be precisely positioned on a surface with optional offset nVidia s CgFX was also implemented albeit via the legacy shader system STL support was added to enable output suitable for D printers The virtual studio system was also enhanced to support a LightWave D group authored add on called NevronMotion enabling direct motion capture full body and facial using consumer devices such as the Kinect on Windows only and re targeting via a simplified user interface A simplified Python system was made available for the Modeler environment and for common functions The timeline for Layout support via this simplified system has not been disclosed Alembic support was also introduced Since the release of two minor patches have been released to resolve software issues and In early May was released to address a licensing system limitation br On November NewTek released Lightwave The release upgraded Bullet physics integration constraints motors dynamics affecting bones Genoma rigging automation plug in with scripting edge rendering and the dynamic object parenting workflow It also added a plate perspective matching tool and Importance sampling to Global illumination The retail price was lowered by a third br On January NewTek released Lightwave Features include Physically Based Rendering System Render Light Buffers New Volumetric Engine OpenVDB Support New Lighting Architecture Surface Editor Material Nodes Surface Preview Virtual Reality Camera Modifier Stack Nodal Modifiers New Cel Shader Enhanced Edge Rendering More Integrated FiberFX Layout based Parametric Shapes Physically Based OpenGL a Noise Reduction Filter New Modeler Features include A Layout View viewport shows the current camera view from Layout In addition LightWave Modeler provides new fully interactive tools including Lattice Smoothing Array and Spline Bridge to speed up your modeling br In January LightWave introduced new integration tools with Unreal Engine animatable mesh sculpting and painting in Layout new UV mapping and UDIM tools as well as support for smoothing groups in Modeler improved FBX interchange shading model customization tools new shape primitives OpenVDB creation shading rendering enhancements and workflow UI improvements br br br Modeler and Layout br LightWave is composed of separate programs primarily Modeler and Layout Each program provides a dedicated workspace for specific tasks When these two programs are running simultaneously a program called Hub is used to synchronize data between the two br Modeler as the name implies includes all of the modeling features used to create the D models while Layout includes features to arrange the D models animate and render them Layout offers ray tracing global illumination and render output parameters br This separation is unique among D computer graphics packages which commonly integrate their modeler and renderer NewTek asserts dedicating workspaces for specific tasks creates an arguably more efficient D production workflow A long standing debate in the LightWave user community has consisted of whether or not to integrate Modeler and Layout into a single program In response to this NewTek has begun an integration process by including several basic modeling tools with Layout br There is also a command line network rendering engine named Screamernet which can be used to distribute rendering tasks across a large number of networked computers This is used to reduce the overall time that it takes to render a single project by having the computers each rendering a part of the whole project in parallel Screamernet includes all the features of the rendering engine that is integrated in Layout but without an interactive user interface LightWave supports render nodes natively br br br Features br br br Dynamics br LightWave provides dynamics physics systems supporting hard and soft body motion deformation constraint motorization environments and particles It interacts with D object models bones and hair FiberFX LightWave includes both Bullet and legacy proprietary comprising ClothFX SoftFX HardFX ParticleFX emitter wind

appearances that mimic br br Metaballs for objects like water or mercury including reflection or refraction surface settings br Sprites which are able to reproduce effects like fire or flocking birds br Volume shading for simulating clouds or fog type effects br br br Material shaders br LightWave comes with a nodal texture editor that comes with a collection of special purpose material shaders Some of the types of surface for which these shaders have been optimized include br br general purpose subsurface scattering materials for materials like wax or plastics br realistic skin including subsurface scattering and multiple skin layers br metallic reflective materials using energy conservation algorithms br transparent refractive materials including accurate total internal reflection algorithms br dielectric shading to render the behavior of light rays passing through materials with differing refractive indices br br br Nodes br NewTek expanded LightWave s parameter setting capabilities with a node graph architecture Node Editor for LightWave This Editor enabled broad hierarchical parameter setting on top of its fixed and stack based parameter setting support Example node types include mathematical script gradient sample instance group and shader Nodes are usable within the Surface Editor Mesh Displacement and Virtual Studio features A node plug in API was released for third party developers to add their own nodes br A notable example of third party node development is Denis Pontonnier s Additional Nodes These free nodes enable modifying images renders procedural textures Hypervoxels object motions animation channels and volumetric lights Also they enable particles and other meshes to drive node parameters br br br Scripting br LScript is one of LightWave s scripting languages It provides a comprehensive set of prebuilt functions you can use when scripting how LightWave behaves br With LightWave NewTek added Python support as an option for custom scripting br br br LightWave Plug In SDK br The SDK provides a set of C classes for writing native LightWave plug ins br br br Licensing br Prior to being made available as a stand alone product in LightWave required the presence of a Video Toaster in an Amiga to run Until version LightWave licenses were bound to a hardware dongle e g Safenet USB or legacy parallel port models Without a dongle LightWave would operate in Discovery Mode which severely restricts functionality One copy of LightWave supports distributed rendering of up to nodes br br br See also br br Computer generated
