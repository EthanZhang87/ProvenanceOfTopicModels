title: Game mechanics
id: 1012146
In tabletop games and video games game mechanics are the rules or ludemes that govern and guide the player s actions as well as the game s response to them A rule is an instruction on how to play a ludeme is an element of play like the L shaped move of the knight in chess A game s mechanics thus effectively specify how the game will work for the people who play it br There are no accepted definitions of game mechanics Some competing definitions include the opinion that game mechanics are systems of interactions between the player and the game that they are more than what the player may recognize they are only those things that impact the play experience and In tabletop games and video games game mechanics are the rules and procedures that guide the player and the game response to the player s moves or actions br All games use mechanics though there are different theories as to their ultimate importance to the game In general the process and study of game design are efforts to come up with game mechanics that allow for people playing a game to have an engaging but not necessarily fun experience The interaction of various game mechanics in a game determines the complexity and level of player interaction in the game and in conjunction with the game s environment and resources determine game balance Some forms of game mechanics have been used in games for centuries while others are relatively new having been invented within the past decade br br br Game mechanics vs gameplay br br Gameplay could be defined as the combination and interaction of many elements of a game However there is some confusion as to the difference between game mechanics and gameplay For some gameplay is nothing more than a set of game mechanics For others gameplay especially when referenced in the term of basic gameplay refers to certain core game mechanics which determine the overall characteristics of the game itself br For example the basic gameplay of a shooting or fighting video game is to hit while not being hit In a graphic adventure game the basic gameplay is usually to solve puzzles related to the context The basic gameplay of poker is to produce certain numerical or categorical combinations Golf s basic gameplay is to hit a ball and reach a designated spot br The goal of these games is slightly different from the gameplay itself For example while reaching the end of a stage in platform games defeating the boss advancing your characters progress through the story RPGs or sinking the ball into a hole golf may be the purpose of playing a game the fun is derived primarily by the means and the process in which such a goal is achieved Basic gameplay defines what a game is to the player while game mechanics determine the parts of which the entire game consists br In video games gamers have a well defined notion of what is considered gameplay This is br br What the player can do br What other entities can do in response to player s actions br What a player and other entities can do within a game would also fall under the mechanics of a game br However from a programming or overall design perspective basic gameplay can be deconstructed further to reveal constituent game mechanics For example the basic gameplay of fighting game can be deconstructed to attack and defense or punch kick block dodge and throw which can be further deconstructed to strong weak punch kick For this reason game mechanics is more of an engineering concept while gameplay is more of a design concept br br br Game mechanics vs theme br br Some games are abstract that is the action is not intended to represent anything Go is one famous example Other games have a theme some element of representation Monopoly is a famous example where the events of the game are intended to represent another activity in this case the buying and selling of properties br Games that are mechanically similar can vary widely in theme Eurogames often feature relatively simple systems and stress the mechanics with the theme merely being a context to place the mechanics in br Some wargames at the other extreme are known for complex rules and for attempts at detailed simulation br br br Key game mechanics categories br Game mechanics fall into several more or less well defined categories which along with basic gameplay and theme are sometimes used as a basis to classify games Geoffrey Engelstein and Isaac Shalev in their book Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design classify game mechanisms into categories as they relate to game structure turn order actions resolution victory conditions uncertainty economics auctions worker placement movement area control set collection and card mechanisms br br br Game structure br br br Game modes br br A game mode is a distinct configuration that varies gameplay and affects how other game mechanics behave A game with several modes will present different settings in each one changing how a particular element of the game is played One of the most common examples of game mode is the single player versus multiplayer choice in video games where multiplayer can further be cooperative or competitive br Common game modes include a Time Attack Mode in which the player tries to score progress or clear levels in a limited amount of time In Marathon Mode the goal is to clear a certain number of levels or challenges in a continuous streak without losing br Changing modes while the game is ongoing can be used as a means to increase difficulty and provide additional challenge or as a reward for player success Power ups are modes that last for a few moments or that change only one or a few game rules for example power pellets in Pac Man give the temporary ability to eat the enemies for a few seconds br Other examples include the availability of a sandbox mode without predefined goals or progression The division of game content in stages or chapters where each stage expands the rules that a player can use with respect to the previous stage increases game complexity and variety If the game advances through these stages by moving through different areas these areas are called levels or maps if the character unlocks new abilities through activities or rewards they receive a currency called experience points These points can be used to upgrade or augment various pre determined abilities br A game mode may restrict or change the behavior of the available tools e g play with limited unlimited ammo new weapons obstacles or enemies a timer etc establish different rules and game mechanics e g altered gravity win at first touch in a fighting game play with some cards face up in a poker game or even change the overall game goals following a campaign story or character s career vs playing a limited deathmatch or capture the flag set br br br Turns br br A game turn is an important fundamental concept to almost all non computer games and many video games as well although in video games various real time genres have become much more popular In general a turn is a segment of the game set aside for certain actions to happen before moving on to the next turn where the sequence of events can largely repeat In a truly abstract game backgammon turns are nothing more than a means to regulate play In less abstract games Risk turns obviously denote the passage of time but the amount of time is not clear nor important In simulation games time is generally more concrete Wargames usually specify the amount of time each turn represents and in sports games a turn is usually distinctly one play although the amount of time a play or turn takes can vary br Some games use player turns where one player gets to perform their actions before another player can perform any on their turn Monopoly and chess would be classic examples Some use game turns where all players contribute to the actions of a single turn board game simulations of American football tend to have both players pick plays and then determine the outcome each play or down can be considered a turn Some games have game turns that consist of a round of player turns possibly with other actions added in Civilization plays with a series of player turns followed by a trading round in which all players participate br In games that are meant to be some sort of simulation the on off nature of player turns can cause problems and has led to a few extra variations on the theme The semi simultaneous turn allows for some reactions to be done during the other player s turn The impulse based turn divides the turn into smaller segments or impulses where everyone does some of their actions at one time and then reacts to the current situation before moving on to the next impulse as seen in Star Fleet Battles or Car Wars br In some games not all turns are alike Usually this is a difference in what phases or different portions of the turn happen Imperium Romanum II for instance features a Taxation and Mobilization Phase in every third turn month which does not occur in the other turns Napoleon has an unusual variation on the idea where every third player turn is night turn where combat is not allowed br Even in real time computer games there are often certain periodic effects For instance a wounded character in World of Warcraft will gradually recover health while out of combat The rate of recovery is calculated from the character s statistics and applied per tick as a lump sum so a character would gain ten health per tick instead of one every tenth of a tick These periodic effects can be considered the vestigial remnants of the concept of turns br br br Action selection br br br Action points br br These control what players may do on their turns in the game by allocating each player a budget of action points each turn These points may be spent on various actions according to the game rules such as moving pieces drawing cards collecting money etc This type of mechanism is common in many German style board games br br br Worker placement br Worker placement is a game mechanism where players allocate a limited number of tokens workers to multiple stations that provide various defined actions The worker placement mechanism originates with board games Stewart Woods identifies Keydom later remade and updated as Aladdin s Dragons as the first game to implement the mechanic Worker placement was popularized by Caylus and became a staple of the Eurogame genre in the wake of the game s success Other popular board games that use this mechanism include Stone Age and Agricola Although the mechanism is chiefly associated with board games the worker placement concept has been used in analysis of other game types For instance Adams and Dormans describe the assigning of tasks to SCV units in the real time strategy game StarCraft as an example of the worker placement mechanic br br br Economics br br br Resource management br Many games involve the management of resources Examples of game resources include tokens money land natural resources human resources and game points Resource management involves the players establishing relative values for various types of available resources in the context of the current state of the game and the desired outcome i e winning the game The game will have rules that determine how players can increase spend or exchange their various resources The skillful management of resources under such rules allows players to influence the outcome of the game br br br Auction or bidding br Some games use an auction or bidding system in which the players make competitive bids to determine which player gets the right to perform particular actions Such an auction can be based on different forms of payment br br The winning bidder must pay for the won privilege with some form of game resource game money points etc e g Ra br The winning bidder does not pay upon winning the auction but an auction is a form of a promise that the winner will achieve some outcome in the near future If this outcome is not achieved the bidder pays some form of penalty Such a system is used in many trick taking games such as contract bridge br In some games the auction determines a unique player who gains the privilege in others the auction orders all players into a sequence often the sequence in which they take turns during the current round of gameplay br br br Movement br br Many board games involve the movement of playing tokens How these tokens are allowed to move and when is governed by movement mechanics br Some game boards are divided into more or less equally sized areas each of which can be occupied by one or more game tokens Often such areas are called squares even if not strictly square in shape Movement rules will specify how and when a token can be moved to another area For example a player may be allowed to move a token to an adjacent area but not one further away Dice are sometimes used to randomize the allowable movements br Other games particularly miniatures games are played on surfaces with no marked areas A common movement mechanism in this case is to measure the distance which the miniatures are allowed to move with a ruler Sometimes generally in naval wargames the direction of movement is restricted by use of a turning key br br br Set collection br br br Engine building br Engine building is a mechanism that involves building and optimizing a system to create a flow of resources SimCity is an example of an engine building video game money activates building mechanisms which in turn unlock feedback loops between many internal resources such as people job vacancies power transport capacity and zone types In engine building board games the player adds and modifies combinations of abilities or resources to assemble a virtuous circle of increasingly powerful and productive outcomes br br br Tile laying br br Many games use tiles flat rigid pieces of a regular shape that can be laid down on a flat surface to form a tessellation Usually such tiles have patterns or symbols on their surfaces that combine when tessellated to form game mechanically significant combinations br The tiles themselves are often drawn at random by the players either immediately before placing them on the playing surface or in groups to form a pool or hand of tiles from which the player may select one to play br Tiles can be used in two distinct ways br br The playing of a tile itself is directly significant to the outcome of the game in that where and when it is played contributes points or resources to the player br Tiles are used to build a board upon which other game tokens are placed and the interaction of those tokens with the tiles provides game points or resources br Examples of tile mechanics include Scrabble in which tiles are letters and players lay them down to form words and score points and Tikal in which players lay tiles representing newly explored areas of jungle through which archaeologists represented by tokens must move to score game points br br br Resolution br br br Capture eliminate br br In some games the number of tokens a player has on the playing surface is related to their current strength in the game In such games it can be an important goal to capture opponent s tokens meaning to remove them from the playing surface br Captures can be achieved in a number of ways br br Moving one of one s own tokens into a space occupied by an opposing token e g chess parchisi also known as a replacement capture or displacement capture br When there is an additional condition where the space immediately opposite has to be either off the board or a marked trap space it is known as a push capture br Jumping a token over the space immediately occupied by an opposing token e g draughts known as a jump or leap br When the opposing token can be any distance along an unobstructed line it is known as a flying capture br Occupying the adjacent squares of an opposing token e g tafl also known as a custodian capture custodianship or interception br Occupying one immediately adjacent square to an opposing token also known as approach br The reverse of approach capturing an adjacent opposing token by moving away from it in a straight line e g fanorona also known as withdrawal br Capturing two opposing tokens by occupying the single square separating them also known as intervention br Declaring an attack on an opposing token and then determining the outcome of the attack either in a deterministic way by the game rules e g Stratego Illuminati or by using a randomising method e g Illuminati New World Order br Surrounding a token or region with one s own tokens in some manner e g go also known as enclosure br Playing cards or other resources that the game allows to be used to capture tokens br Other specialized mechanisms that do not fall neatly into any of the above categories br In some games captured tokens are simply removed and play no further part in the game e g chess In others captured tokens are removed but can return to play later in the game under various rules e g backgammon pachisi Less common is the case in which the capturing player takes possession of the captured tokens and can use them himself later in the game e g shogi Reversi Illuminati also known as conversion br Many video games express the capture mechanism in the form of a kill count sometimes referred to as frags reflecting the number of opposing pawns eliminated during the game br br br Victory conditions br br Victory conditions control how a player wins the game Examples of victory conditions include the necessity of completing a quest in a role playing video game or the player being suitably trained in a skill as is the goal of a business game Some games also feature a losing condition such as being checkmated in chess or being tagged in tag In such a game the winner is the only remaining player to have avoided loss Games are not limited to one victory or loss condition and can combine several of these at once TTRPGs and sandbox games frequently have no victory condition br br br Catch up br br Some games include a mechanism designed to make progress towards victory more difficult the closer a player gets to it The idea behind this is to allow trailing players a chance to catch up and potentially still win the game rather than suffer an inevitable loss once they fall behind This may be desirable in games such as racing games that have a fixed finish line br An example is from The Settlers of Catan This game contains a neutral piece the robber which debilitates the resource generation of players whose territories it is near Players occasionally get to move the robber and frequently choose to position it where it will cause maximal disruption to the player currently winning the game br Another example often seen in racing games such as Chutes and Ladders is by requiring rolling or spinning the exact number needed to reach the finish line e g if a player is only four spaces from the finish line then they must roll a four on the die or land on the four with the spinner If more than four is rolled then the turn is forfeited to the next player br Other games do the reverse making the player in the lead more capable of winning such as in Monopoly and thus the game is drawn to an end sooner This may be desirable in zero sum games br br br Uncertainty br br br Dice br br These involve the use of dice usually as randomisers Most dice used in games are the standard cubical dice numbered from to though games with polyhedral dice or those marked with symbols other than numbers exist br The most common use of dice is to randomly determine the outcome of an interaction in a game An example is a player rolling a die or dice to determine how many board spaces to move a game token br Dice often determine the outcomes of in game conflict between players with different outcomes of the die dice roll of different benefit or adverse effect to each player involved This is useful in games that simulate direct conflicts of interest br br br Dice curves br Different dice formulas are used to generate different probability curves A single die has equal probability of landing on any particular side and consequently produces a linear probability distribution curve The sum of two or more dice however results in a bell curve shaped probability distribution with the addition of further dice resulting in a steeper bell curve decreasing the likelihood of an extreme result A linear curve is generally perceived by players as being more swingy whereas a bell curve is perceived as being more fair br br br Risk and reward br Some games include situations where players can press their luck in optional actions where the danger of a risk must be weighed against the chance of reward For example in Beowulf The Legend players may elect to take a Risk with success yielding cards and failure weakening the player s ultimate chance of victory br br br Card mechanisms br br These involve the use of cards similar to playing cards to act as a randomizer and or to act as tokens to keep track of states in the game br A common use is for a deck of cards to be shuffled and placed face down on or near the game playing area When a random result is called for a player draws a card and what is printed on the card determines the outcome of the result br Another use of cards occurs when players draw cards and retain them for later use in the game without revealing them to other players When used in this fashion cards form a game resource br br br Role playing br br Role playing games often rely on mechanics that determine the effectiveness of in game actions by how well the player acts out the role of a fictional character While early role playing games such as Dungeons Dragons relied heavily on either group consensus or the judgement of a single player deemed the Dungeon Master or Game Master or on randomizers such as dice later generations of narrativist games use more structured and integrated systems to allow role playing to influence the creative input and output of the players so both acting out roles and employing rules take part in shaping the gameplay br br br See also br Ludology br Game clock br
