A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm a step by step approach to solving a task br The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem Flowcharts are used in analyzing designing documenting or managing a process or program in various fields br br br Overview br br Flowcharts are used to design and document simple processes or programs Like other types of diagrams they help visualize the process Two of the many benefits are flaws and bottlenecks may become apparent Flowcharts typically use the following main symbols br br A process step usually called an activity is denoted by a rectangular box br A decision is usually denoted by a diamond br A flowchart is described as cross functional when the chart is divided into different vertical or horizontal parts to describe the control of different organizational units A symbol appearing in a particular part is within the control of that organizational unit A cross functional flowchart allows the author to correctly locate the responsibility for performing an action or making a decision and to show the responsibility of each organizational unit for different parts of a single process br Flowcharts represent certain aspects of processes and are usually complemented by other types of diagram For instance Kaoru Ishikawa defined the flowchart as one of the seven basic tools of quality control next to the histogram Pareto chart check sheet control chart cause and effect diagram and the scatter diagram Similarly in UML a standard concept modeling notation used in software development the activity diagram which is a type of flowchart is just one of many different diagram types br Nassi Shneiderman diagrams and Drakon charts are an alternative notation for process flow br Common alternative names include flow chart process flowchart functional flowchart process map process chart functional process chart business process model process model process flow diagram work flow diagram business flow diagram The terms flowchart and flow chart are used interchangeably br The underlying graph structure of a flowchart is a flow graph which abstracts away node types their contents and other ancillary information br br br History br The first structured method for documenting process flow the flow process chart was introduced by Frank and Lillian Gilbreth in the presentation Process Charts First Steps in Finding the One Best Way to do Work to members of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASME in The Gilbreths tools quickly found their way into industrial engineering curricula In the early s an industrial engineer Allan H Mogensen began to train business people in the use of some of the tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in Lake Placid New York br Art Spinanger a graduate of Mogensen s class took the tools back to Procter and Gamble where he developed their Deliberate Methods Change Program Ben S Graham another graduate Director of Formcraft Engineering at Standard Register Industrial applied the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi flow process chart to present multiple documents and their relationships In ASME adopted a symbol set derived from Gilbreth s original work as the ASME Standard Operation and Flow Process Charts br Douglas Hartree in explained that Herman Goldstine and John von Neumann had developed a flowchart originally diagram to plan computer programs His contemporary account was endorsed by IBM engineers and by Goldstine s personal recollections The original programming flowcharts of Goldstine and von Neumann can be found in their unpublished report Planning and coding of problems for an electronic computing instrument Part II Volume which is reproduced in von Neumann s collected works br The flowchart became a popular tool for describing computer algorithms but its popularity decreased in the s when interactive computer terminals and third generation programming languages became common tools for computer programming since algorithms can be expressed more concisely as source code in such languages Often pseudo code is used which uses the common idioms of such languages without strictly adhering to the details of a particular one br In the early st century flowcharts were still used for describing computer algorithms Modern techniques such as UML activity diagrams and Drakon charts can be considered to be extensions of the flowchart br br br Types br Sterneckert suggested that flowcharts can be modeled from the perspective of different user groups such as managers system analysts and clerks and that there are four general types br br Document flowcharts showing controls over a document flow through a system br Data flowcharts showing controls over a data flow in a system br System flowcharts showing controls at a physical or resource level br Program flowchart showing the controls in a program within a system br Notice that every type of flowchart focuses on some kind of control rather than on the particular flow itself br However there are some different classifications For example Andrew Veronis named three basic types of flowcharts the system flowchart the general flowchart and the detailed flowchart That same year Marilyn Bohl stated in practice two kinds of flowcharts are used in solution planning system flowcharts and program flowcharts More recently Mark A Fryman identified more differences Decision flowcharts logic flowcharts systems flowcharts product flowcharts and process flowcharts are just a few of the different types of flowcharts that are used in business and government br In addition many diagram techniques are similar to flowcharts but carry a different name such as UML activity diagrams br Reversible flowcharts represent a paradigm in computing that focuses on the reversibility of computational processes Unlike traditional computing models where operations are often irreversible reversible flowcharts ensure that any atomic computational step can be reversed Reversible flowcharts are shown to be as expressive as reversible Turing machines and are a theoretical foundation for structured reversible programming and energy efficient reversible computing systems br br br Building blocks br br br Common symbols br The American National Standards Institute ANSI set standards for flowcharts and their symbols in the s The International Organization for Standardization ISO adopted the ANSI symbols in The current standard ISO was published in and last reviewed in Generally flowcharts flow from top to bottom and left to right br br br Other symbols br The ANSI ISO standards include symbols beyond the basic shapes Some are br br br Parallel processing br Parallel Mode is represented by two horizontal lines at the beginning or ending of simultaneous operations br For parallel and concurrent processing the Parallel Mode horizontal lines or a horizontal bar indicate the start or end of a section of processes that can be done independently br br At a fork the process creates one or more additional processes indicated by a bar with one incoming path and two or more outgoing paths br At a join two or more processes continue as a single process indicated by a bar with several incoming paths and one outgoing path All processes must complete before the single process continues br br br Diagramming software br br Any drawing program can be used to create flowchart diagrams but these will have no underlying data model to share data with databases or other programs such as project management systems or spreadsheet Many software packages exist that can create flowcharts automatically either directly from a programming language source code or from a flowchart description language br There are several applications and visual programming languages that use flowcharts to represent and execute programs Generally these are used as teaching tools for beginner students br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br ISO Information processing Documentation symbols and conventions for data
