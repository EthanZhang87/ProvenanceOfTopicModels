title: Universal design
id: 1158081
Universal design is the design of buildings products or environments to make them accessible to people regardless of ageism disability or other factors It emerged as a rights based anti discrimination measure which seeks to create design for all abilities Evaluating material and structures that can be utilized by all It addresses common barriers to participation by creating things that can be used by the maximum number of people possible When disabling mechanisms are to be replaced with mechanisms for inclusion different kinds of knowledge are relevant for different purposes As a practical strategy for inclusion Universal Design involves dilemmas and often difficult priorities Curb cuts or sidewalk ramps which are essential for people in wheelchairs but also used by all are a common example of universal design br The term universal design was coined by the architect Ronald Mace to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone regardless of their age ability or status in life However due to some people having unusual or conflicting access needs such as a person with low vision needing bright light and a person with photophobia needing dim light universal design does not address absolutely every need for every person in every situation br Universal design emerged from slightly earlier barrier free concepts the broader accessibility movement and adaptive and assistive technology and also seeks to blend aesthetics into these core considerations As life expectancy rises and modern medicine increases the survival rate of those with significant injuries illnesses and birth defects there is a growing interest in universal design There are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent Universal design is also being applied to the design of technology instruction services and other products and environments Several different fields such as engineering architecture and medicine collaborate in order to effectively create accessible environments that can lend to inclusion for a variety of disabilities It can change the socio material relationships people have with spaces and environments and create positive experiences for all kinds of abilities Which allows for meaningful participation across multiple demographics experiencing disability br However it was the work of Selwyn Goldsmith author of Designing for the Disabled who really pioneered the concept of free access for people with disabilities His most significant achievement was the creation of the dropped curb now a standard feature of the built environment br br br Principles br The Center for Universal Design at North Carolina State University expounded the following principles br br Equitable use br Flexibility in use br Simple and intuitive br Perceptible information br Tolerance for error br Low physical effort br Size and space for approach and use br Each principle above is succinctly defined and contains a few brief guidelines that can be applied to design processes in any realm physical or digital br These principles are broader than those of accessible design and barrier free design br br br Goals br In the Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access at the University at Buffalo expanded the definition of the principles of universal design to include social participation and health and wellness Rooted in evidence based design the goals of universal design were also developed br br Body Fit br Comfort br Awareness br Understanding br Wellness br Social Integration br Personalization br Cultural Appropriateness br The first four goals are oriented to human performance anthropometry biomechanics perception cognition Wellness bridges human performance and social participation The last three goals addresses social participation outcomes The definition and the goals are expanded upon in the textbook Universal Design Creating Inclusive Environments br br br Examples br Spaces and buildings that use universal design often comply with broad areas of accessibility On the other hand homes and personal spaces comply with the specific disability or capabilities of a resident Gesture movements are activities that are normally autonomously accomplished on a daily basis These gesture movements are the foundation for what elements need to be incorporated into a design in order to achieve a space that lends itself to a livable and comfortable environment for somebody with a disability A study conducted in revealed that the words homeowners use to describe conditions of comfort and safety in their own home overlaps with words that are commonly used in discussions regarding accessibility utility and universal design These concepts include temperature lighting social atmosphere and other sensory qualities of an environment br Color contrast dishware with steep sides that assists those with visual or dexterity problems are an example of universal design Anyone can use the dishes and more people can use this than a flat plate br There are also cabinets with pull out shelves kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures In many of the world s public transit systems low floor buses that kneel bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap and or are equipped with ramps rather than on board lifts br br Smooth ground level entrances without stairs br Surface textures that require low force to traverse on level less than pounds force per pounds rolling force br Surfaces that are stable firm and slip resistant per ASTM br Wide interior doors hallways and alcoves with turning space at doors and dead ends br Functional clearances for approach and use of elements and components br Lever handles for opening doors rather than twisting knobs br Single hand operation with closed fist for operable components including fire alarm pull stations br Components that do not require tight grasping pinching or twisting of the wrist br Components that require less than pounds of force to operate br Cash br Light switches with large flat panels rather than small toggle switches br Buttons and other controls that can be distinguished by touch br Bright and appropriate lighting particularly task lighting br Auditory output redundant with information on visual displays br Visual output redundant with information in auditory output br Contrast controls on visual output br Use of meaningful icons with text labels br Clear lines of sight to reduce dependence on sound br Volume controls on auditory output br Speed controls on auditory output br Choice of language on speech output br Ramp access in swimming pools br Closed captioning on television networks br Signs with light on dark visual contrast br Web pages that provide alternative text to describe images br Instruction that presents material both orally and visually br Labels in large print on equipment control buttons br A museum that allows visitors to choose to listen to or read descriptions br br br Design standards br In specifications for barrier free design were published It was a compendium of over years of disability ergonomic research In the specifications became the first Barrier Free Design standard called the American National Standard A was published It was the first standard to present the criteria for designing facilities and programs for the use of disabled individuals The research started in at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign and continues to this day The principal investigator is Dr Timothy Nugent his name is listed in the front of the standard In Dr Nugent also started the National Wheelchair Basketball Association This ANSI A standard was adopted by the US federal government General Services Administration under FR FR FR ABA FR FR in for UFAS and then in for ADA The archived research documents are at the International Code Council ICC ANSI A division Dr Nugent made presentations around the globe in the late s and s presenting the concept of independent functional participation for individuals with disabilities through program options and architectural design br Another comprehensive publication by the Royal Institute of British Architects published three editions and of Designing for the Disabled by Selwyn Goldsmith UK These publications contain valuable empirical data and studies of individuals with disabilities Both standards are excellent resources for the designer and builder br Disability ergonomics should be taught to designers engineers non profits executives to further the understanding of what makes an environment wholly tenable and functional for individuals with disabilities br In October representatives from China Japan and South Korea met in Beijing and agreed to set up a committee to define common design standards for a wide range of products and services that are easy to understand and use Their goal is to publish a standard in which covers among other areas standards on containers and wrappings of household goods based on a proposal from experts in Japan and standardization of signs for public facilities a subject which was of particular interest to China as it prepared to host the Summer Olympics br The International Organization for Standardization the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission have developed br br CEN CENELEC Guide Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities Identical to ISO IEC Guide but free for download br ISO Building construction Accessibility and usability of the built environment available in English and French br ISO Ease of operation of everyday products Part Context of use and user characteristics br ISO TS Usability of consumer products and products for public use Part Summative test method published August br br br Design for All br The term Design for All DfA is used to describe a design philosophy targeting the use of products services and systems by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation Design for All is design for human diversity social inclusion and equality EIDD Stockholm Declaration According to the European Commission it encourages manufacturers and service providers to produce new technologies for everyone technologies that are suitable for the elderly and people with disabilities as much as the teenage techno wizard The origin of Design for All lies in the field of barrier free accessibility for people with disabilities and the broader notion of universal design br br br Background br Design for All has been highlighted in Europe by the European Commission in seeking a more user friendly society in Europe Design for All is about ensuring that environments products services and interfaces work for people of all ages and abilities in different situations and under various circumstances br Design for All has become a mainstream issue because of the aging of the population and its increasingly multi ethnic composition It follows a market approach and can reach out to a broader market Easy to use accessible affordable products and services improve the quality of life of all citizens Design for All permits access to the built environment access to services and user friendly products which are not just a quality factor but a necessity for many aging or disabled persons Including Design for All early in the design process is more cost effective than making alterations after solutions are already in the market This is best achieved by identifying and involving users stakeholders in the decision making processes that lead to drawing up the design brief and educating public and private sector decision makers about the benefits to be gained from making coherent use of Design for All in a wide range of socio economic situations br br br Examples br The following examples of Designs for All were presented in the book Dise os para todos Designs for All published in by Optimastudio with the support of Spain s Ministry of Education Social Affairs and Sports IMSERSO and CEAPAT br br Audiobook br Automatic door br Electric toothbrush br Flexible drinking straw br Google br Low floor bus br Q Drums br Tactile paving br Trolley case roll along suitcase br Velcro br Other useful items for those with mobility limitations br br Washlet br Wireless remote controlled power sockets br Wireless remote controlled window shades br br br In information and communication technology ICT br br Design for All criteria are aimed at ensuring that everyone can participate in the Information society The European Union refers to this under the terms eInclusion and eAccessibility A three way approach is proposed goods which can be accessed by nearly all potential users without modification or failing that products being easy to adapt according to different needs or using standardized interfaces that can be accessed simply by using assistive technology To this end manufacturers and service providers especially but not exclusively in the Information and Communication Technologies ICT produce new technologies products services and applications for everyone br br br European organizational networks br In Europe people have joined in networks to promote and develop Design for All br br The European Design for All eAccessibility Network EDeAN was launched under the lead of the European Commission and the European Member States in It fosters Design for All for eInclusion that is creating an information society for all It has national contact centres NCCs in almost all EU countries and more than network members in national networks br EIDD Design for All Europe is a NGO and a self financed European organization that covers the entire area of theory and practice of Design for All from the built environment and tangible products to communication service and system design Originally set up in as the European Institute for Design and Disability EIDD to enhance the quality of life through Design for All it changed its name in to bring it into line with its core business EIDD Design for All Europe disseminates the application of Design for All to business and administration communities previously unaware of its benefits and currently has member organizations in European countries br EuCAN The European Concept for Accessibility Network started in as an open network of experts and advocates from all over Europe in order to promote and support the Design for All approach The coordination work of EuCAN and the functioning of the network are mainly voluntary work In the Luxembourg Disability Information and Meeting Centre better known by its acronym Info Handicap took over the coordination of the steering group together with the implicit responsibility for the follow up of the European Concept for Accessibility ECA The EuCAN publications like ECA aim to provide practical guidance They are neither academic nor policy documents br br br The barrier free concept br Barrier free bariafurii building modification consists of modifying buildings or facilities so that they can be used by people who are disabled or have physical impairments The term is used primarily in Japan and other non English speaking countries e g German Barrierefreiheit Finnish esteett myys while in English speaking countries terms such as accessibility and accessible dominate in everyday use An example of barrier free design would be installing a ramp for wheelchair users alongside steps In the late s any element which could make the use of the environment inconvenient was considered a barrier for example poor public street lighting In the case of new buildings however the idea of barrier free modification has largely been superseded by the concept of universal design which seeks to design things from the outset to support easy access br Freeing a building of barriers means br br Recognizing the features that could form barriers for some people br Thinking inclusively about the whole range of impairment and disability br Reviewing everything from structure to smallest detail br Seeking feedback from users and learning from mistakes br Barrier free is also a term that applies to accessibility in situations where legal codes such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of applies The process of adapting barrier free public policies started when the Veterans Administration and US President s Committee on Employment of the Handicapped noticed a large amount of US citizens coming back from the Vietnam War injured and unable to navigate public spaces The ADA is a law focusing on all building aspects products and design that is based on the concept of respecting human rights It doesn t contain design specifications directly br An example of a country that has sought to implement barrier free accessibility in housing estates is Singapore Within five years all public housing estates in the country all blocks of apartments have benefited from the program br br br National legislation br Chile Ley n ESTABLECE NORMAS SOBRE

Buffalo is a current recipient br br br Common Shortcomings br br br Aswan Case Study br One study conducted in Aswan Egypt published in the Journal of Engineering and Applied Science aimed to explore the accessibility in three administrative buildings in the area They were looking for universal design in entrances and exits circulation of traffic within the building and wayfinding within the building s services They decided to focus their case study on administrative buildings in order to exemplify universal design that granted access for all citizens to all locations Among the buildings there were some shared issues br br br The Local Unit of Aswan City br In here the researchers found that vertical movement was difficult for disabled patrons given that there were no elevators There was also no dropped curb no Braille system and the handles of doors were difficult to open and there were no sensory indicators such as sounds or visual signs br br br Aswan University br The entrances of this building like many others did not include any textures indicating where ramps or stairs are In the case of this building there was an elevator but it was not large enough to turn a wheelchair in Although the elevator wasn t a successful adaptation of universal design the building did include double doors and wider halls which make the location easier to navigate in a wheelchair br br br National Organization for Social Insurance br This case highlights the importance if demographics when considering needs for universal design Over of the citizens who use this building on a daily basis are elderly but there aren t accommodations that are helpful to their capabilities Along with the lack of tactile features to guide the visually impaired the space within the building is very congested especially for one who may not have full physical capabilities and must use a wheelchair The circulation suffers as a result as well as the wayfinding in the structure br br br Latin America br br br Guadalajara br Although there have been attempts to create more accessible public and outdoor spaces the restorations made have ultimately failed to meet the needs of the disabled and
