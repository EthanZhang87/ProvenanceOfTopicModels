Video game piracy is the unauthorized copying and distributing of video game software and is a form of copyright infringement It is often cited as a major problem that video game publishers face when distributing their products due to the ease of being able to distribute games for free via torrenting or websites offering direct download links Right holders generally attempt to counter piracy of their products by enforcing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act though this has never been totally successful Digital distribution of pirated games has historically occurred on bulletin board systems BBS and more recently via decentralized peer to peer torrenting In terms of physical distribution Taiwan China and Malaysia are known for major manufacturing and distribution centers for pirated game copies while Hong Kong and Singapore are major importers br br br History and culture br As the personal computer rose to prominence in the mid to late s so too did the tendency to copy video games onto floppy disks and cassette tapes and share pirated copies by hand Piracy networks can be traced back to the mid s with infrastructure changes resulting from the Bell System breakup serving as a major catalyst Video game trading circles began to emerge in the years following with networks of computers connected via modem to long distance telephone lines transmitting the contents of floppy discs These trading circles became colloquially known as the Warez scene with the term warez being an informal bastardization of software br In the s crack intros began appearing on pirated games Preceding the booting of the actual game these windows would contain the monikers of those who created the pirated copy along with any messages they wanted to add Beginning as simple text the presentation of these crack intros gradually grew more complex with windows featuring GIFs music and colorful designs br With the rise of bulletin board systems throughout the s and into the s the sharing of pirated video games took a centralized form By connecting personal computers to telephone modems and dialing a number to a dedicated server members of the Warez scene could share their copies of video games Furthermore because this system preceded the rise of the consumer level internet it could go relatively unnoticed However with the rise of peer to peer torrenting and notably with the release of BitTorrent in this BBS format of video game piracy began to decline Nowadays torrenting pirated games remains the popular choice among those who engage in piracy Efforts to thwart illegal torrenting have historically failed because its decentralized nature makes it effectively impossible to totally dismantle br br br Anti piracy measures br br The use of copy protection has been a commonplace throughout the history of video games Early copy protection measures for video games included Lenslok code wheels and special instructions that would require the player to own the manual Several early copy protection measures have been criticized for both their ineffectiveness at preventing piracy and their inconvenience to the player One of the most typical means of copy protection is to assign a serial key to each legitimate copy of the game so that it can only be activated by entering the serial However this is often circumvented via software cracking or through the use of a keygen br More recent attempts to hinder piracy have included Digital rights management tools A form of this is the sale of games on digital distribution platforms such as the Epic Games Store Blizzard s Battle net and Steam Steam offers proprietary features such as accelerated downloads cloud saves automatic patching and achievements that pirated copies do not have The purpose of these features is to make piracy look less attractive and to incentivize the legitimate purchase of games Gabe Newell creator of Steam has stated that creating service value discourages piracy more than adding additional DRM Some games such as Grand Theft Auto IV use DRM that negatively alters gameplay if it detects that the game is an illegitimate copy In GTA IV s case it disables the brakes on cars and gives the camera an amplified drunk effect making gameplay much harder thus creating an incentive to legitimately purchase the game br Sometimes games require online authentication or have always on DRM A notable incident concerning always on DRM took place in surrounding the Windows release of Crash Bandicoot It s About Time Without a constant internet connection the game s DRM disallows any play at all even in single player which naturally drew ire However the Warez scene cracked this DRM feature almost immediately A cracked version of Crash Bandicoot stripped of this DRM began circulating online just one day after its official release br br br Emulation and piracy br Historically video game companies have blamed video game emulators for piracy despite the fact that anyone can create their own legal ROM image from the original media Concerning this demonization of emulators video game historian Frank Cifaldi attributed it to the Connectix Virtual Game Station Released in this commercial emulator enabled the play of Sony PlayStation games on Macintosh computers However it was easily cracked by hackers to play pirated ISO images of PlayStation games leading to a lawsuit from Sony Companies continued to fear that emulators would encourage piracy This has created a long running debate over emulation since many out of print video games can only be played via ROM making emulators the only replacement for defunct video game consoles Additionally modern remasters and remakes can significantly alter a game sometimes in a manner that changes the entire gameplay experience For example Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy had a rewritten physics engine requiring players to make more precise jumps Such gameplay changes give importance to emulators which may be able to run the original game br Some companies still consider emulators copyright infringing In Atlus attempted to take down the Patreon page of a PlayStation emulator RPCS arguing that the ability to play Persona on it made it illegal software However Patreon disagreed with the company s stance and allowed the page to remain as long as references to Persona were removed Furthermore Nintendo has taken decisive action against the emulation of its games in recent years In the company sued a handful of large ROM sites forcing them to remove ROMs of their older console games for what they called brazen and mass scale infringement of Nintendo s intellectual property rites The distribution of copied ROM files online is illegal but this move by Nintendo was interpreted by the emulation scene as an attack on the emulation of older games In November Nintendo issued a cease and desist order to The Big House an annual Super Smash Bros tournament The Big House ran SSB games on the Dolphin emulator and it was the addition of the mod Slippi which enabled online play that caught Nintendo s attention br Despite longstanding criticism of emulators in the game industry companies themselves have used emulation to run commercial games Nintendo operated the Virtual Console which allowed people to buy and play certain games via emulation In the PlayStation was found to contain a functioning internal PSP emulator Hackers discovered that PaRappa the Rapper Remastered was actually the PSP version running with upscaled textures This emulator was later reverse engineered and used to play other PSP games Additionally Microsoft s Xbox One console uses a proprietary emulator in order to play games released for the original Xbox and the Xbox br br br Console modding and piracy br br Modded consoles have been cited as an avenue for video game piracy both by allowing unauthorized copies to be played and by circumventing DRM Legal homebrew video games and backup copies can be played on modified systems but the argument of piracy remains A notable example of console modding is the original Microsoft Xbox of which tutorials still exist to this day By introducing softmod installation files via one of the four controller ports players could overhaul the system UI install and play games directly off the internal hard disc drive and even play TV shows and movies on the console Some softmods even re enable online play on the original Xbox despite the first incarnation of Xbox Live having shut down in A handful of hardmod techniques also exist for the original Xbox enabling hardware additions and upgrades to non stock components br Companies such as Nintendo have coordinated with law enforcement agencies to track down and seize modchips for their consoles such as in the Operation Tangled Web The same year Nintendo also began a crackdown against merchants of R flash cartridges which could be used to play pirated ROMs on the Nintendo DS In the device was declared illegal to sell or import into Japan among other countries In a man was arrested in the United Kingdom for allegedly running a Nintendo Switch modding operation out of his house Furthermore in two prominent members of the hacking group Team Xecuter were arrested and indicted by the Department of Justice The indictment detailed their creation of modded consoles which were designed to be circumvention devices that had the purpose of allowing users to play pirated ROMs br br br See also br Copyright infringement br br br
