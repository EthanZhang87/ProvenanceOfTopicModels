Doom WAD is the default format of package files for the video game Doom and its sequel Doom II Hell on Earth that contain sprites levels and game data WAD stands for Where s All the Data Immediately after its release in Doom attracted a sizeable following of players who created their own mods for WAD files packages containing new levels or graphics and played a vital part in spawning the mod making culture which is now commonplace for first person shooter games Thousands of WADs have been created for Doom ranging from single custom levels to full original games most of these can be freely downloaded over the Internet Several WADs have also been released commercially and for some people the WAD making hobby became a gateway to a professional career as a level designer br There are two types of WADs IWADs internal WADs and PWADs patch WADs IWADs contain the data necessary to load the game while PWADs contain additional data such as new character sprites as necessary for custom levels br br br History of WADs br br br Development of Doom br When developing Doom id Software was aware that many players had tried to create custom levels and other modifications for their previous game Wolfenstein D However the procedures involved in creating and loading modifications for that game were cumbersome br John Carmack lead programmer at id Software designed the Doom internals from the ground up to allow players to extend the game For that reason game data such as levels graphics sound effects and music are stored separately from the game engine in WAD files allowing for third parties to make new games without making any modifications to the engine Tom Hall is responsible for coming up with the name WAD br The idea of making Doom easily modifiable was primarily backed by Carmack a well known supporter of copyleft and the hacker ideal of people sharing and building upon each other s work and by John Romero who had hacked games in his youth and wanted to allow other gamers to do the same However some including Jay Wilbur and Kevin Cloud objected due to legal concerns and the belief that it would not be of any benefit to the company s business br br br Utilities and WADs br Immediately after the initial shareware release of Doom on December players began working on various tools to modify the game On January Brendon Wyber released the first public domain version of the Doom Editing Utility DEU program on the Internet a program created by Doom fans which made it possible to create entirely new levels DEU continued development until May of the same year It was made possible by Matt Fell s release of the Unofficial Doom specifications Shortly thereafter Doom players became involved with further enhancing DEU Rapha l Quinet spearheaded the program development efforts and overall project release while Steve Bareman led the documentation effort and creation of the DEU Tutorial More than other people also helped with the effort and their names appear in the README file included with the program distribution Yadex a fork of DEU for Unix systems running the X Window System was later released under the GNU GPL license Carmack additionally released the source code for the utilities used to create the game but these were programmed in Objective C for NeXT workstations and were therefore not directly usable by the mass userbase of IBM PC compatible br Jeff Bird is credited with creating the first custom WAD for Doom called Origwad on March Soon countless players were creating custom WADs and sharing them over AOL the CompuServe forums and other Internet based channels Many of the WADs were made in the style of the base game others were based on existing TV series movies or original themes Some of the id Software staff have revealed that they were impressed by some of the WADs John Carmack later said the following about a Star Wars themed modification br br I still remember the first time I saw the original Star Wars DOOM mod Seeing how someone had put the Death Star into our game felt so amazingly cool I was so proud of what had been made possible and I was completely sure that making games that could serve as a canvas for other people to work on was a valid direction br Another early modification is Aliens TC a total conversion based on the movie Aliens br Even though WADs modified Doom by replacing graphics and audio the amount of customization was somewhat limited much of the game s behavior including the timing and strength of weapons and enemies was hard coded in the Doom executable file and impossible to alter in WADs DeHackEd a Doom editing program created by Greg Lewis addressed this by letting users modify parameters inside of the Doom executable itself allowing for a greater degree of customization br br br Commercial WADs br Around and WADs were distributed primarily through BBSs and via CD collections found in computer shops or bundled together with instruction guides for level creation while in later years Internet FTP servers became the primary method for obtaining these works Although the Doom software license required that no profit be made from custom WADs and Shawn Green objected to people selling their WADs for money some WAD sets and shovelware bundles were nonetheless obtainable for a price at certain outlets br During this time id Software was working on their next game Quake using new technology but started projects picking up the most talented WAD makers from the Doom community to create official expansions and to compete with the unauthorized collection CDs The team produced the Master Levels which on December were released on a CD along with Maximum Doom a collection of WADs that had been downloaded from the Internet In Final Doom a package of two level megawads created by TeamTNT was released as an official id Software product br Various first person shooter games released at the time use the Doom engine under a commercial license from id Software as such essentially being custom WADs packaged with the Doom engine such as Hacx Twitch n Kill br In addition to the many people who contributed to commercially released WADs various authors became involved with the development of other games br br Kenneth Scott who contributed artwork to Hacx Twitch n Kill later became the art director at id Software and Industries on the post Bungie Halo games br Tim Willits who contributed two levels to Master Levels for Doom II later became the lead designer at id Software br Dario Casali author of a quarter of Final Doom was hired by Valve to work on Half Life br Sverre Kvernmo designer of five levels in Master Levels for Doom II and member of TeamTNT was hired by Ion Storm for Daikatana br Iikka Ker nen author of several Doom WADs and later Quake mods was hired by Ion Storm to create levels for Anachronox and Daikatana and by Looking Glass Studios to create levels for Thief II The Metal Age Ker nen was later hired by Valve br John Anderson level designer also known as Dr Sleep author of five levels in Master Levels for Doom II and E M in The Ultimate Doom later worked on Blood Unreal and Daikatana br Matthias Worch level designer joined Ritual Entertainment to work on SiN He later contributed to the Unreal series br br br Source port era br br Around interest in Doom WADs began to decline as attention was drawn to newer games with more advanced technology and more customizable design including id Software s own Quake and Quake II However a dedicated following continued into the new century with modern Doom modding becoming more popular than Quake and Quake II modding br On December id Software released the source code to the Doom engine initially under a restrictive license On October it was released again under the terms of the GNU GPL or later With the source code available it became possible for programmers to modify any aspect of the game remove technical limitations and bugs and add entirely new features br These engine modifications or Doom source ports have since become the target for much of the WAD editing activity and with the decline of MS DOS using a source port became the only feasible way to play Doom for most people Several source ports are in active development and Doom retains a strong following of WAD creators br br br Types of WADs br br br Levels br The most common type of WAD consists of a single level usually retaining the theme of the original game but possibly including new music and some modified graphics to define a more distinctive setting or mood Both single player and deathmatch multiplayer levels are common br WADs may have a level pack in the form of an episode replacing nine levels and sometimes in the form of a megawad which replaces or more levels in the game in Doom in Doom II in The Ultimate Doom br br br Total conversions br A WAD that gives the game an overhaul to incorporate an entirely different game setting character set and story instead of simply providing new levels or graphic changes is called a total conversion The phrase was coined by Justin Fisher as part of the title of Aliens TC or Aliens Total Conversion Add ons that provide extensive changes to a similar degree but retain distinctive parts or characteristics of the original games such as characters or weapons are often by extension called partial conversions br br br List of WADs br Since custom map editing started in many Doom Doom II and Doom WADs have been created and some have acquired fame even outside of the

named Freedoom Phase and Freedoom Phase and FreeDM which contains a collection of deathmatch levels br A similar project Blasphemer aims to create a complete free version of Heretic but is less fully developed than Freedoom from which it has recycled assets Currently three episodes are drafted and a deathmatch set called BlasphDM is available Zauberer has also been initiated for Hexen and Amimosity for Strife br br br Editing br Many level editors are available for Doom The original Doom Editing Utility DEU was ported to a number of operating systems but lost significance over time many modern Doom editors still have their roots in DEU and its editing paradigm including DETH DeePsea Linux Doom Editor and Yadex and its fork Eureka Other level editors include WadAuthor Doom Builder released in January Doom Builder released in May as the successor to Doom Builder GZDoom Builder released in March and Doom Builder X released in September Some Doom level editors such as Doom Builder family feature a D editing mode As of now these variants have been discontinued but a newer fork has been released and is regularly updated known as Ultimate Doom Builder br Many specialized Doom editors are used to modify graphics and audio lumps such as XWE SLADE Wintex and SLumpEd The DeHackEd executable patching utility modifies monsters items and weapon behavior In ZDoom users can create new monsters weapons and items through a scripting language called DECORATE made to address many of the shortcomings of DeHackEd such as not being able to add new objects and not being able to deviate far from the behavior of the original weapons and monsters br br br WAD and WAD br In Quake WAD files were replaced with PAK files WAD files still remain in Quake files though their use is limited to textures Since WAD and WAD use a slightly larger directory structure they are incompatible with Doom br br br See also br Quake modding br br br br br br Bibliography br Joseph Bell David
