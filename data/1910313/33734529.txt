The visual arts are art forms such as painting drawing printmaking sculpture ceramics photography video filmmaking comics design crafts and architecture Many artistic disciplines such as performing arts conceptual art and textile arts also involve aspects of the visual arts as well as arts of other types Also included within the visual arts are the applied arts such as industrial design graphic design fashion design interior design and decorative art br Current usage of the term visual arts includes fine art as well as applied or decorative arts and crafts but this was not always the case Before the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain and elsewhere at the turn of the th century the term artist had for some centuries often been restricted to a person working in the fine arts such as painting sculpture or printmaking and not the decorative arts crafts or applied visual arts media The distinction was emphasized by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms Art schools made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts br br The increasing tendency to privilege painting and to a lesser degree sculpture above other arts has been a feature of Western art as well as East Asian art In both regions painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist and being the furthest removed from manual labour in Chinese painting the most highly valued styles were those of scholar painting at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs The Western hierarchy of genres reflected similar attitudes br br br Education and training br br Training in the visual arts has generally been through variations of the apprentice and workshop systems In Europe the Renaissance movement to increase the prestige of the artist led to the academy system for training artists and today most of the people who are pursuing a career in the arts train in art schools at tertiary levels Visual arts have now become an elective subject in most education systems br In East Asia arts education for nonprofessional artists typically focused on brushwork calligraphy was numbered among the Six Arts of gentlemen in the Chinese Zhou dynasty and calligraphy and Chinese painting were numbered among the four arts of scholar officials in imperial China br Leading country in the development of the arts in Latin America in created the National Society of the Stimulus of the Arts founded by painters Eduardo Schiaffino Eduardo S vori and other artists Their guild was rechartered as the National Academy of Fine Arts in and in on the initiative of painter and academic Ernesto de la C rcova as a department in the University of Buenos Aires the Superior Art School of the Nation Currently the leading educational organization for the arts in the country is the UNA Universidad Nacional de las Artes br br br Drawing br br Drawing is a means of making an image illustration or graphic using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques available online and offline It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool or moving a tool across a surface using dry media such as graphite pencils pen and ink inked brushes wax color pencils crayons charcoals pastels and markers Digital tools including pens stylus that simulate the effects of these are also used The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing hatching crosshatching random hatching shading scribbling stippling and blending An artist who excels at drawing is referred to as a draftsman or draughtsman br Drawing and painting go back tens of thousands of years Art of the Upper Paleolithic includes figurative art beginning between about to years ago Non figurative cave paintings consisting of hand stencils and simple geometric shapes are even older Paleolithic cave representations of animals are found in areas such as Lascaux France and Altamira Spain in Europe Maros Sulawesi in Asia and Gabarnmung Australia br In ancient Egypt ink drawings on papyrus often depicting people were used as models for painting or sculpture Drawings on Greek vases initially geometric later developed into the human form with black figure pottery during the th century BC br With paper becoming common in Europe by the th century drawing was adopted by masters such as Sandro Botticelli Raphael Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci who sometimes treated drawing as an art in its own right rather than a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture br br br Painting br br Painting taken literally is the practice of applying pigment suspended in a carrier or medium and a binding agent a glue to a surface support such as paper canvas or a wall However when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with drawing composition or other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to The Sistine Chapel to the human body itself br br br History br br br Origins and early history br br Like drawing painting has its documented origins in caves and on rock faces The finest examples believed by some to be years old are in the Chauvet and Lascaux caves in southern France In shades of red brown yellow and black the paintings on the walls and ceilings are of bison cattle horses and deer br Paintings of human figures can be found in the tombs of ancient Egypt In the great temple of Ramses II Nefertari his queen is depicted being led by Isis The Greeks contributed to painting but much of their work has been lost One of the best remaining representations are the Hellenistic Fayum mummy portraits Another example is mosaic of the Battle of Issus at Pompeii which was probably based on a Greek painting Greek and Roman art contributed to Byzantine art in the th century BC which initiated a tradition in icon painting br br br The Renaissance br br Apart from the illuminated manuscripts produced by monks during the Middle Ages the next significant contribution to European art was from Italy s renaissance painters From Giotto in the th century to Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael at the beginning of the th century this was the richest period in Italian art as the chiaroscuro techniques were used to create the illusion of D space br Painters in northern Europe too were influenced by the Italian school Jan van Eyck from Belgium Pieter Bruegel the Elder from the Netherlands and Hans Holbein the Younger from Germany are among the most successful painters of the times They used the glazing technique with oils to achieve depth and luminosity br br br Dutch masters br br The th century witnessed the emergence of the great Dutch masters such as the versatile Rembrandt who was especially remembered for his portraits and Bible scenes and Vermeer who specialized in interior scenes of Dutch life br br br Baroque br br The Baroque started after the Renaissance from the late th century to the late th century Main artists of the Baroque included Caravaggio who made heavy use of tenebrism Peter Paul Rubens a Flemish painter who studied in Italy worked for local churches in Antwerp and also painted a series for Marie de Medici Annibale Carracci took influences from the Sistine Chapel and created the genre of illusionistic ceiling painting Much of the development that happened in the Baroque was because of the Protestant Reformation and the resulting Counter Reformation Much of what defines the Baroque is dramatic lighting and overall visuals br br br Impressionism br br Impressionism began in France in the th century with a loose association of artists including Claude Monet Pierre Auguste Renoir and Paul C zanne who brought a new freely brushed style to painting often choosing to paint realistic scenes of modern life outside rather than in the studio This was achieved through a new expression of aesthetic features demonstrated by brush strokes and the impression of reality They achieved intense color vibration by using pure unmixed colors and short brush strokes The movement influenced art as a dynamic moving through time and adjusting to newfound techniques and perception of art Attention to detail became less of a priority in achieving whilst exploring a biased view of landscapes and nature to the artist s eye br br br Post impressionism br br Towards the end of the th century several young painters took impressionism a stage further using geometric forms and unnatural color to depict emotions while striving for deeper symbolism Of particular note are Paul Gauguin who was strongly influenced by Asian African and Japanese art Vincent van Gogh a Dutchman who moved to France where he drew on the strong sunlight of the south and Toulouse Lautrec remembered for his vivid paintings of night life in the Paris district of Montmartre br br br Symbolism expressionism and cubism br Edvard Munch a Norwegian artist developed his symbolistic approach at the end of the th century inspired by the French impressionist Manet The Scream his most famous work is widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man Partly as a result of Munch s influence the German expressionist movement originated in Germany at the beginning of the th century as artists such as Ernst Kirschner and Erich Heckel began to distort reality for an emotional effect br In parallel the style known as cubism developed in France as artists focused on the volume and space of sharp structures within a composition Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque were the leading proponents of the movement Objects are broken up analyzed and re assembled in an abstracted form By the s the style had developed into surrealism with Dali and Magritte br br br Printmaking br br Printmaking is creating for artistic purposes an image on a matrix that is then transferred to a two dimensional flat surface by means of ink or another form of pigmentation Except in the case of a monotype the same matrix can be used to produce many examples of the print br Historically the major techniques also called media involved are woodcut line engraving etching lithography and screen printing serigraphy silk screening but there are many others including modern digital techniques Normally the print is printed on paper but other mediums range from cloth and vellum to more modern materials br br br European history br br Prints in the Western tradition produced before about are known as old master prints In Europe from around AD woodcut was used for master prints on paper by using printing techniques developed in the Byzantine and Islamic worlds Michael Wolgemut improved German woodcut from about and Erhard Reuwich a Dutchman was the first to use cross hatching At the end of the century Albrecht D rer brought the Western woodcut to a stage that has never been surpassed increasing the status of the single leaf woodcut br br br Chinese origin and practice br br In China the art of printmaking developed some years ago as illustrations alongside text cut in woodblocks for printing on paper Initially images were mainly religious but in the Song dynasty artists began to cut landscapes During the Ming and Qing dynasties the technique was perfected for both religious and artistic engravings br br br Development in Japan br br Woodblock printing in Japan Japanese moku hanga is a technique best known for its use in the ukiyo e artistic genre however it was also used very widely for printing illustrated books in the same period Woodblock printing had been used in China for centuries to print books long before the advent of movable type but was only widely adopted in Japan during the Edo period Although similar to woodcut in western printmaking in some regards moku hanga differs greatly in that water based inks are used as opposed to western woodcut which uses oil based inks allowing for a wide range of vivid color glazes and color transparency br After the decline of ukiyo e and introduction of modern printing technologies woodblock printing continued as a method for printing texts as well as for producing art both within traditional modes such as ukiyo e and in a variety of more radical or Western forms that might be construed as modern art In the early th century shin hanga that fused the tradition of ukiyo e with the techniques of Western paintings became popular and the works of Hasui Kawase and Hiroshi Yoshida gained international popularity Institutes such as the Adachi Institute of Woodblock Prints and Takezasado continue to produce ukiyo e prints with the same materials and methods as used in the past br br br Photography br br Photography is the process of making pictures by means of the action of light The light patterns reflected or emitted from objects are recorded onto a sensitive medium or storage chip through a timed exposure The process is done through mechanical shutters or electronically timed exposure of photons into chemical processing or digitizing devices known as cameras br The word comes from the Greek phos light and graphis stylus paintbrush or graph together meaning drawing with light or representation by means of lines or drawing Traditionally the product of photography has been called a photograph The term photo is an abbreviation many people also call them pictures In digital photography the term image has begun to replace photograph The term image is traditional in geometric optics br br br Architecture br br Architecture is the process and the product of planning designing and constructing buildings or any other structures Architectural works in the material form of buildings are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements br The earliest surviving written work on the subject of architecture is De architectura by the Roman architect Vitruvius in the early st century AD According to Vitruvius a good building should satisfy the three principles of firmitas utilitas venustas commonly known by the original translation firmness commodity and delight An equivalent in modern English would be br br Durability a building should stand up robustly and remain in good condition br Utility it should be suitable for the purposes for which it is used br Beauty it should be aesthetically pleasing br Building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs shelter security worship etc and means available building materials and attendant skills As human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices building became a craft and architecture is the name given to the most highly formalized and respected versions of that craft br br br Filmmaking br br Filmmaking is the process of making a motion picture from an initial conception and research through scriptwriting shooting and recording animation or other special effects editing sound and music work and finally distribution to an audience it refers broadly to the creation of all types of films embracing documentary strains of theatre and literature in film and poetic or experimental practices and is often used to refer to video based processes as well br br br Computer art br br Visual artists are no longer limited to traditional visual arts media Computers have been used as an ever more common tool in the visual arts since the s Uses include the capturing or creating of images and forms the editing of those images including exploring multiple compositions and the final rendering or printing including D printing br Computer art is any in which computers played a role in production or display Such art can be an image sound animation video CD ROM DVD video game website algorithm performance or gallery installation br Many traditional disciplines now integrate digital technologies so the lines between traditional works of art and new media works created using computers have been blurred For instance an artist may combine traditional painting with algorithmic art and other digital techniques As a result defining computer art by its end product can be difficult Nevertheless this type of art is beginning to appear in art museum exhibits though it has yet to prove its legitimacy as a form unto itself and this technology is widely seen in contemporary art more as a tool rather than a form as with painting On the other hand there are computer based artworks which belong to a new conceptual and postdigital strand assuming the same technologies and their social impact as an object of inquiry br Computer usage has blurred the distinctions between illustrators photographers photo editors D modelers and handicraft artists Sophisticated rendering and editing software has led to multi skilled image developers Photographers may become digital artists Illustrators may become animators Handicraft may be computer aided or use computer generated imagery as a template Computer clip art usage has also made the clear distinction between visual arts and page layout less obvious due to the easy access and editing of clip art in the process of paginating a document especially to the unskilled observer br br br Plastic arts br br Plastic arts is a term for art forms that involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by moulding or modeling such as sculpture or ceramics The term has also been applied to all the visual non literary non musical arts br Materials that can be carved or shaped such as stone or wood concrete or steel have also been included in the narrower definition since with appropriate tools such materials are also capable of modulation This use of the term plastic in the arts should not be confused with Piet Mondrian s use nor with the movement he termed in French and English Neoplasticism br br br Sculpture br br Sculpture is three dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining hard or plastic material sound or text and or light commonly stone either rock or marble clay metal glass or wood Some sculptures are created directly by finding or carving others are assembled built together and fired welded molded or cast Sculptures are often painted A person who creates sculptures is called a sculptor br The earliest undisputed examples of sculpture belong to the Aurignacian culture which was located in Europe and southwest Asia and active at the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic As well as producing some of the earliest known cave art the people of this culture developed finely crafted stone tools manufacturing pendants bracelets ivory beads and bone flutes as well as three dimensional figurines br Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated it is considered one of the plastic arts The majority of public art is sculpture Many sculptures together in a garden setting may be referred to as a sculpture garden Sculptors do not always make sculptures by hand With increasing technology in the th century and the popularity of conceptual art over technical mastery more sculptors turned to art fabricators to produce their artworks With fabrication the artist creates a design and pays a fabricator to produce it This allows sculptors to create larger and more complex sculptures out of materials like cement metal and plastic that they would not be able to create by hand Sculptures can also be made with d printing technology br br br US copyright definition of visual art br In the United States the law protecting the copyright over a piece of visual art gives a more restrictive definition of visual art
