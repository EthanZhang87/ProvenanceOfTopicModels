 D computer graphics sometimes called CGI D CGI or three dimensional computer graphics are graphics that use a three dimensional representation of geometric data often Cartesian that is stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering digital images usually D images but sometimes D images The resulting images may be stored for viewing later possibly as an animation or displayed in real time br D computer graphics contrary to what the name suggests are most often displayed on two dimensional displays Unlike D film and similar techniques the result is two dimensional without visual depth More often D graphics are being displayed on D displays like in virtual reality systems br D graphics stand in contrast to D computer graphics which typically use completely different methods and formats for creation and rendering br D computer graphics rely on many of the same algorithms as D computer vector graphics in the wire frame model and D computer raster graphics in the final rendered display In computer graphics software D applications may use D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting and similarly D may use some D rendering techniques br The objects in D computer graphics are often referred to as D models Unlike the rendered image a model s data is contained within a graphical data file A D model is a mathematical representation of any three dimensional object a model is not technically a graphic until it is displayed A model can be displayed visually as a two dimensional image through a process called D rendering or it can be used in non graphical computer simulations and calculations With D printing models are rendered into an actual D physical representation of themselves with some limitations as to how accurately the physical model can match the virtual model br br br History br br William Fetter was credited with coining the term computer graphics in to describe his work at Boeing An early example of interactive D computer graphics was explored in by the Sketchpad program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology s Lincoln Laboratory One of the first displays of computer animation was Futureworld which included an animation of a human face and a hand that had originally appeared in the experimental short A Computer Animated Hand created by University of Utah students Edwin Catmull and Fred Parke br D computer graphics software began appearing for home computers in the late s The earliest known example is D Art Graphics a set of D computer graphics effects written by Kazumasa Mitazawa and released in June for the Apple II br br br Overview br D computer graphics production workflow falls into three basic phases br br D modeling the process of forming a computer model of an object s shape br Layout and CGI animation the placement and movement of objects models lights etc within a scene br D rendering the computer calculations that based on light placement surface types and other qualities generate rasterize the scene into an image br br br Modeling br br The model describes the process of forming the shape of an object The two most common sources of D models are those that an artist or engineer originates on the computer with some kind of D modeling tool and models scanned into a computer from real world objects Polygonal Modeling Patch Modeling and NURBS Modeling are some popular tools used in D modeling Models can also be produced procedurally or via physical simulation Basically a D model is formed from points called vertices that define the shape and form polygons A polygon is an area formed from at least three vertices a triangle A polygon of n points is an n gon The overall integrity of the model and its suitability to use in animation depend on the structure of the polygons br br br Layout and animation br br Before rendering into an image objects must be laid out in a D scene This defines spatial relationships between objects including location and size Animation refers to the temporal description of an object i e how it moves and deforms over time Popular methods include keyframing inverse kinematics and motion capture These techniques are often used in combination As with animation physical simulation also specifies motion br br br Materials and textures br Materials and textures are properties that the render engine uses to render the model One can give the model materials to tell the render engine how to treat light when it hits the surface Textures are used to give the material color using a color or albedo map or give the surface features using a bump map or normal map It can be also used to deform the model itself using a displacement map br br br Rendering br br Rendering converts a model into an image either by simulating light transport to get photo realistic images or by applying an art style as in non photorealistic rendering The two basic operations in realistic rendering are transport how much light gets from one place to another and scattering how surfaces interact with light This step is usually performed using D computer graphics software or a D graphics API Altering the scene into a suitable form for rendering also involves D projection which displays a three dimensional image in two dimensions Although D modeling and CAD software may perform D rendering as well e g Autodesk ds Max or Blender exclusive D rendering software also exists e g OTOY s Octane Rendering Engine Maxon s Redshift br br Examples of D rendering br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Software br D computer graphics software produces computer generated imagery CGI through D modeling and D rendering or produces D models for analytic scientific and industrial purposes br br br File formats br br There are many varieties of files supporting D graphics for example Wavefront obj files and x DirectX files Each file type generally tends to have its own unique data structure br Each file format can be accessed through their respective applications such as DirectX files and Quake Alternatively files can be accessed through third party standalone programs or via manual decompilation br br br Modeling br br D modeling software is a class of D computer graphics software used to produce D models Individual programs of this class are called modeling applications or modelers br D modeling starts by describing display models Drawing Points Drawing Lines and Drawing triangles and other Polygonal patches br D modelers allow users to create and alter models via their D mesh Users can add subtract stretch and otherwise change the mesh to their desire Models can be viewed from a variety of angles usually simultaneously Models can be rotated and the view can be zoomed in and out br D modelers can export their models to files which can then be imported into other applications as long as the metadata are compatible Many modelers allow importers and exporters to be plugged in so they can read and write data in the native formats of other applications br Most D modelers contain a number of related features such as ray tracers and other rendering alternatives and texture mapping facilities Some also contain features that support or allow animation of models Some may be able to generate full motion video of a series of rendered scenes i e animation br br br Computer aided design CAD br br Computer aided design software may employ the same fundamental D modeling techniques that D modeling software use but their goal differs They are used in computer aided engineering computer aided manufacturing Finite element analysis product lifecycle management D printing and computer aided architectural design br br br Complementary tools br After producing a video studios then edit or composite the video using programs such as Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro at the mid level or Autodesk Combustion Digital Fusion Shake at the high end Match moving software is commonly used to match live video with computer generated video keeping the two in sync as the camera moves br Use of real time computer graphics engines to create a cinematic production is called machinima br br br Other types of D appearance br br br Photorealistic D graphics br br Not all computer graphics that appear D are based on a wireframe model D computer graphics with D photorealistic effects are often achieved without wireframe modeling and are sometimes indistinguishable in the final form Some graphic art software includes filters that can be applied to D vector graphics or D raster graphics on transparent layers Visual artists may also copy or visualize D effects and manually render photorealistic effects without the use of filters br br br D br br Some video games use D graphics involving restricted projections of three dimensional environments such as isometric graphics or virtual cameras with fixed angles either as a way to improve performance of the game engine or for stylistic and gameplay concerns By contrast games using D computer graphics without such restrictions are said to use true D br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br A Critical
