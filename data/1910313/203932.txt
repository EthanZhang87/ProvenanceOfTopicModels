title: Theory of constraints
id: 203932
The theory of constraints TOC is a management paradigm that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints There is always at least one constraint and TOC uses a focusing process to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it TOC adopts the common idiom a chain is no stronger than its weakest link That means that organizations and processes are vulnerable because the weakest person or part can always damage or break them or at least adversely affect the outcome br br br History br The theory of constraints is an overall management philosophy introduced by Eliyahu M Goldratt in his book titled The Goal that is geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals Goldratt adapted the concept to project management with his book Critical Chain published in br An earlier propagator of a similar concept was Wolfgang Mewes in Germany with publications on power oriented management theory Machtorientierte F hrungstheorie and following with his Energo Kybernetic System EKS later renamed Engpasskonzentrierte Strategie Bottleneck focused Strategy as a more advanced theory of bottlenecks The publications of Wolfgang Mewes are marketed through the FAZ Verlag publishing house of the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung However the paradigm Theory of constraints was first used by Goldratt br br br Key assumption br The underlying premise of the theory of constraints is that organizations can be measured and controlled by variations on three measures throughput operational expense and inventory Inventory is all the money that the system has invested in purchasing things which it intends to sell Operational expense is all the money the system spends in order to turn inventory into throughput Throughput is the rate at which the system generates money through sales br Before the goal itself can be reached necessary conditions must first be met These typically include safety quality legal obligations etc For most businesses the goal itself is to make profit However for many organizations and non profit businesses making money is a necessary condition for pursuing the goal Whether it is the goal or a necessary condition understanding how to make sound financial decisions based on throughput inventory and operating expense is a critical requirement br br br The five focusing steps br TOC is based on the premise that the rate of goal achievement by a goal oriented system i e the system s throughput is limited by at least one constraint br The argument by reductio ad absurdum is as follows If there was nothing preventing a system from achieving higher throughput i e more goal units in a unit of time its throughput would be infinite which is impossible in a real life system br Only by increasing flow through the constraint can overall throughput be increased br Assuming the goal of a system has been articulated and its measurements defined the steps are br br Identify the system s constraint s br Decide how to exploit the system s constraint s br Subordinate everything else to the above decision br Elevate the system s constraint s br Warning If in the previous steps a constraint has been broken go back to step but do not allow inertia to cause a system s constraint br The goal of a commercial organization is Make more money now and in the future and its measurements are given by throughput accounting as throughput inventory and operating expenses br The five focusing steps aim to ensure ongoing improvement efforts are centered on the organization s constraint s In the TOC literature this is referred to as the process of ongoing improvement POOGI br These focusing steps are the key steps to developing the specific applications mentioned below br br br Constraints br A constraint is anything that prevents the system from achieving its goal There are many ways that constraints can show up but a core principle within TOC is that there are not tens or hundreds of constraints There is at least one but at most only a few in any given system Constraints can be internal or external to the system An internal constraint is in evidence when the market demands more from the system than it can deliver If this is the case then the focus of the organization should be on discovering that constraint and following the five focusing steps to open it up and potentially remove it An external constraint exists when the system can produce more than the market will bear If this is the case then the organization should focus on mechanisms to create more demand for its products or services br Types of internal constraints br br Equipment The way equipment is currently used limits the ability of the system to produce more salable goods services br People Lack of skilled people limits the system Mental models held by people can cause behaviour that becomes a constraint br Policy A written or unwritten policy prevents the system from making more br The concept of the constraint in Theory of Constraints is analogous to but differs from the constraint that shows up in mathematical optimization In TOC the constraint is used as a focusing mechanism for management of the system In optimization the constraint is written into the mathematical expressions to limit the scope of the solution X can be no greater than br Please note organizations have many problems with equipment people policies etc A breakdown is just that a breakdown and is not a constraint in the true sense of the TOC concept The constraint is the limiting factor that is preventing the organization from getting more throughput typically revenue through sales even when nothing goes wrong br br br Breaking a constraint br If a constraint s throughput capacity is elevated to the point where it is no longer the system s limiting factor this is said to break the constraint The limiting factor is now some other part of the system or may be external to the system an external constraint This is not to be confused with a breakdown br br br Buffers br Buffers are used throughout the theory of constraints They often result as part of the exploit and subordinate steps of the five focusing steps Buffers are placed before the governing constraint thus ensuring that the constraint is never starved Buffers are also placed behind the constraint to prevent downstream failure from blocking the constraint s output Buffers used in this way protect the constraint from variations in the rest of the system and should allow for normal variation of processing time and the occasional upset Murphy before and behind the constraint br Buffers can be a bank of physical objects before a work center waiting to be processed by that work center Buffers ultimately buy you time as in the time before work reaches the constraint and are often verbalized as time buffers There should always be enough but not excessive work in the time queue before the constraint and adequate offloading space behind the constraint br Buffers are not the small queue of work that sits before every work center in a kanban system although it is similar if you regard the assembly line as the governing constraint A prerequisite in the theory is that with one constraint in the system all other parts of the system must have sufficient capacity to keep up with the work at the constraint and to catch up if time was lost In a balanced line as espoused by kanban when one work center goes down for a period longer than the buffer allows then the entire system must wait until that work center is restored In a TOC system the only situation where work is in danger is if the constraint is unable to process either due to malfunction sickness or a hole in the buffer if something goes wrong that the time buffer can not protect br Buffer management therefore represents a crucial attribute of the theory of constraints There are many ways to apply buffers but the most often used is a visual system of designating the buffer in three colors green okay yellow caution and red action required Creating this kind of visibility enables the system as a whole to align and thus subordinate to the need of the constraint in a holistic manner This can also be done daily in a central operations room that is accessible to everybody br br br Plant types br There are four primary types of plants in the TOC lexicon Draw the flow of material from the bottom of a page to the top and you get the four types They specify the general flow of materials through a system and also provide some hints about where to look for typical problems This type of analysis is known as VATI analysis as it uses the bottom up shapes of the letters V A T and I to describe the types of plants The four types can be combined in many ways in larger facilities e g an A plant feeding a V plant br br V plant The general flow of material is one to many such as a plant that takes one raw material and can make many final products Classic examples are meat rendering plants or a steel manufacturer The primary problem in V plants is robbing where one operation A immediately after a diverging point steals materials meant for the other operation B Once the material has been processed by A it cannot come back and be run through B without significant rework br A plant The general flow of material is many to one such as in a plant where many sub assemblies converge for a final assembly The primary problem in A plants is in synchronizing the converging lines so that each supplies the final assembly point at the right time br T plant The general flow is that of an I plant or has multiple lines which then splits into many assemblies many to many Most manufactured parts are used in multiple assemblies and nearly all assemblies use multiple parts Customized devices such as computers are good examples T plants suffer from both synchronization problems of A plants parts aren t all available for an assembly and the robbing problems of V plants one assembly steals parts that could have been used in another br I plant Material flows in a sequence such as in an assembly line The primary work is done in a straight sequence of events one to one The constraint is the slowest operation br From the above list one can deduce that for non material systems one could draw the flow of work or the flow of processes instead of physical flows and arrive at similar basic V A T or I structures A project for example is an A shaped sequence of work culminating in a delivered product i e the intended outcome of the project br br br Applications br The focusing steps this process of ongoing improvement have been applied to manufacturing project management supply chain distribution generated specific solutions Other tools mainly the thinking process also led to TOC applications in the fields of marketing and sales and finance The solution as applied to each of these areas are listed below br br br Operations br Within manufacturing operations and operations management the solution seeks to pull materials through the system rather than push them into the system The primary methodology used is drum buffer rope DBR and a variation called simplified drum buffer rope S DBR br Drum buffer rope is a manufacturing execution methodology based on the fact the output of a system can only be the same as the output at the constraint of the system Any attempt to produce more than what the constraint can process just leads to excess inventory piling up The method is named for its three components The drum is the rate at which the physical constraint of the plant can work the work center or machine or operation that limits the ability of the entire system to produce more The rest of the plant follows the beat of the drum Schedule at the drum decides what the system should produce in what sequence to produce and how much to produce They make sure the drum has work and that anything the drum has processed does not get wasted br The buffer protects the drum so that it always has work flowing to it Buffers in DBR provide the additional lead time beyond the required set up and process times for materials in the product flow Since these buffers have time as their unit of measure rather than quantity of material this makes the priority system operate strictly based on the time an order is expected to be at the drum Each work order will have a remaining buffer status that can be calculated Based on this buffer status work orders can be color coded into Red Yellow and Green The red orders have the highest priority and must be worked on first since they have penetrated most into their buffers followed by yellow and green As time evolves this buffer status might change and the color assigned to the particular work order change with it br Traditional DBR usually calls for buffers at several points in the system the constraint synchronization points and at shipping S DBR has a buffer at shipping and manages the flow of work across the drum through a load planning mechanism br The rope is the work release mechanism for the plant Orders are released to the shop floor at one buffer time before they are due to be processed by the constraint In other words if the buffer is days the order is released days before it is due at the constraint Putting work into the system earlier than this buffer time is likely to generate too high work in process and slow down the entire system br br br High speed automated production lines br Automated production lines achieve high throughput rates and output quantities by deploying automation solutions that are highly task specific Depending on their design and construction these machines operate at different speeds and capacities and therefore have varying efficiency levels br A prominent example is the use of automated production lines in the beverage industry Filling systems usually have several machines executing parts of the complete bottling process from filling primary containers to secondary packaging and palletisation br To be able to maximize the throughput the production line usually has a designed constraint This constraint is typically the slowest and often the most expensive machine on the line The overall throughput of the line is determined by this machine All other machines can operate faster and are connected by conveyors br The conveyors usually have the ability to buffer product In the event of a stoppage at a machine other than the constraint the conveyor can buffer the product enabling the constraint machine to keep on running br A typical line setup is such that in normal operation the upstream conveyors from the constraint machine are always run full to prevent starvation at the constraint and the downstream conveyors are run empty to prevent a back up at the constraint The overall aim is to prevent minor stoppages at the machines from impacting the constraint br For this reason as the machines get further from the constraint they have the ability to run faster than the previous machine and this creates a V curve br br br Supply chain and logistics br In general the solution for supply chains is to create flow of inventory so as to ensure greater availability and to eliminate surpluses br The TOC distribution solution is effective when used to address a single link in the supply chain and more so across the entire system even if that system comprises many different companies The purpose of the TOC distribution solution is to establish a competitive advantage based on extraordinary availability by reducing the damages caused when the flow of goods is interrupted by shortages and surpluses br This approach uses several new rules to protect availability with less inventory than is conventionally required br br Inventory is held at an aggregation point s as close as possible to the source This approach ensures smoothed demand at the aggregation point requiring proportionally less inventory The distribution centers holding the aggregated stock are able to ship goods downstream to the next link in the supply chain much more quickly than a make to order manufacturer can br Following this rule may result in a make to order manufacturer converting to make to stock The inventory added at the aggregation point is significantly less than the inventory reduction downstream br In all stocking locations initial inventory buffers are set which effectively create an upper limit of the inventory at that location The buffer size is equal to the maximum expected consumption within the average Replenishment Time RT plus additional stock to protect in case a delivery is late In other words there is no advantage in holding more inventory in a location than the amount that might be consumed before more could be ordered and received Typically the sum of the on hand value of such buffers are less than currently observed average inventory levels br Replenishment Time RT is the sum of the delay after the first consumption following a delivery before an order is placed plus the delay after the order is placed until the ordered goods arrive at the ordering location br Once buffers have been established no replenishment orders are placed as long as the quantity inbound already ordered but not yet received plus the quantity on hand are equal to or greater than the buffer size Following this rule causes surplus inventory to be bled off as it is consumed br For any reason when on hand plus inbound inventory is less than the buffer orders are placed as soon as practical to increase the inbound inventory so that the relationship on Hand Inbound Buffer is maintained br To ensure buffers remain correctly sized even with changes in the rates of demand and replenishment a simple recursive algorithm called Buffer Management is used When the on hand inventory level is in the upper third of the buffer for a full RT the buffer is reduced by one third and don t forget rule Alternatively when the on hand inventory is in the bottom one third of the buffer for too long the buffer is increased by one third and don t forget rule The definition of too long may be changed depending on required service levels however a rule of thumb is of the RT Moving buffers up more readily than down is supported by the usually greater damage caused by shortages as compared to the damage caused by surpluses br Once inventory is managed as described above continuous efforts should be undertaken to reduce RT late deliveries supplier minimum order quantities both per SKU and per order and customer order batching Any improvements in these areas will automatically improve both availability and inventory turns thanks to the adaptive nature of Buffer Management br A stocking location that manages inventory according to the TOC should help a non TOC customer downstream link in a supply chain whether internal or external manage their inventory according to the TOC process This type of help can take the form of a vendor managed inventory VMI The TOC distribution link simply extends its buffer sizing and management techniques to its customers inventories Doing so has the effect of smoothing the demand from the customer and reducing order sizes per SKU VMI results in better availability and inventory turns for both supplier and customer The benefits to the non TOC customers are sufficient to meet the purpose of capitalizing on the competitive edge by giving the customer a reason to be more loyal and give more business to the upstream link When the end consumers buy more the whole supply chain sells more br One caveat should be considered Initially and only temporarily the supply chain or a specific link may sell less as the surplus inventory in the system is sold However the sales lift due to improved availability is a countervailing factor The current levels of surpluses and shortages make each case different br br br Finance and accounting br Holistic thinking applied to the finance application has been termed throughput accounting Throughput accounting suggests that one examine the impact of investments and operational changes in terms of the impact on the throughput of the business It is an alternative to cost accounting br The primary measures for a TOC view of finance and accounting are throughput operating expense and investment Throughput is calculated from sales minus totally variable cost where totally variable cost is usually calculated as the cost of raw materials that go into creating the item sold br br br Project management br Critical Chain Project Management CCPM are utilized in this area CCPM is based on the idea that all projects look like A plants all activities converge to a final deliverable As such to protect the project there must be internal buffers to protect synchronization points and a final project buffer to protect the overall project br br br Marketing and sales br While originally focused on manufacturing and logistics TOC has expanded into sales management and marketing Its role is explicitly acknowledged in the field of sales process engineering For effective sales management one can apply Drum Buffer Rope to the sales process similar to the way it is applied to operations see Reengineering the Sales Process book reference below This technique is appropriate when your constraint is in the sales process itself or if you just want an effective sales management technique which includes the topics of funnel management and conversion rates br br br Thinking processes br br The thinking processes are a set of tools to help managers walk through the steps of initiating and implementing a project When used in a logical flow they help walk through a buy in process br br Gain agreement on the problem br Gain agreement on the direction for a solution br Gain agreement that the solution solves the problem br Agree to overcome any potential negative ramifications br Agree to overcome any obstacles to implementation br TOC practitioners sometimes refer to these in the negative as working through layers of resistance to a change br Recently the current reality tree CRT and future reality tree FRT have been applied to an argumentative academic paper br Despite its origins as a manufacturing approach Goldratt Cox The Goal A process of Ongoing Improvement Goldratt s Theory of Constraints TOC methodology is now regarded as a systems methodology with strong foundations in the hard sciences Mabin Through its tools for convergent thinking and synthesis the Thinking processes which underpin the entire TOC methodology help identify and manage constraints and guide continuous improvement and change in organizations Dettmer H br The process of change requires the identification and acceptance of core issues the goal and the means to the goal This comprehensive set of logical tools can be used for exploration solution development and solution implementation for individuals groups or organizations Each tool has a purpose and nearly all tools can be used independently Cox Spencer Since these thinking tools are designed to address successive layers of resistance and enable communication it expedites securing buy in of groups While CRT current reality tree represents the undesirable effects of the current situation the FRT the future reality tree NBR negative branch help people plan and understand the possible results of their actions The PRT prerequisite tree and TRT transition tree are designed to build collective buy in and aid in the Implementation phase The logical constructs of these tools or diagrams are the necessary condition logic the sufficient cause logic and the strict logic rules that are used to validate cause effect relationships which are modelled with these tools Dettmer W br A summary of these tools the questions they help answer and the associated logical constructs used is presented in the table below br br TOC Thinking Process Tools br Use of these tools are based on the fundamental beliefs of TOC that organizations a are inherently simple interdependencies exist in organizations b desire inherent harmony win win solutions are possible c are inherently good people are good and have inherent potential people and organizations have potential to do better Goldratt E In the book Through the clouds to solutions Jelena Fedurko Fedurko states that the major areas for application of TP tools as br br To create and enhance thinking and learning skills br To make better decisions br To develop responsibility for one s own actions through understanding their consequences br To handle conflicts with more confidence and win win outcomes br To correct behavior with undesirable consequences br Assist in evaluating conditions for achieving a desired outcome br To assist in peer mediation br To assist in relationship between subordinates and bosses br br br Development and practice br TOC was initiated by Goldratt who until his death was still the main driving force behind the development and practice of TOC There is a network of individuals and small companies loosely coupled as practitioners around the world TOC is sometimes referred to as constraint management TOC is a large body of knowledge with a strong guiding philosophy of growth br br br Criticism br Criticisms that have been leveled against TOC include br br br Claimed suboptimality of drum buffer rope br While TOC has been compared favorably to linear programming techniques D Trietsch from University of Auckland argues that DBR methodology is inferior to competing methodologies Linhares from the Getulio Vargas Foundation has shown that the TOC approach to establishing an optimal product mix is unlikely to yield optimum results as it would imply that P NP br br br Unacknowledged debt br Duncan as cited by Steyn br says that TOC borrows heavily from systems dynamics developed by Forrester in the s and from statistical process control which dates back to World War II And Noreen Smith and Mackey in their independent report on TOC point out that several key concepts in TOC have been topics in management accounting textbooks for decades It is also claimed that Goldratt s books fail to acknowledge that TOC borrows from more than years of previous management science research and practice particularly from program evaluation and review technique critical path method PERT CPM and the just in time strategy br A rebuttal to these criticisms is offered in Goldratt s What is the Theory of Constraints and How Should it be Implemented and in his audio program Beyond The Goal In these Goldratt discusses the history of disciplinary sciences compares the strengths and weaknesses of the various disciplines and acknowledges the sources of information and inspiration for the thinking processes and critical chain methodologies Articles published in the now defunct Journal of Theory of Constraints referenced foundational materials Goldratt published an article and gave talks with the title Standing on the Shoulders of Giants in which he gives credit for many of the core ideas of Theory of Constraints Goldratt has sought many times to show the correlation between various improvement methods br Goldratt has been criticized on lack of openness in his theories an example being him not releasing the algorithm he used for the Optimum Performance Training system Some view him as unscientific with many of his theories tools and techniques not being a part of the public domain rather a part of his own framework of profiting on his ideas br According to Gupta and Snyder despite being recognized as a genuine management philosophy nowadays TOC has yet failed to demonstrate its effectiveness in the academic literature and as such cannot be considered academically worthy to be called a widely recognized theory TOC needs more case studies that prove a connection between implementation and improved financial performance br Nave argues that TOC does not take employees into account and fails to empower them in the production process He also states that TOC fails to address unsuccessful policies as constraints br In contrast Mukherjee and Chatterjee state that much of the criticism of Goldratt s work has been focused on the lack of rigour in his work but not of the bottleneck approach which are two different aspects of the issue br br
