Low level design LLD is a component level design process that follows a step by step refinement process This process can be used for designing data structures required software architecture source code and ultimately performance algorithms Overall the data organization may be defined during requirement analysis and then refined during data design work Post build each component is specified in detail br The LLD phase is the stage where the actual software components are designed br During the detailed phase the logical and functional design is done and the design of application structure is developed during the high level design phase br br br Design phase br A design is the order of a system that connects individual components Often it can interact with other systems Design is important to achieve high reliability low cost and good maintain ability br We can distinguish two types of program design phases br br Architectural or high level design br Detailed or low level design br Structured flow charts and HIPO diagrams typify the class of software design tools and these provide a high level overview of a program The advantages of such a design tool are that it yields a design specification understandable to non programmers and provides a good pictorial display of the module dependencies br A disadvantage is that it may be difficult for software developers to go from a graphic oriented representation of software design to implementation Therefore it is necessary to provide little insight into the algorithmic structure describing procedural steps to facilitate the early stages of software development generally using Program Design Languages PDLs br br br Purpose br The goal of LLD or a low level design document LLDD is to give the internal logical design of the actual program code Low level design is created based on the high level design LLD describes the class diagrams with the methods and relations between classes and program specs It describes the modules so that the programmer can directly code the program from the document br A good low level design document makes the program easy to develop when proper analysis is utilized to create a low level design document The code can then be developed directly from the low level design document with minimal debugging and testing br Other advantages include lower cost and easier maintenance br br br
