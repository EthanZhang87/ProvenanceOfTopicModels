id: 2438941
The slow movement is a cultural movement which advocates slowing down the pace of human life It emerged from the slow food movement and Carlo Petrini s protest against the opening of a McDonald s restaurant in the Piazza di Spagna Rome Initiatives linked to this movement include the Cittaslow organization for slow cities br Geir Berthelsen s The World Institute of Slowness presented a vision in for a slow planet In Carl Honor s book In Praise of Slow he describes the slow movement as br br a cultural revolution against the notion that faster is always better The Slow philosophy is not about doing everything at a snail s pace It s about seeking to do everything at the right speed Savoring the hours and minutes rather than just counting them Doing everything as well as possible instead of as fast as possible It s about quality over quantity in everything from work to food to parenting br br Professor Guttorm Fl istad summarises the philosophy stating br br The only thing for certain is that everything changes The rate of change increases If you want to hang on you better speed up That is the message of today It could however be useful to remind everyone that our basic needs never change The need to be seen and appreciated It is the need to belong The need for nearness and care and for a little love This is given only through slowness in human relations In order to master changes we have to recover slowness reflection and togetherness There we will find real renewal br br br Art br Slow Art Day was founded by Phil Terry and officially launched in During one day in April each year museums and art galleries around the world host events focused on intentionally experiencing art through slow looking The movement aims to help people discover the joy of looking at art typically through observing a painting or sculpture for minutes often followed by discussion The Slow Art Day team publishes an Annual Report each year on its website which features a range of events hosted by art institutions br br br Ageing br Slow ageing or slow aging is a distinct approach to successful ageing advocating a personal and holistic positive approach to the process of ageing Established as part of the broader slow movement in the s as opposed to the interventionist based and commercially backed medical anti aging system it involves personal ownership and non medical intervention options in gaining potential natural life extension br br br Cinema br br Slow cinema is a cinematography style which derives from the art film genre It aims to convey a sense of calculated slowness to the viewer Slow films often consist of a resistance to movement and emotion a lack of causality and a devotion to realism This is usually obtained through the use of long takes minimalist acting slow or inexistent camera movements unconventional use of music and sparse editing Slow cinema directors include B la Tarr Lav Diaz Tsai Ming liang Nuri Bilge Ceylan Abbas Kiarostami Tsai Ming liang Andrei Tarkovsky and Theo Angelopoulos br br br Cittaslow br br Cittaslow International states its mission as to enlarge the philosophy of Slow Food to local communities and to government of towns applying the concepts of ecogastronomy at practice of everyday life It seeks to improve the quality and enjoyment of living by encouraging happiness and self determination Cittaslow cities use the concept of globalization to prevent the impending globalization of their cities Lisa Servon and Sarah Pink observe that The case of the Spanish Cittaslow towns offers a particular example of how towns can actively exploit the interpenetration of the global and the local In these towns a local global relationship has emerged in ways that enable controlled development and the maintenance of local uniqueness br br br Consumption br Tim Cooper author of Longer Lasting Products is a strong advocate of slow consumption and is quoted as saying The issue to address is what kind of economy is going to be sustainable in its wider sense economically environmentally and socially Saul Griffith introduced heirloom design during a February Greener Gadgets conference in He notes a lasting design the ability to repair and the option of being modernized to advocate slow consumption Legislation alternative options and consumer pressure can encourage manufacturers to design items in a more heirloom fashion br br br Counseling br Recent technological advances have resulted in a fast paced style of living Slow counselors understand that many clients are seeking ways to reduce stress and cultivate a more balanced approach to life Developed by Dr Randy Astramovich and Dr Wendy Hoskins and rooted in the slow movement slow counseling offers counselors a wellness focused foundation for addressing the time urgency and stress often reported by clients br br br Conversation br According to Fast Company An unhurried conversation uses a simple process to allow people to take turns to speak without being interrupted Everyone agrees at the start that only the person holding a chosen object often a sugar bowl is allowed to talk Once the speaker has finished they put the object down signalling that they have said what they want to say Someone else then picks up the object and takes their turn Each speaker can respond to some or all of what the previous speaker said or they can take the conversation in an entirely new direction br Unhurried Conversations is a term used by the author of Unhurried at Work Johnnie Moore about how people can work together at a speed that makes the most of their human qualities br br br Democracy br Slow democracy describes local governance models that are inclusive empowered and centered on deliberative democracy br br Described by Susan Clark and Woden Teachout in their book Slow Democracy the concept parallels the Slow Food movement s call for authenticity in food production and highlights decision making models based on authentic community involvement Clark and Teachout note Slow democracy is not a call for longer meetings or more time between decisions Instead it is a reminder of the care needed for full blooded empowered community decision making xxiii Examples of slow democracy include Participatory Budgeting the Swiss and New England U S town meeting Dialogue to Change and Study Circles processes when connected with democratic action such as the Portsmouth New Hampshire Portsmouth Listens model and many other participatory democracy models The National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation serves as a network for many scholars and practitioners of slow democracy br Slow democracy inspired the Living Room Conversations organization co founded by Joan Blades because slowing down to consider how we characterize the other is crucial to democratic engagement and to peacebuilding br br Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig writes that like slow food slow democracy is a strategy for resisting what we know would be most tempting but what we have learned is both empty and harmful T he slow democracy movement says that we should do politics in particular contexts not because those contexts can t be hacked or will never be poisonous but because it s just harder to hack them or make them poisonous Scholars of dialogue and deliberation have expressed concern that increased online and face to face communication can lead to information overload but incorporating slow democracy processes featuring listening and reflection can improve the experience Proponents of community led housing cite slow democracy as integral to their place specific development efforts br br br Education br As an alternative approach to modern faster styles of reading such as speed reading the concept of slow reading has been reintroduced as an educational branch of the slow movement For instance the ancient Greek method of slow reading known as Lectio now known as Lectio Divina has become a way of reading that encourages more in depth analysis and a greater understanding of the text being read br Though the method is originally of Christian monastic origin and has been used primarily as a tool to better understand the Bible its technique can be applied in other areas of education besides the study of theology br br br Fashion br br The term slow fashion was coined by Kate Fletcher in Centre for Sustainable Fashion UK Slow fashion is not a seasonal trend that comes and goes like animal print but a sustainable fashion movement that is gaining momentum br The slow fashion style is based on the same principles of the slow food movement as the alternative to mass produced clothing also known as fast fashion Initially the slow clothing movement was intended to reject all mass produced clothing referring only to clothing made by hand but has broadened to include many interpretations and is practiced in various ways Functional and fashion novelty drives consumers to replace their items faster causing an increase of imported goods into the United States alone It was reported by the Economic Policy Institute that in the U S imported six billion dollars worth in fashion articles br Some examples of slow fashion practices include br br Opposing and boycotting mass produced fast fashion or McFashion br Choosing artisan products to support smaller businesses fair trade and locally made clothes br Buying secondhand or vintage clothing and donating unwanted garments br Choosing clothing made with sustainable ethically made or recycled fabrics br Choosing quality garments that will last longer transcend trends a classic style and be repairable br Doing it yourself making mending customising altering and up cycling one s own clothing br Slowing the rate of fashion consumption buying fewer clothes less often br The slow fashion ethos is a unified representation of all the sustainable eco green and ethical fashion movements It encourages education about the garment industry s connection with and impact on the environment such as depleting resources slowing of the supply chain to reduce the number of trends and seasons and to encourage quality production and return greater value to garments removing the image of disposability of fashion Hazel Clark states there are three lines of reflection the valuing of local resources and distributed economies transparent production systems with less intermediation between producer and consumer and sustainable and sensorial products br br br Food br br As opposed to the culture of fast food the sub movement known as slow food seeks to encourage the enjoyment of regional produce and traditional foods which are often grown organically and to enjoy these foods in the company of others It aims to defend agricultural biodiversity br The movement claims members in countries which are organised into Convivia or local chapters Sometimes operating under a logo of a snail the collective philosophy is to preserve and support traditional ways of life Today states in the United States have their own convivium br In representatives from food communities in more than countries met in Turin Italy under the umbrella of the Terra Madre Mother Earth network br br br Gaming br Slow gaming is an approach to video games that is meant to be more slow paced and more focused on challenging the assumptions and feelings of the player than on their skills and reflexes br A Slow Games Movement Manifesto was written by Scottish game designer Mitch Alexander in September and a Slow Gaming Manifesto was independently published on Gamasutra by Polish game designer Artur Ganszyniec in June br Some games that can be considered examples of slow gaming include Firewatch Heaven s Vault Journey Wanderlust Travel Stories and The Longing br br br Gardening br br Slow gardening is an approach that helps gardeners savor what they grow using all their senses through all the seasons br br br Goods br Slow goods takes its core direction from various elements of the overall slow movement applying it to the conception design and manufacturing of physical objects Key tenets are low production runs the use of craftspeople within the process on shore manufacturing and smaller local supply and service partners br The rationale for this local engagement facilitates the assurance of quality the revitalisation of local manufacturing industries and reduces greatly the footprint related to the shipment of goods across regions of land and or water br Physical goods affected by the slow movement represent much diversity including architecture and building design The slow movement is affecting the concept and planning stages of commercial buildings chiefly LEED certified projects br This movement seeks to break current conventions of perpetuating the disposable nature of mass production By using higher quality materials and craftsmanship items attain a longer lifespan similar to manufacturing eras in the past br br br Living br br Authors Beth Meredith and Eric Storm summarize slow living as follows br br Slow Living means structuring your life around meaning and fulfillment Similar to voluntary simplicity and downshifting it emphasizes a less is more approach focusing on the quality of your life Slow Living addresses the desire to lead a more balanced life and to pursue a more holistic sense of well being in the fullest sense of the word br br br Marketing br Slow marketing is a reaction to the perceived always on nature of digital marketing It emphasizes a customer centric outlook sustainability and ethics It builds relationships with customers instead of encouraging immediate results such as a limited time offer br br br Media br br Slow media and Slow television are movements aiming at sustainable and focused media production as well as media consumption They formed in the context of a massive acceleration of news distribution ending in almost real time digital media such as Twitter Beginning in many local Slow Media initiatives formed in the USA and Europe Germany France Italy leading to a high attention in mass media Others experiment with a reduction of their daily media intake and log their efforts online slow media diet br br br Medicine br br Slow medicine fosters taking time in developing a relationship between the

Slow Food movement Slow Money aims to develop the relationship between capital markets and place including social and soil fertility It supports grass roots mobilisation through network building convening publishing and incubating intermediary strategies and structures of funding br br br Parenting br br Slow parenting encourages parents to plan less for their children allowing them to explore the world at their own pace It is a response to hyper parenting and helicopter parenting the widespread trend for parents to schedule activities and classes after school every day and every weekend to solve problems on behalf of the children and to buy commercial services and products It was described by Carl Honor in Under Pressure Rescuing Our Children from the Culture Of Hyper Parenting br br br Photography br br Slow photography is a term describing a tendency in contemporary photography and visual arts In response to the spread of the snapshot artists and photographers retake manual techniques and working methods to work slower manually and in constant dialogue with the physical materials of the images A broader interpretation of Slow Photography applies to all kinds of image making including film and digital processes The effort is a collaboration by several photographers to promote the slowing down of experiencing places and the making of stronger connections to place br The term was first introduced by Norwegian photographer artist and photo educator Johanne Seines Svendsen in the article The Slow Photography In Motion published in the book Through a Glass Darkly in January in collaboration with the North Norwegian Art Center the Arts Council of Norway and the Norwegian Photographical Fund br The term was put into shape in the installation The Slow Photography at The th North Norwegian Art Exhibition first opened in the city of Bod in January The installation contained five original ambrotypes and alumitypes presented in a monter and presents contemporary work with the historical photographical process wet plate collodion br br br Religion br Slow church is a movement in Christian praxis which integrates slow movement principles into the structure and character of the local church The phrase was introduced in by Christian bloggers working independently who imagined what such a slow church might look like Over the next several years the concept continued to be discussed online and in print by various writers and ministers br In July a three day conference titled Slow Church Abiding Together in the Patient Work of God was held on the campus of DePaul University in Chicago on the topic of slow church and featured Christian ethicist Stanley Hauerwas and Kyle Childress among others An online blog called Slow Church written by C Christopher Smith and John Pattison is hosted by Patheos and Smith and Pattison have written a book by the same name published in June br Ethics ecology and economy are cited as areas of central concern to slow church Smith describes slow church as a conversation not a movement and has cited New Monasticism as an influence In its emphases on non traditional ways for churches to operate and on conversation over dogma and hierarchy slow church is also related to the broader Christian emerging church movement br br br Scholarship br Slow scholarship is a response to hasty scholarship and the demands of corporatized neoliberal academic culture which may compromise the quality and integrity of research education and well being This movement attempts to counter the erosion of humanistic education analyze the consequences of the culture of speed and explores alternatives to the fast paced metric oriented neoliberal university through a slow moving conversation on ways to slow down and claim time for slow scholarship and collective action br br br Science br br The slow science movement s objective is to enable scientists to take the time to think and read The prevalent culture of science is publish or perish where scientists are judged to be better if they publish more papers in less time and only those who do so are able to maintain their careers Those who practice and promote slow science suggest that society should give scientists the time they need br br br Technology br The slow technology approach aims to emphasize that technology can support reflection rather than efficiency This approach has been discussed through various examples for example those in interaction design or virtual environments It is related to other parallel efforts such as those towards reflective design critical design and critical technical practice br br br Thought philosophy br Slow thought calls for a slow philosophy to ease thinking into a more playful and porous dialogue about what it means to live Vincenzo Di Nicola s Slow Thought Manifesto elucidates and illuminates Slow thought through seven proclamations published and cited in English Indonesian Italian and Portuguese and frequently cited in French br br Slow thought is marked by peripatetic Socratic walks the face to face encounter of Emmanuel Levinas and Mikhail Bakhtin s dialogic conversations br Slow thought creates its own time and place br Slow thought has no other object than itself br Slow thought is porous br Slow thought is playful br Slow thought is a counter method rather than a method for thinking as it relaxes releases and liberates thought from its constraints and the trauma of tradition br Slow thought is deliberate br Notable slow thinkers include Mahatma Gandhi who affirmed that There is more to life than simply increasing its speed Giorgio Agamben on the philosophy of childhood Walter Benjamin on the porosity of Naples and Johan Huizinga on play as an interlude in our daily lives Di Nicola s Slow Thought Manifesto is featured in Julian Hanna s The Manifesto Handbook as a reaction against acceleration elucidating seven principles including the practice of being asynchronous or resisting the speed of modern times in favor of the slow logic of thought and working toward greater focus The Slow Thought Manifesto is being cited in philosophy information science and peacebuilding politics br Take your time the slogan of Slow Thought cited by Di Nicola is taken from philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein himself a slow thinker br br In a wonderful philosophical lesson that is structured like a joke Wittgenstein admonished philosophers about rushing their thinking br Question How does one philosopher address another br Answer Take your time br br br Time poverty br The principal perspective of the slow movement is to experience life in a fundamentally different way Adherents believe that the experience of being present leads to what Abraham Maslow refers to as peak experience br The International Institute of Not Doing Much is a humorous approach to the serious topic of time poverty incivility and workaholism The Institute s fictional presence promotes counter urgency First created in SlowDownNow org is a continually evolving work of art and humor which reports it has over members br br br Travel br Slow travel is an evolving movement that has taken its inspiration from nineteenth century European travel writers such as Th ophile Gautier who reacted against the cult of speed prompting some modern analysts to ask If we have slow food and slow cities then why not slow travel Other literary and exploration traditions from early Arab travelers to late nineteenth century Yiddish writers have also identified with slow travel usually marking its connection with community as its most distinctive feature Espousing modes of travel that were the norm in some less developed societies became for some writers and travelers from western Europe such as Isabelle Eberhardt a way of engaging more seriously with those societies br Slow travel is not only about traveling from one place to another it is also about immersing oneself in a destination It consists of staying in the same place for a while to develop a deep connection with it Frequenting local places spending time with locals and discovering their habits and customs can turn a regular trip into a slow travel experience The key is to take one s time and to let oneself be carried along br Advocates of slow travel argue that all too often the potential pleasure of the journey is lost by too eager anticipation of arrival Slow travel it is asserted is a state of mind which allows travelers to engage more fully with communities along their route often favoring visits to spots enjoyed by local residents rather than merely following guidebooks As such slow travel shares some common values with ecotourism Its advocates and devotees generally look for low impact travel styles even to the extent of eschewing flying The future of Slow Travel is aiming toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions by reducing car and air travel because the rate we are using planes and cars is not sustainable for our atmosphere Advocates believe that the combination of environmental awareness and cost efficient traveling will move people towards Slow Travel br Aspects of slow travel including some of the principles detailed in the Manifesto for Slow Travel are now increasingly featured in travel writing The magazine Hidden Europe which first published the Manifesto for Slow Travel has particularly showcased slow travel featuring articles that focus on unhurried low impact journeys and advocating a stronger engagement with communities that lie en route br A new book series launched in May by Bradt Travel Guides explicitly espouses slow travel ideas with volumes that focus very much on local communities within a tightly defined area often advocating the use of public transport along the way Titles include Bus pass Britain Slow Norfolk and Suffolk Slow Devon and Exmoor Slow Cotswolds Slow North Yorkshire and Slow Sussex and South Downs National Park br br
