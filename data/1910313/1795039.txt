title: Use-centered design
id: 1795039
Use centered design is a design philosophy in which the focus is on the goals and tasks associated with skill performance in specific work or problem domains in contrast to a user centered design approach where the focus is on the needs wants and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact br Bennett and Flach have drawn a contrast between dyadic and triadic approaches to the semiotics of display design The classical user centered approach is based on a dyadic semiotic model where the focus is on the human interface dyad This approach frames meaning as a process of interpreting the symbolic representation That is meaning is constructed from internal information processes From this dyadic perspective the design goal is to build interfaces that match the users internal model i e match user expectations br In contrast the use centered approach is based on a triadic semiotic model that includes the work domain or ecology as a third component of the semiotic system In the triadic system the work domain provides a ground for meaning outside of the human information processing system In this triadic semiotic system the focus is on the match between the constraints in the work domain and the mental representations From this use centered approach the goal is to design displays that shape the internal mental representations so that they reflect validated models of the work domain In other words the goal is to shape user expectations to conform with the validated deep structure of the work domain In doing this work analysis e g Vicente and multi level means ends representations of work domain constraints i e Rasmussen s Abstraction Hierarchy are the typical methods used to specify the deep structure of a work domain By building configural display representations that conform to this deep structure it is possible to facilitate skilled interactions between the human and the work domain br Thus an emphasis on use rather than user suggests a more problem centered focus for interface design Note that it remains important to respect the real limitations of human information processing systems through the use of graphical displays that support efficient chunking of information However the main point is that the organization MUST be consistent with the demands of the work or problem domain if the interactions that result are expected to be skillful In the end the representations must be grounded in the use domain br Charles Sanders Peirce is the inspiration for the triadic model of semiotics Peirce was interested in the fixation of belief relative to pragmatic demands of everyday experiences Peirce also introduced the construct of abduction as an alternative to classical logic deduction and induction The use centered approach assumes abduction as the appropriate model for problem solving Thus use centered design focuses on supporting the closed loop dynamic of learning from experience That is by acting on hypotheses and simultaneously testing those hypotheses in terms of the practical consequences of the actions that they guide The convergence stability and robustness of abduction processes depend critically on the information coupling between perception and action When the coupling is rich an abduction system will typically converge on beliefs that lead to pragmatically successful i e satisfying interactions i e skilled interactions This is the ultimate goal of use centered design to support skilled interactions between a person and a work domain br The term use centered design was first coined by Flach and Dominguez br br br
