In business and engineering product development or new product development PD or NPD covers the complete process of bringing a new product to market renewing an existing product and introducing a product in a new market A central aspect of NPD is product design along with various business considerations New product development is described broadly as the transformation of a market opportunity into a product available for sale The products developed by an organisation provide the means for it to generate income For many technology intensive firms their approach is based on exploiting technological innovation in a rapidly changing market br The product can be tangible something physical which one can touch or intangible like a service or experience though sometimes services and other processes are distinguished from products NPD requires an understanding of customer needs and wants the competitive environment and the nature of the market br Cost time and quality are the main variables that drive customer needs Aiming at these three variables innovative companies develop continuous practices and strategies to better satisfy customer requirements and to increase their own market share by a regular development of new products There are many uncertainties and challenges which companies must face throughout the process br br br Product Development Process Structure br The product development process typically consists of several activities that firms employ in the complex process of delivering new products to the market A process management approach is used to provide a structure Product development often overlaps much with the engineering design process particularly if the new product being developed involves application of math and or science Every new product will pass through a series of stages phases including ideation among other aspects of design as well as manufacturing and market introduction In highly complex engineered products e g aircraft automotive machinery the NPD process can be likewise complex regarding management of personnel milestones and deliverables Such projects typically use an integrated product team approach The process for managing large scale complex engineering products is much slower often plus years than that deployed for many types of consumer goods br The development process is articulated and broken down in many different ways many of which often include the following phases stages br PHASE Fuzzy front end FFE is the set of activities employed before the more formal and well defined requirements specification is completed Requirements speak to what the product should do or have at varying degrees of specificity in order to meet the perceived market or business need br The fuzzy front end FFE is the messy getting started period of new product engineering development processes It is also referred to as the Front End of Innovation or Idea Management br It is in the front end where the organization formulates a concept of the product to be developed and decides whether or not to invest resources in the further development of an idea It is the phase between first consideration of an opportunity and when it is judged ready to enter the structured development process Kim and Wilemon Koen et al br It includes all activities from the search for new opportunities through the formation of a germ of an idea to the development of a precise concept The Fuzzy Front End phase ends when an organization approves and begins formal development of the concept br Although the fuzzy front end may not be an expensive part of product development it can consume of development time see Chapter of the Smith and Reinertsen reference below and it is where major commitments are typically made involving time money and the product s nature thus setting the course for the entire project and final end product Consequently this phase should be considered as an essential part of development rather than something that happens before development and its cycle time should be included in the total development cycle time br Koen et al distinguish five different front end elements not necessarily in a particular order br br Opportunity Identification br Opportunity Analysis br Idea Genesis br Idea Selection br Idea and Technology Development br The first element is the opportunity identification In this element large or incremental business and technological chances are identified in a more or less structured way Using the guidelines established here resources will eventually be allocated to new projects which then leads to a structured NPPD New Product Process Development strategy br The second element is the opportunity analysis It is done to translate the identified opportunities into implications for the business and technology specific context of the company Here extensive efforts may be made to align ideas to target customer groups and do market studies and or technical trials and research br The third element is the idea genesis which is described as evolutionary and iterative process progressing from birth to maturation of the opportunity into a tangible idea The process of the idea genesis can be made internally or come from outside inputs e g a supplier offering a new material technology or from a customer with an unusual request br The fourth element is the idea selection Its purpose is to choose whether to pursue an idea by analyzing its potential business value br The fifth element is the idea and technology development During this part of the front end the business case is developed based on estimates of the total available market customer needs investment requirements competition analysis and project uncertainty Some organizations consider this to be the first stage of the NPPD process i e Stage br A universally acceptable definition for Fuzzy Front End or a dominant framework has not been developed so far br In a glossary of PDMA it is mentioned that the fuzzy front end generally consists of three tasks strategic planning idea generation and pre technical evaluation These activities are often chaotic unpredictable and unstructured In comparison the subsequent new product development process is typically structured predictable and formal br The term fuzzy front end was first popularized by Smith and Reinertsen br R G Cooper it describes the early stages of NPPD as a four step process in which ideas are generated I subjected to a preliminary technical and market assessment II and merged to coherent product concepts III which are finally judged for their fit with existing product strategies and portfolios IV br PHASE Product design is the development of both the high level and detailed level design of the product which turns the what of the requirements into a specific how this particular product will meet those requirements This typically has the most overlap with the engineering design process but can also include industrial design and even purely aesthetic aspects of design On the marketing and planning side this phase ends at pre commercialization analysis stage br PHASE Product implementation often refers to later stages of detailed engineering design e g refining mechanical or electrical hardware or software or goods or other product forms as well as test process that may be used to validate that the prototype actually meets all design specifications that were established br PHASE Fuzzy back end or commercialization phase represent the action steps where the production and market launch occur br The front end marketing phases have been very well researched with valuable models proposed Peter Koen et al provides a five step front end activity called front end innovation opportunity identification opportunity analysis idea genesis idea selection and idea and technology development He also includes an engine in the middle of the five front end stages and the possible outside barriers that can influence the process outcome The engine represents the management driving the activities described The front end of the innovation is the greatest area of weakness in the NPD process This is mainly because the FFE is often chaotic unpredictable and unstructured Engineering design is the process whereby a technical solution is developed iteratively to solve a given problem br The design stage is very important because at this stage most of the product life cycle costs are engaged Previous research shows that of the final product quality and of the product entire life cycle cost are determined in the product design phase therefore the design manufacturing interface represent the greatest opportunity for cost reduction br Design projects last from a few weeks to three years with an average of one year Design and Commercialization phases usually start a very early collaboration When the concept design is finished it will be sent to manufacturing plant for prototyping developing a Concurrent Engineering approach by implementing practices such as QFD DFM DFA and more br The output of the design engineering is a set of product and process specifications mostly in the form of drawings and the output of manufacturing is the product ready for sale Basically the design team will develop drawings with technical specifications representing the future product and will send it to the manufacturing plant to be executed Solving product process fit problems is of high priority in information communication design because of the development effort must be scrapped if any changes are made after the release to manufacturing br br br Product Development Conceptual Models br Conceptual models have been designed in order to facilitate a smooth product development process br Booz Allen and Hamilton Model One of the first developed models that companies still use in the NPD process is the Booz Allen and Hamilton BAH Model published in This is the best known model because it underlies the NPD systems that have been put forward later This model represents the foundation of all the other models that have been developed afterwards Significant work has been conducted in order to propose better models but in fact these models can be easily linked to BAH model The seven steps of the BAH model are new product strategy idea generation screening and evaluation business analysis development testing and commercialization br Exploratory product development model ExPD Exploratory product development which often goes by the acronym ExPD is an emerging approach to new product development Consultants Mary Drotar and Kathy Morrissey first introduced ExPD at the Product Development and Management Association annual meeting and later outlined their approach in the Product Development and Management Association s magazine Visions br In Drotar and Morrissey s firm Strategy Market received the trademark on the term Exploratory PD Rather than going through a set of discrete phases like the phase gate process this exploratory product development process allows organizations to adapt to a landscape of shifting market circumstances and uncertainty by using a more flexible and adaptable product development process for both hardware and software br Where the traditional phase gate approach works best in a stable market environment ExPD is more suitable for product development in markets that are unstable and less predictable Unstable and unpredictable markets cause uncertainty and risk in product development Many factors contribute to the outcome of a project and ExPD works on the assumption that the ones that the product team doesn t know enough about or are unaware of are the factors that create uncertainty and risk br The primary goal of ExPD is to reduce uncertainty and risk by reducing the unknown When organizations adapt quickly to the changing environment market technology regulations globalization etc they reduce uncertainty and risk which leads to product success ExPD is described as a two pronged integrated systems approach Drotar and Morrissey state that product development is complex and needs to be managed as a system integrating essential elements strategy portfolio management organization teams culture metrics market customer understanding and process br Drotar and Morrissey have published two books on ExPD The first Exploratory Product Development Executive Version Adaptable Product Development in a Changing World was published as an e book on December On September Drotar and Morrissey published their second book Learn Adapt ExPD An Adaptive Product Development Process for Rapid Innovation and Risk Reduction which also highlights their process The book has three sections Overview of ExPD How to Do It and Adaptive Practices that Support ExPD According to Kirkus the approach the authors advocate is outwardly focused and premised on being adaptable enough to develop new competencies and create new models as complex situations evolve Kirkus summarizes the text as complex and visually stimulating a serious blueprint for serious strategists br IDEO approach The concept adopted by IDEO a design and consulting firm is one of the most researched processes in regard to new product development and is a five step procedure These steps are listed in chronological order br br Understand and observe the market the client the technology and the limitations of the problem br Synthesize the information collected at the first step br Visualise new customers using the product br Prototype evaluate and improve the concept br Implementation of design changes which are associated with more technologically advanced procedures and therefore will require more time br Lean Start up approach Lean startup is a methodology for developing businesses and products that aims to shorten product development cycles and rapidly discover if a proposed business model is viable this is achieved by adopting a combination of business hypothesis driven experimentation iterative product releases and validated learning Lean startup emphasizes customer feedback over intuition and flexibility over planning This methodology enables recovery from failures more often than traditional ways of product development br Stage gate model A pioneer of NPD research in the consumers goods sector is Robert G Cooper Over the last two decades he conducted significant work in the area of NPD The Stage Gate model developed in the s was proposed as a new tool for managing new products development processes This was mainly applied to the consumers goods industry The APQC benchmarking study reveals that of U S businesses employ a stage gate system to manage new products from idea to launch In return the companies that adopt this system are reported to receive benefits such as improved teamwork improved success rates earlier detection of failure a better launch and even shorter cycle times reduced by about These findings highlight the importance of the stage gate model in the area of new product development br The Stage Gate model of NPD predevelopment activities are summarised in Phase zero and one in respect to earlier definition of predevelopment activities br br Preliminary br Technical assessment br Source of supply assessment suppliers and partners or alliances br Market research market size and segmentation analysis VoC voice of the customer research br Product idea testing br Customer value assessment br Product definition br Business and financial analysis br These activities yield essential information to make a Go No Go to Development decision These decisions represent the Gates in the Stage Gate model br br br Product Development Management br The following are types of new product development management structures br br br Customer Centric Product Development br Customer centric new product development focuses on finding new ways to solve customer problems and create more customer satisfying experiences Companies often rely on technology but real success comes from understanding customer needs and values The most successful companies are the ones that differentiated from others solved major customer problems offer a compelling customer value proposition and engage customers directly and systematically br br br Systematic Product Development br Systematic new product development focuses on creating a process that allows for the collection review and evaluation of new product ideas br Having a way in which employees suppliers distributors and dealers become involved in finding and developing new products is important to a company s success It is also important for companies to have a process in place for monitoring the competition and their products so that they can stay ahead of the curve br br br Innovation Management br In order to successfully manage the new product development process companies must have an innovation management system in place This system helps to ensure that all aspects of new product development are taken into account and that the company is able to track and assess the progress of new products The innovation management system should also help to foster a culture of innovation within the company which can help to increase the chances of success for new products Marketing writers Hyman and Wilkins argue that a company s rate of product innovation should fit between the extremes of being so rapid that its core range decays and so slow that its product range become s obselete br br br Innovation Manager br An innovation manager is a senior person appointed to be responsible for implementing and managing the innovation management system They are also responsible for ensuring that all aspects of new product development are taken into account and that the company is able to track and assess the progress of new products br br br Cross functional Innovation Management Committee br A cross functional innovation management committee is a team of individuals from different company departments including marketing engineering design manufacturing and research and development who are responsible for overseeing and managing the new product development process This committee helps to ensure that all aspects of new product development are taken into account and that the company is able to track and assess the progress of new products Companies may get a better overall picture of new product development by putting together a cross functional team which can help generate fresh ideas and give assistance in evaluating them br br br Product development management Use in Turbulent Times br In difficult economic times it is even more important for companies to focus on innovation and new product development Oftentimes such situations result in a short sighted focus on cost cutting and a reduction in spending on new products However companies that are able to innovate and create new products will be better positioned for the future br Although counter intuitive tough times may even call for a greater emphasis on new product development This is because companies need to find ways to meet the changing needs and tastes of their customers Innovation can help a company become more competitive and better positioned for the future In difficult economic times it is even more important for companies to focus on innovation and new product development br In addition companies can use virtual product development to help reduce costs Virtual product development uses collaboration technology to remove the need for co located teams which can result in significant cost savings such as a reduction in G A general administrative overhead costs of consulting firms br Another way to reduce the cost of new product development is through the use of hour development cycles This approach allows companies to develop products more quickly and at a lower cost By using a hour cycle companies can shorten the time it takes to get a product to market which can give them a competitive advantage and capability that can be extremely useful in cases where there is a sudden change in market conditions or customer needs br In difficult economic times it is even more important for companies to focus on innovation and new product development By using a variety of methods such as virtual product development and hour development cycles companies can reduce the cost of new product development and improve their chances of success br br br Product Development Roles br There are many different roles in a product development team however below is a list of some of the more common ones br br br
