id: 10702868
The Design Quality Indicator DQI is a toolkit to measure evaluate and improve the design quality of buildings br Development of DQI was started in the United Kingdom by the Construction Industry Council CIC in It was initiated in response to the success of Key Performance Indicators devised for assessing construction process issues such as timely completion financial control and safety on site by the construction industry s Movement for Innovation M I The aim of the DQI systems was to ensure that the M I s indicators of construction process were balanced by an assessment of the building as a product The Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex was commissioned to develop the indicator tool which was launched as an online resource on October In the DQI received recognition from the British Institute of Facilities Management for the role of involving users in the design process The DQI tool was made available to users in the United States in and an online American version was launched on October br Unlike its forerunner the Housing Quality Indicator HQI system devised for the UK s Department for the Environment Transport and the Regions DETR by the consultancy DEGW and published on open access in February the DQI system instead could be used only by approved facilitators The criteria and the method of assessment which though unacknowledged is a simple form of multi attribute utility analysis remained inaccessible to design teams and their clients unless they employed a facilitator licensed to use it Guidance on using the HQI system can be found on the government website The DQI version for hospitals is also on open access on the national archive br br br Conceptual framework br DQI applies a structured approach to assess design quality based on the model by the architect Vitruvius the Roman author of the earliest surviving theoretical treatise on building in Western culture who described design in terms of utilitas firmitas and venustas often translated as commodity firmness and delight DQI uses a modern day interpretation of these terms as br br Functionality utilitas the arrangement quality and interrelationship of spaces and how the building is designed to be useful to all br Build Quality firmitas the engineering performance of the building which includes structural stability and the integration safety and robustness of the systems finishes and fittings br Impact venustas the building s ability to create a sense of place and have a positive effect on the local community and environment br br br Methodology br DQI is completed by a range of stakeholders in the briefing and design stages of a building project or on a completed building Stakeholders who participate include br br Architects br Building users or potential users br Building clients br Facilities managers or future facilities managers br Project managers br Quantity surveyors Cost engineer br Structural and building services engineers br DQI is applied in a facilitated workshop that is led by a certified DQI facilitator br br br Models and related approaches br There are three models of design quality indicator br br DQI which is applicable to all building types br DQI for schools which is applicable to school buildings This model of DQI is being used on all current school projects in the UK and forms part of the Department for Children Schools and Families Minimum Design Standard for new school buildings br DQI for health buildings which was released in beta format in June on the DQI website br br br br br br
