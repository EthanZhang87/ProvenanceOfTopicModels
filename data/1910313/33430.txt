Wolfenstein D is a first person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Apogee Software and FormGen Originally released on May for DOS it was inspired by the Muse Software video game Castle Wolfenstein and is the third installment in the Wolfenstein series In Wolfenstein D the player assumes the role of Allied spy William B J Blazkowicz during World War II as he escapes from the Nazi German prison Castle Wolfenstein and carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis The player traverses each of the game s levels to find an elevator to the next level or kill a final boss fighting Nazi soldiers dogs and other enemies with a knife and a variety of guns br Wolfenstein D was the second major independent release by id Software after the Commander Keen series of episodes In mid programmer John Carmack experimented with making a fast D game engine by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a single plane producing Hovertank D and Catacomb D as prototypes After a design session prompted the company to shift from the family friendly Keen to a more violent theme programmer John Romero suggested remaking the stealth shooter Castle Wolfenstein as a fast paced action game He and designer Tom Hall designed the game built on Carmack s engine to be fast and violent unlike other computer games on the market at the time Wolfenstein D features artwork by Adrian Carmack and sound effects and music by Bobby Prince The game was released through Apogee in two sets of three episodes under the shareware model in which the first episode is released for free to drive interest in paying for the rest An additional episode Spear of Destiny was released as a stand alone retail title through FormGen br Wolfenstein D was a critical and commercial success and is considered one of the greatest video games ever made It garnered numerous awards and sold over copies by the end of It has been termed the grandfather of D shooters and is widely regarded as having helped popularize the first person shooter genre and establishing the standard of fast paced action and technical prowess for many subsequent games in the genre as well as showcasing the viability of the shareware publishing model at the time FormGen developed an additional two episodes for the game while Apogee released a pack of over fan created levels Id Software never returned to the series but did license the engine to numerous other titles before releasing the source code for free in and multiple other games in the Wolfenstein series have been developed by other companies since br br br Gameplay br br Wolfenstein D is a first person shooter presented with rudimentary D graphics The game is broken up into levels each of which is a flat plane divided into areas and rooms by a grid based pattern of walls and doors all of equal height Each level is themed after Nazi bunkers and buildings To finish a level the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator Levels ten in the original episodes are grouped together into named episodes with the final level focusing on a boss fight with a particularly difficult enemy While traversing the levels the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers dogs and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and health The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies weapons include a knife a pistol a submachine gun and a rapid fire chain gun The player can also find keys that allow them to pass through locked doors While the levels are presented in a D perspective the enemies and objects are instead D sprites presented from several set viewing angles a technique sometimes referred to as D graphics br The player s health is represented by a percentage starting at which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies If the player s health falls to zero they lose one life and start the level over with a knife a pistol and eight bullets The player begins each episode with four lives and can gain more by finding extra life tokens or by earning enough points Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level collecting all treasure finding all secret areas or completing a level under a par time the player s completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed Secret areas containing treasure health refills or ammunition can be found in hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point though in many of its ports the player can only save between levels br br br Plot br Wolfenstein D is divided into two sets of three episodes Escape from Castle Wolfenstein Operation Eisenfaust and Die F hrer Die serve as the primary trilogy with a second trilogy titled The Nocturnal Missions including A Dark Secret Trail of the Madman and Confrontation The protagonist is William B J Blazkowicz an American spy of Polish descent and the game follows his efforts to destroy the Nazi regime In Escape Blazkowicz has been captured while trying to find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust Iron Fist and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein from which he must escape Operation Eisenfaust follows his discovery and thwarting of the Nazi plan to create an army of undead mutants in Castle Hollehammer while in Die F hrer Die he infiltrates a bunker under the Reichstag culminating in a battle with Adolf Hitler in a robotic suit equipped with four chain guns br The Nocturnal Missions form a prequel storyline dealing with German plans for chemical warfare A Dark Secret deals with the initial pursuit through a weapons research facility of the scientist responsible for developing the weaponry Trail of the Madman takes place in Castle Erlangen where Blazkowicz s goal is to find the maps and plans for the chemical war The story ends in Confrontation which is set in Castle Offenbach as he confronts the Nazi general behind the chemical warfare initiative br br br Spear of Destiny br An additional episode titled Spear of Destiny was released as a retail game by FormGen It follows Blazkowicz on a different prequel mission trying to recapture the Spear of Destiny from the Nazis after it was stolen from Versailles FormGen later developed two sequel episodes Return to Danger and Ultimate Challenge each of which feature Blazkowicz as he fights through another Nazi base to recover the Spear of Destiny after it has been stolen again as part of a plot to build a nuclear weapon or summon demons br br br Development br br In October December a team of employees from programming studio Softdisk calling themselves Ideas from the Deep developed the three part video game Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons the first game in the Commander Keen series The group who worked at Softdisk in Shreveport Louisiana developing games for the Gamer s Edge video game subscription service and disk magazine was composed of programmers John Romero and John Carmack designer Tom Hall artist Adrian Carmack and manager Jay Wilbur After the release of the game in December through shareware publisher Apogee Software the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company When their boss Softdisk owner Al Vekovius confronted them on both their plans and their use of company resources to develop the game the team had created it on their work computers both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack s house on the weekends the team made no secret of their intentions After a few weeks of negotiation the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer s Edge one every two months br Ideas from the Deep now formally established as id Software used some of these to prototype ideas for their own games Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred dark art style while John Carmack began to experiment with D computer graphics which until then was largely the purview of flight simulation games such as Wing Commander or wireframe D in games on mainframe computers Carmack found that this was largely due to the limitations of personal computers of the time which had difficulty displaying a fast action game in D due to the number of surfaces it needed to calculate but felt that the increasing computational power of PCs meant that it may be possible During he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through ray casting in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player After six weeks of development Carmack had created a rudimentary D game engine that used animated D sprites for enemies Id Software then used the engine for the April Softdisk game Hovertank D in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters In the fall of after the team sans Wilbur had relocated to Madison Wisconsin and he had largely finished the engine work for Commander Keen in Goodbye Galaxy Carmack decided to implement a feature from Ultima Underworld The Stygian Abyss a role playing game in development by Blue Sky Productions Ultima Underworld was planned to display texture mapped D graphics without Hovertank s restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting Deciding that he could add texture mapping without sacrificing the engine s speed or greatly increasing the system requirements as Underworld was doing Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from Hovertank D for another Softdisk game the November Catacomb D Upon seeing it Scott Miller of Apogee began to push the team to make a D shareware action game br br In November with the second Commander Keen trilogy of episodes nearing completion and their contractual obligations to Softdisk almost finished id Software sat down to plan out their next major game Designer Tom Hall who initially wanted to do a third Keen trilogy recognized that Carmack s programming focus had shifted from the D side scrolling platform game series to D action games After an initial proposal by Hall of a sci fi project It s Green and Pissed Romero suggested a D remake of the Castle Wolfenstein The team was interested in the idea as Romero Hall and John Carmack all had fond memories of the original title and felt the maze like shooter gameplay fit well with Carmack s D game engine while Adrian Carmack was interested in moving away from the child friendly art style of Keen into something more violent Encouraged by the reception to his idea Romero expounded on it by proposing a loud and cool fast action game where the player could shoot soldiers before dragging and looting their bodies The core of the gameplay would be fast and simple for Romero believed that due to the novelty of a D game and control scheme players would not be receptive to more complicated slow gameplay He felt the game would occupy a unique place in the industry which was then dominated by slower simulation and strategy games Adrian and John Carmack were excited by the prospect while Hall felt that it was enjoyable enough and that since he was the company s designer that they could return to his ideas at a later date br Initially the team believed that they would be unable to use the Wolfenstein name due to trademark issues and came up with multiple possible titles They contacted Castle Wolfenstein developer Silas Warner but learned that Muse Software had shut down in with all rights to Wolfenstein sold The rights last belonged to someone in Michigan and the team was able to purchase the trademark around mid April for US Thus they were free to use the name Wolfenstein D The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee who considered id Software his star developer and he guaranteed id a US payment on the project Mark Rein who had been brought on a few months prior as id s probationary president also sold the idea of doing a retail Wolfenstein project to FormGen which had published id s December Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter overcoming the publisher s concerns over Wolfenstein s proposed content This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets br br The project officially began on December Romero and Hall designed the gameplay and aesthetics Romero wanted the goal to be to mow down Nazis with the suspense of storming a Nazi bunker full of SS soldiers and Hitler himself as well as dogs blood like you never see in games and straightforward lethal weapons He also composed the general storyline for the game Hall designed the levels while also adding collectible objects in the form of treasure and food for health items He also did sketches for the bosses and the title screen Carmack programmed the core of the game s engine in a month he added a few features to the Wolfenstein D engine from Catacomb D including support for doors and decorative non wall objects but primarily focused on making the game run smoother and faster with higher resolution graphics The game was programmed chiefly in ANSI C with its scaling and ray casting routines written in assembly The graphics for the game were planned to be in color EGA but were changed to color VGA four months before release which also enabled the game to have higher resolutions Romero in turn worked on building a game with the engine removing elements of the initial design like looting enemy bodies that he felt interrupted the flow of fast gameplay The sprites for the enemies and objects were hand drawn at eight different angles by Adrian Carmack using Electronic Arts s Deluxe Paint II Initially the team had an external artist who assisted him and created animated wall textures but the team felt that the quality was poor and did not use it in the game The level design by Romero and Hall due to the grid based level design took some inspiration from Pac Man and paid homage with a hidden Pac Man level Romero later said in that making the levels was uninteresting compared to those from Commander Keen and had to prompt Hall to finish the maps with the promise of being able to buy himself a brand new car The team was going to include some anti fascist references and Nazi atrocities but left them out to avoid controversies They ensured that the presentation of the game created the atmosphere that they wanted adding violent animations by Adrian Carmack for enemies being shot and music and sound effects by Keen composer Bobby Prince to make the guns sound exciting Prince took some inspiration from his days as a platoon soldier in the US Army With the aid of a bit sampler keyboard and cassette recorder he composed realistic sounds from a shooting range in addition to Foley sounds The development team along with Scott Miller did the voicing for the enemies Some of the enemy shouts were based on the original Castle Wolfenstein game br As development continued id Software hired their former Softdisk liaison Kevin Cloud as an assistant artist and moved the company out to Mesquite Texas near where Apogee was located Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby and agreed to not only increase their royalty rate to percent but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk ScubaVenture so that id could focus on Wolfenstein The game was intended to be released using Apogee s shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free with ten levels per episode The level maps were designed in D using a custom made program called Tile Editor TEd which had been used for the entire Keen series as well as several other games Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day using the program Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes which could be sold in different sized packs Around the same time the team changed members and structure id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur who had stayed in Shreveport to be both their CEO and business team Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise br As the game neared completion FormGen contacted id with concerns over its violence and shock content In response id increased these aspects Adrian Carmack added skeletons corpses and bloody wall details and Hall and Romero added screams and cries in German along with a Death Cam that would show a replay of the death of the final boss of an episode The team also added Horst Wessel Lied the anthem of the Nazi Party to the opening screen John Carmack meanwhile added in walls that moved when triggered to hide secret areas a feature that Hall had been pushing for months but which Carmack had objected to for technical reasons Hall also added in cheat codes and wrote a back story for the game The team did a month of playtesting in the final stage of the game s development In the early morning of May the first episode of the shareware game was completed and uploaded by Apogee and id to bulletin board systems The other episodes were completed a few weeks later The total development time had been around half a year with a cost of around US to cover the team s rent and US per month salaries plus around US for the computer John Carmack used to develop the engine and the US to get the Wolfenstein trademark br The following summer most of the id Software team developed Spear of Destiny The single episode game was a prequel to Wolfenstein D and used the same engine but added new audio graphics and enemies It was created in two months and was published commercially by FormGen in September The publisher was concerned that the material would be controversial due to holy relics associated with World War II but Romero felt it was similar to the Indiana Jones films Instead of working on the game John Carmack experimented with a new graphics engine that was licensed for Shadowcaster and became the basis of the engine for id s next game Doom br br br Release br The first episode was released as shareware for free distribution by Apogee and the whole original trilogy of episodes made available for purchase on May as Wolfenstein D though the purchased episodes were not actually shipped to customers until a few weeks later The second trilogy that Miller had convinced id to create was released soon after as an add on pack titled The Nocturnal Missions Players were able to buy each trilogy separately or as a single game In Apogee also published the Wolfenstein D Super Upgrades pack which included fan made levels called WolfMaster along with a map editor titled MapEdit and a random level generator named Wolf Creator A retail Wolfenstein episode double the length of the Apogee episodes Spear of Destiny was released through FormGen on September FormGen later published two mission packs titled Return to Danger and Ultimate Challenge each the same length as Spear of Destiny in May and later that year published Spear of Destiny and the two mission packs together as the Spear of Destiny Super CD Package Id released the original six Apogee episodes as a retail title through GT Software in and produced a collection of both the Apogee and FormGen episodes released through Activision in br There were two intended promotions associated with the original Apogee release both of which were cancelled A pushable wall maze led to a sign reading Call Apogee and say Aardwolf Snapity in beta versions it was intended that the first person to find the sign and carry out its instructions would win a prize consisting of US or a line of Apogee games for life but the quick creation of level editors and cheat programs for the game soon after release led id and Apogee to give up on the idea Additionally after completing an episode the player is given a three letter code in addition to their total score and time This code was intended to be a verification code as part of a high score contest but the sudden prevalence of editor programs resulted in the cancellation of the contest without ever being formally announced br Imagineer bought the rights for the game and commissioned id to port the game to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES for a US advance The team was busy with the development of Doom plus their work on Spear of Destiny and ignored the project for seven or eight months finally hiring Rebecca Heineman to do the work She made no progress on the port however and the id team members instead spent three weeks frantically learning how to make SNES games and creating the port by March This version was written in C and compiled in the assembly language making use of binary space partitioning rather than raycasting in order to give it speed Carmack had to resize existing images to fit the SNES resolution Nintendo insisted on censoring the game in accordance with their policies this included first making all blood green and then finally removing it removing Nazi imagery and German voice clips and replacing enemy dogs with giant rats The port was released in Japan on February under the name Wolfenstein D The Claw of Eisenfaust before being released in North America and Europe later that year Using the source code of the SNES port on a whim John Carmack later converted the game to run on the Atari Jaguar Atari Corporation approved the conversion for publication and Carmack spent three weeks assisted by Dave Taylor improving the port s graphics and quality to what he later claimed was four times more detail than the DOS version He also removed the changes that Nintendo had insisted on The game itself however had to be slowed down to work properly on the console br Wolfenstein D has also been ported to numerous other platforms In Alternate Worlds Technology licensed Wolfenstein D and converted it into a virtual reality arcade game The Acorn Archimedes port was done in UK by programmer Eddie Edwards and published by Powerslave Software By a port for the Sega Mega Drive was under development by Imagineer who intended to release it by September but it was cancelled due to technical problems The Classic Mac OS version of the game had three releases The First Encounter a shareware release The Second Encounter with exclusive levels and The Third Encounter with all levels from the DOS version An Atari Lynx version of the game was offered earlier by Atari for id but work on the port was never started save for a few images A DO version was released in October The Apple IIGS port was started in Fall by Vitesse with Heineman as the initial developer with later graphics assistance by Ninjaforce Entertainment but due to licensing problems with id it was not released until February An open source iOS port programmed by John Carmack himself was released in An unofficial port for the Game Boy Color was made in An Android port titled Wolfenstein D Touch later renamed ECWolf was released and published by Beloko Games Other releases include the Game Boy Advance Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network These ports sound graphics and levels sometimes differ from the original Many of the ports include only the Apogee episodes but the iOS port includes Spear of Destiny and a Steam release for PC macOS and Linux includes all of the FormGen episodes Bethesda Softworks whose parent company bought id Software in celebrated the th anniversary of Wolfenstein D s release by producing a free to play browser based version of the game in though the website was removed a few years later br br br Reception br Id had no clear expectations for Wolfenstein s commercial reception but hoped that it would make around US in its first month the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US The game was selling at a rate of copies a month by mail order PC Zone quoted a shareware distributor as saying Wolfenstein D was the top shareware seller of By the end of sales of the Apogee episodes of Wolfenstein D as well as Spear of Destiny had reached over units each with the Apogee game still selling strongly by the end of the year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete with it for shelf space By mid shareware copies were registered and id Software had sold another retail copies of Spear of Destiny the company estimated that one million shareware copies were distributed worldwide Over percent of its sales were from outside of the US despite the lack of any marketing or non English description and despite the game being banned from sale in Germany due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons in and again in for Spear of Destiny Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu reviewed the game five months after release describing it as View from the character s point of view It s a real shooter The game is easy to play and it runs well This is the only game of its type The Apogee episodes sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer s earlier Commander Keen series and provided id with a much higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart where Commander Keen games were bringing Apogee around a month Wolfenstein D averaged per month for the first year and a half The game sold copies by and grossed million in revenue br Wolfenstein D won the Best Arcade game award from Compute the Most Innovative Game and Best Action Game awards from VideoGames Computer Entertainment the Reader s Choice Action Arcade Game award from Game Bytes the Best Action Arcade Game Best Entertainment Software and People s Choice awards at the Shareware Industry Awards the Best Action Game award from Computer Gaming World and a Codie award from the Software Publishers Association for Best Action Arcade Game It was the first shareware title to win a Codie and id with six employees became the smallest company to ever receive the award Wolfenstein D was noted as one of the top games of the year at the Game Developers Conference br Wolfenstein D was well received by reviewers upon its release Chris Lombardi of Computer Gaming World praised the sparse but gorgeous frighteningly realistic and extremely violent graphics as well as the immersive sound and music Noting the violence he warned those sensitive to such things to stay home Lombardi concluded that Wolfenstein D alongside Ultima Underworld released two months prior was the first game technologically capable of creating a sufficient element of disbelief suspension to emotionally immerse the player in a threatening environment stating that they knew of no other game that could evoke such intense psychological responses from its players Wolfenstein twice received out of stars in Dragon in Hartley Patricia and Kirk Lesser termed it definitely one of the best arcade games ever created for PC highly praised the graphics and sound and said that the fast paced action could keep players enthralled for weeks if they were not concerned about the violence Sandy Petersen in the first Eye of the Monitor column claimed that there is nothing else quite like Wolfenstein and that it had evolved almost beyond recognition from the original game He enthusiastically praised the speed and gameplay calling it a fun game with lots of action and a fun fairly mindless romp though he did note that at higher difficulty settings or later levels it became extremely hard The Spear of Destiny retail episode was also rated highly by Computer Gaming World s Bryan A Walker who praised the added enemy types though he noted that it was essentially the same game as the shareware episodes Formgen s Spear of Destiny mission packs Return to Danger and Ultimate Challenge were reviewed by Paul Hyman of Computer Gaming World who praised the updated graphical details and sound as well as the smooth gameplay but noted its overall dated graphics and lack of gameplay changes from the original game br The early ports of the game also received high reviews though their sales have been described as dismal The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly called the Super NES version a good conversion that retained the good music huge levels and overall fun of the original game and dismissed the censoring in the version as inconsequential In Total ranked the game th on their Top SNES Games list Electronic Gaming Monthly rated the Jaguar version similarly to the Super NES version commenting that the graphics and audio were superior to other versions of the game but criticizing the faster movement of the player character as making it less fun to play A GamePro review of the Jaguar port was highly complimentary saying Wolfenstein D set a new standard for PC gaming and that the Jaguar version was the best to date and better than the original due to its increased graphics and sound capabilities A Next Generation review of the Jaguar version was less enthusiastic terming it good but not up to the standards of newer games Its review of the Macintosh version of the game was also mild stating that there isn t a staggering amount of freshness here but the action is fast deadly and surprise addictive br Major Mike of GamePro commended the DO version s complete absence of pixelation fast scaling rousing music and high quality sound effects but criticized the controls as overly sensitive He concluded that the game then over three years old still packs a punch as a first person shooter Wolfenstein D won GamePro s Best DO Game of award beating the acclaimed The Need for Speed and D Maximum on the other hand while stating that the DO port was better than the original and as good as the Jaguar version felt that it was so aged compared to recent releases like Hexen Beyond Heretic and the PlayStation version of Doom that a new port was pointless with the game now somewhat tiresome and very very repetitive A reviewer for Next Generation asserted that Wolfenstein D was still as addictive as it ever was but essentially agreed with Maximum contending that anyone interested in first person shooters would have either already played it on another platform or moved on to more advanced games in the genre More modern reviews include one for the Xbox port in by Ryan McCaffrey of Official Xbox Magazine who heavily criticized it for non existent enemy AI and bad level design and found it notably inferior to Doom and one that same year by Daemon Hatfield of IGN who gave the PlayStation Network release of the game a warm reception saying that while it was dated and flawed it was required playing for any first person shooter fan br br br Legacy br br Wolfenstein D has been called the grandfather of D shooters specifically first person shooters because it established the fast paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre s popularity It has also been called the Citizen Kane of shooters Although some prior computer shooting based games existed they were generally scrolling shooters while Wolfenstein D helped move the market towards first person shooters It has also been credited with confirming shareware distribution as a serious and profitable business strategy at the time VideoGames Computer Entertainment claimed in September that the game justified the existence of shareware and in July Computer Gaming World claimed that it almost single handedly demonstrated the viability of shareware as a method of publishing leading to a wave of other shareware first person shooters The game s high revenue compared to prior smaller D titles led Apogee as well as others in the shareware games industry to move towards larger D titles built by larger development teams br During development id approached Sierra Entertainment then one of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company After viewing Commander Keen and an early version of Wolfenstein D CEO Ken Williams offered to buy id Software for US million and turn it into an in house development studio The team was excited by the deal but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept Romero proposed asking for US in cash up front as part of the deal rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams s seriousness Williams refused which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of Wolfenstein D and the company and the deal fell through causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future By the end of just before the release of their next game Doom the success of Wolfenstein D led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly traded company which were all turned down In Computer Gaming World declared Wolfenstein D the th best computer game ever released br The game is also recognized as the principal cause for Germany banning video games that contain certain types of symbols and imagery from extremist groups like Nazis under its Strafgesetzbuch section a up through Section a had social adequacy allowances for works of art but in a High District Frankfurt Court case evaluating the Nazi imagery within Wolfenstein D determined that video games did not fall under this allowance The court ruled that because video games drew younger audiences this could lead to them growing up with these symbols and insignias and thereby becoming used to them which again could make them more vulnerable for ideological manipulation by national socialist ideas Up through the Germany software ratings board the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle USK refused to rate any game that included inappropriate symbols and imagery effectively banning the game for sale within the country By May a new court ruling was made in response to a parody web browser game in which the Public Prosecutor s Office confirmed there were no breaches of the law in the game s content Following this the ban was reversed by the German government in August having determined that the Wolfenstein D decision was outdated since the USK now included age ratings alongside other content warnings and that video games should be considered as art under the social adequacy allowance In November Wolfenstein D was formally struck from the Index the list of games banned from sale in Germany br After the game s release id Software licensed the engine to other developers like the Commander Keen engine before it as part of a series of engine licensing deals that id has made throughout its history games using the Wolfenstein D engine or derivatives of it include Blake Stone the Capstone Software games Corridor and Operation Body Count as well as Super D Noah s Ark Apogee intended to produce an expansion pack in titled Rise of the Triad Wolfenstein D Part II designed by Tom Hall using the Wolfenstein D engine but during development the game was changed into a stand alone title with an enhanced engine Rise of the Triad Additionally Softdisk produced Catacomb Abyss using the prototype Wolfenstein D engine from Catacomb D as part of the Catacomb Adventure Series trilogy of sequels Although Wolfenstein D was not designed to be editable or modified players developed character and level editors to create original alterations to the game s content John Carmack and Romero who had played numerous mods of other games were delighted and overrode any concerns about copyright issues by the others The modding efforts of Wolfenstein players led id Software to explicitly design later titles like Doom and Quake to be easily modifiable by players even including the map editing tools id Software used with the games The source code for the original Wolfenstein D engine was released by id in when making the iOS port Carmack used some of the enhancements to the engine made by fans after its release The game s technical achievements also led to numerous imitators such as Ken s Labyrinth Nitemare D The Terminator Rampage Terminal Terror and The Fortress of Dr Radiaki among others br Although id Software did not develop another Wolfenstein game as their development focus shifted to Doom shortly after release and has never returned to the series multiple Wolfenstein titles have been produced by other companies sometimes using game engines developed by id The first of these newer Wolfenstein games was Return to Castle Wolfenstein in a reboot of the series and the most recent titles are the games Wolfenstein Youngblood and Wolfenstein Cyberpilot br br br br br br Sources br br br External links br Wolfenstein D at MobyGames br Wolfenstein D engine source code br Wolfenstein D can be played for free in the browser at the
