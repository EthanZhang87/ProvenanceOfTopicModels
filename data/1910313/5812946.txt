title: Statistic (role-playing games)
id: 5812946
A statistic or stat in role playing games is a piece of data that represents a particular aspect of a fictional character That piece of data is usually a unitless integer or in some cases a set of dice br For some types of statistics this value may be accompanied with a descriptive adjective sometimes called a specialisation or aspect that either describes how the character developed that particular score or an affinity for a particular use of that statistic like Specialisations in Ars Magica or Attribute Aspects in Aria br Most games divide their statistics into several categories The set of categories actually used in a game system as well as the precise statistics within each category vary greatly The most often used types of statistic include br br Attributes describe to what extent a character possesses natural in born characteristics common to all characters br Advantages and disadvantages are useful or problematic characteristics that are not common to all characters br Powers represent unique or special qualities of the character In game terms these often grant the character the potential to gain or develop certain advantages or to learn and use certain skills br Skills represent a character s learned abilities in predefined areas br Traits are broad areas of expertise similar to skills but with a broader and usually more loosely defined scope in areas freely chosen by the player br There is no standard nomenclature for statistics for example both GURPS and the Storytelling System refer to their statistics as traits even though they are treated as attributes and skills br Many games make use of derived statistics whose values depend on other statistics which are known as primary or basic statistics Game specific concepts such as experience levels alignment character class and race can also be considered statistics br br br Types br br br Attributes br br An attribute describes to what extent a character possesses a natural in born characteristic common to all characters in the game Attributes are also called statistics characteristics or abilities br Most role playing games use attributes to describe the physical and mental characteristics of characters for example their strength or wisdom Many games also include social characteristics as well for example a character s natural charisma or physical appearance They often influence the chance to succeed in a skill or other tests by addition to a die roll or by determining the number of dice to be thrown As a consequence usually a higher number is better and ranges can be as small as for numbers of dice or as great as when adding to results of percentile dice In some games attributes represent linearly increasing ability e g in Tunnels and Trolls where a character can lift lbs per point of Strength whereas in others a small increase can represent a major gain in ability e g in the DC Heroes Blood of Heroes system where to Strength doubles a character s lifting capacity br Some games work with only a few broad attributes such as Physical or Mental while others have a greater number of more specific ones Most games have about attributes br Most games try to give all attributes about the same usefulness to a character Therefore certain characteristics might be merged such as merging a Charisma type and a Willpower type attribute into a single Personality attribute or split into more attributes such as splitting physical Comeliness from Charisma in the original Unearthed Arcana or even ignored altogether for example Intelligence and Charisma in a hack and slash adventure In many games a small set of primary attributes control a larger number of derived statistics such as Armor Class or magic points br During character creation attribute scores are usually determined either randomly by rolling dice or by distributing character points In some games such as World of Warcraft the base attribute scores are determined by the character s race and class however the vast majority of stat points will be obtained through end game gear equipment Because they represent common in born characteristics and not learned capabilities as skills do in many games they are fixed for the duration of the game However in some games they can be increased by spending experience points gained during the game or as part of the process of levelling up br br br Advantages and disadvantages br br An advantage is a physical social intellectual or other enhancement to a character In contrast a disadvantage is an adverse effect Advantages are also known as virtues merits or edges and disadvantages as flaws or hindrances or by the abbreviation disads br Many games encourage or even force players to take disadvantages for their characters in order to balance their advantages or other positive statistics Disadvantages also add flavor to a character that can t be obtained solely by a list of positive traits Advantages and disadvantages often have a thematic element to them They often provide a direct relationship between how someone wants to role play their character and a tangible in game enhancement to skill or ability rolls br Systems of advantages and disadvantages are often criticized for allowing or even encouraging min maxing where a player strives to take disadvantages which have little or no tangible effect on play while using the character points gained from those disadvantages to pay for powerful advantages br br br Character points br Character points are abstract units used in some role playing games during character creation and development br Early role playing games such as Dungeons Dragons assigned random values to a player character s attributes while allowing each character a fixed number of skills As a result characters were at the same time wildly unbalanced in terms of attributes and heavily constrained in terms of skills Champions introduced a points based system of purchasing attributes and skills as a means of improving game balance and flexibility These points are known as character points and it has become a feature of numerous later games most notably GURPS br Usually a player is allotted a number of points for character creation A character s attributes such as high intelligence skills such as fixing a car or mechanics or powers such as flying can then be bought for a certain number of points More powerful abilities or a greater degree of power will require more spending of character points Later character points can be earned and spent to improve attributes or skills or to buy new skills or powers In some games such as Champions these points are experience points in others such as Ars Magica there is a more complicated relationship between experience points and character points br br br Powers br A power represents a unique or special quality of a character br In many games powers are binary on or off qualities as opposed to attributes and skills which are usually numeric quantities The main exception to this is superhero RPGs where superpowers are often treated as a sort of skill Superpowers may also use the same rating scale as the primary statistics br br br Skills br br A skill represents the learned knowledge and abilities of a character Skills are known by various names including proficiencies abilities powers talents and knacks br During character creation a player character s skills are generally chosen from a long list A character may have a fixed number of starting skills or they may be paid for using character points In contrast to attributes very few games fix a player s skills at the start of the game instead allowing players to increase them by spending experience points or during levelling up Since some skills are likely to be more useful than others different skills often have different costs br Skills usually influence a character s chance to succeed by adding to the relevant attribute In some games such as GURPS each skill has a specific base attribute to which it is always added in others such as Ars Magica a skill can be added to different attributes depending on how the skill is being used Some games such as Feng Shui add the base attribute to the skill at character creation time after that it is independent of the attribute and is used instead of the attribute rather than adding to it Most games have a fixed penalty for attempting a task without a relevant skill older editions of Shadowrun gave a complex network of penalties for using similar skills such as attempting to pick an electronic lock by using the Computer skill instead of the Electronics skill The text based roleplaying game Avalon The Legend Lives is noted for being the first text based multi user role playing game to offer a developed profession and skills system Choosing a profession then conveyed a bank of general skills and guild specific ones each containing a ladder of skills which could be invested in via lessons earned through on line play Initially there were around such skills with approximately abilities in each covering a wide range from Riding Perception Thievery or Demonology As of Avalon possesses Skills with distinct abilities developed over its year tenure br br br Traits br A trait represents a broad area of expertise of a character br Traits are rarely drawn from a predetermined list rather the player chooses some description during character generation For example a squash playing history professor with a knowledge of fine wines might have the traits History Squash and Oenology In terms of a more fine grained system of statistics a single trait would often be represented by a group of skills one or more advantages and attributes or a combination thereof br The first major role playing game to use traits was Over the Edge Some systems such as Castle Falkenstein and HeroQuest use traits as the only type of statistic although they may use some other term for them such as abilities br br br Derived statistics br Many games make use of derived statistics statistics whose values are determined only by the values of other basic statistics They often represent a single capability of the character such as the weight a character can lift or the speed at which they can move Some are unitless numbers but often they use real world units of measurement such as kilograms or metres per second Derived statistics are often used during combat e g hit points Armor Class and initiative Basic and derived statistics are also called primary and secondary statistics respectively br In games which use such concepts derived statistics are often modified by the character s race and class In addition certain in game methods such as spells or magical items might raise or lower these statistics temporarily br br br Interdependencies between statistics br Some games define various interdependencies between statistics of different categories as well as within categories The most common are br br Prerequisite br Only if statistic A has a value of at least x statistic B may exceed value y Where y is often or none For example a character class may require certain minimum attribute scores or a spell may require a minimal level of magical talent Learning some esoteric skill often requires knowledge of another one at an expert level or possession of a certain advantage In GURPS Martial Arts for example cinematic or mystical martial arts abilities require a special advantage Trained by a Master br Limitation br If statistic A has a value of at least x then statistic B cannot exceed value y This is the opposite of prerequisite Only if statistic A has a value of at most x statistic B may exceed value y For example a character class may be disallowed for certain races or one of the game effects of a disadvantage say Unfit could be to limit a certain attribute Constitution or Health in the example to a certain maximum value no more than average br Bonus or base value br If statistic A has a value of x then the value of statistic B is increased by or starts at y The term base value is preferred if y x or if y is large compared to Bs value Higher scores in an attribute often grant bonuses to a group of skills br Derivation br If statistics A and B have values of x and y respectively then the value of statistic C is a function of x y br br br
