id: 25596814
Configuration design is a kind of design where a fixed set of predefined components that can be interfaced connected in predefined ways is given and an assembly i e designed artifact of components selected from this fixed set is sought that satisfies a set of requirements and obeys a set of constraints br The associated design configuration problem consists of the following three constituent tasks br br Selection of components br Allocation of components and br Interfacing of components design of ways the components interface connect with each other br Types of knowledge involved in configuration design include br br Problem specific knowledge br Input knowledge br Requirements br Constraints br Technology br Case knowledge br Persistent knowledge knowledge that remains valid over multiple problem solving sessions br Case knowledge br Domain specific method independent knowledge br Method specific domain knowledge br Search control knowledge br br br See also br Systems design br Modular design br Morphological analysis problem solving br Constraint satisfaction problem br br br br Mittal S and Frayman F Towards a generic model of configuration tasks Proceedings of the th IJCAI San Mateo CA USA Morgan Kaufmann pages br Levin Mark Sh Modular systems design and evaluation Springer br B Wielinga and G Schreiber Configuration Design Problem Solving IEEE Intelligent Systems Vol pages
