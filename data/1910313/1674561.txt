id: 1674561
In video gaming the HUD heads up display or status bar is the method by which information is visually relayed to the player as part of a game s user interface It takes its name from the head up displays used in modern aircraft br The HUD is frequently used to simultaneously display several pieces of information including the player character s health points items and an indication of game progression such as score or level A HUD may also include elements to aid a player s navigation in the virtual space such as a mini map br br br Common elements br While the information that is displayed on the HUD depends greatly on the game there are many features that players recognize across many games Most of them are static onscreen so that they stay visible during gameplay Common features include br br Health lives this might include the player s character and possibly other important characters such as allies or bosses Real time strategy games usually show the health of every unit visible on screen Also in many but not all first and third person shooters when the player is damaged the screen or part of it flashes briefly usually in red color representing blood and shows arrows or other similar images that point to the direction the threat came from thus informing the player from which direction the enemies are attacking In many fighting games there are often two health bars on the top of the screen which often depletes to the middle sometimes the opposite direction with every punch or kick the player enemy inflicts to their opponent br Time this may be a timer counting down the time limit or the time left until a specific event It may also be a timer counting up to records such as lap times in racing games or the length of time a player can last in games based on survival Many HUDs also use time displays to show the in game time such as the current time of day or year within the game Some games may also display the real time br Weapons ammunition most action games first and third person shooters in particular show what weapon is being used and also how much ammunition is in it It can show other available weapons and objects like health packs radios etc br Capabilities gameplay options that are often accessible by the player during gameplay such as available weapons items or spells This can include when the ability will become usable again such as ammunition magic points or some other type of charge up timer Icons and or text may appear in the HUD to indicate other actions that are only available at certain times or in certain places to show they are available to perform and which button performs it for example the text A open door may be displayed but only when the character is near a door br Menus menus to exit change options delete files change settings etc br Game progression the player s current score money lap or level as in stage or as in experience points This might also include the character s current task or quest br Mini map a small map of the area that can act like a radar showing the terrain allies and or enemies locations like safe houses and shops streets etc br Speedometer tachometer used in most games which feature user operated vehicles It is usually shown only when driving one of these br Context sensitive information shown only as it becomes important such as tutorial messages special one off abilities and speech subtitles br Reticle cursor cross hair an indication of where the character is aiming or where the mouse pointer is Pressing a key while pointing at an object or character with the cursor can issue actions like shooting talking picking up objects manipulating switches using computers etc br Stealthometer displays the awareness level of enemies to the player s presence used mainly in stealth games and some first person shooters br Compass quest arrow sometimes found in RPGs first person shooters and driving games they help guide the player toward the objective An example is in the first person shooter BioShock which displays an arrow pointing the direction of the next objective on the top of the player s HUD Sometimes the compass itself might not be a real compass rather one that points toward the next location or goal Another notable example is in the open world driving game Crazy Taxi br There are also trends common among genres and platforms Many online games show player names and a chat text box for talking to the other players RTS games tend to have complex user interfaces with context sensitive panels and a full overview mini map with fog of war br br br How the HUD is displayed br br Typically this information is represented numerically with the health level being a number from percent representing full health and representing empty no health or death However many other methods of visual representation can be used For instance certain games employ a health bar which empties as the player becomes hurt such as Tekken Street Fighter and many others br Armour levels are also commonly monitored either through a separate readout or as part of the health system For example some Halo games use one recharging shield bar acting as the health level When this is depleted the player can only take a few more hits before their death The same goes in Destroy All Humans but in the form of the player s shields Traditionally games used lives to represent health Every time the main character was injured they would lose one of their limited lives Another way to display the life in the HUD is demonstrated in Gears of War where the characters life is displayed only when they are taking damage in which case a red cog known as the Crimson Omen appears in the center of the screen The more visible the Crimson Omen is the more damage the player has sustained and the closer they are to death This health system is known as the Red Ring system br There is also a lot of variance with regards to the display of other information Some games permanently display all the weapons a character is currently carrying others rely on a pull up weapon selector Inventory or storage space may also be permanently overlaid over the screen or accessed via a menu Alternatively only a limited number of items stored in the inventory might be displayed at once with the rest being rotated into view using the and keys br In order to maintain the suspension of disbelief some games make the HUD look like a real HUD within the context of the game s world Many first person vehicle simulation games use this technique showing instruments and displays that the driver of the vehicle would be expected to see The displays in the helmet in the action adventure game game Metroid Prime or Star Wars Republic Commando also mimic the player s point of view A similar method is used in Tom Clancy s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter and Crysis In some of these circumstances where the player and character within the game are meant to see the same HUD information such as Halo the term helmet mounted display HMD would technically be more accurate br Some games in an attempt to increase player immersion and reduce potential screen clutter have most or all elements disappear when not needed usually when the status they display is static a method commonly referred to as a dynamic HUD In most cases the player can display them all by pausing the game or pressing a button Some games also give players control over the HUD allowing them to hide elements and customize position size color and opacity World of Warcraft is notable for allowing players to significantly modify and enhance the user interface through Lua scripting Another example is Horizon Zero Dawn which allows player to set the display of each element to always appear show only when relevant or never display br Despite the modern dominance of D graphics in games HUDs are frequently rendered with a D look often using sprites br br br Reduction of elements br Sometimes for the sake of narrative and spatial immersion information normally displayed in the HUD is instead disguised as part of the scenery or part of the vehicle in which the player is traveling For example when the player is driving a car that can sustain a certain number of hits a smoke trail might appear when the car can take only two more hits fire might appear from the car to indicate that the next hit will be fatal Wounds and bloodstains may sometimes appear on injured characters who may also limp stagger slouch over or breathe heavily to indicate they are injured a notable example being Resident Evil br In rare cases no HUD is used at all leaving the player to interpret the auditory and visual cues in the game world Ico has no HUD fitting with the game s calmer style by not including many traditional game like elements br Another method of improving realism and immersion in games is through the implementation of dynamic HUDs such as the HUD in Red Dead Redemption These types of HUDs reduce screen clutter by only displaying specific bits of information when the in game situation calls for it For instance when exploring on horseback the player will only see the mini map and the horse s stamina meter if they are galloping When the player enters combat the game will display information related to ammunition amount and type along with the meters for player health player stamina Dead Eye ability horse stamina and horse health The racing game Split Second purposefully concentrated the HUD into just the lap counter position counter and the game s power play meter all floating within the car s rear bumper and completely dropping out common racing game elements such as lap timers or speedometers to reduce clutter and distractions br br br Displaying the HUD on a second screen br Some console video games are able to display an HUD on video game controllers that contain a smaller second screen that accompanies the gameplay on the main display The Sega Dreamcast released in uses a VMU on many games as a HUD A notable example is Resident Evil Resident Evil Nemesis and Resident Evil Code Veronica all using the VMU to show a mini version of the HUD which displays the protagonists health and ammo This feature returned with the introduction of the Nintendo Wii U which uses the Wii U GamePad for some games as a HUD including Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros for Wii U br Multi screen gaming systems particularly the Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS handheld systems can also assign HUD information to one screen while showing gameplay in another br br br Potential screen damage br Prolonged display that stays on the screen in a fixed position remaining static of HUD elements on certain CRT based screens may cause permanent damage in the form of burning into the inner coating of the television sets which is impossible to repair Players who pause their games for long hours without turning off such televisions or putting them on standby risk harming their TV sets Plasma TV screens are also at risk although the effects are usually not as permanent br br br See also br Menu computing br Second screen br br br br General br br Specific
