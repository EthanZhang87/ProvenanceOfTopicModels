Magic or mana is an attribute assigned to characters within a role playing or video game that indicates their power to use special magical abilities or spells Magic is usually measured in magic points or mana points shortened as MP Different abilities will use up different amounts of MP When the MP of a character reaches zero the character will not be able to use special abilities until some of their MP is recovered br Much like health magic might be displayed as a numeric value such as Here the first number indicates the current amount of MP a character has whereas the second number indicates the character s maximum MP In video games magic can also be displayed visually such as with a gauge that empties itself as a character uses their abilities br br br History br The magic system in tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons Dragons is largely based on patterns established in the Dying Earth novels of author Jack Vance In this system the player character can only memorize a fixed number of spells from a list of spells Once this spell is used once the character forgets it and becomes unable to use it again br Mana is a word that comes from Polynesian languages meaning something along the lines of supernatural power The concept of mana was introduced in Europe by missionary Robert Henry Codrington in and was popularized by Mircea Eliade in the s It was first introduced as a magical fuel used to cast spells in the short story Not Long Before the End by Larry Niven which is part of and later popularized by his The Magic Goes Away setting It has since become a common staple in both role playing and video games br br br Mechanisms br br Because skills and abilities are not usually lost a game designer might decide to limit the use of such an ability by linking its use to magic points This way after using an ability the player is required to rest or use an item to replenish their character s MP This is done for balancing so that each skill does not have an infinite casting ability with equal results every time br Magic may be substituted with psychic powers spiritual power advanced technology or other concepts that would allow a character to influence the world around them that is not available in real life Magic is often restricted to a specific class of character such as a mage or spellcaster while other character classes have to rely on melee combat or physical projectiles Other character classes such as those that rely on melee attacks may also have a magic bar that limits their special abilities although they are usually called something different such as the Barbarian s Fury in Diablo br In video games MP can often be restored by consuming magic potions or it may regenerate over time Status effects are temporary modification to a game character s original set of stats A character may cast a spell that inflicts a positive or negative status effect on another character br br br In role playing games br br In both tabletop role playing games and role playing video games magic is most usually used to cast spells during battles However magic has many uses outside of combat situations such as using love spells on NPCs to gain information Some games base the strength and amount of a character s magic on stats such as wisdom or intelligence These stats are used because they are easy to keep track of and develop in pen and paper RPGs br Some games introduce a separate point system per skill For example in the Pok mon games each skill of each fighting character has its own Power Points PP If the PP of only one of its skills are depleted that specific Pok mon still has three other skills to choose from br br br In god games br In god games the player s power is usually called mana and grows along with the number and prosperity of the player s worshipers Here the population size influences the maximum amount of mana the player has and the rate at which their mana restores itself when it is below that maximum Using godly powers consumes mana but such actions are necessary to increase the number and prosperity of the population br br br br br br See also br Health game terminology br Experience point
