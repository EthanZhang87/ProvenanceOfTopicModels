User interface UI design or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for machines and software such as computers home appliances mobile devices and other electronic devices with the focus on maximizing usability and the user experience In computer or software design user interface UI design primarily focuses on information architecture It is the process of building interfaces that clearly communicate to the user what s important UI design refers to graphical user interfaces and other forms of interface design The goal of user interface design is to make the user s interaction as simple and efficient as possible in terms of accomplishing user goals user centered design br User interfaces are the points of interaction between users and designs There are three types br br Graphical user interfaces GUIs Users interact with visual representations on a computer s screen The desktop is an example of a GUI br Interfaces controlled through voice Users interact with these through their voices Most smart assistants such as Siri on smartphones or Alexa on Amazon devices use voice control br Interactive interfaces utilizing gestures Users interact with D design environments through their bodies e g in virtual reality VR games br Interface design is involved in a wide range of projects from computer systems to cars to commercial planes all of these projects involve much of the same basic human interactions yet also require some unique skills and knowledge As a result designers tend to specialize in certain types of projects and have skills centered on their expertise whether it is software design user research web design or industrial design br Good user interface design facilitates finishing the task at hand without drawing unnecessary attention to itself Graphic design and typography are utilized to support its usability influencing how the user performs certain interactions and improving the aesthetic appeal of the design design aesthetics may enhance or detract from the ability of users to use the functions of the interface The design process must balance technical functionality and visual elements e g mental model to create a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to changing user needs br br br Compared to UX design br Compared to UX design UI design is more about the surface and overall look of a design User interface design is a craft in which designers perform an important function in creating the user experience UI design should keep users informed about what is happening giving appropriate feedback in a timely manner The visual look and feel of UI design sets the tone for the user experience On the other hand the term UX design refers to the entire process of creating a user experience br br Don Norman and Jakob Nielsen said It s important to distinguish the total user experience from the user interface UI even though the UI is obviously an extremely important part of the design As an example consider a website with movie reviews Even if the UI for finding a film is perfect the UX will be poor for a user who wants information about a small independent release if the underlying database only contains movies from the major studios br br br Processes br br User interface design requires a good understanding of user needs It mainly focuses on the needs of the platform and its user expectations There are several phases and processes in the user interface design some of which are more demanded upon than others depending on the project Note for the remainder of this section the word system is used to denote any project whether it is a website application or device br br Functionality requirements gathering assembling a list of the functionality required by the system to accomplish the goals of the project and the potential needs of the users br User and task analysis a form of field research it is the analysis of the potential users of the system by studying how they perform the tasks that the design must support and conducting interviews to elaborate their goals Typical questions involve br What would the user want the system to do br How would the system fit in with the user s normal workflow or daily activities br How technically savvy is the user and what similar systems does the user already use br What interface look feel styles appeal to the user br Information architecture development of the process and or information flow of the system i e for phone tree systems this would be an option tree flowchart and for web sites this would be a site flow that shows the hierarchy of the pages br Prototyping development of wire frames either in the form of paper prototypes or simple interactive screens These prototypes are stripped of all look feel elements and most content in order to concentrate on the interface br Usability inspection letting an evaluator inspect a user interface This is generally considered to be cheaper to implement than usability testing see step below and can be used early on in the development process since it can be used to evaluate prototypes or specifications for the system which usually cannot be tested on users Some common usability inspection methods include cognitive walkthrough which focuses the simplicity to accomplish tasks with the system for new users heuristic evaluation in which a set of heuristics are used to identify usability problems in the UI design and pluralistic walkthrough in which a selected group of people step through a task scenario and discuss usability issues br Usability testing testing of the prototypes on an actual user often using a technique called think aloud protocol where you ask the user to talk about their thoughts during the experience User interface design testing allows the designer to understand the reception of the design from the viewer s standpoint and thus facilitates creating successful applications br Graphical user interface design actual look and feel design of the final graphical user interface GUI These are design s control panels and faces voice controlled interfaces involve oral auditory interaction while gesture based interfaces witness users engaging with D design spaces via bodily motions It may be based on the findings developed during the user research and refined to fix any usability problems found through the results of testing Depending on the type of interface being created this process typically involves some computer programming in order to validate forms establish links or perform a desired action br Software maintenance after the deployment of a new interface occasional maintenance may be required to fix software bugs change features or completely upgrade the system Once a decision is made to upgrade the interface the legacy system will undergo another version of the design process and will begin to repeat the stages of the interface life cycle br br br Requirements br The dynamic characteristics of a system are described in terms of the dialogue requirements contained in seven principles of part of the ergonomics standard the ISO This standard establishes a framework of ergonomic principles for the dialogue techniques with high level definitions and illustrative applications and examples of the principles The principles of the dialogue represent the dynamic aspects of the interface and can be mostly regarded as the feel of the interface br The seven dialogue principles are br br Suitability for the task the dialogue is suitable for a task when it supports the user in the effective and efficient completion of the task br Self descriptiveness the dialogue is self descriptive when each dialogue step is immediately comprehensible through feedback from the system or is explained to the user on request br Controllability the dialogue is controllable when the user is able to initiate and control the direction and pace of the interaction until the point at which the goal has been met br Conformity with user expectations the dialogue conforms with user expectations when it is consistent and corresponds to the user characteristics such as task knowledge education experience and to commonly accepted conventions br Error tolerance the dialogue is error tolerant if despite evident errors in input the intended result may be achieved with either no or minimal action by the user br Suitability for individualization the dialogue is capable of individualization when the interface software can be modified to suit the task needs individual preferences and skills of the user br Suitability for learning the dialogue is suitable for learning when it supports and guides the user in learning to use the system br The concept of usability is defined of the ISO standard by effectiveness efficiency and satisfaction of the user br Part gives the following definition of usability br br Usability is measured by the extent to which the intended goals of use of the overall system are achieved effectiveness br The resources that have to be expended to achieve the intended goals efficiency br The extent to which the user finds the overall system acceptable satisfaction br Effectiveness efficiency and satisfaction can be seen as quality factors of usability To evaluate these factors they need to be decomposed into sub factors and finally into usability measures br The information presented is described in Part of the ISO standard for the organization of information arrangement alignment grouping labels location for the display of graphical objects and for the coding of information abbreviation colour size shape visual cues by seven attributes The attributes of presented information represent the static aspects of the interface and can be generally regarded as the look of the interface The attributes are detailed in the recommendations given in the standard Each of the recommendations supports one or more of the seven attributes br The seven presentation attributes are br br Clarity the information content is conveyed quickly and accurately br Discriminability the displayed information can be distinguished accurately br Conciseness users are not overloaded with extraneous information br Consistency a unique design conformity with user s expectation br Detectability the user s attention is directed towards information required br Legibility information is easy to read br Comprehensibility the meaning is clearly understandable unambiguous interpretable and recognizable br The user guidance in Part of the ISO standard describes that the user guidance information should be readily distinguishable from other displayed information and should be specific for the current context of use br User guidance can be given by the following five means br br Prompts indicating explicitly specific prompts or implicitly generic prompts that the system is available for input br Feedback informing about the user s input timely perceptible and non intrusive br Status information indicating the continuing state of the application the system s hardware and software components and the user s activities br Error management including error prevention error correction user support for error management and error messages br On line help for system initiated and user initiated requests with specific information for the current context of use br br br Research br User interface design has been a topic of considerable research including on its aesthetics Standards have been developed as far back as the s for defining the usability of software products br One of the structural bases has become the IFIP user interface reference model br The model proposes four dimensions to structure the user interface br br The input output dimension the look br The dialogue dimension the feel br The technical or functional dimension the access to tools and services br The organizational dimension the communication and co operation support br This model has greatly influenced the development of the international standard ISO describing the interface design requirements for usability br The desire to understand application specific UI issues early in software development even as an application was being developed led to research on GUI rapid prototyping tools that might offer convincing simulations of how an actual application might behave in production use Some of this research has shown that a wide variety of programming tasks for GUI based software can in fact be specified through means other than writing program code br Research in recent years is strongly motivated by the increasing variety of devices that can by virtue of Moore s law host very complex interfaces br br br See
