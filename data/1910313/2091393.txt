title: Fault tolerance
id: 2091393
Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to maintain proper operation in the event of failures or faults in one or more of its components Any decrease in operating quality is proportional to the severity of the failure unlike a naively designed system in which even a small failure can lead to total breakdown Fault tolerance is particularly sought after in high availability mission critical or even life critical systems The ability to maintain functionality when portions of a system break down is referred to as graceful degradation br A fault tolerant design enables a system to continue its intended operation possibly at a reduced level rather than failing completely when some part of the system fails The term is most commonly used to describe computer systems designed to continue operation in the event of a partial failure with perhaps a reduction in throughput or an increase in response time That is the system as a whole is not stopped due to problems either in the hardware or the software Non computing examples include a motor vehicle designed to remain drivable if one of the tires is punctured or a structure that retains its integrity despite damage caused by fatigue corrosion manufacturing flaws or impact br For an individual system fault tolerance can be achieved by anticipating exceptional conditions and building the system to cope with them and aiming for self stabilization so that the system converges towards an error free state However if the consequences of a system failure are catastrophic or the cost of making it sufficiently reliable is very high a better solution may be to use some form of duplication In any case if the consequence of a system failure is so catastrophic the system must be able to use reversion to fall back to a safe mode This is similar to roll back recovery but can be a human action if humans are present in the loop br br br History br The first known fault tolerant computer was SAPO built in in Czechoslovakia by Anton n Svoboda Its basic design was magnetic drums connected via relays with a voting method of memory error detection triple modular redundancy Several other machines were developed along this line mostly for military use Eventually they separated into three distinct categories br br Machines that would last a long time without any maintenance such as the ones used on NASA space probes and satellites br Computers that were very dependable but required constant monitoring such as those used to monitor and control nuclear power plants or supercollider experiments and br Computers with a high amount of runtime that would be under heavy use such as many of the supercomputers used by insurance companies for their probability monitoring br Most of the development in the so called LLNM Long Life No Maintenance computing was done by NASA during the s in preparation for Project Apollo and other research aspects NASA s first machine went into a space observatory and their second attempt the JSTAR computer was used in Voyager This computer had a backup of memory arrays to use memory recovery methods and thus it was called the JPL Self Testing And Repairing computer It could detect its own errors and fix them or bring up redundant modules as needed The computer is still working as of early br Hyper dependable computers were pioneered mostly by aircraft manufacturers nuclear power companies and the railroad industry in the United States These entities needed computers with massive amounts of uptime that would fail gracefully enough during a fault to allow continued operation while relying on constant human monitoring of computer output to detect faults Again IBM developed the first computer of this kind for NASA for guidance of Saturn V rockets but later on BNSF Unisys and General Electric built their own br In the s much work happened in the field For instance F CADC had built in self test and redundancy br In general the early efforts at fault tolerant designs were focused mainly on internal diagnosis where a fault would indicate something was failing and a worker could replace it SAPO for instance had a method by which faulty memory drums would emit a noise before failure Later efforts showed that to be fully effective the system had to be self repairing and diagnosing isolating a fault and then implementing a redundant backup while alerting a need for repair This is known as N model redundancy where faults cause automatic fail safes and a warning to the operator and it is still the most common form of level one fault tolerant design in use today br Voting was another initial method as discussed above with multiple redundant backups operating constantly and checking each other s results For example if four components reported an answer of and one component reported an answer of the other four would vote that the fifth component was faulty and have it taken out of service This is called M out of N majority voting br Historically the trend has been to move away from N model and toward M out of N as the complexity of systems and the difficulty of ensuring the transitive state from fault negative to fault positive did not disrupt operations br Tandem Computers in and Stratus were among the first companies specializing in the design of fault tolerant computer systems for online transaction processing br br br Examples br br Hardware fault tolerance sometimes requires that broken parts be taken out and replaced with new parts while the system is still operational in computing known as hot swapping Such a system implemented with a single backup is known as single point tolerant and represents the vast majority of fault tolerant systems In such systems the mean time between failures should be long enough for the operators to have sufficient time to fix the broken devices mean time to repair before the backup also fails It is helpful if the time between failures is as long as possible but this is not specifically required in a fault tolerant system br Fault tolerance is notably successful in computer applications Tandem Computers built their entire business on such machines which used single point tolerance to create their NonStop systems with uptimes measured in years br Fail safe architectures may encompass also the computer software for example by process replication br Data formats may also be designed to degrade gracefully HTML for example is designed to be forward compatible allowing Web browsers to ignore new and unsupported HTML entities without causing the document to be unusable Additionally some sites including popular platforms such as Twitter until December provide an optional lightweight front end that does not rely on JavaScript and has a minimal layout to ensure wide accessibility and outreach such as on game consoles with limited web browsing capabilities br br br Terminology br br A highly fault tolerant system might continue at the same level of performance even though one or more components have failed For example a building with a backup electrical generator will provide the same voltage to wall outlets even if the grid power fails br A system that is designed to fail safe or fail secure or fail gracefully whether it functions at a reduced level or fails completely does so in a way that protects people property or data from injury damage intrusion or disclosure In computers a program might fail safe by executing a graceful exit as opposed to an uncontrolled crash to prevent data corruption after an error occurs A similar distinction is made between failing well and failing badly br A system designed to experience graceful degradation or to fail soft used in computing similar to fail safe operates at a reduced level of performance after some component fails For example if grid power fails a building may operate lighting at reduced levels or elevators at reduced speeds In computing if insufficient network bandwidth is available to stream an online video a lower resolution version might be streamed in place of the high resolution version Progressive enhancement is another example where web pages are available in a basic functional format for older small screen or limited capability web browsers but in an enhanced version for browsers capable of handling additional technologies or that have a larger display br In fault tolerant computer systems programs that are considered robust are designed to continue operation despite an error exception or invalid input instead of crashing completely Software brittleness is the opposite of robustness Resilient networks continue to transmit data despite the failure of some links or nodes Resilient buildings and infrastructure are likewise expected to prevent complete failure in situations like earthquakes floods or collisions br A system with high failure transparency will alert users that a component failure has occurred even if it continues to operate with full performance so that failure can be repaired or imminent complete failure anticipated Likewise a fail fast component is designed to report at the first point of failure rather than generating reports when downstream components fail This allows easier diagnosis of the underlying problem and may prevent improper operation in a broken state br br A single fault condition is a situation where one means for protection against a hazard is defective If a single fault condition results unavoidably in another single fault condition the two failures are considered one single fault condition A source offers the following example A single fault condition is a condition when a single means for protection against hazard in equipment is defective or a single external abnormal condition is present e g short circuit between the live parts and the applied part br br br Criteria br Providing fault tolerant design for every component is normally not an option Associated redundancy brings a number of penalties increase in weight size power consumption cost as well as time to design verify and test Therefore a number of choices have to be examined to determine which components should be fault tolerant br br How critical is the component In a car the radio is not critical so this component has less need for fault tolerance br How likely is the component to fail Some components like the drive shaft in a car are not likely to fail so no fault tolerance is needed br How expensive is it to make the component fault tolerant Requiring a redundant car engine for example would likely be too expensive both economically and in terms of weight and space to be considered br An example of a component that passes all the tests is a car s occupant restraint system While the primary occupant restraint system is not normally thought of it is gravity If the vehicle rolls over or undergoes severe g forces then this primary method of occupant restraint may fail Restraining the occupants during such an accident is absolutely critical to safety so the first test is passed Accidents causing occupant ejection were quite common before seat belts so the second test is passed The cost of a redundant restraint method like seat belts is quite low both economically and in terms of weight and space so the third test is passed Therefore adding seat belts to all vehicles is an excellent idea Other supplemental restraint systems such as airbags are more expensive and so pass that test by a smaller margin br Another excellent and long term example of this principle being put into practice is the braking system whilst the actual brake mechanisms are critical they are not particularly prone to sudden rather than progressive failure and are in any case necessarily duplicated to allow even and balanced application of brake force to all wheels It would also be prohibitively costly to further double up the main components and they would add considerable weight However the similarly critical systems for actuating the brakes under driver control are inherently less robust generally using a cable can rust stretch jam snap or hydraulic fluid can leak boil and develop bubbles absorb water and thus lose effectiveness Thus in most modern cars the footbrake hydraulic brake circuit is diagonally divided to give two smaller points of failure the loss of either only reducing brake power by and not causing as much dangerous brakeforce imbalance as a straight front back or left right split and should the hydraulic circuit fail completely a relatively very rare occurrence there is a failsafe in the form of the cable actuated parking brake that operates the otherwise relatively weak rear brakes but can still bring the vehicle to a safe halt in conjunction with transmission engine braking so long as the demands on it are in line with normal traffic flow The cumulatively unlikely combination of total foot brake failure with the need for harsh braking in an emergency will likely result in a collision but still one at lower speed than would otherwise have been the case br In comparison with the foot pedal activated service brake the parking brake itself is a less critical item and unless it is being used as a one time backup for the footbrake will not cause immediate danger if it is found to be nonfunctional at the moment of application Therefore no redundancy is built into it per se and it typically uses a cheaper lighter but less hardwearing cable actuation system and it can suffice if this happens on a hill to use the footbrake to momentarily hold the vehicle still before driving off to find a flat piece of road on which to stop Alternatively on shallow gradients the transmission can be shifted into Park Reverse or First gear and the transmission lock engine compression used to hold it stationary as there is no need for them to include the sophistication to first bring it to a halt br On motorcycles a similar level of fail safety is provided by simpler methods first the front and rear brake systems are entirely separate regardless of their method of activation that can be cable rod or hydraulic allowing one to fail entirely while leaving the other unaffected Second the rear brake is relatively strong compared to its automotive cousin being a powerful disc on some sports models even though the usual intent is for the front system to provide the vast majority of braking force as the overall vehicle weight is more central the rear tire is generally larger and has better traction so that the rider can lean back to put more weight on it therefore allowing more brake force to be applied before the wheel locks On cheaper slower utility class machines even if the front wheel should use a hydraulic disc for extra brake force and easier packaging the rear will usually be a primitive somewhat inefficient but exceptionally robust rod actuated drum thanks to the ease of connecting the footpedal to the wheel in this way and more importantly the near impossibility of catastrophic failure even if the rest of the machine like a lot of low priced bikes after their first few years of use is on the point of collapse from neglected maintenance br br br Requirements br The basic characteristics of fault tolerance require br br No single point of failure If a system experiences a failure it must continue to operate without interruption during the repair process br Fault isolation to the failing component When a failure occurs the system must be able to isolate the failure to the offending component This requires the addition of dedicated failure detection mechanisms that exist only for the purpose of fault isolation Recovery from a fault condition requires classifying the fault or failing component The National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST categorizes faults based on locality cause duration and effect br Fault containment to prevent propagation of the failure Some failure mechanisms can cause a system to fail by propagating the failure to the rest of the system An example of this kind of failure is the rogue transmitter that can swamp legitimate communication in a system and cause overall system failure Firewalls or other mechanisms that isolate a rogue transmitter or failing component to protect the system are required br Availability of reversion modes br In addition fault tolerant systems are characterized in terms of both planned service outages and unplanned service outages These are usually measured at the application level and not just at a hardware level The figure of merit is called availability and is expressed as a percentage For example a five nines system would statistically provide availability br Fault tolerant systems are typically based on the concept of redundancy br br br Fault tolerance techniques br Research into the kinds of tolerances needed for critical systems involves a large amount of interdisciplinary work The more complex the system the more carefully all possible interactions have to be considered and prepared for Considering the importance of high value systems in transport public utilities and the military the field of topics that touch on research is very wide it can include such obvious subjects as software modeling and reliability or hardware design to arcane elements such as stochastic models graph theory formal or exclusionary logic parallel processing remote data transmission and more br br br Replication br Spare components address the first fundamental characteristic of fault tolerance in three ways br br Replication Providing multiple identical instances of the same system or subsystem directing tasks or requests to all of them in parallel and choosing the correct result on the basis of a quorum br Redundancy Providing multiple identical instances of the same system and switching to one of the remaining instances in case of a failure failover br Diversity Providing multiple different implementations of the same specification and using them like replicated systems to cope with errors in a specific implementation br All implementations of RAID redundant array of independent disks except RAID are examples of a fault tolerant storage device that uses data redundancy br A lockstep fault tolerant machine uses replicated elements operating in parallel At any time all the replications of each element should be in the same state The same inputs are provided to each replication and the same outputs are expected The outputs of the replications are compared using a voting circuit A machine with two replications of each element is termed dual modular redundant DMR The voting circuit can then only detect a mismatch and recovery relies on other methods A machine with three replications of each element is termed triple modular redundant TMR The voting circuit can determine which replication is in error when a two to one vote is observed In this case the voting circuit can output the correct result and discard the erroneous version After this the internal state of the erroneous replication is assumed to be different from that of the other two and the voting circuit can switch to a DMR mode This model can be applied to any larger number of replications br Lockstep fault tolerant machines are most easily made fully synchronous with each gate of each replication making the same state transition on the same edge of the clock and the clocks to the replications being exactly in phase However it is possible to build lockstep systems without this requirement br Bringing the replications into synchrony requires making their internal stored states the same They can be started from a fixed initial state such as the reset state Alternatively the internal state of one replica can be copied to another replica br One variant of DMR is pair and spare Two replicated elements operate in lockstep as a pair with a voting circuit that detects any mismatch between their operations and outputs a signal indicating that there is an error Another pair operates exactly the same way A final circuit selects the output of the pair that does not proclaim that it is in error Pair and spare requires four replicas rather than the three of TMR but has been used commercially br br br Failure oblivious computing br Failure oblivious computing is a technique that enables computer programs to continue executing despite errors The technique can be applied in different contexts It can handle invalid memory reads by returning a manufactured value to the program which in turn makes use of the manufactured value and ignores the former memory value it tried to access this is a great contrast to typical memory checkers which inform the program of the error or abort the program br The approach has performance costs because the technique rewrites code to insert dynamic checks for address validity execution time will increase by to br br br Recovery shepherding br Recovery shepherding is a lightweight technique to enable software programs to recover from otherwise fatal errors such as null pointer dereference and divide by zero Comparing to the failure oblivious computing technique recovery shepherding works on the compiled program binary directly and does not need to recompile to program br It uses the just in time binary instrumentation framework Pin It attaches to the application process when an error occurs repairs the execution br tracks the repair effects as the execution continues contains the repair effects within the application process and detaches from the process after all repair effects are flushed from the process state It does not interfere with the normal execution of the program and therefore incurs negligible overhead For of systematically collected real world null dereference and divide by zero errors a prototype implementation enables the application to continue to execute to provide acceptable output and service to its users on the error triggering inputs br br br Circuit breaker br br The circuit breaker design pattern is a technique to avoid catastrophic failures in distributed systems br br br Redundancy br br Redundancy is the provision of functional capabilities that would be unnecessary in a fault free environment br This can consist of backup components that automatically kick in if one component fails For example large cargo trucks can lose a tire without any major consequences They have many tires and no one tire is critical with the exception of the front tires which are used to steer but generally carry less load each and in total than the other four to so are less likely to fail br The idea of incorporating redundancy in order to improve the reliability of a system was pioneered by John von Neumann in the s br Two kinds of redundancy are possible space redundancy and time redundancy Space redundancy provides additional components functions or data items that are unnecessary for fault free operation Space redundancy is further classified into hardware software and information redundancy depending on the type of redundant resources added to the system In time redundancy the computation or data transmission is repeated and the result is compared to a stored copy of the previous result The current terminology for this kind of testing is referred to as In Service Fault Tolerance Testing or ISFTT for short br br br Disadvantages br Fault tolerant design s advantages are obvious while many of its disadvantages are not br br Interference with fault detection in the same component To continue the above passenger vehicle example with either of the fault tolerant systems it may not be obvious to the driver when a tire has been punctured This is usually handled with a separate automated fault detection system In the case of the tire an air pressure monitor detects the loss of pressure and notifies the driver The alternative is a manual fault detection system such as manually inspecting all tires at each stop br Interference with fault detection in another component Another variation of this problem is when fault tolerance in one component prevents fault detection in a different component For example if component B performs some operation based on the output from component A then fault tolerance in B can hide a problem with A If component B is later changed to a less fault tolerant design the system may fail suddenly making it appear that the new component B is the problem Only after the system has been carefully scrutinized will it become clear that the root problem is actually with component A br Reduction of priority of fault correction Even if the operator is aware of the fault having a fault tolerant system is likely to reduce the importance of repairing the fault If the faults are not corrected this will eventually lead to system failure when the fault tolerant component fails completely or when all redundant components have also failed br Test difficulty For certain critical fault tolerant systems such as a nuclear reactor there is no easy way to verify that the backup components are functional The most infamous example of this is Chernobyl where operators tested the emergency backup cooling by disabling primary and secondary cooling The backup failed resulting in a core meltdown and massive release of radiation br Cost Both fault tolerant components and redundant components tend to increase cost This can be a purely economic cost or can include other measures such as weight Crewed spaceships for example have so many redundant and fault tolerant components that their weight is increased dramatically over uncrewed systems which do not require the same level of safety br Inferior components A fault tolerant design may allow for the use of inferior components which would have otherwise made the system inoperable While this practice has the potential to mitigate the cost increase use of multiple inferior components may lower the reliability of the system to a level equal to or even worse than a comparable non fault tolerant system br br br Related terms br There is a difference between fault tolerance and systems that rarely have problems For instance the Western Electric crossbar systems had failure rates of two hours per forty years and therefore were highly fault resistant But when a fault did occur they still stopped operating completely and therefore were not fault tolerant br br br See also br br br
