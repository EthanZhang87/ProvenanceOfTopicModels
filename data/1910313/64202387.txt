he took inspiration for Pauline from the animated character Betty Boop and drew her in a similar style br The sounds in Donkey Kong were produced by Hirokazu Tanaka who attempted to use a voice synthesiser to create Pauline s voice with unsatisfactory results Miyamoto said that although she initially had English voice lines they were replaced by sound effects She originally cried Help help and said Nice when Mario jumped Miyamoto explained that an English teacher was asked to listen to the voice lines due to pronunciation concerns and said that it sounded like she was saying Kelp so voices were abandoned br Super Mario Odyssey producer Yoshiaki Koizumi said that Pauline was chosen as the mayor of New Donk City because the development team wanted the setting to resonate with players and knew that Pauline was a familiar character He said that she sang the game s theme song Jump Up Super Star as she was being developed more as a character and was going to be interested in jazz Kate Higgins provided the English voice for Pauline for both the song and the game giving her full sentence dialogue for the first time expanding on the audible cries of Help in Donkey Kong that are intelligible when using a Super Game Boy br br br Appearances br Pauline debuted as Mario s love interest in Donkey Kong which was remade for Game Boy where she was again a typical damsel in

for The Independent noted that Pauline had been swiftly replaced by Princess Peach as Mario s love interest for over years while Pauline has remained drifting on the fringes of Mario titles her story

distress trope that would haunt games for decades to come He opined that although Shigeru Miyamoto had explained Nintendo s reliance on damsels by stating that the game has been designed for male gamers in arcades it was actually the result of applying outdated notions of identity and gender roles after the fact instead of at the start Tim Mulkerin of Mic said that Pauline diverged from other love interests of Mario by being a run of the mill absurdly beautiful yet helpless human woman rather than a princess but thought that her conversion from damsel to empowered politician in Super Mario Odyssey was a fun inversion of a tired trope br After her reappearance in Super Mario Odyssey her character was praised for overcoming the damsel in distress archetype to become a woman of power
