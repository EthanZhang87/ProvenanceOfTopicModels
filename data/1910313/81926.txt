Blender is a free and open source D computer graphics software tool set that runs on Windows MacOS BSD Haiku and Linux It is used for creating animated films visual effects art D printed models motion graphics interactive D applications virtual reality and formerly video games Blender s features include D modelling UV mapping texturing digital drawing raster graphics editing rigging and skinning fluid and smoke simulation particle simulation soft body simulation sculpting animation match moving rendering motion graphics video editing Python scripting and compositing br br br History br br Blender was initially developed as an in house application by the Dutch animation studio NeoGeo no relation to the video game brand and was officially launched on January Version was released in January with the primary author being the company co owner and software developer Ton Roosendaal The name Blender was inspired by a song by the Swiss electronic band Yello from the album Baby which NeoGeo used in its showreel Some design choices and experiences for Blender were carried over from an earlier software application called Traces that Roosendaal developed for NeoGeo on the Commodore Amiga platform during the period br On January Blender was released publicly online as SGI freeware NeoGeo was later dissolved and its client contracts were taken over by another company After NeoGeo s dissolution Ton Roosendaal founded Not a Number Technologies NaN in June to further develop Blender initially distributing it as shareware until NaN went bankrupt in This also resulted in the discontinuation of Blender s development br In May Roosendaal started the non profit Blender Foundation with the first goal to find a way to continue developing and promoting Blender as a community based open source project On July Roosendaal started the Free Blender campaign a crowdfunding precursor The campaign aimed at open sourcing Blender for a one time payment of US at the time with the money being collected from the community On September it was announced that they had collected enough funds and would release the Blender source code Today Blender is free and open source software largely developed by its community as well as full time employees and freelancers employed by the Blender Institute br The Blender Foundation initially reserved the right to use dual licensing so that in addition to GPL or later Blender would have been available also under the Blender License which did not require disclosing source code but required payments to the Blender Foundation However this option was never exercised and was suspended indefinitely in Blender is solely available under GNU GPLv or any later and was not updated to the GPLv as no evident benefits were seen The binary releases of Blender are under GNU GPLv or later because of the incorporated Apache libraries br In with the release of version the integrated game engine for making and prototyping video games was removed Blender s developers recommended that users migrate to more powerful open source game engines such as Godot instead br br br Suzanne br br In February the fate of the Blender software company NaN became evident as it faced imminent closure in March Nevertheless one more release was pushed out Blender As a sort of Easter egg and last personal tag the artists and developers decided to add a D model of a chimpanzee head called a monkey in the software It was created by Willem Paul van Overbruggen SLiD who named it Suzanne the monkey after the orangutan in the Kevin Smith film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back br Suzanne is Blender s alternative to more common test models such as the Utah Teapot and the Stanford Bunny A low polygon model with only faces Suzanne is included in Blender and often used as a quick and easy way to test materials animations rigs textures and lighting setups It is as easily added to a scene as primitives such as a cube or plane br The largest Blender contest gives out an award called the Suzanne Award underscoring the significance of this unique D model in the Blender community br br br Release history br br The following table lists notable developments during Blender s release history green indicates the current version yellow indicates currently supported versions and red indicates versions that are no longer supported though many later versions can still be used on modern systems br br As of official releases of Blender for Microsoft Windows macOS and Linux as well as a port for FreeBSD are available in bit versions Blender is available for Windows and above and Mac OS X and above br Blender b was the last supported release for Windows XP and version was the last supported release for PowerPC Blender LTS and were the last supported versions for Windows In Blender was released on Android as a demo but has not been updated since br br br Features br br br Modeling br Blender has support for a variety of geometric primitives including polygon meshes B zier curves NURBS surfaces metaballs icospheres text and an n gon modeling system called B mesh There is also an advanced polygonal modelling system which can be accessed through an edit mode It supports features such as extrusion bevelling and subdividing br br br Modifiers br Modifiers apply non destructive effects which can be applied upon rendering or exporting such as subdivision surfaces br br br Sculpting br Blender has multi resolution digital sculpting which includes dynamic topology baking remeshing re symmetrization and decimation The latter is used to simplify models for exporting purposes an example being game assets br br br Geometry nodes br br Blender has a node graph system for procedurally and non destructively creating and manipulating geometry It was first added to Blender which focuses on object scattering and instancing It takes the form of a modifier so it can be stacked over other different modifiers The system uses object attributes which can be modified and overridden with string inputs Attributes can include positions normals and UV maps All attributes can be viewed in an attribute spreadsheet editor The Geometry Nodes utility also has the capability of creating primitive meshes In Blender support for creating and modifying curves objects was added to Geometry Nodes in the same release the Geometry Nodes workflow was completely redesigned with fields in order to make the system more intuitive and work like shader nodes br br br Simulation br Blender can be used to simulate smoke rain dust cloth fluids hair and rigid bodies br br br Fluid simulation br The fluid simulator can be used for simulating liquids like water being poured into a cup It uses Lattice Boltzmann methods LBM to simulate fluids and allows for plenty of adjustment of particles and resolution The particle physics fluid simulation creates particles that follow the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method br Blender has simulation tools for soft body dynamics including mesh collision detection LBM fluid dynamics smoke simulation Bullet rigid body dynamics an ocean generator with waves a particle system that includes support for particle based hair and real time control during physics simulation and rendering br In Blender a new fluid simulation system called Mantaflow was added replacing the old FLIP system In Blender another fluid simulation system called APIC which builds on Mantaflow was added Vortices and more stable calculations are improved from the FLIP system br br br Cloth Simulation br Cloth simulation is done by simulating vertices with a rigid body simulation If done on a D mesh it will produce similar effects as the soft body simulation br br br Animation br Blender s keyframed animation capabilities include inverse kinematics armatures hooks curve and lattice based deformations shape keys non linear animation constraints and vertex weighting In addition its Grease Pencil tools allow for D animation within a full D pipeline br br br Rendering br br Blender includes three render engines since version EEVEE Workbench and Cycles br Cycles is a path tracing render engine It supports rendering through both the CPU and the GPU Cycles supports the Open Shading Language since Blender br Cycles Hybrid Rendering is possible in Version with Optix Tiles are calculated with GPU in combination with CPU br EEVEE is a new physically based real time renderer While it is capable of driving Blender s real time viewport for creating assets thanks to its speed it can also work as a renderer for final frames br Workbench is a real time render engine designed for fast rendering during modelling and animation preview It is not intended for final rendering Workbench supports assigning colors to objects for visual distinction br br br Cycles br br Cycles is a path tracing render engine that is designed to be interactive and easy to use while still supporting many features It has been included with Blender since with the release of Blender Cycles supports with AVX AVX and AVX extensions as well as CPU acceleration in modern hardware br br br GPU rendering br Cycles supports GPU rendering which is used to speed up rendering times There are three GPU rendering modes CUDA which is the preferred method for older Nvidia graphics cards OptiX which utilizes the hardware ray tracing capabilities of Nvidia s Turing architecture Ampere architecture and OpenCL which supports rendering on AMD Radeon graphics cards with added Intel Iris and Xe support in The toolkit software associated with these rendering modes does not come within Blender and needs to be separately installed and configured as per their respective source instructions br Multiple GPUs are also supported with the notable exception of the EEVEE render engine which can be used to create a render farm to speed up rendering by processing frames or tiles in parallel having multiple GPUs however does not increase the available memory since each GPU can only access its own memory Since Version this limitation of SLI cards is broken with Nvidia s NVLink br Apple s Metal API got initial implementation in Blender for Apple computers with M chips and AMD graphics cards br A Benchmark of Blender shows great advantages of long supported CUDA against newer API OptiX and brand new HIP for AMD Hardware Some improvements in performance were added for HIP and OptiX in Blender and br Support for Intel Arc GPUs arrived in Blender LTS br br br Integrator br The integrator is the core rendering algorithm used for lighting computations Cycles currently supports a path tracing integrator with direct light sampling It works well for a variety of lighting setups but it is not as suitable for caustics and certain other complex lighting situations Rays are traced from the camera into the scene bouncing around until they find a light source a lamp an object material emitting light or the world background or until they are simply terminated based on the number of maximum bounces determined in the light path settings for the renderer To find lamps and surfaces emitting light both indirect light sampling letting the ray follow the surface bidirectional scattering distribution function or BSDF and direct light sampling picking a light source and tracing a ray towards it are used br The default path tracing integrator is a pure path tracer This integrator works by sending several light rays that act as photons from the camera out into the scene These rays will eventually hit either a light source an object or the world background If these rays hit an object they will bounce based on the angle of impact and continue bouncing until a light source has been reached or until a maximum number of bounces as determined by the user which will cause it to terminate and result in a black unlit pixel Multiple rays are calculated and averaged out for each pixel a process known as sampling This sampling number is set by the user and greatly affects the final image Lower sampling often results in more noise and has the potential to create fireflies which are uncharacteristically bright pixels while higher sampling greatly reduces noise but also increases render times br The alternative is a branched path tracing integrator which works mostly the same way Branched path tracing splits the light rays at each intersection with an object according to different surface components and takes all lights into account for shading instead of just one This added complexity makes computing each ray slower but reduces noise in the render especially in scenes dominated by direct one bounce lighting br br br Open Shading Language br Blender users can create their own nodes using the Open Shading Language OSL although it is important to note that this feature is not supported by GPUs br br br Materials br Materials define the look of meshes NURBS curves and other geometric objects They consist of three shaders to define the mesh s surface appearance volume inside and surface displacement br The surface shader defines the light interaction at the surface of the mesh One or more bidirectional scattering distribution functions or BSDFs can specify if incoming light is reflected refracted into the mesh or absorbed The alpha value is one measure of translucency br When the surface shader does not reflect or absorb light it enters the volume light transmission If no volume shader is specified it will pass straight through or be refracted see refractive index or IOR to another side of the mesh br If one is defined a volume shader describes the light interaction as it passes through the volume of the mesh Light may be scattered absorbed or even emitted at any point in the volume br The shape of the surface may be altered by displacement shaders In this way textures can be used to make the mesh surface more detailed br Depending on the settings the displacement may be virtual only modifying the surface normals to give the impression of displacement also known as bump mapping real or a combination of real displacement with bump mapping br br br EEVEE br EEVEE or Eevee is a real time PBR renderer included in Blender from version This render engine was given the nickname EEVEE after the Pok mon The name was later made into the backronym Extra Easy Virtual Environment Engine or EEVEE br br br Workbench br Using the default D viewport drawing system for modeling texturing etc br br br External renderers br Free and open source br br Mitsuba Renderer br YafaRay previously Yafray br LuxCoreRender previously LuxRender br Appleseed Renderer br POV Ray br NOX Renderer br Armory D a free and open source game engine for

Maxwell addon for Blender br Thea Render Thea for Blender br Corona Renderer Blender To Corona exporter Corona Standalone is needed for rendering br br br Texturing and shading br Blender allows procedural and node based textures as well as texture painting projective painting vertex painting weight painting and dynamic painting br br br Post production br br Blender has a node based compositor within the rendering pipeline which is accelerated with OpenCL and in it supports GPU It also includes a non linear video editor called the Video Sequence Editor VSE with support for effects like Gaussian blur color grading fade and wipe transitions and other video transformations However there is no built in multi core support for rendering video with the VSE br br br Plugins addons and scripts br Blender supports Python scripting for the creation of custom tools prototyping importing exporting from other formats and task automation This allows for integration with several external render engines through plugins addons Blender itself can also be compiled imported as a python library for further automation and development br br br File format br Blender features an internal file system that can pack multiple scenes into a single blend file br br Most of Blender s blend files are forward backward and cross platform compatible with other versions of Blender with the following exceptions br Loading animations stored in post files in Blender pre This is due to the reworked animation subsystem introduced in Blender being inherently incompatible with older versions br Loading meshes stored in post This is due to the introduction of BMesh a more versatile mesh format br Blender blend files are no longer fully backward compatible causing errors when opened in previous versions br Many x blend files are not completely backwards compatible as well and may cause errors with previous versions br All scenes objects materials textures sounds images and post production effects for an entire animation can be packaged and stored in a single blend file Data loaded from external sources such as images and sounds can also be stored externally and referenced through either an absolute or relative file path Likewise blend files themselves can also be used as libraries of Blender assets br Interface configurations are retained in blend files br A wide variety of import export scripts that extend Blender capabilities accessing the object data via an internal API make it possible to interoperate with other D tools br Blender organizes data as various kinds of data blocks akin to glTF such as Objects Meshes Lamps Scenes Materials Images and so on An object in Blender consists of multiple data blocks for example what the user would describe as a polygon mesh consists of at least an Object and a Mesh data block and usually also a Material and many more linked together This allows various data blocks to refer to each other There may be for example multiple Objects that refer to the same Mesh and making subsequent editing of the shared mesh results in shape changes in all Objects using this Mesh Objects meshes materials textures etc can also be linked to other blend files which is what allows the use of blend files as reusable resource libraries br br br Import and export br The software supports a variety of D file formats for import and export among them Alembic D Studio DS FBX DXF SVG STL for D printing UDIM USD VRML WebM X D and OBJ br br br Deprecated features br br br Blender Game Engine br The Blender Game Engine was a built in real time graphics and logic engine with features such as collision detection a dynamics engine and programmable logic It also allowed the creation of stand alone real time applications ranging from architectural visualization to video games In April the engine was removed from the upcoming Blender release series due to updates and revisions to the engine lagging behind other game engines such as Unity and the open source Godot In the announcements the Blender team specifically mentioned the Godot engine as a suitable replacement for migrating Blender Game Engine users br br br Blender Internal br Blender Internal a biased rasterization engine and scanline renderer used in previous versions of Blender was also removed for the release in favor of the new EEVEE renderer a realtime physically based renderer br br br User interface br br br Commands br Most of the commands are accessible via hotkeys There are also comprehensive graphical menus Numeric buttons can be dragged to change their value directly without the need to aim at a particular widget as well as being set using the keyboard Both sliders and number buttons can be constrained to various step sizes with modifiers like the Ctrl and Shift keys Python expressions can also be typed directly into number entry fields allowing mathematical expressions to specify values br br br Modes br Blender includes many modes for interacting with objects the two primary ones being Object Mode and Edit Mode which are toggled with the Tab key Object mode is used to manipulate individual objects as a unit while Edit mode is used to manipulate the actual object data For example an Object Mode can be used to move scale and rotate entire polygon meshes and Edit Mode can be used to manipulate the individual vertices of a single mesh There are also several other modes such as Vertex Paint Weight Paint and Sculpt Mode br br br Workspaces br The Blender GUI builds its tiled windowing system on top of one or multiple windows provided by the underlying platform One platform window often sized to fill the screen is divided into sections and subsections that can be of any type of Blender s views or window types The user can define multiple layouts of such Blender windows called screens and switch quickly between them by selecting from a menu or with keyboard shortcuts Each window type s own GUI elements can be controlled with the same tools that manipulate the D view For example one can zoom in and out of GUI buttons using similar controls one zooms in and out in the D viewport The GUI viewport and screen layout are fully user customizable It is possible to set up the interface for specific tasks such as video editing or UV mapping or texturing by hiding features not used for the task br br br Development br br Since the opening of the source code Blender has experienced significant refactoring of the initial codebase and major additions to its feature set br Improvements include an animation system refresh a stack based modifier system an updated particle system which can also be used to simulate hair and fur fluid dynamics soft body dynamics GLSL shaders support in the game engine advanced UV unwrapping a fully recoded render pipeline allowing separate render passes and render to texture node based material editing and compositing and projection painting br Part of these developments was fostered by Google s Summer of Code program in which the Blender Foundation has participated since br Historically Blender has used Phabricator to manage its development but due to the announcement in that Phabricator would be discontinued the Blender Institute began work on migrating to another software in early After extensive debate on what software it should choose it was finally decided to migrate to Gitea The migration from Phabricator to Gitea is currently a work in progress br br br Blender br Official planning for the next major revision of Blender after the series began in the latter half of with potential targets including a more configurable UI dubbed Blender support for Physically based rendering PBR dubbed EEVEE for Extra Easy Virtual Environment Engine to bring improved realtime D graphics to the viewport allowing the use of C and C in the codebase moving to a newer version of OpenGL and dropping support for versions before and a possible overhaul of the particle and constraint systems Blender Internal renderer has been removed from Code Quest was a project started in April set in Amsterdam at the Blender Institute The goal of the project was to get a large development team working in one place in order to speed up the development of Blender By June the Code Quest project ended and on July the alpha version was completed Beta testing commenced on November and was anticipated to take until July Blender was released on July br br br Cycles X br On April the Blender Foundation announced the Cycles X project where they improved the Cycles architecture for future development Key changes included a new kernel removal of default tiled rendering replaced by progressive refine removal of branched path tracing and the removal of OpenCL support Volumetric rendering was also replaced with better algorithms Cycles X had only been accessible in an experimental branch until September when it was merged into the master build br br br Support br Blender is extensively documented on its website There are also a number of online communities dedicated to support such as the Blender Stack Exchange br br br Modified versions br Due to Blender s open source nature other programs have tried to take advantage of its success by repackaging and selling cosmetically modified versions of it Examples include IllusionMage DMofun DMagix and Fluid Designer the latter being recognized as Blender based br br br Use in industry br Blender started as an in house tool for NeoGeo a Dutch commercial animation company The first large professional project that used Blender was Spider Man where it was primarily used to create animatics and pre visualizations for the storyboard department br The French language film Friday or

drive innovation in Blender In response to the success of the first open movie project Elephants Dream in the Blender Foundation founded the Blender Institute to be in charge of additional projects with two projects announced at first Big Buck Bunny also known as Project Peach a furry and funny short open animated film project and Yo Frankie or Project Apricot an open game utilizing the Crystal Space game engine that reused some of the assets created for Big Buck Bunny br br br Elephants Dream Project Orange br br In September some of the most notable Blender artists and developers began working on a short film using primarily free software in an initiative known as the Orange Movie Project hosted by the Netherlands Media Art Institute NIMk The codename Orange about the fruit started the trend of giving each project a different fruity name The resulting film Elephants Dream premiered on March br br br Big Buck Bunny Project Peach br br On October a new team started working on a second open project Peach for the production of the short movie Big Buck Bunny This time however the creative concept was different Instead of the deep and mystical style of Elephants Dream things are more funny and furry according to the official site The movie had its premiere on April This later made its way to Nintendo DS s Nintendo Video in May br br br Yo Frankie Open Game Project Apricot br br Apricot was the project name for the production of a game based on the universe and characters of the Peach movie Big Buck Bunny using free software including the Crystal Space framework The
