Generative design is an iterative design process that uses software to generate outputs that fulfill a set of constraints iteratively adjusted by a designer Whether a human test program or artificial intelligence the designer algorithmically or manually refines the feasible region of the program s inputs and outputs with each iteration to fulfill evolving design requirements By employing computing power to evaluate more design permutations than a human alone is capable of the process is capable of producing an optimal design that mimics nature s evolutionary approach to design through genetic variation and selection The output can be images sounds architectural models animation and much more It is therefore a fast method of exploring design possibilities that is used in various design fields such as art architecture communication design and product design br Generative design has become more important largely due to new programming environments or scripting capabilities that have made it relatively easy even for designers with little programming experience to implement their ideas Additionally this process can create solutions to substantially complex problems that would otherwise be resource exhaustive with an alternative approach making it a more attractive option for problems with a large or unknown solution set It is also facilitated with tools in commercially available CAD packages Not only are implementation tools more accessible but also tools leveraging generative design as a foundation br br br Generative design in architecture br Generative design in architecture is an iterative design process that enables architects to explore a wider solution space with more possibility and creativity Architectural design has long been regarded as a wicked problem Compared with traditional top down design approach generative design can address design problems efficiently by using a bottom up paradigm that uses parametric defined rules to generate complex solutions The solution itself then evolves to a good if not optimal solution The advantage of using generative design as a design tool is that it does not construct fixed geometries but take a set of design rules that can generate an infinite set of possible design solutions The generated design solutions can be more sensitive responsive and adaptive to the problem br Generative design involves rule definition and result analysis which are integrated with the design process By defining parameters and rules the generative approach is able to provide optimized solution for both structural stability and aesthetics Possible design algorithms include cellular automata shape grammar genetic algorithm space syntax and most recently artificial neural network Due to the high complexity of the solution generated rule based computational tools such as finite element method and topology optimisation are more preferable to evaluate and optimise the generated solution The iterative process provided by computer software enables the trial and error approach in design and involves architects interfering with the optimisation process br Historical precedent work includes Antoni Gaud s Sagrada Fam lia which used rule based geometrical forms for structures and Buckminster Fuller s Montreal Biosphere where the rules to generate individual components is designed rather than the final product br More recent generative design cases include Foster and Partners Queen Elizabeth II Great Court where the tessellated glass roof was designed using a geometric schema to define hierarchical relationships and then the generated solution was optimized based on geometrical and structural requirement br br br See also br Computer art br Computer automated design br Feedback br Generative art br Parametric design br Procedural modeling br Random number generation br System dynamics br Topology optimization br br br br br br Further reading br Gary William Flake The Computational Beauty of Nature Computer Explorations of Fractals Chaos Complex Systems and Adaptation MIT Press ISBN br John Maeda Design by Numbers MIT Press ISBN br Krish Sivam A practical generative design method Computer Aided Design doi j cad br Celestino Soddu papers on Generative Design at Generative Art Design Papers C Soddu E Colabella
