title: Experience point
id: 215107
An experience point often abbreviated as exp or XP is a unit of measurement used in some tabletop role playing games RPGs and role playing video games to quantify a player character s life experience and progression through the game Experience points are generally awarded for the completion of missions overcoming obstacles and opponents and successful role playing br In many RPGs characters start as fairly weak and untrained When a sufficient amount of experience is obtained the character levels up achieving the next stage of character development Such an event usually increases the character s statistics such as maximum health magic and strength and may permit the character to acquire new abilities or improve existing ones Levelling up may also give the character access to more challenging areas or items br In some role playing games particularly those derived from Dungeons Dragons experience points are used to improve characters in discrete experience levels in other games such as GURPS and the World of Darkness games experience points are spent on specific abilities or attributes chosen by the player br In most games as the difficulty of the challenge increases the experience rewarded for overcoming it also increases As players gain more experience points the amount of experience needed to gain abilities typically increases Alternatively some games keep the number of experience points per level constant but progressively lower the experience gained for the same tasks as the character s level increases Thus as the player character strengthens from gaining experience they are encouraged to accept new tasks that are commensurate with their improved abilities in order to advance br br br History br The term experience point was introduced by Gary Gygax in the creation of Dungeons Dragons While games prior had similar systems that addressed character progression Gygax introduced the term to account for rewarding players from successful encounters The abbreviation to XP was suggested by Lawrence Schick one of the first hires into TSR Inc to help Gygax finish off the first manuals for the game s release Needing an abbreviation for experience point but EP already used as part of the currency system for electrum pieces Schick opted for XP which stuck with the game and picked up in other systems that featured character progression br br br Types br br br Level based progression br br In many role playing games such as games derived from Dungeons Dragons D D an accumulation of a sufficient number of experience points XP increases a character s level a number that represents a character s overall skill and experience To level or level up means to gain enough XP to reach the next level By gaining a level a character s abilities or stats will increase making the character stronger and able to accomplish more difficult tasks including safely battling stronger enemies gaining access to more powerful abilities such as spells or combat techniques and to make fix or disable more complex mechanical devices or resolve increasingly difficult social challenges br Typically levels are associated with a character class and many systems allow combinations of classes allowing a player to customize how their character develops br Some systems that use a level based experience system also incorporate the ability to purchase specific traits with a set amount of experience for example D D rd Edition bases the creation of magical items around a system of experience expenditure known as burning xp and also uses a system of feat selection which closely matches the advantages of systems such as GURPS or the Hero System The d System also introduced the concept of prestige classes which bundle sets of mechanics character development and requirements into a package which can be leveled like an ordinary class br Some games have a level cap or a limit of levels available For example in the online game RuneScape no player can currently get higher than level which needs a combined experience points to gain nor can any one skill gain more than million experiences Some games have a dynamic level cap where the level cap is dependent upon the levels of the average player so it gradually increases br br br Activity based progression br In some systems such as the classic tabletop role playing games Traveller Call of Cthulhu and Basic Role Playing and the role playing video games Dungeon Master Final Fantasy II The Elder Scrolls the SaGa series and Grandia series progression is based on increasing individual statistics skills rank and other features of the character and is not driven by the acquisition of general experience points The skills and attributes are made to grow through exercised use Some authors believe that activity based progression encourages tedious grinding processes like intentionally taking damage and attacking allied characters to increase health in Final Fantasy II br br br Free form advancement br br Free form advancement is used by many role playing systems including GURPS Hero System or the World of Darkness series It allows the player to select which skills to advance by allocating points Each character attribute is assigned a price to improve so for example it might cost a character points to raise an archery skill one notch points to raise overall dexterity by one or it might cost points to learn a new magic spell br Players are typically free to spend points however they choose which greatly increases the control that a player has over the character s development but also usually causes players to find that complexity increases as well Some games therefore simplify character creation and advancement by suggesting packages or templates of pre selected ability sets so for example a player could have their character become an investigator by purchasing a package deal which includes many skills and abilities rather than buying them each separately br br br Cash in advancement br A cash in experience advancement system uses experience points to purchase such character advancements as class levels skill points new skills feats or increasing saving throw bonuses or base attribute points each of which has a set cost in experience points with set limits on the maximum bonuses that can be purchased at a given time usually once per game session Once experience points are used thus they are spent and are erased from the character record or marked as spent and cannot be used again Final Fantasy XIII and Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay are examples of games that use a cash in advancement system br br br Hybrid systems br Some games use advancement systems which combine elements from two or more of the above types For example in the third edition of Dungeons Dragons whenever a level is gained in a character class it provides a number of skill points the exact number is calculated based on the class and the character s intelligence statistic which can be spent to raise various skills Character level generally the sum of a character s total levels in all classes is used to calculate how high skills can be raised when an ability score can be raised and when a character can gain new feats a class of special abilities which include special attacks proficiencies in various weapons and bonuses on the dice rolls used to determine the outcome of various actions and how many experience points are needed to advance in level In Ragnarok Online experience points are divided into two categories base experience and job experience Gaining base experience increases a character s base level which is used to calculate a character s maximum HP and SP increasing base level also provides points which can be spent to increase stats such as strength agility and intelligence Gaining job experience increases a character s job level each job level provides a skill point which can be spent in the job s skill tree to gain a new ability such as a spell special attack or passive bonus or improve an existing ability br br br Video games br Since many early role playing video games are derived from Dungeons Dragons most use a level based experience system br In many games characters must obtain a minimum level to perform certain actions such as wielding a particular weapon entering a restricted area or earning the respect of a non player character Some games use a system of character levels where higher level characters hold an absolute advantage over those of lower level In these games statistical character management is usually kept to a minimum Other games use a system of skill levels to measure advantages in terms of specific aptitudes such as weapon handling spell casting proficiency and stealthiness These games allow the players to customize their characters to a greater extent br Some games particularly among MUDs and MMORPGs place a limit on the experience a character gains from a single encounter or challenge to reduce the effectiveness of power leveling br br br Perks br br Perks are special bonuses that video game players can add to their characters to give special abilities The term refers to the general usage of perk as an abbreviation of perquisite Perks are permanent rather than temporary and are progressively unlocked through experience points The first video game to use the term perks to refer to such a mechanic was the role playing video game Fallout br Besides RPGs perks have been used in various other video games in recent times including first person shooters such as Call of Duty Modern Warfare Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Killing Floor as well as action games such as Metal Gear Online br br br Remorting br Remorting also known as rebirth ascending ascension reincarnating or new game plus is a game mechanic in some role playing games whereby once the player character reaches a specified level limit the player can elect to start over with a new version of the character The bonuses that are given are dependent on several factors which generally involve the stats of the character before the reincarnation occurs The remorting character generally loses all levels but gains an advantage that was previously unavailable usually access to different races avatars classes skills or otherwise inaccessible play areas within the game A symbol often identifies a remorted character br The term remort comes from MUDs in some of which players may become immortal characters administrative staff simply by advancing to the maximum level These users are generally expected to distance themselves from gameplay and interaction with players may be severely limited When an immortal chooses to vacate his or her position to resume playing the game usually from level one just as with any new character he or she is said to have remorted becoming mortal again br br br Grinding br br Grinding refers to the process of repeating one specific activity over and over This is done for example by repeatedly participating in challenges quests tasks and events which reward experience points for performing repetitive often menial challenges This definition can also be used in multi player games but it is typically displaced by a much more charged meaning A term intended to describe this style of play without pejorative connotation is optimization also known as XP farming br br br Power leveling br Power leveling is using the help of another stronger player to level a character more quickly than is possible alone br br br Sharing br Games that allow several characters participating in a single event such as battle or quest completion implement various methods of determining how and when experience gets shared between participants These methods include only last hitting character whose hit killed the enemy getting experience as in Fire Emblem series unconditionally sharing experience among characters as in D D system and giving experience based on each character s actions as in Final Fantasy Tactics In some online games it is possible to join a group and gain experience loot or other rewards while providing little or no contribution to the group This type of behaviour is referred to as leeching particularly when it is done without the permission of other group members In games which allow players to gain rewards by kill stealing this is also considered a form of leeching This is extremely common in games such as Dungeon Defenders in which all players receive the same rewards regardless of their contributions br br br Botting br br Some players of online games use automated programs known as bots to grind or leech for them in order to progress with minimal effort This practice often violates the terms of service Bots are also commonly used in commercial operations in order to powerlevel a character either to increase the sale value of the account or to allow the character to be used for commercial gold farming br br br See also br Grinding gaming br Virtual economy br Virtual world br br br br br br External links
