Mario is a character from the Mario franchise and the mascot of Japanese video game company Nintendo Created by video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto Mario is an Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom with his younger twin brother Luigi Their adventures generally involve rescuing Princess Peach from the villain Bowser while using power ups that give them different abilities br Mario first appeared as the player character of the platformer game Donkey Kong Originally Miyamoto wanted to use Popeye as the protagonist but was unable to acquire the licensing rights leading him to create Mario Many elements of Mario s design were due to the graphical limitations of arcade hardware such as a large nose a mustache to accentuate his nose and overalls to make his arms more identifiable Originally called Mr Video and Jumpman he was renamed Mario after Nintendo of America s landlord Mario Segale Following his appearance in Donkey Kong he would make cameo appearances in other video games before making his appearance in Super Mario Bros a Nintendo Entertainment System game that started the Super Mario series Charles Martinet voiced Mario from to before being succeeded by Kevin Afghani br After Super Mario Bros Mario began to branch off into different genres and has appeared in over video games since his creation These include puzzle games such as Dr Mario role playing games such as Paper Mario and Mario Luigi and sports games such as Mario Kart and Mario Tennis He has appeared in other Nintendo properties such as in the Super Smash Bros series of crossover fighting games Mario has also appeared in animated media including three series produced by DIC Entertainment voiced by Lou Albano and later Walker Boone He was portrayed by Bob Hoskins in the live action Super Mario Bros film in and voiced by Chris Pratt in The Super Mario Bros Movie in br An established pop culture icon Mario holds multiple Guinness World Records titles such as Most Prolific Video Game Character Longest running Computer Game Character and Godfather of gaming He has appeared in a variety of merchandise such as clothing and collectible items and people and places have been nicknamed after him He has inspired a considerable amount of unofficial media br br br Concept and creation br br Shigeru Miyamoto created Mario while developing Donkey Kong in an attempt to produce a successful video game for Nintendo previous games such as Sheriff had not achieved the success of games such as Namco s Pac Man Originally Miyamoto wanted to create a game that used the s characters Popeye Bluto and Olive Oyl At the time however as Miyamoto was unable to acquire a license to use the characters and would not until with Popeye he ended up creating an unnamed player character along with Donkey Kong and Lady later known as Pauline br In the early stages of Donkey Kong Mario was drawn using pixel dots in a x grid The focus of the game was to escape a maze while Mario did not have the ability to jump However Miyamoto soon introduced jumping capabilities for the player character reasoning that If you had a barrel rolling towards you what would you do Continuing to draw from s media King Kong served as an inspiration and Mario was set in New York City br br br Name br Though the protagonist was unnamed in the Japanese release of Donkey Kong he was named Jumpman in the game s English instructions and little Mario in the sales brochure Miyamoto envisioned a go to character he could use in any game he developed if needed albeit in cameo appearances as Miyamoto did not at the time expect the character to become singularly popular To this end he originally named the character Mr Video comparing what he intended for the character s appearances in later games to the cameos that Alfred Hitchcock had done within his films In retrospect Miyamoto commented that if he had named Mario Mr Video Mario likely would have disappeared off the face of the Earth br br According to a widely circulated story during the localization of Donkey Kong for American audiences Nintendo of America s warehouse landlord Mario Segale confronted then president Minoru Arakawa demanding back rent Following a heated argument in which the Nintendo employees eventually convinced Segale he would be paid they opted to name the character in the game Mario after him A friend of Mario Segale commented My direct understanding and perception is that Mario Segale doesn t mind at all the fact that his name inspired such an iconic character and that he shows humble pride in that fact in front of his grandchildren and close knit adult circles br While it is implied by the title of the Mario Bros series in a interview his full name was stated not to be Mario Mario The first notable use of Mario Mario was in the live action film adaptation of the Super Mario series and was further used in Prima s official video game strategy guides in for Mario Party and in for Mario Luigi Superstar Saga In after Mario voice actor Charles Martinet stated that the character s name was in fact Mario Mario at the San Diego Comic Con Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata said Mario had no last name with which Miyamoto agreed the month after Two months after Iwata s death in July Miyamoto changed his stance asserting at the Super Mario Bros th Anniversary festival that Mario s full name was indeed Mario Mario Mario can also be referred to as Super Mario when he acquires the Super Mushroom power up br br br Appearance and profession br By Miyamoto s own account Mario s profession was chosen to fit with the game design since Donkey Kong takes place on a construction site Mario was made into a carpenter and when he appeared again in Mario Bros it was decided that he should be a plumber because a lot of the game is situated in underground settings Mario s character design particularly his large nose draws on Western influences once he became a plumber Miyamoto decided to put him in New York and make him Italian light heartedly attributing Mario s nationality to his mustache Other sources have Mario s profession chosen to be carpentry in an effort to depict the character as an ordinary hard worker making it easier for players to identify with him After a colleague suggested that Mario more closely resembled a plumber Miyamoto changed Mario s profession accordingly and developed Mario Bros featuring the character in the sewers of New York City br Due to the graphical limitations of arcade hardware at the time Miyamoto clothed the character in red overalls and a blue shirt to contrast against each other and the background making the movements of his arms easily perceptible A red cap was added to let Miyamoto avoid drawing the character s hairstyle forehead and eyebrows as well as to circumvent the issue of animating his hair as he jumped To give distinctly human facial features with the limited graphical abilities Miyamoto drew a large nose and a mustache which avoided the need to draw a mouth and facial expressions Omitting a mouth circumvented the problem of clearly separating the nose from the mouth with a limited number of pixels available br Over time Mario s appearance has become more defined blue eyes white gloves brown shoes a red M in a white circle on the front of his hat and gold buttons on his overalls have been added According to an interview Japanese character designer Y ichi Kotabe who worked on redesigning characters in Super Mario Bros revealed that Mario s M on his hat was originally the resemblance of McDonald s logo Kotabe later changed the design of M and straightened its lines to clearly distinguish the difference The colors of his shirt and overalls were also reversed from a blue shirt with red overalls to a red shirt with blue overalls Miyamoto attributed this process to the different development teams and artists for each game as well as advances in technology br br br Voice acting br br Mario was voiced by Charles Martinet from to When he crashed the audition the directors were preparing to close for the night already packing up when he arrived He was prompted with an Italian plumber from Brooklyn when he heard the phrase he immediately thought of a stereotypical Italian accent with a voice similar to that of a mobster He then assumed the voice would be too harsh for children so he planned on using a voice of an older figure However according to Martinet the audition for Mario was the only time where his thoughts crashed and he spoke complete nonsense After he was prompted the character he babbled the following in a soft and friendly voice instead br br Hello ima Mario Okey dokey letsa make a pizza pie together you go get somea spaghetti you go geta some sausage I getta some sauce you gonna put some spaghetti on the sausage and the sausage on the pizza then I m gonna chasea you with the pizza then you gonna chasea me with the pizza and gonaa makea lasagne br The voice he chose was derived from another voice role he used to play the character Gremio from William Shakespeare s The Taming of the Shrew Martinet kept speaking with the voice until the audition tape ran out the clip was the only tape sent back to Nintendo and when the director called the company he said he found our Mario For the following years he would use the voice for an attraction at trade shows small tracking sensors were glued onto his face and he would voice a D model of Mario s head on a television while he remained hidden behind a curtain When attendees would approach the screen they could talk and interact with Mario The attraction was successful and would be used for five years until he was called by Miyamoto requesting that he use the voice for a video game br His first official video game voice role would be the CD rerelease of Mario Teaches Typing in but his first major voice acting role was Super Mario He received instructions on the types of sound clips needed from Miyamoto and Martinet appreciated the fun tone of the game and later called Miyamoto a genius He has since also continued to voice other various Mario characters such as Luigi Wario and Waluigi His time in the studio recording voice clips consisted of takes of every sound he can think of according to Martinet at a Q A in Canada What time he gives vocals for the game varies and according to him has ranged from three years before a game s release to one week The amount of clips varies as well ranging from one hour of audio to Martinet was recognized by the Guinness World Records for the most roles performed with the same character at the time one hundred and is the most of any video game voice actor As of January he has voiced Mario in over games and has recorded million audio files with the voice In an interview Martinet said he wants to continue voicing the character until he drops dead or until he can no longer perform the voice accurately In August Nintendo announced Martinet would be retiring from the voice role of Mario though he would continue to promote the franchise as a Mario Ambassador Voice actor Kevin Afghani succeeded Martinet in Super Mario Bros Wonder the following October br br br Characteristics br Mario is depicted as a portly plumber who lives in the fictional land of the Mushroom Kingdom with Luigi his younger taller brother The original Mario Bros depicted Mario and Luigi as Italians in New York with the television series and films specifying them as originating from the borough Brooklyn Mario s infancy in which he was transported by a stork to the Mushroom Kingdom was first depicted in Super Mario World Yoshi s Island In a interview Miyamoto stated that Mario s physical age was about years old and Nintendo Power stated that his birthday is October br He wears a long sleeved red shirt a pair of blue overalls with yellow buttons brown shoes white gloves and a red cap with a red M printed on a white circle In Donkey Kong he wore a pair of red overalls and a blue shirt In Super Mario Bros he wore a brown shirt with red overalls He has blue eyes and like Luigi has brown hair and a dark brown or black mustache This consistent difference in color is attributed to being a relic from designing the characters for their original platforms wherein certain features were actively distinguished while others had to be curtailed due to technical limitations br Mario s occupation is plumbing though in the original Donkey Kong games he is a carpenter Mario has also assumed several other occupations in the Dr Mario series of puzzle games which debuted in Mario is portrayed as a medical physician named Dr Mario in the Game Boy game Mario s Picross Mario is an archaeologist in Mario vs Donkey Kong March of the Minis Mario is the president of a profitable toy making company Mario is an athlete in Mario sports games in games such as tennis and golf as well as a kart racer in the Mario Kart series In September Nintendo confirmed on their official Japanese profile for the character that Mario was no longer considered a plumber but the statement was changed in March Although according to Nintendo Mario has seven careers which include plumber doctor racer martial artist basketball player baseball player and soccer player br Nintendo s characterization of Mario as a Brooklynite Italian American has been described as an example of mukokuseki or nationlessness with roots across the three continents of Europe North America and Japan br br br Relationships br Mario usually saves Princess Peach and the Mushroom Kingdom and purges antagonists such as Bowser from various areas since his first game Mario has usually had the role of saving the damsel in distress Originally he had to rescue his girlfriend Pauline in Donkey Kong from Donkey Kong Pauline was soon replaced by Princess Peach in Super Mario Bros although Pauline has reappeared in the Mario vs Donkey Kong series and is considered Mario s friend instead Mario reprises his role of saving Peach in the Super Mario series but Mario himself was rescued by Peach in role reversal in Super Princess Peach Mario rescued Princess Daisy of Sarasaland in Super Mario Land but Luigi has since been more linked to her in Super Smash Bros Melee the text explaining Daisy states that After her appearance in Mario Golf some gossips started portraying her as Luigi s answer to Mario s Peach br Luigi is Mario s younger fraternal twin brother who is taller slimmer and can jump higher than him He is a companion in the Mario games and the character whom the second player controls in two player sessions of many of the video games Luigi has also occasionally rescued Mario as seen in Mario Is Missing and the Luigi s Mansion series Super Mario Land Golden Coins for the Game Boy saw the arrival of Wario Mario s greedy counterpart and self declared arch rival who usually assumes the role of a main antagonist or an antihero The dinosaur character Yoshi serves as Mario s steed and sidekick in games such as Super Mario World Toad is Mario s trusted close friend who gives him advice and supports him throughout his journey to rescue Princess Peach br br br Abilities br During the development of Donkey Kong Mario was known as Jumpman Janpuman Jumping both to facilitate level traversal and as an offensive move is a common gameplay element in Mario games especially the Super Mario series By the time Super Mario RPG was released jumping became such a signature act of Mario that the player was often tasked with jumping to prove to non player characters that he was Mario Mario s most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies first used in Super Mario Bros This jump stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage and usually deal damage to larger ones sometimes causing secondary effects Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario s jumping related abilities Super Mario World added the ability to spin jump which allows Mario to break blocks beneath him In Super Mario Mario gains new jumping abilities such as a sideways somersault a ground pound which is a high impact downward thrusting motion and the Wall Kick which propels him upwards by kicking off walls br Super Mario Bros introduced the basic three power ups that have become staples for the series especially the D games the Super Mushroom a large red mushroom which causes Mario to grow larger and be able to survive getting hit once the Fire Flower which allows Mario to throw fireballs and the Super Star which gives Mario temporary invincibility These powers have appeared regularly throughout the series br br br In video games br br br Super Mario series br br Mario is the protagonist of the Super Mario series Each game varies in its plot but most of them have the ultimate goal of Mario rescuing Princess Peach after being kidnapped by Bowser Mario explores a variety of locations titled worlds and along the way he can collect items and defeat enemies Most levels have an end goal such as stars or flagpoles that he needs to reach to move on to the next The series is divided into two general sets of games the D side scrolling Super Mario games and the D open world Super Mario games br br br D games br The Super Mario series had Mario starring in platform games beginning with Super Mario Bros on the Nintendo Entertainment System NES in In these games Mario traverses worlds that contain a set number of levels for Mario to complete In them he traverses them from moving left to right the screen scrolling in the direction he moves Mario has the goal of reaching the end of the level to move onto the next typically marked with a flagpole These games are less focused on plot and more on platforming most commonly Bowser kidnaps Peach and Mario with the help of Luigi and other characters sets out to rescue her Most worlds have mini boss battles which typically involve fighting Bowser Jr or one of several Koopalings The final level is a fight against Bowser br br His first appearance in the D variant of the series was Super Mario Bros in which began with a x pixel rectangle prototype as the character Takashi Tezuka suggested the character to be Mario after the success of one of his previous roles Mario Bros Certain other gameplay concepts were cut as well such as how Mario could fly in a rocket ship and fire bullets Originally designed with a small Mario in mind with the intention of increasing his size further in development the developers implemented the feature of his size changes via power ups as they considered it a fun addition The concept was influenced by Japanese folktales br Super Mario Bros was originally not going to be a sequel to Super Mario Bros and was originally going to be a game called Doki Doki Panic directed by Kensuke Tanabe One of the changes included the retexturing of the four main playable characters of Doki Doki Panic and since they varied in height this was the first instance where Mario was noticeably shorter than Luigi Super Mario Bros experimented with Mario s looks with different power ups that represented different creatures An example included the raccoon tail which was chosen over a power up that represented a centaur The game s success led to an animated television series The Adventures of Super Mario Bros with Mario being portrayed by Walker Boone br Hiroshi Yamauchi wanted a launch game for the Game Boy that featured Mario as he believed in the statement fun games sold consoles Super Mario Land was designed without the help of Miyamoto a first for the series The game uses completely different elements to pair with the small screen due to the Game Boy s portability For example instead of rescuing Princess Peach from Bowser in the Mushroom Kingdom Mario is instead rescuing Princess Daisy from Tatanga in Sarasaland Mario was designed with line art br Super Mario World was the first video game to feature Yoshi as a companion to Mario Miyamoto had always wanted a dinosaur like companion ever since the original Super Mario Bros but the concept was never achievable due to limited hardware Since Super Mario World took place in a land of dinosaurs Takashi Tezuka requested Shigefumi Hino to draw a character based on Miyamoto s concepts and sketches which he drew during the development of Super Mario Bros Super Mario World was released during a console war between Nintendo and Sega Sega s mascot Sonic the Hedgehog was considered a cooler alternative to Mario to which Miyamoto apologized for br The plot for Super Mario Land Golden Coins has Mario pursue something for his own benefit rather than for someone else his goal trying to reclaim ownership of his island Mario Land from Wario The game was developed by Nintendo Research Development R D The company was unmotivated by the Super Mario series and when they were tasked with creating a Super Mario game without Miyamoto they created Wario to emphasize the frustration of working with a character they did not make The name Wario is word play of Mario and Warui the latter meaning bad in Japanese to mean bad Mario br The character s models and backgrounds in New Super Mario Bros were D but still only allowed for left and right movement and are considered D With the D series of Super Mario games being absent for years the previous installment being released in game mechanics improved drastically Since the characters were no longer sprites and the backdrops were not tile based the developers were nearly restrictionless new game mechanics such as Mario teetering off of trees and swinging on ropes were implemented New Super Mario Bros was the first D Super Mario game to use voice acting with Charles Martinet voicing Mario and Luigi It was followed by three games similar to New Super Mario Bros namely New Super Mario Bros Wii New Super Mario Bros and New Super Mario Bros U the latter of which being the first game to feature Mario in high definition graphics HD br Takashi Tezuka returned as a producer for the development of Super Mario Bros Wonder with Shiro Mouri as the director of the game The game introduces new items such as Wonder Flowers which are unique to each level The game director Shiro Mouri said that the game developers aimed to provide a stress free experience to the players by allowing them to move freely through the course In comparison to the previous D Super Mario games Mario s facial expressions are now more detailed and expressive br br br D games br br Most Super Mario games in D feature open world gameplay instead of being confined to only moving left and right Mario can move in any direction and the player can complete the level however they please The player chooses from one of the multiple objectives before entering a level and Mario is tasked with completing that goal which ultimately ends with an obtainable item such as a star These games feature a more complex narrative but most still have Mario rescuing a kidnapped Princess Peach from Bowser br Mario s debut D role was in Super Mario since the concept of D video games was still new at the time the developers knew they were helping to pave the way for future games and they were not restricted on what the standard game was like However when Yoshiaki Koizumi had to create a D model and animation of Mario he had no frame of reference and struggled with the task Koizumi stated how the whole concept was arguably tough but was overtaken by the enjoyment of innovating in a new field Mario s movement was among the top priorities in the game s development with his animation being tested long before the basic layout of the game s locations was in place Super Mario was one of the first games voiced by Charles Martinet and Mario s character model was made with the N World toolkit Mario s movements and animations were inspired by Arale Norimaki from Dr Slump a Japanese manga series br Super Mario Sunshine was the first Nintendo game after Satoru Iwata became the CEO of Nintendo succeeding Hiroshi Yamauchi The game s original concept did not feature Mario as the developers believed the role was too out of the ordinary for such a character Later on when they used a generic man for the role instead they believed having a realistic person alongside a character like Mario would cause incongruity and it was ultimately changed to Mario instead Mario s ally F L U D D was one of ten design options but was chosen because it fit the game s theme although it was not their favorite option in terms of looks br Super Mario Galaxy had Mario exploring a number of spherical planets which the developers at the time knew simply jumping on enemies would be difficult to perform They instead took advantage of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk having motion controls and gave Mario a spin attack where he knocked over the enemies via spinning To also balance the game s difficulty Mario was given fewer hit points br To create a sense of familiarity for Super Mario Odyssey various references to the Super Mario series were put in the game s environment For example Pauline was chosen to be a major aspect of the Metro Kingdom due to the kingdom representing the core of the game Mario was also given a variety of costumes to represent other smaller games such as the Mario s Picross series The development team found the most fun way to use the Joy Con controllers motion controls was to throw a hat and the gameplay was centered around Mario throwing his cap br Sunshine and Galaxy were re released on the Nintendo Switch in as part of the th anniversary of Super Mario Bros in the collection pack Super Mario D All Stars The games featured high definition graphics but were kept generally the same as their original counterparts br br br Other Super Mario games br There have also been a variety of Super Mario games starring Mario that do not have typical D or D platforming The Super Mario D series does have D gameplay but the stages are linear and do not allow for open world movement The Super Mario Maker games are a series of game creation systems where the player can create their own D Super Mario levels and play ones created by others Super Mario Run is a D platforming mobile game with other unnatural gameplay aspects br The main aspect of Super Mario D Land was bridging the aspects of D and D Super Mario games One of the issues brought up was how Mario looked too small in comparison to the large terrain and the small portable screen of the Nintendo DS so the game s camera system needed to be fixed to one position in certain occasions The game brought with it the Tanooki Tail power up which was originally introduced in Super Mario Bros and its existence was teased by the developers to the fans prior to its official announcement Concepts for Mario which included a skater outfit and a power up that would make Mario grow to a large size were cut br Super Mario D World on the Wii U included the Cat Mario power up which was implemented to help newcomers play the game and add new gameplay features such as climbing up walls Another power up was the Double Cherry which was added accidentally one of the developers added a second Mario into the game in error and found it humorous when both Marios were somehow controllable at the same time In also as part of the Super Mario Bros th anniversary Nintendo re released Super Mario D World on the Nintendo Switch with an additional mode Bowser s Fury br The developers of Super Mario Run were mainly inspired by speedrunners during development as they took note of how when they would try to beat a D Super Mario game as fast as possible they would never let go of the run button With this they made the core gameplay concept revolve around how Mario does not stop moving forward br br br Other Mario games br While the most prominent use of Mario has been directed toward the Super Mario series various spinoff series that split into numerous games covering various genres have also been released This includes genres such as role playing games RPGs puzzle games sports games and even educational games in the s br br br RPGs br br Mario has been the protagonist of various role playing video games RPGs beginning with Super Mario RPG on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES The developer of Super Mario RPG Yoshio Hongo for Square liked the character Mario and believed he would fit well in an RPG format He discussed the idea with Miyamoto and according to him the meeting went well The game was a critical and commercial success and led to two other spinoff RPG series starring the character Paper Mario and Mario Luigi br A sequel to Super Mario RPG was planned for the Nintendo The original developer Square had signed a deal with Sony to release Final Fantasy VII for the PlayStation so Nintendo had Intelligent Systems develop the game instead The new art designer Naohiko Aoyama changed every character to two dimensional to bring out cuter graphics compared to low polygon three dimensional graphics on the console In the Paper Mario games Mario is often aided by numerous allies who progress the story while Mario remains silent br Unlike Paper Mario both Mario and Luigi have voices in the Mario Luigi series and are voiced by Charles Martinet According to the developers the early games used character sprites the developers were generally inexperienced and did not know much about hardware at the time Once the Nintendo DS was released the developers had the chance to switch to dimensional graphics They decided to change the background and world design but chose to keep the characters as D renderings of D characters as they believed it made it easier to convey comedic expressions In they believed Mario took too much of the spotlight in the Mario franchise and they made Luigi the more story focused character in Mario Luigi Dream Team br br br Sports games br br Nintendo has explored a variety of sports games featuring Super Mario properties which include tennis golf baseball soccer kart racing and other miscellaneous br In the video game Golf although one of the two playable characters looks similar to that of him wearing red clothes and black pants he is never directly referred to be Mario In his look was changed in the re release of the Famicom Disk System to that more like the character and Nintendo later confirmed the character was Mario in a guide book of the game in marking his first sports video game appearance He then directly appeared in NES Open Tournament Golf in as one of two playable characters the other being Luigi along with a variety of other Mario characters with supporting roles The character sprites were designed by Eiji Aonuma his first project in graphical art design br After the unsuccessful attempt on the Virtual Boy with Mario s Tennis the first tennis game featuring Mario Nintendo gave licensing rights to Camelot Software Planning to develop a second Mario themed tennis game for the Nintendo Each character had a unique ability with Mario having an all around average set of skills to pair with his type of character This ideology was later continued in Mario Power Tennis br The Mario Kart franchise began with Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in early in development the game did not have any Mario themed elements A few months into the process the designers were testing how one character would look at another they had just passed They implemented Mario simply to see how he would look inside a kart and the original concept was scrapped entirely after they decided he looked better than the previous non defined characters Similar to the Mario Luigi series he appears as a sprite that turns in different angles br Mario Sonic at the Olympic Games is a crossover series of party and sports games featuring characters from the Mario franchise and the Sonic the Hedgehog series It includes different varieties of sports such as skateboarding fencing volleyball gymnastics and many others br br br Party games br br br Puzzle games br br Mario has also starred in a variety of multiple puzzle games but sometimes only makes an appearance and is not playable The first of which to release was Wrecking Crew designed by Yoshio Sakamoto Surprisingly in this game Mario can t jump because of hammer s weight After which three main series and a variety of spin offs were released starring him including Dr Mario Mario vs Donkey Kong and Mario Picross br The original game in the Dr Mario series also titled Dr Mario was designed by Takahiro Harada and had Mario assume the role of a doctor instead of a plumber His appearance and role have generally remained the same to celebrate his th anniversary in the series an bit rendering of his original appearance was made unlockable in the most recent game Dr Mario World Mario vs Donkey Kong is centered around Mini Marios wind up toys that resemble Mario The Mario s Picross series was an attempt by Nintendo to capitalize on the popularity of Mario and the success of puzzle games in Japan at the time Released in the game was popular and was followed by two sequels Super Mario Picross and Picross but the first game was only made available to American audiences in br Due to the abandonment of the SNES CD hardware in the s a project developed by Nintendo and Phillips as part of Nintendo s dissolving agreement with Philips they gave the licensing rights to Mario and The Legend of Zelda property to release games on the CD i Multiple games were developed by the inexperienced Fantasy Factory which included the puzzle game Hotel Mario in Via Animation Magic Hotel Mario had various cutscenes of Mario and Luigi which borrowed animation elements from Disney and J R R Tolkien Mario was voiced by Marc Graue as the game was released prior to Charles Martinet receiving the role of voicing the character br br br Educational games br br Due to the popularity of the Super Mario series various educational games starring the character were released and appealed to younger audiences These games had little involvement from Nintendo with the games releasing for the NES Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES and personal computers The last of the genres to release was Mario Teaches Typing in before the production of such games was discontinued br Mario is Missing is one of the only occasions where Mario himself was kidnapped and rescued by another character In the game Mario and Luigi approach Bowser to stop his plans but Mario is then captured Luigi traverses real world locations to follow after him solving trivia along the way A similar game was released without the help of Miyamoto Mario s Time Machine which starred Mario against Bowser instead Mario s Game Gallery has the player competing in various card and board games against Mario The game was Charles Martinet s first official voice acting role for Mario one year prior to Super Mario br For Mario Teaches Typing the head of Interplay Productions Brian Fargo saw the success of the typing game Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing and knew a character like Mario as the teacher would be appealing Pre dating Mario s Game Gallery Martinet did not voice Mario After release the concept was so successful it began a negative relationship between Fargo Les Crane the creator of Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing Mario Teaches Typing was released in which Martinet voiced Mario for When they were approved of creating Mario s Game Gallery another Mario themed education game was also released that was of poor quality so Miyamoto met with Fargo and halted production of any further education games using the character br br br Cameos br Apart from
