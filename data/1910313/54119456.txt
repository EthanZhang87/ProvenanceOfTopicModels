A gacha game Japanese Hepburn gacha g mu is a video game that implements the gacha toy vending machine mechanic Similar to loot boxes gacha games entice players to spend in game currency to receive a random in game item Some in game currency generally can be gained through game play and some by purchasing it from the game publisher using real world funds br Most gacha games are free to play F P mobile games br The gacha game model began to be widely used in the early s particularly in Japan Gacha mechanics have become an integral part of Japanese mobile game culture The game mechanism is also increasingly used in Chinese and Korean games as well as European and American games br Gacha games have been criticized for being addictive and are often compared to gambling due to the incentive to spend real world money on chance based rewards br br br Model br br br Price anchoring br A marketing practice where deals of a product are shown to the consumer so they perceive what they are buying as a good deal This is used in gacha as extra roll deals and virtual currency deals to get the consumer to buy more Studies show that consumers buy on the basis of the price of a single product and not all of the products prices combined which entrepreneurs take advantage of Customers only look at the price at hand of a product and compare that to the deal and not the sub charges of the product In mobile games this is used by a cheap product to set the anchor then the more expensive ones that shows deals making the player feel better for a purchase because they have more value br br br Intermittent rewards system br Makes the player more engaged by giving the player rewards intermediately throughout the game so that the player will work for these rewards in order to get what they desire Making the player either have to play to get these rewards or paying to get an advantage and getting the rewards without having to play An example of this is getting a free gacha pull by doing certain tasks in game br br br Near miss tactic br Showing the player rare items that they want so whenever the player does a gacha pull and does not get the desired item they would then want to spend more to obtain this item because they feel that they were close to getting it and that the next roll will get their targeted item When the player starts a roll it passes by the items in that banner then stops on the item the player obtained while teasing what items were next to or close to the item they got making the player feel as if they have missed the desired item br br br Fear of missing out FOMO br Some items are only available for a limited amount of time incentivizing players to directly purchase or otherwise obtain the item for an in game power advantage or bragging rights Limited time events can also condition players to consistently play the game out of fear missing an event or specific item Daily login rewards can encourage players to open the game each day in order to collect a specific daily reward br br br Rolling pulling br A gacha game will have collectable characters cards or other items Many of them are obtainable only through a gacha mechanic wherein the player exchanges in game currency for pulls or spins each pull yielding a random collectable drop The pulls are analogous to spins on a slot machine or roulette wheel br Some of the drops drop less frequently than others As such drops can often be categorized into rarity tiers Historically gacha games did not always share their droprates Those that did so were called open gacha and those that did not were closed gacha In many jurisdictions it is now legally required for the item rarities to be public information As such virtually all contemporary gacha games share this information br Between rarity and limited time availability drops players are incentivized to roll while their desired item is available br br br Spark Pity system br Some gacha models use an eventually guaranteed drop mechanic called pity or spark the player will be guaranteed a given drop after pulling for it a large number of times without success This mechanic by itself does not start at the beginning but rather at a fixed point Pity mechanics can be soft or hard Depending on the game these mechanics usually start at a designated pull count and at the very end for that matter Soft pity increases the probability slightly of getting a rare item with every pull counting up and recalculating the probability until the rare item is received while hard pity uses a counter to keep track of the number of pulls and automatically dispense or allow the item to be purchasable with in game currency after reaching a preset number of rolls br br br In game currency br Gacha games often feature several in game currencies with intricate conversion methods obscuring the actual value of non premium currencies While players can earn the premium currency during gameplay it is available in strictly limited amounts br br br Virtual item br Many kinds of virtual items can be in the loot table for a banner Gameplay units such as cards characters equippable gear or more abstract loot such as experience are all possible br br br Login and task rewards br In many games gacha rewards are essential for players to make progress in the game Players are generally given free or discounted gachas in low amounts on a regular schedule in exchange for logging in or doing in game tasks br br br Common mechanics br br br Banners br Banners are pools of available items characters loot cards etc that players can roll on Offered banners can be perpetually available or can have a limited duration Games generally have some of both with player retention efforts and in game advertising emphasizing the limited availability of some or all of the items in the latter br br br Limited banners br Sometimes these banners are limited such that specific prizes can only be obtained within a specific event time frame br br br Stamina br Stamina is a resource that is required for and consumed by core in game actions such as in a fighting oriented game beginning combat encounters It regenerates over time often only up to a cap It can typically be regenerated or gained instantly through some form of microtransaction or premium currency spending The name for this resource is usually different on a per game basis but stamina is typically the general term used for this type of currency in general across games br br br Variations br This is a list of game mechanics that may be used in a game s implementation of gacha mechanics Some mechanics are nearly or entirely obsolete due to regulatory requirements br br br Appeal br Game developers have praised gacha as a free to play monetization strategy Most developers that work primarily with free to play games recommend it be incorporated into the game starting with the concept for maximum monetization potential br It has been debated what makes gacha so addictive to so many players Proposed mechanisms include playing on the hunter gatherer instinct to collect items as well as the desire to complete a set effective use of the fear of missing out or simply the same mechanisms that drive gambling br The model of gacha has been compared to that of collectible trading card games as well as to gambling br An aspect of monetization commonly found in the financing of gacha games involves a model where a large part of the game s revenue comes from a very small proportion of players who spend an unusually large amount of money on gacha rolls essentially to subsidize the game for other players who may spend smaller amounts of money or even free to play players that spend no money at all The high spending players are often colloquially referred to as whales A player who is called a dolphin spends a moderate amount of money on microtransactions in mobile games A player who is called a minnow spends little to no money on microtransactions in mobile games br br br Criticism and controversy br br br Resemblance to gambling br Gacha games have faced significant criticism for their resemblance to gambling largely due to their reliance on chance based mechanics to acquire desirable in game items Studies in Europe and the United States indicate that a substantial portion of young players who engage in gacha games develop gambling like behaviors For instance research has shown that over of juveniles who participate in gacha games exhibit some gambling tendencies with around developing problematic habits and showing early signs of gambling addiction br The gacha industry has been accused of exploiting addictive behaviors with a notable percentage of players being students who spend considerable amounts of money on these games despite lacking a steady income The European Union Parliament has taken steps to regulate gacha mechanics to protect consumers citing the exploitative nature of these games Some countries such as Belgium have banned loot boxes altogether while others like China require companies to disclose the probabilities of obtaining specific items br Players with existing gambling problems are particularly vulnerable to spending excessive amounts of money on gacha games This is exacerbated by the absence of spending limits which can lead to significant financial losses Reports indicate that around of revenue from gacha and loot box mechanics comes from players at moderate to high risk for gambling addiction br Despite the controversy gacha games are not universally considered gambling For example the UK s legal framework does not classify gacha as gambling since the virtual items obtained do not have real world monetary value However the Netherlands Gambling Authority and the Belgium Gaming Commission view gacha as gambling due to its reliance on chance and the potential for items to be traded for real money on third party sites br The addictive nature of gacha games can be attributed to the brain s positive response to randomness and surprise The anticipation of obtaining a rare or desirable item can create a sense of excitement similar to that experienced in traditional gambling While some gacha games are criticized for being pay to win not all are inherently exploitative The impact on players largely depends on how the developers implement the gacha mechanics and whether they are essential for game progression or merely provide optional enhancements br In response to growing concerns some jurisdictions have implemented regulations requiring transparency in drop rates and banning particularly exploitative practices Nevertheless gacha games continue to be a lucrative business model generating substantial revenue and sparking ongoing debates about their ethical implications and resemblance to gambling br br br See also br List of gacha games br br br
