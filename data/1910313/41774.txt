Systems design interfaces and data for an electronic control system to satisfy specified requirements Systems design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development There is some overlap with the disciplines of systems analysis systems architecture and systems engineering br br br Overview br If the broader topic of product development blends the perspective of marketing design and manufacturing into a single approach to product development then design is the act of taking the marketing information and creating the design of the product to be manufactured Systems design is therefore the process of defining and developing systems to satisfy specified requirements of the user br The basic study of system design is the understanding of component parts and their subsequent interaction with one another br br br Physical design br The physical design relates to the actual input and output processes of the system This is explained in terms of how data is input into a system how it is verified authenticated how it is processed and how it is displayed br In physical design the following requirements about the system are decided br br Input requirement br Output requirements br Storage requirements br Processing requirements br System control and backup or recovery br Put another way the physical portion of system design can generally be broken down into three sub tasks br br User Interface Design br Data Design br Process Design br br br Web System design br Online websites such as Google Twitter Facebook Amazon and Netflix are used by millions of users worldwide A scalable highly available system must be designed to accommodate an increasing number of users Here are the things to consider in designing the system br br Functional and non functional requirements br Capacity estimation br Database to use Relational or NoSQL br Vertical scaling Horizontal scaling Shard br Load Balancing br Primary secondary Replication br Cache and CDN br Stateless and Stateful servers br Datacenter georouting br Message Queue Publish Subscribe Architecture br Performance Metrics Monitoring and Logging br Build test configure deploy automation br Finding single point of failure br API Rate Limiting br Service Level Agreement br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br Bentley Lonnie D Kevin C Dittman and Jeffrey L Whitten System analysis and design methods br C West Churchman The Design of Inquiring Systems Basic Concepts of Systems and Organization New York Basic Books ISBN br William Gosling The design of engineering systems New York Wiley br Hawryszkiewycz Igor T Introduction to system analysis and design Prentice Hall PTR br Levin Mark Sh Modular system design and evaluation Springer br Maier Mark W Rechtin Eberhardt The Art of System Architecting Second ed Boca Raton CRC Press br J H Saltzer D P Reed D D Clark November End to end arguments in system design PDF ACM Transactions on Computer Systems doi ISSN S CID Wikidata Q br Ulrich Karl T Eppinger Steven D Product Design and Development Second ed Boston Irwin McGraw Hill br Whitten Jeffrey L Bentley Lonnie D Dittman Kevin C Fundamentals of system analysis and design methods br br br External links br br Interactive System Design Course by Chris Johnson br Course by Prof Birgit Weller
