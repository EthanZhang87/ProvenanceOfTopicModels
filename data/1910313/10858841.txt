title: Video game content rating system
id: 10858841
A video game content rating system is a system used for the classification of video games based on suitability for target audiences Most of these systems are associated with and or sponsored by a government and are sometimes part of the local motion picture rating system The utility of such ratings has been called into question by studies that publish findings such as of teenagers claim that their parents never check the ratings before allowing them to rent or buy video games and as such calls have been made to fix the existing rating systems Video game content rating systems can be used as the basis for laws that cover the sales of video games to minors such as in Australia Rating checking and approval is part of the game localization when they are being prepared for their distribution in other countries or locales These rating systems have also been used to voluntarily restrict sales of certain video games by stores such as the German retailer Galeria Kaufhof s removal of all video games rated by the USK following the Winnenden school shooting br br br Comparison table br A comparison of current video game rating systems showing age on the horizontal axis Note

games have been the subject of argument between leading professionals and restriction and prohibition Often these bouts of criticism come from use of debated topics such as video game graphic violence virtual sex violent and gory scenes partial or full nudity drug use portrayal of criminal behavior or other provocative and objectionable material br Video games have also been studied for links to addiction and aggression A meta analysis of studies from both eastern and western countries yielded evidence that strongly suggests that exposure to violent video games is a causal risk factor for increased aggressive behavior aggressive cognition and aggressive affect and for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior br There are also groups that have argued to the contrary that few if any scientifically proven studies exist to back up these claims and that the video game industry has become an easy target for the media to blame for many contemporary issues Researchers have also proposed potential positive effects of video games on aspects of social and cognitive development and psychological well being It has been shown that action video game players have better hand eye coordination and visuo motor skills such as their resistance to distraction their sensitivity to information in the peripheral vision and their ability to count briefly presented objects than non
