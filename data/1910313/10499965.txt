title: Immersion (virtual reality)
id: 10499965
In virtual reality VR immersion is the perception of being physically present in a non physical world The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images sound or other stimuli that provide an engrossing total environment br br br Etymology br The name is a metaphoric use of the experience of submersion applied to representation fiction or simulation Immersion can also be defined as the state of consciousness where a visitor Maurice Benayoun or immersant Char Davies has their awareness of their physical self transformed by being surrounded in an artificial environment The term is used to describe partial or complete suspension of disbelief enabling action or reaction to stimulations encountered in a virtual or artistic environment The greater the suspension of disbelief the greater the degree of presence achieved br br br Types br According to Ernest W Adams immersion can be separated into three main categories br br Tactical immersion Tactical immersion is experienced when performing tactile operations that involve skill Players feel in the zone while perfecting actions that result in success br Strategic immersion Strategic immersion is more cerebral and is associated with mental challenge Chess players experience strategic immersion when choosing a correct solution among a broad array of possibilities br Narrative immersion Narrative immersion occurs when players become invested in a story and is similar to what is experienced while reading a book or watching a movie br Staffan Bj rk and Jussi Holopainen in Patterns In Game Design divide immersion into similar categories but call them sensory motoric immersion cognitive immersion and emotional immersion respectively In addition to these they add a new category spatial immersion which occurs when a player feels the simulated world is perceptually convincing The player feels that he or she is really there and that a simulated world looks and feels real br br br Presence br br Presence a term derived from the shortening of the original telepresence is a phenomenon enabling people to interact with and feel connected to the world outside their physical bodies via technology It is defined as a person s subjective sensation of being there in a scene depicted by a medium usually virtual in nature Most designers focus on the technology used to create a high fidelity virtual environment however the human factors involved in achieving a state of presence must be taken into account as well It is the subjective perception although generated by and or filtered through human made technology that ultimately determines the successful attainment of presence br Virtual reality glasses can produce a visceral feeling of being in a simulated world a form of spatial immersion called Presence According to Oculus VR the technology requirements to achieve this visceral reaction are low latency and precise tracking of movements br Michael Abrash gave a talk on VR at Steam Dev Days in According to the VR research team at Valve all of the following are needed to establish presence br br A wide field of view degrees or better br Adequate resolution p or better br Low pixel persistence ms or less br A high enough refresh rate Hz Hz is enough but less may be adequate br Global display where all pixels are illuminated simultaneously rolling display may work with eye tracking br Optics at most two lenses per eye with trade offs ideal optics not practical using current technology br Optical calibration br Rock solid tracking translation with millimeter accuracy or better orientation with quarter degree accuracy or better and volume of meter or more on a side br Low latency ms motion to last photon ms may be good enough br br br Immersive media and technology br Immersive media is a term applied to a group of concepts variously defined which may have application in fields such as engineering media healthcare education and retail Concepts included in immersive media are br br Virtual reality VR br Augmented reality AR br Mixed reality MR br Extended reality XR br Metaverse br D content br br br Technology br br Immersive virtual reality is a technology that aims to completely immerse the user inside the computer generated world giving the impression to the user that they have stepped inside the synthetic world This is achieved by either using the technologies of Head Mounted Display HMD or multiple projections HMD allows VR to be projected right in front of the eyes and allows users to focus on it without any distraction The earliest attempts at developing immersive technology date back to the s Without these early attempts the world of immersive technology would never have reached its advanced technological state we have today The many elements that surround the realm of immersive technology all come together in different ways to create different types of immersive technology including virtual reality and pervasive gaming While immersive technology has already had an immense impact on our world its progressive growth and development will continue to make lasting impacts among our technological culture br br br Origin br One of the first devices that was designed to look like and function as a virtual reality headset was called a stereoscope It was invented in the s during the early days of photography and it used a slightly different image in each eye to create a kind of D effect Although as photography continued to develop in the late s stereoscopes became more and more obsolete Immersive technology became more available to the people in when Morton Heilig invented the Sensorama cinematic experience that included speakers fans smell generators and a vibrating chair to immerse the viewer in the movie When one imagines the VR headsets they see today they must give credit to The Sword of Damocles which was invented in and allowed users to connect their VR headsets to a computer rather than a camera In Sega launched the Sega VR headset which was made for arcade home use but only the arcade version was released due to technical difficulties Augmented reality began to rapidly develop within the s when Louis Rosenberg created Virtual Fixtures which was the first fully immersive augmented reality system used for the Air Force The invention enhanced operator performance of manual tasks in remote locations by using two robot controls in an exoskeleton The first introduction of augmented reality displayed to a live audience was in when the NFL first displayed a virtual yellow line to represent the line of scrimmage first down In Hirokazu Kato developed the ARToolkit which was an open source library for the development of AR applications This allowed people to experiment with AR and release new and improved applications Later in Esquire s magazine was the first to use a QR code on the front of their magazine to provide additional content Once The Oculus came out in it revolutionized virtual reality and eventually raised million dollars and began releasing their pre production models to developers Facebook purchased Oculus for billion dollars in which showed the world the upward trajectory of VR In Google announced their plans to develop their first AR headset Google Glass The production stopped in due to privacy concerns but relaunched in exclusively for the enterprise In Pok mon Go took the world by storm and became one of the most downloaded apps of all time It was the first augmented reality game that was accessible through ones phone br br br Elements of immersive technology br br A full immersive technology experience happens when all elements of sight sound and touch come together A true immersive experience needs to be done with either virtual reality or augmented reality as these two types utilize all of these elements Interactivity and connectivity is the entire focus of immersive technology It is not placing someone in an entirely different environment it is when they are virtually presented with a new environment and are given the opportunity to learn how to optimally live and interact with it br br br Types of immersive technology br Virtual reality is the primary source of immersive technology that allows the user to be completely immersed in a fully digital environment that replicates another reality Users must use a headset hand controls and headphones in order to have a fully immersive experience where one is able to utilize movements reflects There are also pervasive games which utilize real world locations within game play This is when the user s interaction on a virtual game lead to them interacting in real life Some of these games may require users to physically meet up in order to complete stages The gaming world has developed a series of popular virtual reality video games such as Vader Immortal Trover Saves the Universe and No Man s Sky The world of immersive technology has many facets that will continue to develop expand over time br br br Immersive technology today br Immersive technology has grown immensely in the past few decades and is continuing to progress VR has even been described as the learning aid of the st century Head mounted displays HMD is what allows users to get the full immersive experience The HMD market is expected to be worth over billion USD by the year The technologies of VR and AR received a boost in attention when Mark Zuckerberg founder creator of Facebook bought Oculus for billion USD in Recently the Oculus quest was released which is wireless and allows users to move more freely It costs around USD which is around the same price as the previous generation headsets with cables Other massive corporations such as Sony Samsung HTC are also making huge investments into VR AR In regards to education there are currently many researchers who are exploring the benefits and applications of virtual reality in the classroom However there is little systemic work that currently exists regarding how researchers have applied immersive VR for higher education purposes using HMD s The most popular use of immersive technology comes in the world of video games Completely immersing users into their favorite game HMD s have allowed individuals to experience the realm of video games in an entirely new light Current video games such as Star Wars Squadron Half Life Alyx and No Man s Sky are giving users the ability to experience every aspect of the digital world in their game While there is still a lot to learn about immersive technology and what it has to offer it has come an entirely long way from its beginning on the early s br br br Components br br br Perception br Hardware technologies are developed to stimulate one or more of the senses to create perceptually real sensations Some vision technologies are D displays fulldomes head mounted displays and holography Some auditory technologies are D audio effects high resolution audio and surround sound Haptic technology simulates tactile responses br br br Interaction br Various technologies provide the ability to interact and communicate with the virtual environment including brain computer interfaces gesture recognition omnidirectional treadmills and speech recognition br br br Software br Software interacts with the hardware technology to render the virtual environment and process the user input to provide dynamic real time response To achieve this software often integrates components of artificial intelligence and virtual worlds This is done differently depending on the technology and environment Whether the software needs to create a fully immersive environment or display a projection on the already existing environment the user is looking at br br br Research and development br Many universities have programs that research and develop immersive technology Examples are Stanford s Virtual Human Interaction Lab USC s Computer Graphics and Immersive Technologies Lab Iowa State Virtual Reality Applications Center University of Buffalo s VR Lab Teesside University s Intelligent Virtual Environments Lab Liverpool John Moores University s Immersive Story Lab University of Michigan Ann Arbor Oklahoma State University and the University of Southern California All of these universities and more are researching the advancement of the technology along with the different uses that VR could be applied to br As well universities the video game industry has received a massive boost from immersive technology specifically Augmented reality The company Epic games known for their popular game Fortnite generated billion dollars in a round of investing in as they have a leading D development platform for AR apps The U S Government requests information for immersive technology development and funds specific projects This is for implementation in government branches in the future br br br Application br br Immersive technology is applied in several areas including retail and e commerce the adult industry art entertainment and video games and interactive storytelling military education and medicine It is also growing in the Non profit industry in fields such as disaster relief and conservation due to its ability to put a user in a situation that would elicit more of a real world experience than just a picture giving them a stronger emotional connection to the situation they would be viewing As immersive technology becomes more mainstream it will likely pervade other industries Also with the legalization of cannabis happening worldwide the cannabis industry has seen a large growth in the immersive technology market to allow virtual tours of their facilities to engage potential customers and investors br br br Concerns and ethics br The potential perils of immersive technology have often been portrayed in science fiction and entertainment Movies such as eXistenZ The Matrix and the short film Play by David Kaplan and Eric Zimmerman raise questions about what may happen if we are unable to distinguish the physical world from the digital world As the world of immersive technology becomes deeper and more intense this will be a growing concern for consumers and governments alike as to how to regulate this industry Because all these technology is immersive and therefore not taking place in real life the application and or problems that come with the developing industry are something to keep an eye on For example Legal systems debate on topics of virtual crime and whether it is ethical to permit illegal behavior such as rape in a simulated environment this is relative to the adult industry art entertainment and video games industries br br br Immersive virtual reality br br Immersive virtual reality is a hypothetical future technology that exists today as virtual reality art projects for the most part It consists of immersion in an artificial environment where the user feels just as immersed as they usually feel in everyday life br br br Direct interaction of the nervous system br The most considered method would be to induce the sensations that made up the virtual reality in the nervous system directly In functionalism conventional biology we interact with everyday life through the nervous system Thus we receive all input from all the senses as nerve impulses It gives your neurons a feeling of heightened sensation It would involve the user receiving inputs as artificially stimulated nerve impulses the system would receive the CNS outputs natural nerve impulses and process them allowing the user to interact with the virtual reality Natural impulses between the body and central nervous system would need to be prevented This could be done by blocking out natural impulses using nanorobots which attach themselves to the brain wiring whilst receiving the digital impulses of which describe the virtual world which could then be sent into the wiring of the brain A feedback system between the user and the computer which stores the information would also be needed Considering how much information would be required for such a system it is likely that it would be based on hypothetical forms of computer technology br br br Requirements br Understanding of the nervous system br A comprehensive understanding of which nerve impulses correspond to which sensations and which motor impulses correspond to which muscle contractions will be required This will allow the correct sensations in the user and actions in the virtual reality to occur The Blue Brain Project is the current most promising research with the idea of understanding how the brain works by building very large scale computer models br br Ability to manipulate CNS br The central nervous system would obviously need to be manipulated Whilst non invasive devices using radiation have been postulated invasive cybernetic implants are likely to become available sooner and be more accurate br Molecular nanotechnology is likely to provide the degree of precision required and could allow the implant to be built inside the body rather than be inserted by an operation br br Computer hardware software to process inputs outputs br A very powerful computer would be necessary for processing virtual reality complex enough to be nearly indistinguishable from everyday life and interacting with central nervous system fast enough br br br Immersive digital environments br br An immersive digital environment is an artificial interactive computer created scene or world within which a user can immerse themselves br Immersive digital environments could be thought of as synonymous with virtual reality but without the implication that actual reality is being simulated An immersive digital environment could be a model of reality but it could also be a complete fantasy user interface or abstraction as long as the user of the environment is immersed within it The definition of immersion is wide and variable but here it is assumed to mean simply that the user feels like they are part of the simulated universe The success with which an immersive digital environment can actually immerse the user is dependent on many factors such as believable D computer graphics surround sound interactive user input and other factors such as simplicity functionality and potential for enjoyment New technologies are currently under development which claim to bring realistic environmental effects to the players environment effects like wind seat vibration and ambient lighting br br br Perception br To create a sense of full immersion the senses sight sound touch smell taste must perceive the digital environment to be physically real Immersive technology can perceptually fool the senses through br br Panoramic D displays visual br Surround sound acoustics auditory br Haptics and force feedback tactile br Smell replication olfactory br Taste replication gustation br br br Interaction br Once the senses reach a sufficient belief that the digital environment is real it is interaction and involvement which can never be real the user must then be able to interact with the environment in a natural intuitive manner Various immersive technologies such as gestural controls motion tracking and computer vision respond to the user s actions and movements Brain control interfaces BCI respond to the user s brainwave activity br br br Examples and applications br Training and rehearsal simulations run the gamut from part task procedural training often buttonology for example which button do you push to deploy a refueling boom through situational simulation such as crisis response or convoy driver training to full motion simulations which train pilots or soldiers and law enforcement in scenarios that are too dangerous to train in actual equipment using live ordinance br Video games from simple arcade to massively multiplayer online game and training programs such as flight and driving simulators Entertainment environments such as motion simulators that immerse the riders players in a virtual digital environment enhanced by motion visual and aural cues Reality simulators such as one of the Virunga Mountains in Rwanda that takes you on a trip through the jungle to meet a tribe of mountain gorillas Or training versions such as one which simulates taking a ride through human arteries and the heart to witness the buildup of plaque and thus learn about cholesterol and health br In parallel with scientists artists like Knowbotic Research Donna Cox Rebecca Allen Robbie Cooper Maurice Benayoun Char Davies and Jeffrey Shaw use the potential of immersive virtual reality to create physiologic or symbolic experiences and situations br Other examples of immersion technology include physical environment immersive space with surrounding digital projections and sound such as the CAVE and the use of virtual reality headsets for viewing movies with head tracking and computer control of the image presented so that the viewer appears to be inside the scene The next generation is VIRTSIM which achieves total immersion through motion capture and wireless head mounted displays for teams of up to thirteen immersants enabling natural movement through space and interaction in both the virtual and physical space simultaneously br br br Use in medical care br New fields of studies linked to immersive virtual reality emerge every day Researchers see a great potential in virtual reality tests serving as complementary interview methods in psychiatric care br Immersive virtual reality have in studies also been used as an educational tool in which the visualization of psychotic states have been used to get increased understanding of patients with similar symptoms New treatment methods are available for schizophrenia and other newly developed research areas where immersive virtual reality is expected to achieve melioration is in education of surgical procedures rehabilitation program from injuries and surgeries and reduction of phantom limb pain br br br Applications in the built environment br In the domain of architectural design and building science immersive virtual environments are adopted to facilitate architects and building engineers to enhance the design process through assimilating their sense of scale depth and spatial awareness Such platforms integrate the use of virtual reality models and mixed reality technologies in various functions of building science research construction operations personnel training end user surveys performance simulations and building information modeling visualization Head mounted displays with both degrees of freedom and degrees of freedom systems and CAVE platforms are used for spatial visualization and building information modeling BIM navigations for different design and evaluation purposes Clients architects and building owners use derived applications from game engines to navigate scale BIM models allowing a virtual walkthrough experience of future buildings For such use cases the performance improvement of space navigation between virtual reality headsets and D desktop screens has been investigated in various studies with some suggesting significant improvement in virtual reality headsets while others indicate no significant difference Architects and building engineers can also use immersive design tools to model various building elements in virtual reality CAD interfaces and apply property modifications to building information modeling BIM files through such environments br In the building construction phase immersive environments are used to improve site preparations on site communication and collaboration of team members safety and logistics For training of construction workers virtual environments have shown to be highly effective in skill transfer with studies showing similar performance results to training in real environments Moreover virtual platforms are also used in the operation phase of buildings to interact and visualize data with Internet of Things IoT devices available in buildings process improvement and also resource management br Occupant and end user studies are performed through immersive environments Virtual immersive platforms engage future occupants in the building design process by providing a sense of presence to users with integrating pre construction mock ups and BIM models for the evaluation of alternative design options in the building model in a timely and cost efficient manner Studies conducting human experiments have shown users perform similarly in daily office activities object identification reading speed and comprehension within immersive virtual environments and benchmarked physical environments In the field of lighting virtual reality headsets have been used investigate the influence of fa ade patterns on the perceptual impressions and satisfaction of a simulated daylit space Moreover artificial lighting studies have implemented immersive virtual environments to evaluate end users lighting preferences of simulated virtual scenes with the controlling of the blinds and artificial lights in the virtual environment br For structural engineering and analysis immersive environments enable the user to focus on structural investigations without getting too distracted to operate and navigate the simulation tool Virtual and augmented reality applications have been designed for finite element analysis of shell structures Using stylus and data gloves as input devices the user can create modify mesh and specify boundary conditions For a simple geometry real time color coded results are obtained by changing loads on the model Studies have used artificial neural networks ANN or approximation methods to achieve real time interaction for the complex geometry and to simulate its impact via haptic gloves Large scale structures and bridge simulation have also been achieved in immersive virtual environments The user can move the loads acting on the bridge and finite element analysis results are updated immediately using an approximate module br br br Detrimental effects br Simulation sickness or simulator sickness is a condition where a person exhibits symptoms similar to motion sickness caused by playing computer simulation video games Oculus Rift is working to solve simulator sickness br Motion sickness due to virtual reality is very similar to simulation sickness and motion sickness due to films In virtual reality however the effect is made more acute as all external reference points are blocked from vision the simulated images are three dimensional and in some cases stereo sound that may also give a sense of motion Studies have shown that exposure to rotational motions in a virtual environment can cause significant increases in nausea and other symptoms of motion sickness br Other behavioural changes such as stress addiction isolation and mood changes are also discussed to be side effects caused by immersive virtual reality br br br See also br br br br
