TRIZ Russian romanized teoriya resheniya izobretatelskikh zadach lit theory of inventive problem solving combines an organized systematic method of problem solving with analysis and forecasting techniques derived from the study of patterns of invention in global patent literature The development and improvement of products and technologies in accordance with TRIZ are guided by the laws of technical systems evolution Its development by Soviet inventor and science fiction author Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues began in In English TRIZ is typically rendered as the theory of inventive problem solving br TRIZ developed from a foundation of research into hundreds of thousands of inventions in many fields to produce an approach which defines patterns in inventive solutions and the characteristics of the problems these inventions have overcome The research has produced three findings br br Problems and solutions are repeated across industries and sciences br Patterns of technical evolution are replicated in industries and sciences br The innovations have scientific effects outside the field in which they were developed br TRIZ applies these findings to create and improve products services and systems br br br History br TRIZ was developed by the Soviet inventor and science fiction writer Genrich Altshuller and his associates Altshuller began developing TRIZ in while working in the inventions inspection department of the Caspian Sea flotilla of the Soviet Navy His job was to help initiate invention proposals to rectify and document them and to prepare applications to the patent office Altshuller realized that a problem requires an inventive solution if there are technical contradictions improving one parameter negatively affects another br His work on what later became TRIZ was interrupted in by his arrest and year sentence to the Vorkuta Gulag The arrest was partially triggered by letters he and Raphael Shapiro sent to Stalin ministers and newspapers about Soviet government decisions they considered erroneous Altshuller and Shapiro were freed during the Khrushchev Thaw which followed Stalin s death in and they returned to Baku The first paper on TRIZ On the psychology of inventive creation was published in in the Issues in Psychology Voprosi Psichologii journal br Altshuller observed clever and creative people at work discovering patterns in their thinking with which he developed thinking tools and techniques The tools included Smart Little People and Thinking in Time and Scale or the Screens of Talented Thought br In Altshuller s attention shifted from technical TRIZ to the development of individual creativity He developed a version of TRIZ for children which was tried in several schools After the Cold War emigrants from the former Soviet Union brought TRIZ to other countries br br br Principles br br One tool which evolved as an extension of TRIZ was a contradiction matrix The ideal final result IFR is the ultimate solution of a problem when the desired result is achieved by itself br Altshuller screened patents to discover which contradictions were resolved or eliminated by the invention and how this had been achieved He developed a set of inventive principles and later a matrix of contradictions Although TRIZ was developed from analyzing technical systems it has been used to understand and solve management problems The German based nonprofit European TRIZ Association founded in hosts conferences with publications br br br Use in industry br Samsung has invested in embedding TRIZ throughout the company br BAE Systems and GE also use TRIZ Mars has documented how TRIZ led to a new patent for chocolate packaging It has been used by Leafield Engineering Smart Stabilizer Systems and Buro Happold to solve problems and generate new patents br The automakers Rolls Royce Ford and Daimler Chrysler Johnson Johnson aeronautics companies Boeing NASA technology companies Hewlett Packard Motorola General Electric Xerox IBM LG Samsung Intel Procter Gamble Expedia and Kodak have used TRIZ methods in projects br TOP TRIZ is a modern version of developed and integrated TRIZ methods TOP TRIZ includes further development of problem formulation and problem modeling development of Standard Solutions into Standard Techniques further development of ARIZ and Technology Forecasting TOP TRIZ has integrated its methods into a universal and user friendly system for innovation In several TRIZ practitioners fleeing the collapsing Soviet Union relocated and formed Ideation
