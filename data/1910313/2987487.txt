title: Critical design
id: 2987487
Critical design uses design fiction and speculative design proposals to challenge assumptions and conceptions about the role objects play in everyday life Critical design plays a similar role to product design but does not emphasize an object s commercial purpose or physical utility It is mainly used to share a critical perspective or inspire debate while increasing awareness of social cultural or ethical issues in the eyes of the public Critical design was popularized by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby through their firm Dunne Raby br Critical design can make aspects of the future physically present to provoke a reaction Critical design is critical thought translated into materiality It is about thinking through design rather than through words and using the language and structure of design to engage people br It may be conflated with the critical theory or the Frankfurt School but it is not related br br br Definition br A critical design object challenges an audience s preconceptions provoking new ways of thinking about the object its use and the surrounding culture Its adverse is affirmative design design that reinforces the status quo For a project to succeed in critical design the viewer must be mentally engaged and willing to think beyond the expected and ordinary Humor is important but satire is not the goal br Many practitioners of critical design have never heard of the term itself and or would describe their work differently Referring to it as critical design simply garners more attention to it and emphasizes that design has applications beyond problem solving br It is more of an attitude than a style or movement a position rather than a method Critical design builds on this attitude by creatively critiquing concepts and ideologies using fabricated artifacts to embody commentaries around everything from consumer culture to the MeToo Movement Regardless of its processes critical design is often discussed as a unique approach in Design Research perhaps because of its focus on critiquing widely held social cultural and technical beliefs The process of designing such an object as well as the presentation and narrative around the object itself allows for reflection on existing cultural values morals and practices In making such an object critical designers frequently employ classic design processes research user experience iteration while working to conceptualize scenarios intended to highlight social cultural or political paradigms Design as societal critique is not a new idea br br br History br Italian Radical Design of the s and s was highly critical of prevailing social values and design ideologies br The term critical design was first used in Anthony Dunne s book Hertzian Tales and further developed in Design Noir The Secret Life of Electronic Objects br According to Sanders critical design probes an ambiguous stimuli that br designers send to people who then respond to them providing insights for the design process Uta Brandes identifies critical design as a discrete Design Research method and Bowen integrates it into human centered design activities as a useful tool for stakeholders to critically think about possible futures br FABRICA a communication research center owned by Italian fashion giant Benetton Group has been actively involved in producing provocative imagery and critical design projects FABRICA s Visual Communication department led by Omar Vulpinari actively participates in critiquing social political and environmental issues through global awareness campaigns for international magazines and organizations like UN WHO Several young artists who have produced critical design projects at FABRICA in recent years are Erik Ravello Cuba Yianni Hill Australia Marian Grabmayer Austria Priya Khatri India Andy Rementer United States and An Namyoung South Korea br br br Function br To attribute to design practice critical design broadens the vision in design from traditional practice It is no longer limited to highlighting the physical function in product design though this causes some ambiguities in the discussion of critical design s function as it maintains in design area Matt Malpass addresses Larry Ligo s classification of five different types of function Structural articulation Physical function Psychological function Social function as well as Cultural existential function in his article with a further discussion of how Modernism leaves a narrower understanding of physical utility when we think about function which leads to the ambiguity in critical design s function As critical design focuses on present social cultural and ethical implications of design objects and practice it mostly emphasizes on social and cultural impact from its function br In addition critical design objects have a lot of potential to contribute to testing ideas during the process of the development of new technology As Dunne and Raby express their concerns about always lacking communication between the specialists and the general public to form a two way discussion of new technology It always limits to one way flow from specialists to the public Critical design provides a stage to give scenarios completes the dialog between specialists and the general public and helps to collect feedback from the public for further refinements before the idea is going too far for any changes br br br Critical play br Researcher Mary Flanagan wrote Critical Play Radical Game Design in the same year that Lindsay Grace started the Critical Gameplay project Grace s Critical Gameplay project is an internationally exhibited collection of video games that apply critical design The games provoke questions about the way games are designed and played The Critical Gameplay Game Wait was awarded the Games for Change hall of fame award for being one of the most important games for social impact since The work has been shown at Electronic Language International Festival Games Learning Society Conference Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems among other notable events br br br Critiques br As critical design has gained mainstream exposure the discipline has been itself criticized by some for dramatizing so called dystopian scenarios which may in fact be reflective of real life conditions in some places in the world Some see critical design as rooted in the fears of a wealthy urban western population and failing to engage with existing social problems As an example a project titled Republic of Salivation by designers Michael Burton and Michiko Nitta featured as part of MoMA s Design and Violence series portrays a society plagued by overpopulation and food scarcity which is reliant on heavily modified government provided nutrient blocks Certain media responses to the work point to the presumed naivety of the project which presents a scenario that might be dystopian to some but in some other parts of the world it has been the reality for decades br br br Critical acclaim br In recognition of their formalization of the field Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby were presented with the inaugural MIT Media Lab Award in June with director Joichi Ito pointing out that Dunne and Raby s pioneering approach to critical design and its intersection with science technology art and the humanities has changed the landscape of design education and practice worldwide br br br Distinctions with Conceptual art br Conceptual art practice has a very similar role as critical design since both of them are sharing critical perspectives to the public and being commentators to issues the public may get confused to understand these two different fields However Matt Malpass points out that the critical designer still applies the skills from the training and practice as designer but re orientates these skills from a focus on practical ends to a focus on design work that functions symbolically culturally existentially and discursively Critical design objects are made precisely based on the design principles and carefully follow the design and design research process Also critical design objects always stay close to people s everyday life They tend to be tested on real people and get feedback for further developments Conceptual art usually associates with gallery spaces and mostly tends to apply the artistic media in the process br br br See also br Social fiction br Design fiction br Critical making br Critical technical practice br Science fiction prototyping br Speculative design br Talk to Me
