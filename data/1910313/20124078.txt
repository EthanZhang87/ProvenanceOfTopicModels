Grome is an environmental modeling package developed by Quad Software dedicated for procedural and manual generation of large virtual outdoor worlds suitable for games and other D real time simulation applications br br br History br After more than two years of internal developing the program was first launched on March as version It immediately started to be used by various professional game studios and independent developers Version was launched on August adding various optimizations pen tablet support and more flexibility by introducing user defined data sets Following this was version on March which optimized existing fractal tools and added new ones extended import and export with new data formats and introduced the Grome scripting language for automated tasks br Major release was introduced on June with many new additions With this new version Grome becomes a more complete outdoor editing platform by introducing editing of water surfaces vegetation and other decoration layers bit processing was introduced to take advantage of large amounts of RAM and bit CPUs With this version Quad Software announced the availability for customization work for professional studios that need a specific Grome version for their projects br The Grome version was launched on April bringing road networks editing support for per pixel materials optimization tools for mobiles and low end hardware and other new tools A new updated version was launched on October with focus on optimization A further update version was made on September fixing various issues and improving the SDK br br br Main features br br br General br Easy to use user interface with shortcuts available for every operation Real time preview on multiple customizable hardware accelerated viewports Presets system for tool parameters br br br Terrain editor br Supports unlimited terrain size using custom data swapping mechanism to hard disk space Terrain made of multiple terrain zones supporting variable resolution and automatic border stitching br Procedural heightmap generation using fractal terracing and erosion tools Possibility to create and assign multiple layers of heightmaps for each zone br Manual editing of heightmap layers using selection layers and brushes Flexible brush system that allows custom orientation mask strength directions and pen tablet pressure Elevation terracing and fractals brushes br Novel texture layering system that allows different shading methods variable resolutions and images per terrain zones Creation of images based on brushes or procedural generation based on slope direction altitude external shape files and erosion flowmaps br br br Object editing br User defined format system using Grome SDK plugins br Spawn objects individually or using brushes with custom orientation and area of effect Tag categorized search and replace tools for objects br Gizmo and numeric object transformation tools for translation scaling and rotation Possibility to group object for transformation around common pivot Groups can be saved to disk and later restored br Object terrain linking mechanism that allows snapping objects to terrain and moving objects along ground surface br br br Road editing br Starting with version road placement and manipulation was introduced Control of road geometry generation resolution banking and intersections is now possible while real time road terrain interaction computation is done using the GPU br br br Water editing br Real time water rendering using pixel lighting bump mapping and masking for smooth shoreline transitions Generation of water layers masks with brushes or based on terrain heights Coloring and lightmapping of water based on terrain texture layers br br br Decoration layers br Allow rendering of massive population of decoration objects and grass blades Animated grass effects to simulate wind and characters walking through Generation with brushes or automatically based on terrain slope orientation and altitude br br br Software development kit SDK br Offered for every Grome client to allow integration with their engine application pipeline Allows saving and loading from custom formats define new mesh formats and automatic responses to various editing events Comes with source code for all default plugins and documentation Out of the box Grome has the default plugins to include support for COLLADA XML DTED shape files bit RAW BT and all major images formats br br br Licensing br Grome is currently licensed under two different prices the same base version being offered to individuals and small developers under a reduced price Professional companies benefit from premium support and dongle based protection Normal builds offer file based activation per computer br br br Customization program br Starting with version Quad Software publicly announced the availability of customization work for companies In the way professional studios can obtain customized builds as part of under contract projects Examples of previous developed customized modules were presented among them being road editing AI navigation mesh generation and a more advanced lightmapper br br br Graphite Renderer br Graphite is a real time outdoor rendering library created by Grome developers to allow easy integration of Grome scenes into any D engine and graphical application The renderer is designed to be flexible and supports DirectX rendering API It is offered for free in binary form for non commercial usage for all Grome clients while paid licenses are offered to professional studios allowing source access and commercial usage br br br Grome scenes gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br See also br D computer graphics software br
