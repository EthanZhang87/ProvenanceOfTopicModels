title: Loot box
id: 54877204
In video game terminology a loot box also called a loot crate or prize crate is a consumable virtual item which can be redeemed to receive a randomised selection of further virtual items or loot ranging from simple customization options for a player s avatar or character to game changing equipment such as weapons and armor A loot box is typically a form of monetisation with players either buying the boxes directly or receiving the boxes during play and later buying keys with which to redeem them These systems may also be known as gacha based on gashapon i e capsule toys which is popular in Japan and may be integrated into gacha games br Loot box concepts originated from loot systems in massively multiplayer online role playing games and from the monetisation of free to play mobile gaming They first appeared in through and have appeared in many free to play games and in some full priced titles since then They are seen by developers and publishers of video games not only to help generate ongoing revenue for games while avoiding drawbacks of paid downloadable content or game subscriptions but to also keep player interest within games by offering new content and cosmetics through loot box reward systems Loot boxes are just one form of chance based mechanism used in paid reward systems within some digital games and research has explored their impact on children youth and families and the boundaries between gaming and gambling br Loot boxes were popularised through their inclusion in several games throughout the mid s By the latter half of the decade some games particularly Star Wars Battlefront II expanded approaches to the concept that caused them to become highly criticised Such criticism included pay to win gameplay systems that favored those that spent real money on loot boxes and negative effects on gameplay systems to accommodate them as well as them being anti consumer when implemented in full priced games Due to fears of them being used as a source in gray market skin gambling loot boxes began to become regulated under national gambling laws in various countries at the same time br br br Design br br A loot box can be named several different ways usually related to the type of game that it appears in A loot box loot crate or lockbox is often applied to shooter games since one obtains new equipable outfits or gear from it Digital card games may use the term booster pack following from collectible card game roots br Loot boxes are often given to players during play for instance as rewards for leveling up their character or completing a multiplayer game without quitting Loot boxes may also be given out through promotions outside of gameplay such as watching certain streaming events Players can also buy them directly most often with real world funds but also through in game currency sometimes in game currency can or has to be paid for with real world funds to obtain lootboxes Some loot boxes can be redeemed immediately while redeeming others requires further consumable items dressed as keys br Loot boxes are generally redeemed through an in game interface which dresses the process with appealing visual and audio effects Some such interfaces are similar to those of slot machines or roulette wheels and designed to create a psychological response to increase player excitement When the player runs out of loot boxes or keys a prominent button may be displayed with which they can buy more br The items that can be granted by a loot box are usually graded by rarity with the probability of receiving an item decreasing rapidly with each grade While the set of items given are randomly selected it can come with certain guarantees for instance that it will contain at least one item of a certain rarity or above In some redemption processes yet revealed items are presented with a colour that corresponds to its rarity level further heightening the excitement of revealing the items Some game systems include a pity timer mechanic which increases the player s chances to receive a rarer item from a loot box if the player has not received one in the last several loot boxes they have opened This pity timer mechanic may also be used if the player purchases loot boxes in bulk rather than individually such that one of the loot boxes in the bulk purchase is assured of having a rarer item br The player s inventory is managed in server databases run by the game s developers or publishers This may allow for players to view the inventory of other players and arrange for trades with them Items obtained from loot boxes and equipped or used by the player s character are nearly always visible to all other players during the course of a game such as seeing a character skin or hearing a voice line br Most loot box systems grant items without regard for what the player already owns Means are provided to dispose of these duplicates often involving trading them with other players or converting them into an in game currency Some loot box systems allow players to then use this currency to directly purchase specific items they do not have br Some loot box systems primarily from Asian developers use an approach adapted from gashapon capsule toy vending machines These gacha games offer spins analogous to turning the crank of a capsule machine to get a random item character or other virtual good One form of gacha called complete gacha allows players to combine common items in a set in order to form a rarer item The first few items in a set can be rapidly acquired but as the number of missing items decreases it becomes increasingly unlikely that redeeming a loot box will complete the set This is particularly true if there are a large number of common items in the game since eventually one single specific item is required This particular practice was banned in Japan by the Consumer Affairs Agency in though gacha games at large remain br Some games may include seasonal or special event loot boxes which include specific items only available during the time of that event In the case of digital collectible card games which rotate expansions in and out as part of keeping a viable meta game booster packs of a certain expansion may only be purchasable while that expansion is considered in standard play and once it is retired these cards can no longer be earned in packs though still may be gained from the use of in game currency and used outside standard play br br br History br br Loot boxes are an extension of randomised loot drop systems from earlier video games frequently used to give out randomised rewards in massively multiplayer online role playing games MMO or MMORPG or similar games Loot boxes took this approach and formulated a monetisation approach used by free to play games in mobile gaming Loot boxes also incorporate elements of the randomness of acquiring gachapon capsule toys br The first known instance of a loot box system is believed to be an item called Gachapon ticket which was introduced in the Japanese version of MapleStory a side scrolling MMORPG in June Such tickets were sold at the price of Japanese yen per ticket Like real life gachapon machines players attained randomly chosen game items when they used the ticket on Gachapon an in game booth that was distributed across the game world br The Chinese free to play game ZT Online or simply Zhengtu which was released in by the Zhengtu Network is also considered to be one of the early examples of video games that contained loot boxes as a part of its game system Players in Asian countries typically do not have the funds to purchase full cost titles and use Internet cafes or PC bangs to play the game for free or resort to copyright infringement to obtain copies of games for free Instead of trying to change this approach Asian games like ZT Online introduced loot boxes as a means to assure monetisation from a game that they would otherwise not receive revenue from the base sale Within a year Zhengtu Network reported monthly revenue from ZT Online exceeding US million justifying the profitability of this scheme This led to the approach of releasing games as free to play with microtransactions atop the title Many free to play mobile games in Asian regions would offer loot box approaches most notably Puzzle Dragons released in which used its gacha approach to be the first mobile game to earn more than US billion from its monetisation scheme br In Western regions North America and Europe around the video game industry saw the success of Zynga and other large publishers of social network games that offered the games for free on sites like Facebook but included microtransactions to accelerate one s progress in the game providing that publishers could depend on revenue from post sale transactions rather than initial sale One of the first games to introduce loot box like mechanics was FIFA made by Electronic Arts EA in March which allowed players to create a team of association football players from in game card packs they opened using in game currency earned through regular playing of the game or via microtransactions Another early game with loot box mechanics was Team Fortress in September when Valve added the ability to earn random crates to be opened with purchased keys Valve s Robin Walker stated that the intent was to create network effects that would draw more players to the game so that there would be more players to obtain revenue from the keys to unlock crates Valve later transitioned to a free to play model reporting an increase in player count of over times after the transition and hired Yanis Varoufakis to research virtual economies Over the next few years many MMOs and multiplayer online battle arena games MOBAs also transitioned to a free to play business model to help grow out their player base many adding loot box monetisation in the process with the first two being both Star Trek Online and The Lord of the Rings Online in December br Separately the FIFA series included a FIFA Ultimate Team Mode that allowed players to use virtual trading cards to build a team Initially released as downloadable content DLC the FIFA Ultimate Team Mode transitioned to a free add on to the base game with the release with the ability to buy card packs as a means to generate revenue for the game EA took the success of this transition for Mass Effect in March Mass Effect offered packs that would offer uncommon gear otherwise obtainable only by grinding through online gameplay According to the game s producer Jesse Houston these were used as a means to offset the development cost of the game s multiplayer mode The Mass Effect team worked closely with the FIFA team to get the rollout of these packs right which Houston compared to opening a Magic The Gathering booster card pack to make a player feel like they were always getting value from the pack br Other early examples of packaged games with loot boxes included Counter Strike Global Offensive in August adding weapon cases in an update and Battlefield in October adding battlepacks though they did not become purchasable until May and never granted duplicate items Call of Duty Advanced Warfare released in November included supply drops that contained randomised items including different variants of the game s weapons character gear and experience points that could be used to customise one s character br With the financial success of Overwatch and its loot box systems several games particularly from popular franchises in and included the mechanic as part of its meta game This included Call of Duty WWII Halo Wars Gears of War Assassin s Creed Origins Middle earth Shadow of War and Forza Motorsport By October this had led to critical review of the practice In particular the highly visible Star Wars Battlefront II released amid criticism of its loot box systems in November led to renewed discussions at various government levels related to the legality of these systems The review aggregator OpenCritic announced plans to include a business model intrusiveness for games that provide a metric on how much a game s loot and DLC system can impact the game The reaction to loot boxes in the last half of was considered one of the major trends in the video game industry in br br br Criticism br br br Player expenditures and gambling concerns br br Loot boxes are considered part of the compulsion loop of game design to keep players invested in a game Such compulsion loops are known to contribute towards video game addiction and are frequently compared to gambling addiction This is in part due to the use of a variable ratio reinforcement schedule similar to how slot machines dole out prizes While many players may never spend real world money in a loot box system such addictive systems can bring large monetary expenditures from whales players who are willing to spend large amounts of money on virtual items Gambling concerns are heightened in games that offer loot boxes and are known to be played by children Loot boxes also feed into the social anxiety around the fear of missing out FOMO as some random drops from loot boxes may be available for only a limited time and players will be more inclined to spend money to obtain loot boxes so they do not miss out on these items The use of pity timers in loot box redemption also can feed into the gambler s fallacy appearing to give credence to the player that they will be assured of a high rarity item if they open enough loot boxes br Video games have generally been considered games of skill rather than games of chance and thus are unregulated under most gambling laws but researchers from New Zealand and Australia writing in Nature Human Behaviour in concluded that loot boxes are psychologically akin to gambling A separate report from researchers in England in also concluded that loot boxes are structurally and psychologically akin to gambling br Proponents for the use of loot boxes have countered complaints that they are gambling systems by likening them to opening collectible toys such as Hatchimals or booster packs from physical collectible card games CCGs like Magic The Gathering In the United States CCGs have been subject to previous legal challenges related to if they are a form of gambling but were not found liable Some countries like Belgium have specifically exempted CCGs from gambling legislation because these games do not offer any type of gambling element However opponents of loot boxes address the fact that the process of opening a digital loot box is designed around a sensory experience and immediate return that can affect those that may be prone to gambling a factor that does not exist with physical booster packs br Some have argued the increased use of loot boxes in games since FIFA was due to the perception that the act of opening loot boxes is an exciting element for a game for both the player and those watching the player either on YouTube videos or through live streaming creating a number of multi million subscriber video streams solely dedicated to opening loot boxes NPD Group which tracks video game sales says that for games released through September there was no sign of consumer purchase change positively or negatively on games that included loot boxes NPD reported that NBA K which had been criticised by players for its loot box system at its September launch ended up as the best selling game in North America for that month Juniper Research estimated that the global video game market worth around US billion in is set to grow to about US billion by buoyed by the increased use of loot boxes particularly within China For these reason some developers see loot boxes as an essential means to monetise games knowing that there will always be players willing to buy these even if most others do not br Games with randomised in game rewards including those from loot boxes and which offer the means to trade these items with other players are known to attract the use of skin gambling In skin gambling these customization items skins become a black market virtual currency among players and operators of websites that allow players to trade the items for real world funds or to use those items to gamble on esports or other games of chance subsequently these activities have been identified as gambling by legal authorities and several legal challenges arose in the last half of to stop this practice Valve s Counter Strike Global Offensive updated in to include randomised loot drops from in games has been the most visible example of skin gambling by mid Several games which followed in and onward that used loot boxes or other randomised rewards including Rocket League and PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds did not include the ability to trade items or placed limits on trades thus eliminating skin gambling from these games br br br Impact on game design br Some loot box systems within free games are criticised as pay to win systems and may be derogatorily referred to as pay to loot In these cases the contents of the loot box contain items beyond superficial customization options which directly affect gameplay such as booster packs for a digital collectible card game and with the impact on gameplay proportional to the item s rarity This can tie the quality of a player s ability to compete with others to the random generation systems of the loot pack and may drive players into paying for additional loot boxes to obtain high rarity items to fairly compete with others Blizzard s digital card game Hearthstone released in is frequently considered to require financial expenditure in booster packs to be a successful player Blizzard claims that it attempts to minimize the effect of pay to win in Hearthstone by implementing a gameplay mode which only allows players to use cards from a core set and from expansions released in the prior two years br Some commentators expressed concern that for these types of loot box models to be successful for the publishers the game itself has to be designed around promoting and encouraging the player to purchase loot boxes which fundamentally impacts core game design principles and may weaken the underlying game mechanics This may include the use of loot boxes as a means to bypass the need to grind missions repeatedly to get gameplay changing items that significantly help towards completing a single player game which drives players to use real money to purchase these to avoid the time sink For example Middle earth Shadow of War has a second true ending requiring the player to gain many more stronger allies to meet its higher difficulty While the developers playtested the balance of the game without the loot box system activated assuring the game could be completed without additional monetisation reviewers found that the game required a great deal of time needed to complete numerous additional missions for the chance to acquire stronger allies and with the consistent presence of the in game market for loot boxes made it difficult to avoid the allure of paying real money to bypass this grinding creating a negative on the overall experience The presentation of a storefront within a game which allows one to use real world funds to purchase loot boxes or other equipment can also impact the sense of immersion a player has with a game By July the developers of Shadow of War had released patches that completely removed the in game storefront and loot box system br br br Incentives for monetisation br The implementation of some loot box systems are considered anti consumer by some players and commentators Full priced games which already provide downloadable content and then include a loot box system have been heavily criticised by players Some gaming journalists identify the inclusion of loot boxes in multiplayer games as a justified part of the publisher s cost for maintaining the game servers but see their use in single player games as only a means for the publishers to profit br Developers and publishers consider loot boxes part of a necessary process of monetising AAA video games beyond their initial sale Publishers have been hesitant of raising the base price of AAA games beyond US as of for fear of immediately losing sales and instead seek post release revenue streams to cover the increased costs and pace of the development process the stagnation in growth in video game audiences and a shortening window of time in which to gain full price sales of their games after release Monetisation schemes like loot boxes can help provide long tail revenue well after the release of the game Post release monetisation is believed by publishers to be necessary to compete with the mobile gaming sector which predominantly uses free to play monetisation schemes An analyst for KeyBanc Capital Markets in the wake of the Star Wars Battlefront II controversy said that the price of video games even with added purchases for loot boxes and micro transactions remains lower than other forms of media on a per hour basis and that games are generally underpriced for what value they give br Developers noted that the decision to include loot boxes in a game and how they will be priced in real world funds may come from their publisher or upper management but the implementation of their mechanics including what they include how they are doled out and the like are frequently set by the developers themselves Some developers argue that the loot box approach can mesh well with certain types of games as long as they are not implemented to be a predatory manner towards consumers and the decision to implement loot boxes within a game may be chosen by the developers rather than a mandate from the publisher When the loot box systems are used principally as a means to gain post sales revenues rather than as an incentive to continuing playing the game developers feel this requires them to significantly alter the game design away from challenge in gameplay and onto getting players to spend money They found that games where the baseline gameplay does not encourage or require spending money for loot boxes the addition of new content obtained from loot boxes is generally celebrated within that community and may gain brief revenue from that Further loot box systems are generally better handled when their use is determined early in development so the developers can design around it rather than a last minute addition Developers found that the mechanics of loot boxes are more accepted by non Western audiences and younger Western audiences where these groups have developed different consumption patterns than older Western players particularly as a result of growing up playing free to play mobile titles br br br Specific examples br br br Overwatch br Blizzard Entertainment s Overwatch s loot box implementation does not impact gameplay but other aspects of the system are subject to criticism A free crate is given to the player each time the player reaches enough experience to level up but the rate of experience acquisition varies with player skill While any item contains only cosmetic appeal and has no influence on gameplay the desire for a specific item creates a strong incentive to purchase additional crates Overwatch s producer Jeff Kaplan detailed the desire to create an in game currency allowing players to directly acquire an item independent of luck or skill but currency is only given to a player after opening a crate Overwatch s software as a service model delivers continued revenue as Blizzard adds new items to obtain through loot boxes In response to criticism Blizzard has made adjustments to its loot box system for example reducing the frequency of obtaining duplicate items from loot boxes while attempting to maintain the same in game currency earning rate in June Blizzard s CEO Mike Morhaime said that with Overwatch s loot boxes Blizzard avoided inclusion of pay to win gameplay changing elements and the ability to convert rewards from loot boxes back into real world money and thus don t think Overwatch belongs in that loot box controversy Industry analyst Michael Pachter speculated that the loot box model of Overwatch that uses only cosmetic items will become the more preferred method of offering this monetisation in the future Despite this Overwatch s system still does not allow players to directly use real world funds to purchase a specific cosmetic item and the rate which they earn in game currency towards loot boxes can be slow both aspects which contribute towards in game spending and the potential for gambling br Overwatch which released as a free to play title does not use loot boxes and instead offer new cosmetic items through a battle pass system br br br Star Wars Battlefront II br Conversely Electronic Arts Star Wars Battlefront II developed by EA DICE studio and released in November received heightened attention in the wake of the October loot box criticism Principally an online multiplayer shooter Battlefront II was developed to eliminate the season pass approach that the original game had used which was found to have split the player base over those that paid for the added content and those that did not Instead Battlefront II brought in other micro transaction schemes that would still allow all players to play together but provided the desired revenue streams for EA These schemes include a loot box system providing among other rewards Star Cards that provide boosts to a specific character class and which have tiered levels tied to rarity that provide greater boosts Because these higher tier Star Cards give direct advantages to players willing to acquire many loot boxes with real money than at the rate one would obtain simply playing the game its loot box system at the time of its open beta period had been described as one of the more egregious pay to win systems for a full price game br EA did re evaluate this approach in response to criticism and prior to full release reworked the loot box system so that some items still offered in loot boxes like Star Cards could also be earned through other routes such as in game achievements in game currency or through direct monetary purchase Just prior to release members of EA Access that had early access to the release version of Battlefront discovered that its other in game currency and micro transaction systems required players to spend numerous hours in game matches to earn credits at a sufficient rate to unlock special hero characters or alternatively spend real world funds to buy in game currency or loot boxes that offered that currency as a possible reward The combined loot box and micro transaction systems all elements of pay to win schemes drew even more criticism Just hours before the game s official launch EA and DICE temporarily disabled all micro transaction purchases until they figured out a way to offer these systems in a favorable manner for consumers DICE stated We will now spend more time listening adjusting balancing and tuning before they are reintroduced According to The Wall Street Journal the decision to remove the micro transactions just before launch was demanded by Disney which owns the Star Wars properties Disney knowing the franchise draws in younger players feared the loot box systems would contribute towards gambling behavior in children EA later affirmed its revamped approach to micro transactions within the game to be released in March eliminating any pay to win elements like Star Cards as potential rewards from loot boxes Star Cards would otherwise only be earned by an experience point based progression in the game while loot crates would be limited to only cosmetic items or in game credits to buy these items br The player reaction to Battlefront s loot box system led to the Belgian Gambling Commission to evaluate the nature of loot boxes specifically in Battlefront In the United States it generated legislative debates about a potential sales ban within Hawaii and some other US states EA has stated that they do not consider the approach of loot boxes in Battlefront as gambling as it is strictly an optional feature The reaction and change to the loot box and monetisation scheme caused sales of Battlefront to fall from expectations and EA s stock lost of its value a week after the game s release equal to about US billion Analysts expect that EA will have to re evaluate how they monetise games in the future to avoid similar backlashes which may further reduce future revenues In its fiscal quarter results following the release of Battlefront II EA reported missing their sales mark of million units by about which EA CFO Blake Jorgensen attributed to the loot box controversy over the game This coupled with the removal of micro transactions from the game while they readdressed the loot box approach led to the game missing EA s revenue projections for that quarter In April EA s Patrick S derlund stated that the loot box controversy over Battlefront impacted the company significantly which included a reorganisation of executive positions and that For games that come next for Battlefield or for Anthem players have made it very clear that we can t afford to make similar mistakes And we won t br br br FIFA br br Electronic Arts also published the FIFA series of association football games in annual installments using the appearances and attributes of the real world athletes in the teams on the league Part of more recent entries in the system include its Ultimate Team mode where players can form their own teams by collecting cards of these players which have been offered through virtual card packs that can be purchased with in game currency or real world funds Points currency While this is a similar mechanism to other games using loot box mechanics the use here is criticised due to the fact that cards earned from one version of the game do not carry over into the next year s version teams remain in their account until the said edition s servers are shut down Thus players must work to regain a competitive team by re earning in game credits or spending more money by buying additional points with the potential to continue that cycle each year EA has since implemented Ultimate Team like mechanics in other sports simulation series including Madden NFL NBA Live NHL and UFC In EA reported that revenue from Ultimate Team pack purchases was US million a year roughly half of their total revenue from microtransactions across their portfolio and of their entire digital sales revenue CBC reported from a leaked EA presentation of the company s intent to drive FIFA players to the Ultimate Team mode as the cornerstone of the game In a reply EA stated that they do not push players to spend money in their games and that the majority of FIFA players do not spend any money in game br br br Regulation and legislation br br Because of their use of random chance to gain items after committing real world funds games using loot boxes may be considered a form of gambling While gambling laws vary from country to country a common theme that tends to legally distinguish loot boxes from gambling is the inability to transform the contents from a loot box back into real world money by legitimate means within the video game br Games with loot box systems have become subject to regulation in several Asian countries while questions of the legality of loot boxes are under consideration in some Western ones Steven Wright for PC Gamer observed that several of the concerns for loot boxes related to gambling had been previously experienced through lawsuits in the s against the baseball card industry as well as with the physical Pok mon Trading Card Game but these cases did not impact either arena to a significant degree br br br Asia and Oceania br br br China br In December China s Ministry of Culture announced legislation which required online game publishers to publicly release from May onwards the draw probability of all virtual items and services When the law came into effect publishers complied resulting in a variety of statistics being released which quantified the odds of Chinese players receiving different categories of item from each loot box some of which were as low as Other changes mandated by the new regulations required publishers to limit the number of loot box purchases any player can purchase in a day including limiting the size of multiple loot box bundle packages and requiring the publisher to give more favorable odds to the player to get rare items with the number of loot boxes they have opened effectively assuring a player of receiving a rare item by opening a fixed number of loot boxes A paper evaluated the state of many Chinese games that used loot boxes and found that of the current top games offered on China s Apple App store of those games included loot boxes but only about of these made full proper disclosure of loot box probabilities to China s law br The law also banned game publishers from directly selling lottery tickets such as loot boxes In June Blizzard Entertainment announced that in line with the new laws and regulations loot boxes in their game Overwatch would no longer be available for purchase in China Players would instead buy in game currency and receive loot boxes as a gift for making the purchase br Effective November China s General Administration of Press and Publication prohibited the sale of loot boxes to users under eight years of age and restricted their sale to older users under years of age to a maximum monthly spending limit ranging from to renminbi br br br Japan br Following the success of the gacha model in Puzzle Dragons in it became recognised in Japan that the system was essentially gambling particularly for younger players By May Japan s Consumer Affairs Agency banned the practice of complete gacha in which a predetermined set of items gained from loot boxes would combine once completed to form a rarer and thus more valuable item This was done not by introducing any new legislation but by issuing a legal opinion that virtual items could be considered prizes under existing legislation written in to prevent the complete gacha practice in the context of baseball trading cards Within a month of the opinion being issued all major Japanese game publishers had removed complete gacha rules from their games though many developers found ways around these rules Japanese mobile game developers including GREE and DeNA worked to establish a self regulating industry group the Japan Social Game Association However this association was disbanded by br br br South Korea br In March members of South Korea s National Assembly led by the Liberty Korea Party proposed amendments to the country s existing games industry regulation that would require games companies to release information on the type composition ratio and acquisition probability of items granted by loot boxes Though the amendment did not pass it led to attempts by the South Korean games industry to self regulate This has not convinced assembly members who have continued to propose statutory regulation However there have been several revisions to the self regulation most recently in July which now requires all video games to clearly display the payout rates of the items from the loot boxes to the player There are also plans in the near future to expand the scope of this regulation to include other in game purchases such as the success rate of a paid consumable item whose purpose is to enhance another virtual item br The Fair Trade Commission still oversees consumer issues related to loot boxes and video games in April it issued a US fine against Nexon related to its game Sudden Attack for deceptive loot box practices as well as two smaller fines to other companies br br br Singapore br In October Singapore s parliament passed The Remote Gambling Act which introduced a ban on unlicensed gambling websites and fines for anyone violating it The law s definition of gambling included staking virtual credits virtual coins virtual tokens virtual objects or any similar thing that is purchased in relation to a game of chance leading to concerns that it would require producers of any game in which players paid money and received a randomised outcome to seek a license to operate from the government br In response to games industry lobbying home affairs minister S Iswaran clarified the law in parliament stating that the Bill does not intend to cover social games in which players do not play to acquire a chance of winning money and where the game design does not allow the player to convert in game credits to money or real merchandise outside the game The minister also specifically excluded platforms which offered virtual currencies which can be used to buy or redeem other entertainment products such as Steam from the provisions of the bill br However the minister also said br br The fact is that the line between social gaming and gambling is increasingly becoming blurred What may appear benign today can quickly morph into something a lot more sinister tomorrow in response to market opportunities and consumer trends That is why the legislation is cast broadly The Remote Gambling Act was placed under review by Ministry of Home Affairs of Singapore in with the aim to amend the law be technology agnostic and may potentially include regulations for loot boxes among other types of non traditional gambling products br br br Australia br Within Australia games with loot boxes would fall under gambling restrictions if they can be played for money or anything else of value the question remains if items that only exist within game have value that can be quantified even if this is related to an item s prestige The Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation has stated that it considers loot boxes to be gambling but does not have the authority to prosecute companies registered overseas The commission has suggested an immediate R rating for any games which feature loot boxes as a solution to this limitation In March the Australian Office of eSafety published a list of safety guidelines on the dangers of online loot boxes br The Australian Senate passed a motion led by Jordon Steele John in June directing the Environment and Communications References Committee to investigate loot boxes and report back to the Senate in September The investigation which started in August evaluated the use of loot boxes in video games and considered them under issues related to gambling and effects on children The report released in mid September found that loot boxes are psychologically akin to gambling and that games with loot boxes are potentially exploiting gambling disorders among their customers The committee recommended that games with loot boxes be labeled to warn of parental guidance and indicate that they contain in game gambling content and suggest that such games be rated to represent the legal gambling age in the country In the final report the committee urged the Australian government to undertake a comprehensive review of loot boxes in video games through a multi departmental effort to determine what legislative and other actions need to be taken br A February report from the Australian House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs that focused on internet content that should be blocked behind age verification gates recommended that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner or similar body report to the Australian government on options for restricting access to loot boxes and other simulated gambling elements in computer and video games to adults aged years or over including through the use of mandatory age verification br By August the Australian Classification Board ACB had updated its regulations to state that games with any microtransaction including loot boxes must be labeled on their covers as containing in game purchases as part of the ratings classification br MP Andrew Wilkie introduced a bill in November that would require video games with loot boxes to be automatically rated by the ACB as R or be refused a rating By existing law R games are restricted from sale to minors Wilkie stated that he believed that loot boxes in video games were grooming minors for future gambling as a rationale for the bill The approach was modified in March so as to address any video game with simulated gambling including loot boxes These changes were implemented with enforcement to start in September games with simulated gambling would be rated R and games containing in game purchases linked to elements of chance including paid loot boxes would be rated M br br br New Zealand br The Gambling Commission within the Department of Internal Affairs for New Zealand stated in response to a citizen s email that currently in their view loot boxes do not meet the legal definition of gambling but are reviewing the situation as it progresses br br br Europe br br br Austria br In March the district court of Hermagor ruled that loot boxes contained in FIFA video game series are gambling and thus illegal The relevant question for the court was if on one hand virtual goods have real value and on the other hand promise a gain Especially with games of the FIFA series there is a black market where players are traded for real money The decision required Sony in accepting the payment for EA to refund the money spent on Ultimate Team packs to the users and EA to label the FIFA games as gambling games requiring a license to use The judgement is not final and can be contested However Sony failed to apply for an appeal by May and subsequently was ordered to refund money to the plaintiffs br br br United Kingdom br In March the UK s Gambling Commission issued a position paper Virtual currencies esports and social casino gaming The paper took the position that virtual items are prizes and that in general Where prizes are successfully restricted for use solely within the game such in game features would not be licensable gambling However the paper continues that br br In our view the ability to convert in game items into cash or to trade them for other items of value means they attain a real world value and become articles of money or money s worth Where facilities for gambling are offered using such items a licence is required in exactly the same manner as would be expected in circumstances where somebody uses or receives casino chips as a method of payment for gambling which can later be exchanged for cash br In August the commission opened an investigation into skin gambling Later in November the commission s executive director Tim Miller was interviewed on BBC Radio where he confirmed that the commission had also been investigating loot boxes and suggested self regulation of the games industry The Commission issued a statement that month recognising that they cannot make the determination when loot boxes crosses over into gambling as that they can only enforce what Parliament has issued as the law for gambling and restating the legal definition of gambling in this regard from their earlier position paper Miller said while they cannot take action toward loot boxes until Parliament changes the law they can raise awareness of issues with loot boxes that might affect children and their parents and are trying to evaluate the risks and issues associated with that as part of their August skin gambling investigation Miller further stated that even if other countries were to pass laws or regulate loot boxes the commission would still need to follow the UK s laws br br In October a month prior to the Battlefront II controversy MP Daniel Zeichner of Cambridge on behalf of a constituent submitted a written parliamentary question to ask the Secretary of State for Digital Culture Media and Sport DCMS what steps she plans to take to help protect vulnerable adults and children from illegal gambling in game gambling and loot boxes within computer games In response MP Tracey Crouch parliamentary under secretary for the department referred back to the stance of the Gambling Commission s position paper and said that The government recognises the risks that come from increasing convergence between gambling and video games The Gambling Commission is keeping this matter under review and will continue to monitor developments in the market Separately over British citizens signed a petition requesting that the British government adapt gambling laws to include gambling in video games which targets children which includes issues over loot boxes The government s

technology like virtual reality may impact culture with a specific focus on the addictive nature of some technologies The department has also held public hearings with members of the video game industry to solicit their input MP Margot James the current Minister for Culture Communications and Creative Industries stated in these discussions that the UK s approach to how they treat loot boxes will likely be different from how other European states like Belgium have done as the countries do not share similar laws for other gambling activities James said Loot boxes are a means of people purchasing items skins to enhance their gaming experience not through an expectation of an additional financial reward And also more importantly they can t be traded offline for money So I think there are big differences and I don t think really it is true to say loot boxes are gambling br The Gambling Commission issued a statement in July that they cannot oversee the sale of loot boxes in most video games as there is no way to monetise the items within the loot box a core distinction from gambling as written in current legislation The Commission did caution that there are third party sites

gambling monetisation br In its final report published September the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport recommended that the British government take precautionary steps to prevent the sale of games containing loot boxes to minors and to work with PEGI to make sure that games with loot boxes are labeled as having gambling mechanics Further the report stated that We consider loot boxes that can be bought with real world money and do not reveal their contents in advance to be games of chance played for money s worth and urged the government to add games containing loot boxes as regulated under the Gambling Act which would restrict their sale The report also agreed with the conclusions of the Gambling Commission that game publishes and developers must take more steps to limit

encouraged updates to gambling laws to reflect how games may use them to draw minors to continue to spend money br The National Health Service director of mental health Claire Murdoch stated in January that the Service was incorporating concerns related to loot boxes and the mental health of youth into their Long Term Plan but cautioned that no company should be setting kids up for addiction

evidence from game companies related to loot boxes as part of a further investigation It issued its first findings in July where it concluded that players of games with loot boxes were more likely to experience gambling mental health financial and problem gaming related harms DCMS did not intend to change gambling laws in the UK to account for loot boxes as this would have significant implementation challenges and risks of unintended consequence but urged video game companies to employ measures to reduce the potential harm to players from loot boxes such as implementing parental controls more transparency on loot box odds and warning players who have spent a large amount of money on loot boxes The DCMS said they would not hesitate to change laws should the video game industry not work on these measures br The House of Lords Gambling Committee released a special report on the state of gambling in the UK on July The report identified the ongoing issue of loot boxes how they may be seen as gambling and their effect on the youth and concluded that Ministers should make regulations under section of the Gambling Act specifying that loot boxes and br any other similar games

games advertise their in game premium currency Among these factors the ASA s guidance stated that games that included loot boxes must disclose this information on store pages and any advertising for

remaining games did not meet the threshold for legal action they nevertheless foster ed the development of addiction and were at odds with the authority s objectives br The authority gave the developers of the four unnamed games eight weeks to correct their loot box system or face fines and potential bans on sales of the games in the Netherlands Valve disabled the ability for players to trade in game items from Counter Strike Global Offensive Team Fortress and Dota stating that they were told by the Dutch Gaming Authority that they had until June to remedy the loot box situations

completed its study of loot box systems in four games FIFA Overwatch Counter Strike Global Offensive and Star Wars Battlefront II and determined that the loot box systems in FIFA Overwatch and Counter Strike Global Offensive were considered games of chance and subject to Belgium s gambling laws The Commission stated that for loot boxes in Overwatch the action of opening a loot box is a game of chance to receive items of some perceived value to players and there is no means to directly purchase in game currency to obtain a specific item while games like FIFA merge reality and fantasy by using real life athletes to promote the loot box system Belgium s Minister of Justice Koen Geens stated in these findings that A dialogue with the sector is necessary and that It is often children who come into contact with such loot box systems and we cannot allow that The study was conducted starting in November during which Battlefront II had temporarily removed loot boxes so was not considered in violation The Commission ordered that the loot box systems from these three games be removed or otherwise the publishers could face criminal offenses and fines up to Geens called for a European Union wide ban of loot boxes saying that mixing gambling and gaming especially at a young age is dangerous for the mental health of the child br In response to the announcement several companies made

by the commission however EA did not make any modifications to these games EA had previously stated in May that it did not believe the implementation of loot boxes in their games constituted gambling As such the commission has started actions with the Belgian courts to initiate legal action against EA by September though whether such action is possible would be a decision of the public prosecutor s office Ultimately on January EA announced that it would stop selling FIFA Ultimate Team packs with microtransactions to players in Belgium by February bringing them into compliance with the commission br In July an academic study revealed that the Belgian ban on loot boxes has not been enforced by the Commission and that of the highest grossing iPhone games were still selling loot boxes

oversees online gambling to ask them to investigate the situation with pay to win loot boxes Durain s letter stated his concerns that some observers point to a convergence of the video game world and practices specific to gambling in his request ARJEL s report released in June does not immediately consider loot boxes as gambling but does address the need to continue to investigate them further following a planned report to be published by the Gaming Regulators European Forum ARJEL noted that items from loot boxes do not normally have monetary value and even when they are traded through skin gambling the publisher of such games do not participate in that arena thus distancing loot boxes from other forms of gambling br br br Germany br In February Germany s Commission for Youth Media Protection announced research into loot boxes undertaken at the University of Hamburg which concluded that they present features typical of gambling markets Commission head Wolfgang Krei ig said that it was conceivable that loot boxes could violate the ban on advertising to children and adolescents The commission concluded in March that loot boxes can possibly violate the prohibition of direct advertisement appeals to buy products directed towards minors however the games that they studied were rated for players of at least years old and thus were not targeted to be played by minors The commission remained open on hearing complaints towards loot boxes on specific games though have no legal authority to enact any fines or penalties should they be found to be against law br In October the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons BPjM stated it was looking into blacklisting the game Coin Master for distribution in Germany after Jan B hmermann had discussed issues with the game s monetisation mechanics While Coin Master does not use loot boxes the game uses a gameplay mechanism that requires the player to play a virtual slot machine to advance in the game with the opportunity to use items purchased with real world funds to influence or bypass the slot machine to achieve desirable results a model adapted by many other games and one that can encourage or trivialise excessive gambling If Coin Master had been blacklisted the BPjM may have opened the door for other games with similar monetisation routes to be reviewed By March BPjM opted not to blacklist the game but later announced in July that it may consider requiring games like Coin Master and games with loot boxes to be rated at a higher ratings level under a new Youth Protection Act that is

Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection IMCP Loot boxes in online games and their effect on consumers in particular young consumers was one of the first reports to reframe loot boxes as a matter of consumer protection rather than a gambling concern The report identified that loot boxes in video games have problematic design features that create an irresistible urge to play and a growing tension that could only be relieved by playing in an addictive loop While the report identified this had similarities with gambling the authors also urged that the European Parliament consider the loot box issue at a consumer protection standpoint since it can create addictive behavior particularly in young persons The report included recommendations such as restrictions on design features that encourage the addictive loop better disclosure from publishers to players on loot box odds and the risks of playing such games parental controls and consumer testing with governmental oversight br A report by the Norwegian Consumer Council and backed by other EU countries released in May found that loot boxes in games like FIFA and Raid Shadow Legends were exploitative and predatory and positioned the EU to include regulations related to loot boxes in upcoming directive discussions br br br North America br br br United States br There are presently no laws in the United States targeting loot boxes though the renewed interest in the issues with skin gambling from mid highlighted several concerns with using virtual items for gambling purposes In past case law courts have ruled that gambling with virtual currency within a video game is not illegal as long as there are no ties to real money steps Blizzard Entertainment and Riot Games have done with their titles Further most states define gambling laws based on receiving something of value from paying for a game of chance and traditionally in game items are considered to have no value in previous case law However with more technically literate court judges that may consider value more than just a financial value alongside new perception of how much value in game items can have resulting from the skin gambling situation could change how the framework in the United States would classify loot boxes br Hawaii state representatives Chris Lee and Sean Quinlan issued a statement in November taking a stance against loot boxes These kinds of lootboxes and microtransactions are explicitly designed to prey upon and exploit human psychology in the same way casino games are so designed They plan to introduce legislation in the State of Hawaii specifically to block sale of Star Wars Battlefront II and that they have spoken to lawmakers from other states to enact similar laws such that federal legislation could be possible if enough states take action Quinlan stated br br I realized just how bad it has gotten We ve been on this path for years with day one DLC subscription passes pay to win We as consumers kept accepting that kept buying those games Now we re at a place where we need to consider do we need to legislate Does the ESRB have to consider a new rating that could deal with gambling and addictive mechanics br Rather than passing legislation that could have a slippery slope of harmful effects on the industry Quinlan stated he would prefer to see the industry self regulate either by excluding gambling like mechanics in games marketed to children or have the industry rate games with these mechanics for more mature audiences which would affect how they would be sold and marketed Lee later outlined how he would present a law which would ban the sale of games to anyone under if it contained a gambling element defined if real world funds are used to provide a percentage chance of receiving a specific in game item rather than the item directly applied both at retail and at digital distribution By February two separate bills were introduced in Hawaii s state legislature one bill would require retail games featuring loot box mechanisms to have clear labeling stating Warning contains in game purchases and gambling like mechanisms which may be harmful or addictive while a second bill would regulate sale of these games to only those years of age or older the minimum age for gambling within the state However by March the bills failed to meet necessary requirements to be considered in the legislation and were dropped br In January three senators in Washington state introduced Senate Bill S in the state legislature which would if enacted order the Washington State

this as previously defined in the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act The Federal Trade Commission would be responsible for enforcing the bill by making judgements and leveling fines for games that fail to take these steps The bill was formally introduced in the United States Senate in the th Congress on May as Senate Bill with co sponsors Ed Markey Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal Connecticut both Democrats The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation at that time and no further action was taken on it with the bill expiring at the end of

Japan Online Game Association JOGA which now serves as the Japanese video game industry s self regulatory body in lieu of JSGA also issued similar guidelines with further specifications such as listing all available rewards from the lootbox and payout rates of all rewards and listing changes to all available rewards and payout rates upon software revision specifically during festive campaign

ESRB does not consider loot boxes as a form of gambling and will not rate such games with their Real Gambling content descriptions ESRB considers that loot boxes are equivalent to collectible card game booster packs and that the player is always receiving something of value with opening a loot box purchase even if it is not something the player desires The Board further stated that games that are labelled with Real Gambling will likely be then rated AO Adults Only to comply with gambling laws retailers typically do not stock such games and would thus harm a publisher Additionally the ESRB also sees themselves as responsible to help guide parents on video game content As an example they found that parents were more worried about children spending money in game and not any gambling aspects and thus did not include loot boxes as one of its content descriptions though would like to add them in the future should legislation or other industry standards establish gambling as a critical issue br The Entertainment Software Association the parent organization of the ESRB asserted loot boxes are not a form of gambling stressing that they are a voluntary and optional aspect in

hearing of the Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee to four Federal Trade Commission nominees which the Commission oversees She asked the nominees if that children being addicted to gaming and activities like loot boxes that might make them more susceptible to addiction is a problem that merits attention all four nominees agreed attention would be necessary The same day Hassan authored a letter to the ESRB to review the completeness of the board s ratings process and policies as they relate to loot boxes and to take into account the potential harm these types of micro transactions may have on children and to examine whether the design and marketing approach to loot boxes in games geared toward children is being conducted in an ethical and transparent way that adequately protects the developing minds of young children from predatory practices Though neither the hearing nor the letter called for regulation Brian Crecente of Glixel considered these as pretense to get the ESRB to act on its own before Congress would be forced to take legislative action br In response to Hassan s letter the ESRB announced in February that it would require any rated game that offers any type of in game purchase with real world funds encompassing loot boxes would be required to be labeled as such ESRB stated the labeling was primarily meant to help parents watch for games for their children and because of the brevity of space they have on retail packaging did not opt to require publishers to identify the specific form of microtransaction However the board still asserted that they still do not believe loot boxes themselves are a form of gambling While Sen Hassan called the ESRB s decision a step forward she still remained concerned of the ESRB s skepticism regarding the potentially addictive nature of loot boxes and microtransactions in video games and stated I will work with all relevant stakeholders to continue oversight on these issues and
