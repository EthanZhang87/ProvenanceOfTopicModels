Autodesk ds Max formerly D Studio and D Studio Max is a professional D computer graphics program for making D animations models games and images It is developed and produced by Autodesk Media and Entertainment It has modeling capabilities and a flexible plugin architecture and must be used on the Microsoft Windows platform It is frequently used by video game developers many TV commercial studios and architectural visualization studios It is also used for movie effects and movie pre visualization ds Max features shaders such as ambient occlusion and subsurface scattering dynamic simulation particle systems radiosity normal map creation and rendering global illumination a customizable user interface and its own scripting language br br br History br The original D Studio product was created for the DOS platform by the Yost Group and published by Autodesk The release of D Studio made Autodesk s previous D rendering package AutoShade obsolete After D Studio DOS Release the product was rewritten for the Windows NT platform and renamed D Studio MAX This version was also originally created by the Yost Group It was released by Kinetix which was at that time Autodesk s division of media and entertainment br Autodesk purchased the product at the second release update of the D Studio MAX version and internalized development entirely over the next two releases Later the product name was changed to ds max all lower case to better comply with the naming conventions of Discreet a Montreal based software company which Autodesk had purchased br When it was re released release the product was again branded with the Autodesk logo and the short name was again changed to ds Max upper and lower case while the formal product name became the current Autodesk ds Max br br br Version history br br br Features br MAXScript br MAXScript is a built in scripting language that can be used to automate repetitive tasks combine existing functionality in new ways develop new tools and user interfaces and much more Plugin modules can be created entirely within MAXScript br Character Studio br Character Studio was a plugin which since version of Max is now integrated in ds Max it helps users to animate virtual characters The system works using a character rig or Biped skeleton which has stock settings that can be modified and customized to fit the character meshes and animation needs This tool also includes robust editing tools for IK FK switching Pose manipulation Layers and Keyframing workflows and sharing of animation data across different Biped skeletons These Biped objects have other useful features that help accelerate the production of walk cycles and movement paths as well as secondary motion br Scene Explorer br Scene Explorer a tool that provides a hierarchical view of scene data and analysis facilitates working with more complex scenes Scene Explorer has the ability to sort filter and search a scene by any object type or property including metadata Added in ds Max it was the first component to facilitate NET managed code in ds Max outside of MAXScript br DWG import br ds Max supports both import and linking of dwg files Improved memory management in ds Max enables larger scenes to be imported with multiple objects br Texture assignment editing br ds Max offers operations for creative texture and planar mapping including tiling mirroring decals angle rotate blur UV stretching and relaxation Remove Distortion Preserve UV and UV template image export The texture workflow includes the ability to combine an unlimited number of textures a material map browser with support for drag and drop assignment and hierarchies with thumbnails UV workflow features include Pelt mapping which defines custom seams and enables users to unfold UVs according to those seams copy paste materials maps and colors and access to quick mapping types box cylindrical spherical br General keyframing br Two keying modes set key and auto key offer support for different keyframing workflows br Fast and intuitive controls for keyframing including cut copy and paste let the user create animations with ease Animation trajectories may be viewed and edited directly in the viewport br Constrained animation br Objects can be animated along curves with controls for alignment banking velocity smoothness and looping and along surfaces with controls for alignment Weight path controlled animation between multiple curves and animate the weight Objects can be constrained to animate with other objects in many ways including look at orientation in different coordinate spaces and linking at different points in time These constraints also support animated weighting between more than one target br All resulting constrained animation can be collapsed into standard keyframes for further editing br Skinning br Either the Skin or Physique modifier may be used to achieve precise control of skeletal deformation so the character deforms smoothly as joints are moved even in the most challenging areas such as shoulders Skin deformation can be controlled using direct vertex weights volumes of vertices defined by envelopes or both Capabilities such as weight tables paintable weights and saving and loading of weights offer easy editing and proximity based transfer between models providing the accuracy and flexibility needed for complicated characters br The rigid bind skinning option is useful for animating low polygon models or as a diagnostic tool for regular skeleton animation br Additional modifiers such as Skin Wrap and Skin Morph can be used to drive meshes with other meshes and make targeted weighting adjustments in tricky areas br Skeletons and inverse kinematics IK br Characters can be rigged with custom skeletons using ds Max bones IK solvers and rigging tools powered by Motion Capture Data br All animation tools including expressions scripts list controllers and wiring can be used along with a set of utilities specific to bones to build rigs of any structure and with custom controls so animators see only the UI necessary to get their characters animated Four plug in IK solvers ship with ds Max history independent solver history dependent solver limb solver and spline IK solver These powerful solvers reduce the time it takes to create high quality character animation The history independent solver delivers smooth blending between IK and FK animation and uses preferred angles to give animators more control over the positioning of affected bones The history dependent solver can solve within joint limits and is used for machine like animation IK limb is a lightweight two bone solver optimized for real time interactivity ideal for working with a character arm or leg Spline IK solver provides a flexible animation system with nodes that can be moved anywhere in D space It allows for efficient animation of skeletal chains such as a character s spine or tail and includes easy to use twist and roll controls br Integrated Cloth solver br In addition to reactor s cloth modifier ds Max software has an integrated cloth simulation engine that enables the user to turn almost any D object into clothing and even build garments from scratch Collision solving is fast and accurate even in complex simulations Local simulation lets artists drape cloth in real time to set up an initial clothing state before setting animation keys br Cloth simulations can be used in conjunction with other ds Max dynamic forces such as Space Warps Multiple independent cloth systems can be animated with their own objects and forces Cloth deformation data can be cached to the hard drive to allow for nondestructive iterations and to improve playback performance br Integration with Autodesk Vault br Autodesk Vault plug in which ships with ds Max consolidates users ds Max assets in a single location enabling them to automatically track files and manage work in progress Users can easily and safely find share and reuse ds Max and design assets in a large scale production or visualization environment br br br Max Creation Graph br Introduced with Max Max Creation Graph MCG enables users to create modifiers geometry and utility plug ins using a visual node based workflow br With MCG the user can create a new plug in for ds Max in minutes by simply wiring together parameter nodes computation nodes and output nodes The resulting graph can then be saved in an XML file maxtool or be packaged with any compounds maxcompound it depends on in a ZIP file mcg which can be shared easily with ds Max users br br br Adoption br br Many films have made use of ds Max or previous versions of the program under previous names in CGI animation such as Avatar and which contain computer generated graphics from ds Max alongside live action acting Mudbox was also used in the final texturing of the set and characters in Avatar with ds Max and Mudbox being closely related br ds Max has been used in the development of D computer graphics for a number of video games br Architectural and engineering design firms use ds Max for developing concept art and previsualization br Educational programs at secondary and tertiary level use ds Max in their courses on D computer graphics and computer animation Students in the FIRST competition for d animation are known to use ds Max br br br Modeling techniques br br br Polygon modeling br br Polygon modeling is more common with game design than any other modeling technique as the very specific control over individual polygons allows for extreme optimization Usually the modeler begins with one of the ds max primitives and using such tools as bevel and extrude adds detail to and refines the model Versions and up feature the Editable Polygon object which simplifies most mesh editing operations and provides subdivision smoothing at customizable levels see NURMS br Version introduced the edit poly modifier which allows the use of the tools available in the editable polygon object to be used higher in the modifier stack i e on top of other modifications br NURBS in ds Max is a legacy feature None of the features have been updated since version and have been ignored by the development teams over the past decade For example the updated path deform and the updated normalize spline modifiers in version do not work on NURBS curves anymore as they did in previous versions br br br NURBS Non Uniform Rational Based Splines br An alternative to polygons it gives a smoothed out surface that eliminates the straight edges of a polygon model NURBS is a mathematically exact representation of freeform surfaces like those used for car bodies and ship hulls which can be exactly reproduced at any resolution whenever needed With NURBS a smooth sphere can be created with only one face br The non uniform property of NURBS brings up an important point Because they are generated mathematically NURBS objects have a parameter space in addition to the D geometric space in which they are displayed Specifically an array of values called knots specifies the extent of influence of each control vertex CV on the curve or surface Knots are invisible in D space and can t be manipulated directly but occasionally their behavior affects the visible appearance of the NURBS object Parameter space is one dimensional for curves which have only a single U dimension topologically even though they exist geometrically in D space Surfaces have two dimensions in parameter space called U and V br NURBS curves and surfaces have the important properties of not changing under the standard geometric affine transformations Transforms or under perspective projections The CVs have local control of the object moving a CV or changing its weight does not affect any part of the object beyond the neighboring CVs This property can be overridden by using the Soft Selection controls Also the control lattice that connects CVs surrounds the surface This is known as the convex hull property br br br Surface tool editable patch object br Surface tool was originally a rd party plugin but Kinetix acquired and included this feature since version The surface tool is for creating common ds Max splines and then applying a modifier called surface This modifier makes a surface from every three or four vertices in a grid It is often seen as an alternative to mesh or nurbs modeling as it enables a user to interpolate curved sections with straight geometry for example a hole through a box shape Although the surface tool is a useful way to generate parametrically accurate geometry it lacks the surface properties found in the similar Edit Patch modifier which enables a user to maintain the original parametric geometry whilst being able to adjust smoothing groups between faces br br br Predefined primitives br This is a basic method in which one models something using only boxes spheres cones cylinders and other predefined objects from the list of Predefined Standard Primitives or a list of Predefined Extended Primitives One may also apply Boolean operations including subtract cut and connect For example one can make two spheres which will work as blobs that will connect with each other These are called metaballs br br br Standard primitives br br br Extended primitives br br br Rendering br Scanline rendering br The default rendering method in ds Max is scanline rendering Several advanced features have been added to the scanliner over the years such as global illumination radiosity and ray tracing br ART Renderer br Autodesk Raytracer Renderer ART is a CPU only physically based renderer for architectural product and industrial design renderings and animations It is integrated into ds Max as of version br Redshift br A third party GPU accelerated biased renderer with plugins for ds Max Cinema D Houdini Katana and Maya br Mental Ray br Mental ray is a third party renderer using bucket rendering a technique that allows distributing the rendering task for a single image between several computers Since ds Max mental ray is no longer shipped with ds Max and needs to be obtained directly from NVIDIA br RenderMan br A third party connection tool to RenderMan pipelines is also available for those that need to integrate Max into Renderman render farms Used by Pixar for rendering several of their CGI animated films br V Ray br A third party render engine plug in for ds Max br Brazil R S br A third party photorealistic rendering system It is capable of fast ray tracing and global illumination br Arion br A third party hybrid GPU CPU interactive unbiased ray tracer based on Nvidia CUDA br Indigo Renderer br A third party photorealistic renderer with plugins for ds Max br Maxwell Render br A third party photorealistic rendering system providing materials and unbiased rendering br Octane Render br A third party unbiased GPU ray tracer with plugins for ds Max based on Nvidia CUDA br Luxrender br An open source ray tracer supporting ds Max Cinema D Softimage and Blender Focuses on photorealism by simulating real light physics as much as possible br Arnold br Arnold is an unbiased physically based unidirectional path tracing renderer br Corona Renderer br An third party high performance un biased photorealistic renderer br br br Licensing br Earlier versions up to and including D Studio Max R required a special copy protection device called a dongle to be plugged into the parallel port while the program was run but later versions incorporated software based copy prevention methods instead Current versions require online registration br Due to the high price of the commercial version of the program Autodesk also offers a free student version which explicitly states that it is to be used for educational purposes only The student version has identical features to the full version but is only for single use and cannot be installed on a network The student license expires after three years at which time the user if they are still a student may download the latest version thus renewing the license for another three years br br br See also br br
