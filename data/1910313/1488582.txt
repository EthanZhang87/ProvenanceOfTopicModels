Warzone is an open source real time strategy and real time tactics hybrid computer game originally developed by Pumpkin Studios and published by Eidos Interactive It was originally released in for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation and is now also available for macOS FreeBSD AmigaOS AROS MorphOS Linux NetBSD and OpenBSD br While Warzone was developed and released as a proprietary commercial video game on December the source code and most of its data was released under the GNU GPL or later the rest of the data followed on June br br br Synopsis br br br Setting br In the late st century the world s civilizations are wiped out by a series of nuclear strikes seemingly caused by a massive malfunction of the new NASDA North American Strategic Defense Agency strategic defense system While most of the survivors form scavenger bands to survive the player is a member of a group named The Project that is more organised and seeks to rebuild civilization using pre war technology br br br Plot br The game begins with The Project sending three teams Alpha Beta and Gamma to gather technology that would help with reconstruction the player assumes command of Team Alpha in Arizona While gathering pre war artifacts the Project fends off attacks from an organization called the New Paradigm another major survivalist organisation which is more advanced than the player s forces Later however it is discovered that a self aware computer virus named Nexus is actually controlling the New Paradigm br After the player defeats the New Paradigm they are assigned to Team Beta which is based in Chicago and under attack by a faction called The Collective Again the player starts out less advanced than The Collective and it is discovered that Nexus is controlling this faction too At the end of the campaign Nexus launches nuclear missiles at Alpha and Beta bases prompting the player to abandon the facility and move to the Gamma base br Upon arriving at Gamma base the player is immediately ambushed by the Gamma forces which have already been taken over by Nexus After the player survives the ambush and develops countermeasures to Nexus infection Nexus takes control of the remaining NASDA satellites and attempts to destroy the player However before he can succeed the Project captures a NASDA missile site and shoots down the orbiting laser weapons It is learned that the scientist Dr Reed who was bankrupted by the US military transformed himself into the Nexus virus and was responsible for the nuclear holocaust by infiltrating the NASDA systems At this point the survivors of the Alpha and Beta bases arrive and the three Project teams launch a full scale assault on Nexus The Project destroys Nexus and can begin rebuilding civilization br br br Gameplay br br The game is fully D based on the iViS D graphics engine developed by Sam Kerbeck of Eidos Interactive The game world is mapped by a grid vehicles tilt to meet hilly terrain and projectiles can be realistically blocked by steep mountains or buildings The camera is free moving and can zoom in and out rotate and pan up or down while navigating the battlefield br In the game units of different factions are painted different colors The New Paradigm the Collective and Nexus are the enemies of the Project in the campaign and they can be seen attacking Project forces as well as Scavengers survivors of the nuclear fallout br Units can all be customized according to chassis which for example takes weight and power into account drive system such as wheels or tracks and mounted object such as a weapon or one of various support tools Units can earn experience Earning experience causes units to level up from ranks such as Rookie to Trained and Professional br Warzone places an emphasis on sensors and radar to detect units and to coordinate ground attacks Counter battery sensors detect enemy artillery by sensing their projectiles and firing arcs and pinpointing their location to coordinate artillery strikes against enemy artillery VTOL Vertical Take Off and Landing sensors work like basic sensors only they coordinate VTOL airstrikes VTOL counter battery sensors coordinate VTOLs to find and destroy enemy artillery batteries br There is an emphasis on artillery although many direct and close combat weapons and anti air weapons can be researched and deployed artillery is a staple of assault on enemy bases and outposts While the technology tree is clearly defined and consistent it never appears in game and therefore the player can be left guessing as to what technology is next in the tree Technology can be acquired by gathering artifacts left behind by certain destroyed enemy structures or units Researching is composed of largely small and incremental advancements over existing weapons armor and chassis types br Some levels require the player to achieve the objective within a time limit whilst some without these limits can be used to gather power In Away missions the player must select a limited group of units to transport to a territory completely removed from the original base br All of the terrain throughout the campaign is essentially composed of three areas with different sectors for Away missions and other such levels upon progression previous maps simply expand and the player s original bases from past levels are maintained Also its resource system is quite different from mainstream RTS games Oil Derricks are established over specific scarce locations which constantly provide a slow fixed rate of income Combined with a mission time limit this resource method makes it generally infeasible for players to utilize certain traditional RTS tactics such as turtling fortifying one or more bases against enemy attack while stockpiling resources with which to produce a massive army br However there are certain missions throughout the game that do not have a time limit and in these missions it is possible to use more traditional RTS tactics to prepare for subsequent timed missions br br br History br Warzone was originally developed by Pumpkin Studios and published by Eidos Interactive In it was originally released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation After having released patch final in November Pumpkin Studios ended their support for Warzone at January On March Pumpkin Studios was closed down by Eidos Interactive Pumpkin Studios later reformed as Pivotal Games br br br End of support and fan patch br After the official support ended with the dissolution of Pumpkin Studios a third party group of game enthusiasts N E W S T tried to continue the support in October Starting in November the group released unofficial patches which fixed many of the game s remaining problems In February Pumpkin the renamed N E W S T group sent a petition to copyright holder Eidos Interactive asking for permission to get and use the source code and art content br br br Open sourcing br On December Warzone s source code was uploaded to Radiosity s FTP server by Alex McLean of Pivotal Games Source code and artwork beside the movies of Warzone were placed under the GPL or later license making the game free and open source On June the license of the game was clarified distribution of movies and soundtrack was now permitted too br br br Community driven development br Following the release the game s community started a revival project based on the available source code and assets originally called Warzone Re Development Project it was later renamed to the Warzone Resurrection Project and then to the Warzone Project On June version of the Warzone Project was released with all proprietary technology replaced by free and open source alternatives As of the community development continues and has been officially released on the Microsoft Store Snap Store itch io and others br On February an unofficial version of Warzone was released on the Steam gaming platform Underdone Gaming has published only a Windows version of the game with questions about other platforms left unanswered The reception of the community to this release is generally negative and it is unlikely that community developers will aid technical support for the Steam version br br br Reception br br The game s new additions to the real time strategy genre were positively noted such as its create a unit feature persistent world D environments with control over a zoomable and rotatable floating camera variety of terrain and environments animated units diverse colors night and day mechanic and numerous features br GameSpot gave the PlayStation version a and the PC version a GameSpot praised the game for its high level of customizability and concluded Warzone s highly navigable D engine unique campaign structure and multiplayer gameplay should please most real time strategy fans br IGN shared similar sentiments rating the PC version and the PlayStation version IGN praised the PlayStation version for being one of the few RTS games on the system IGN praised this aspect by saying In the end the weird truth is that Warzone is one of the best RTS on the system In their PC review the author expressed disappointment with the lack of innovation but praised it nonetheless with the following comment Mostly it boils down to taking great ideas found in other RTS titles and combining them into one Pumpkin Studios did a fantastic job with that task and this one is certainly worth playing all the way through br GameRevolution noted problems in the presentation such as the uninspiring audio and fuzzy graphics and the lack of being able to save during gameplay The Playstation port was criticized for keeping the interface of the PC version which was unsuitable for the Playstation controller br br br See also br br List of free PC games br List of open source video games br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br br Official website br The Warzone Project on GitHub br
