title: Automotive suspension design process
id: 9160229
Automotive suspension design is an aspect of automotive engineering concerned with designing the suspension for cars and trucks Suspension design for other vehicles is similar though the process may not be as well established br The process entails br br Selecting appropriate vehicle level targets br Selecting a system architecture br Choosing the location of the hard points or theoretical centres of each ball joint or bushing br Selecting the rates of the bushings br Analysing the loads in the suspension br Designing the spring rates br Designing shock absorber characteristics br Designing the structure of each component so that it is strong stiff light and cheap br Analysing the vehicle dynamics of the resulting design br Since the s the use of multibody simulation and finite element software has made this series of tasks more straightforward br br br Vehicle level targets br A partial list would include br br Maximum steady state lateral acceleration in understeer mode br Roll stiffness degrees per g of lateral acceleration br Ride frequencies br Lateral load transfer percentage distribution front to rear br Roll moment distribution front to rear br Ride heights at various states of load br Understeer gradient br Turning circle br Ackermann br Jounce travel br Rebound travel br Once the overall vehicle targets have been identified they can be used to set targets for the two suspensions For instance the overall understeer target can be broken down into contributions from each end using a Bundorf analysis br br br System architecture br Typically a vehicle designer is operating within a set of constraints The suspension architecture selected for each end of the vehicle will have to obey those constraints For both ends of the car this would include the type of spring location of the spring and location of the shock absorbers br For the front suspension the following need to be considered br br The type of suspension MacPherson strut or double wishbone suspension br Type of steering actuator rack and pinion or recirculating ball br Location of the steering actuator in front of or behind the wheel centre br For the rear suspension there are many more possible suspension types in practice br br br Hardpoints br The hardpoints control the static settings and the kinematics of the suspension br The static settings are br br Toe br Camber br Caster br Roll center height at design load br Mechanical or caster trail br Anti dive and anti squat br Kingpin Inclination br Scrub radius br Spring and shock absorber motion ratios br The kinematics describe how important characteristics change as the suspension moves typically in roll or steer They include br br Bump Steer br Roll Steer br Tractive Force Steer br Brake Force Steer br Camber gain in roll br Caster gain in roll br Roll centre height gain br Ackermann change with steering angle br Track gain in roll br The analysis for these parameters can be done graphically or by CAD or by the use of kinematics software br br br Compliance analysis br The compliance of the bushings the body and other parts modify the behaviour of the suspension In general it is difficult to improve the kinematics of a suspension using the bushings but one example where it does work is the toe control bush used in Twist beam rear suspensions More generally modern cars suspensions include a Noise vibration and harshness NVH bush This is designed as the main path for the vibrations and forces that cause road noise and impact noise and is supposed to be tunable without affecting the kinematics too much br In racing cars bushings tend to be made of harder materials for good handling such as brass or delrin br In Passenger cars bushings tend to be made of softer material for added comfort br In general physical terms the mass and mechanical hysteresis damping effect of solid parts should be accounted for in a dynamic analysis as well as their elasticity br br br Loads br Once the basic geometry is established the loads in each suspension part can be estimated This can be as simple as deciding what a likely maximum load case is at the contact patch and then drawing a Free body diagram of each part to work out the forces or as complex as simulating the behaviour of the suspension over a rough road and calculating the loads caused Often loads that have been measured on a similar suspension are used instead this is the most reliable method br br br Detailed design of arms br The loads and geometry are then used to design the arms and spindle Inevitably some problems will be found in the course of this that force compromises to be made with the basic geometry of the suspension br br br br br br Notes br br br Sources br The Automotive Chassis Engineering
