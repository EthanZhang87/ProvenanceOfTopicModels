Design tools are objects media or computer programs which can be used to design They may influence the process of production expression and perception of design ideas and therefore need to be applied skillfully br br br Objects br New ideas can come by way of experimenting with tools and methods Some designers explore ideas using pencil and paper Others use many different mark making tools and resources from computers to sculpture as a means of inspiring creativity Traditionally objects like pencil compass ruler drawing triangle have been considered design tools and have been used to characterize design and designers One reason for the success of traditional design tools such as pencil and paper is that these tools can be used without any special knowledge and their usage facilitates a continuous flow of thoughts br br br Media br The appropriate development and presentation tools can substantially change how an audience perceives a project The media used for design can be divided in two categories visual and verbal Conventionally in areas like architecture industrial design or graphic design visual media are considered more important than verbal media In other areas like engineering the use of verbal design media may be prevalent br br br Visual br Visual design tools are for example gesture sketch drawing scale model perspective drawing photograph film video Eugene S Ferguson s paper in Science entitled The mind s eye Nonverbal thought in technology is credited for clarifying the role of visual reasoning in the thinking process In this article he reasoned that Thinking with pictures is an essential strand in the intellectual history of technological development He concludes his article with the following statement br br Much of the creative thought of the designers of our technological world is nonverbal not easily reducible to words its language is an object or a picture or a visual image in the mind It is out of this kind of thinking that the clock printing press and snowmobile have arisen Technologists converting their nonverbal knowledge into objects directly as when an artisan fashioned an American ax or into drawings that have enabled others to build what was in their minds have chosen the shape and many of the qualities of our man made surroundings This intellectual component of technology which is non literary and non scientific has been generally unnoticed because its origins lie in art and not in science As the scientific component of knowledge in technology has increased markedly in the th and th centuries the tendency has been to lose sight of the crucial part played by nonverbal knowledge in making the big decisions of form arrangement and texture that determine the parameters within which a system will operate br In his work claims Ferguson that visual reasoning is a widely used tool used in creating technological artefacts There is ample evidence that visual methods particularly drawing play a central role in creating artefacts br br br Verbal br Verbal design tools are for example metaphor description discussion critique theory algorithm calculation program br br br Computer programs br Computer programs have many functions which can be discussed in terms of design tools One of the most widely used design tools is computer aided design CAD software like Autodesk Inventor DSS SolidWorks or Pro Engineer which enables designers to create D models D drawings and schematics of their designs CAD together with Digital Mockup DMU and CAE software such as finite element method analysis or analytic element method allows designers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time consuming physical prototypes br There is some debate whether computers enhance the creative process of design Rapid production from the computer allows many designers to explore multiple ideas quickly with more detail than what could be achieved by traditional hand rendering or paste up on paper moving the designer through the creative process more quickly However being faced with limitless choices does not help isolate the best design solution and can lead to endless iterations with no clear design outcome A designer may use sketches to explore multiple or complex ideas quickly without the distractions and complications of software br br br See also br Design method br Design strategy br Reflective practice br Computer aided design br br br Bibliography br Design Creativity and Materialization Cottbus ISSN online at http www cloud cuckoo net openarchive wolke eng Subjects subject html br Elke Krasny Architektur beginnt im Kopf The Making of Architecture Basel Boston Berlin Birkh user ISBN br br br
