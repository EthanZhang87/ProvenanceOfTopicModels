id: 3054853
In geometry a three dimensional space D space space or rarely tri dimensional space is a mathematical space in which three values coordinates are required to determine the position of a point Most commonly it is the three dimensional Euclidean space that is the Euclidean space of dimension three which models physical space More general three dimensional spaces are called manifolds br The term may also refer colloquially to a subset of space a three dimensional region or D domain a solid figure br Technically a tuple of n numbers can be understood as the Cartesian coordinates of a location in a n dimensional Euclidean space The set of these n tuples is commonly denoted br br br br br br R br br br n br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R n br br and can be identified to the pair formed by a n dimensional Euclidean space and a Cartesian coordinate system br When n this space is called the three dimensional Euclidean space or simply Euclidean space when the context is clear In classical physics it serves as a model of the physical universe in which all known matter exists When relativity theory is considered it can be considered a local subspace of space time While this space remains the most compelling and useful way to model the world as it is experienced it is only one example of a large variety of spaces in three dimensions called manifolds In this classical example when the three values refer to measurements in different directions coordinates any three directions can be chosen provided that these directions do not lie in the same plane Furthermore if these directions are pairwise perpendicular the three values are often labeled by the terms width breadth height depth and length br br br History br Books XI to XIII of Euclid s Elements dealt with three dimensional geometry Book XI develops notions of orthogonality and parallelism of lines and planes and defines solids including parallelpipeds pyramids prisms spheres octahedra icosahedra and dodecahedra Book XII develops notions of similarity of solids Book XIII describes the construction of the five regular Platonic solids in a sphere br In the th century three dimensional space was described with Cartesian coordinates with the advent of analytic geometry developed by Ren Descartes in his work La G om trie and Pierre de Fermat in the manuscript Ad locos planos et solidos isagoge Introduction to Plane and Solid Loci which was unpublished during Fermat s lifetime However only Fermat s work dealt with three dimensional space br In the th century developments of the geometry of three dimensional space came with William Rowan Hamilton s development of the quaternions In fact it was Hamilton who coined the terms scalar and vector and they were first defined within his geometric framework for quaternions Three dimensional space could then be described by quaternions br br br br q br br a br br u br i br br v br j br br w br k br br br displaystyle q a ui vj wk br br which had vanishing scalar component that is br br br br a br br br br br displaystyle a br br While not explicitly studied by Hamilton this indirectly introduced notions of basis here given by the quaternion elements br br br br i br br j br br k br br br displaystyle i j k br br as well as the dot product and cross product which correspond to the negative of the scalar part and the vector part of the product of two vector quaternions br It was not until Josiah Willard Gibbs that these two products were identified in their own right and the modern notation for the dot and cross product were introduced in his classroom teaching notes found also in the textbook Vector Analysis written by Edwin Bidwell Wilson based on Gibbs lectures br Also during the th century came developments in the abstract formalism of vector spaces with the work of Hermann Grassmann and Giuseppe Peano the latter of whom first gave the modern definition of vector spaces as an algebraic structure br br br In Euclidean geometry br br br Coordinate systems br br In mathematics analytic geometry also called Cartesian geometry describes every point in three dimensional space by means of three coordinates Three coordinate axes are given each perpendicular to the other two at the origin the point at which they cross They are usually labeled x y and z Relative to these axes the position of any point in three dimensional space is given by an ordered triple of real numbers each number giving the distance of that point from the origin measured along the given axis which is equal to the distance of that point from the plane determined by the other two axes br Other popular methods of describing the location of a point in three dimensional space include cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates though there are an infinite number of possible methods For more see Euclidean space br Below are images of the above mentioned systems br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Lines and planes br Two distinct points always determine a straight line Three distinct points are either collinear or determine a unique plane On the other hand four distinct points can either be collinear coplanar or determine the entire space br Two distinct lines can either intersect be parallel or be skew Two parallel lines or two intersecting lines lie in a unique plane so skew lines are lines that do not meet and do not lie in a common plane br Two distinct planes can either meet in a common line or are parallel i e do not meet Three distinct planes no pair of which are parallel can either meet in a common line meet in a unique common point or have no point in common In the last case the three lines of intersection of each pair of planes are mutually parallel br A line can lie in a given plane intersect that plane in a unique point or be parallel to the plane In the last case there will be lines in the plane that are parallel to the given line br A hyperplane is a subspace of one dimension less than the dimension of the full space The hyperplanes of a three dimensional space are the two dimensional subspaces that is the planes In terms of Cartesian coordinates the points of a hyperplane satisfy a single linear equation so planes in this space are described by linear equations A line can be described by a pair of independent linear equations each representing a plane having this line as a common intersection br Varignon s theorem states that the midpoints of any quadrilateral in br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br form a parallelogram and hence are coplanar br br br Spheres and balls br br A sphere in space also called a sphere because it is a dimensional object consists of the set of all points in space at a fixed distance r from a central point P The solid enclosed by the sphere is called a ball or more precisely a ball br The volume of the ball is given by br br and the surface area of the sphere is br br Another type of sphere arises from a ball whose three dimensional surface is the sphere points equidistant to the origin of the euclidean space R If a point has coordinates P x y z w then x y z w characterizes those points on the unit sphere centered at the origin br This sphere is an example of a manifold a space which is looks locally like D space In precise topological terms each point of the sphere has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to an open subset of D space br br br Polytopes br br In three dimensions there are nine regular polytopes the five convex Platonic solids and the four nonconvex Kepler Poinsot polyhedra br br br Surfaces of revolution br br A surface generated by revolving a plane curve about a fixed line in its plane as an axis is called a surface of revolution The plane curve is called the generatrix of the surface A section of the surface made by intersecting the surface with a plane that is perpendicular orthogonal to the axis is a circle br Simple examples occur when the generatrix is a line If the generatrix line intersects the axis line the surface of revolution is a right circular cone with vertex apex the point of intersection However if the generatrix and axis are parallel then the surface of revolution is a circular cylinder br br br Quadric surfaces br br In analogy with the conic sections the set of points whose Cartesian coordinates satisfy the general equation of the second degree namely br br where A B C F G H J K L and M are real numbers and not all of A B C F G and H are zero is called a quadric surface br There are six types of non degenerate quadric surfaces br br Ellipsoid br Hyperboloid of one sheet br Hyperboloid of two sheets br Elliptic cone br Elliptic paraboloid br Hyperbolic paraboloid br The degenerate quadric surfaces are the empty set a single point a single line a single plane a pair of planes or a quadratic cylinder a surface consisting of a non degenerate conic section in a plane and all the lines of R through that conic that are normal to Elliptic cones are sometimes considered to be degenerate quadric surfaces as well br Both the hyperboloid of one sheet and the hyperbolic paraboloid are ruled surfaces meaning that they can be made up from a family of straight lines In fact each has two families of generating lines the members of each family are disjoint and each member one family intersects with just one exception every member of the other family Each family is called a regulus br br br In linear algebra br Another way of viewing three dimensional space is found in linear algebra where the idea of independence is crucial Space has three dimensions because the length of a box is independent of its width or breadth In the technical language of linear algebra space is three dimensional because every point in space can be described by a linear combination of three independent vectors br br br Dot product angle and length br A vector can be pictured as an arrow The vector s magnitude is its length and its direction is the direction the arrow points A vector in br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br can be represented by an ordered triple of real numbers These numbers are called the components of the vector br The dot product of two vectors A A A A and B B B B is defined as br br br br br br A br br br br B br br br br A

and is denoted by the symbol The cross product A B of the vectors A and B is a vector that is perpendicular to both and therefore normal to the plane containing them It has many applications in

br br br displaystyle mathbf C br br br One can in n dimensions take the product of n vectors to produce a vector perpendicular to all of them But if the product is limited to non trivial binary products with vector results it exists only in three and seven dimensions br br br Abstract description br br It can be useful to describe three dimensional space as a three dimensional vector space

displaystyle mathbb R br br can be viewed as the abstract vector space together with the additional structure of a choice of basis Conversely br br br br V br br br displaystyle V br br can be obtained by starting with br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br and forgetting the Cartesian product structure or equivalently the standard choice of basis br As opposed to a general vector space br br br br V br br br displaystyle V br br the space br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br is sometimes referred to as a coordinate space br Physically it is conceptually desirable to use the abstract formalism in order to assume as little structure as possible if it is not given by the parameters of a particular problem For example in a problem with rotational symmetry working with the more concrete description of three dimensional space br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br assumes a choice of basis corresponding to a set of axes But in rotational symmetry there is no reason why one set of axes is preferred to say the same set of axes which has been rotated arbitrarily Stated another way a preferred choice of axes breaks the rotational symmetry of physical space br Computationally it is necessary to work with the more concrete description br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br in order to do concrete computations br br br Affine description br br A more abstract description still is to model physical space as a three dimensional affine space br br br br E br br br br br br displaystyle E br br over the real numbers This is unique up to affine isomorphism It is sometimes referred to as three dimensional Euclidean space Just as the vector space description came from forgetting the preferred basis of br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br the affine space description comes from forgetting the origin of the vector space Euclidean spaces are sometimes called Euclidean affine spaces for distinguishing them from Euclidean vector spaces br This is physically appealing as it makes the translation invariance of physical space manifest A preferred origin breaks the translational invariance br br br Inner product space br br The above discussion does not involve the dot product The dot product is an example of an inner product Physical space can be modelled as a vector space which additionally has the structure of an inner product The inner product defines notions of length and angle and therefore in particular the notion of orthogonality For any inner product there exist bases under which the inner product agrees with the dot product but again there are many different possible bases none of which are preferred They differ from one another by a rotation an element of the group of rotations SO br br br In calculus br br br Gradient divergence and curl br In a
