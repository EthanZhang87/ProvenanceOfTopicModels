Video games are a major industry in Japan and the country is considered one of the most influential in video gaming Japanese game development is often identified with the golden age of video games and the country is home to many notable video game companies such as Nintendo Sega Taito Bandai Namco Entertainment Capcom Square Enix Konami NEC SNK and formerly Sony Computer Entertainment Japan is currently the third largest video game market in the world after China and the United States br The space is known for the catalogs of several major publishers all of whom have competed in the video game console and video arcade markets at various points Released in Periscope was a major arcade hit in Japan preceding several decades of success in the arcade industry there Nintendo a former hanafuda playing card vendor rose to prominence during the s with the release of the home video game console called the Famicom or Family Computer which became a major hit as the Nintendo Entertainment System NES internationally Sony already one of the world s largest electronics manufacturers entered the market in with the Sony PlayStation one of the first home consoles to feature D graphics almost immediately establishing itself as a major publisher in the space Shigeru Miyamoto remains internationally renowned as a father of video gaming and is the only game developer so far to receive Japan s highest civilian honor for artists the bunka k r sha or Person of Cultural Merit br Arcade culture is a major influence among young Japanese with Akihabara Electric Town being a major nexus of so called otaku culture in Japan which overlaps with video gaming heavily Japanese video game franchises such as Super Mario Pok mon The Legend of Zelda Sonic the Hedgehog Super Smash Bros Final Fantasy Street Fighter Kirby Metal Gear Devil May Cry Animal Crossing Tekken Kingdom Hearts Persona Resident Evil Dark Souls Monster Hunter and many others have gained critical acclaim and continue to garner a large international following The Japanese role playing game is a major game genre innovated by Japan and remains popular both domestically and internationally with titles like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest selling millions In the country had an estimate of million players in its game market br br br Gaming Platforms br br br Arcade machines br br br Mobile phones br Androids and iPhones reportedly had the highest player rate amongst its owners versus the player rate amongst owners of game consoles such as the PlayStation and the Wii This is most likely due to many Japanese people having daily long commutes on the train or bus versus time at home and the mobile phone being portable and convenient The main characteristic of mobiles games is being freemium and this monetization model is most commonly seen in gacha games In mobile game publishers had more than twice the ordinary income rate as console game publishers in Japan br br br Notable Genres br br br Japanese role playing games JRPGs br Role playing games RPGs originated from tabletop role playing games TRPGs in the West such as Dungeons Dragons D D In a Japanese translated version of D D was the first TRPG to be published in Japan TRPGs were not as popular in Japan compared to overseas but after Enix published Dragon Quest in RPGs began to gain traction amongst Japanese consumers Soon after multiple Japanese publishers were releasing RPG franchises such as Final Fantasy Persona Tales Pok mon The Legend of Zelda Ys Kingdom Hearts and many others that were very popular with Japanese and overseas consumers br The term JRPG was coined by Western media because Japanese developed RPGs had distinct elements that set it apart from RPGs developed in the West The settings in Western RPGs tend to be inspired by fantasy and science fiction literature while JRPGs have been inspired by anime and manga literature In addition Western RPGs tend to be open world and feature real time combat systems but JRPGs favor confining the player to smaller areas in the game world following a linear story line and most notably using turn based combat systems like in D D Although there was typically less freedom in JRPGs compared to Western RPGs the linear story lines allowed for Japanese developers to completely flesh out the character development of the player s companions and sometimes the player s character themselves This focus on narrative was different from the West s focus on expression through RPGs and JRPGs appealed to players all over the world because of their rich story lines However as of recently some Japanese developers are starting to try to appeal to a broader audience by introducing real time combat for example such as Final Fantasy XVI br br br Visual novels br Visual novels VNs are text based story video games where players can usually make decisions at multiple points of the story and achieve different endings VNs are novel like but also include character visuals and artwork to complement with different scenes in the story and sometimes voice acting Many visual don t feature many game play features besides decision making This decision making differentiated visual novels from regular novels as it allowed players to replay the game at certain decision points to make different decisions and see different endings Most VNs are romance stories and allow the player to choose between multiple love interests and fall under dating sims VNs often contained sexual content in the beginning when VNs were first developed for the PC but when VNs were starting to be published for game consoles as well family friendly versions were also released Like manga popular VNs were also adapted into anime such as Higurashi When They Cry Clannad Fate stay night Steins Gate and many others br Two big subgenres of VNs are bish jo and otome games Bish jo meaning beautiful girl in Japanese games are romance visual novels featuring a male protagonist with female love interests and are targeted towards straight men while otome meaning maiden in Japanese games feature a female protagonist with male love interests catering towards straight women br br br Gacha games br Gacha games are named after toy vending machines in Japan because of its lottery system After spending in game currency which can be bought with real money the player can get a random character or item Most often the characters that the player wants are rare and encourages the player to spend enough money until they get their desired character Notable Japanese gacha games include iDOLM STER Granblue Fantasy Fate Grand Order and others Gacha games can often have different game elements such as combat and serve as an RPG or contain rhythm game game play br br br History br br br Background br In Sega introduced an electro mechanical game called Periscope a submarine simulator which used lights and plastic waves to simulate sinking ships from a submarine It became an instant success in Japan Europe and North America where it was the first arcade game to cost a quarter per play which would remain the standard price for arcade games for many years to come br Sega later produced gun games that used rear image projection in a manner similar to the ancient zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen The first of these the light gun game Duck Hunt appeared in it featured animated moving targets on a screen printed out the player s score on a ticket and had volume controllable sound effects Another Sega release Missile a shooter featured electronic sound and a moving film strip to represent the targets on a projection screen br br br s to early s br The first arcade video game Atari Inc s Pong debuted in the United States in and led to a number of new American manufacturers to create their own arcade games to capitalize on the rising fad Several of these companies had Japanese partners and kept their overseas counterparts abreast of this new technology leading several Japanese coin operated electronic games makers to step into the arcade game market as well Taito and Namco were some of the early adopters of arcade games in Japan first distributing American games before developing their own Nintendo which at this time was primarily manufacturing traditional and electronic toys also entered the arcade game market in the latter part of the s br As in the United States many of the early Japanese arcade games were based on the principle of cloning gameplay established by popular titles to make new ones However several new concepts came out of these Japanese developed games and performed well in both Japan and in re licensed versions in the United States such as Taito s Speed Race and Gun Fight in Gun Fight notably when released by Midway Games in the U S was the first arcade game to use a microprocessor rather than discrete electronic components Sega s black and white boxing game Heavyweight Champ was released in as the first video game to feature fist fighting The first stealth games were Hiroshi Suzuki s Manbiki Shounen and Manbiki Shoujo Taito s Lupin III and Sega s br br Separately the first home video game console the Magnavox Odyssey had been released in the U S in of which Nintendo had partnered to manufacture the light gun accessory for the console while Atari began releasing home console versions of Pong in Japan s first home video game console was Epoch s TV Tennis Electrotennis It was followed by the first successful Japanese console Nintendo s Color TV Game in which was made in partnership with Mitsubishi Electronics Numerous other dedicated home consoles were made mostly by television manufacturers leading these systems to be called TV geemu or terebi geemu in Japan br br Eventually the arcade release of Space Invaders would mark the first major mainstream breakthrough for video games in Japan Created by Nishikado at Japan s Taito Space Invaders pitted the player against multiple enemies descending from the top of the screen at a constantly increasing speed The game used alien creatures inspired by The War of the Worlds by H G Wells because the developers were unable to render the movement of aircraft in turn the aliens replaced human enemies because of moral concerns regarding the portrayal of killing humans on the part of Taito As with subsequent shoot em ups of the time the game was set in space as the available technology only permitted a black background The game also introduced the idea of giving the player a number of lives It popularised a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon s movement and it was the first video game to popularise the concept of achieving a high score being the first to save the player s score The aliens of Space Invaders return fire at the protagonist making them the first arcade game targets to do so It set the template for the shoot em up genre and has influenced most shooting games released since then br br Taito s Space Invaders in proved to be the first blockbuster arcade video game Its success marked the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games Video game arcades sprang up in shopping malls and small corner arcades appeared in restaurants grocery stores bars and movie theaters all over Japan and other countries during the late s and early s Space Invaders Galaxian Pac Man and Bosconian were especially popular By the arcade video game industry was worth billion billion in Some games of this era were so popular that they entered popular culture The first to do so was Space Invaders The game was so popular upon its release in that an urban legend blamed it for a national shortage of yen coins in Japan leading to a production increase of coins to meet demand for the game although yen coin production was lower in and than in previous or subsequent years and the claim does not withstand logical scrutiny arcade operators would have emptied out their machines and taken the money to the bank thus keeping the coins in circulation Japanese arcade games during the golden age also had hardware unit sales at least in the tens of thousands including Ms Pac Man with over units Donkey Kong with over Galaxian with Donkey Kong Jr with and Mr Do with br Other Japanese arcade games established new concepts that would become fundamentals in video games Use of color graphics and individualized antagonists were considered strong evolutionary concepts among space ship games The Namco s Galaxian in introduced multi colored animated sprites That same year saw the release of SNK s debut shoot em up Ozma Wars notable for being the first action game to feature a supply of energy resembling a life bar a mechanic that has now become common in the majority of modern action games It also featured vertically scrolling backgrounds and enemies br br br s to early s br br From to Nintendo produced a line of handheld electronic games called Game Watch Created by game designer Gunpei Yokoi each Game Watch features a single game to be played on an LCD screen It was the earliest Nintendo product to gain major success br Mega Man known as Rockman Rokkuman in Japan is a Japanese science fiction video game franchise created by Capcom starring a series of robot characters each known by the moniker Mega Man Mega Man released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in was the first in a series that expanded to over games on multiple systems As of March the game series has sold million units worldwide br Konami s Scramble released in is a side scrolling shooter with forced scrolling It was the first scrolling shooter to offer multiple distinct levels Vertical scrolling shooters emerged around the same time Namco s Xevious released in is frequently cited as the first vertical scrolling shooter and although it was in fact preceded by several other games of that type it is considered one of the most influential br The first platform game to use scrolling graphics was Jump Bug a simple platform shooter game developed by Alpha Denshi br The North American video game industry was devastated by the video game crash but in Japan it was more of a surprise to developers and typically known in Japan as the Atari Shock After the video game crash analysts doubted the long term viability of the video game industry At the same time following a series of arcade game successes in the early s Nintendo made plans to create a cartridge based console called the Famicom which is short for Family Computer Masayuki Uemura designed the system The console was released on July as the Family Computer or Famicom for short alongside three ports of Nintendo s successful arcade games Donkey Kong Donkey Kong Jr and Popeye The Famicom was slow to gather momentum a bad chip set caused the initial release of the system to crash Following a product recall and a reissue with a new motherboard the Famicom s popularity soared becoming the best selling game console in Japan by the end of By industry observers stated that the NES s popularity had grown so quickly that the market for Nintendo cartridges was larger than that for all home computer software By mid million of Japanese households owned a Famicom one third by mid In June Nintendo of America s vice president of marketing Peter Main said that the Famicom was present in of Japan s households By the end of its run over million NES units had been sold throughout the world In Nintendo surpassed Toyota as Japan s most successful corporation br Because the NES was released after the video game crash of the early s many retailers and adults regarded electronic games as a passing fad so many believed at first that the NES would soon fade Before the NES Famicom Nintendo was known as a moderately successful Japanese toy and playing card manufacturer but the popularity of the NES Famicom helped the company grow into an internationally recognized name almost synonymous with video games as Atari had been and set the stage for Japanese dominance of the video game industry With the NES Nintendo also changed the relationship between console manufacturers and third party software developers by restricting developers from publishing and distributing software without licensed approval This led to higher quality software titles which helped change the attitude of a public that had grown weary from poorly produced titles for earlier game systems The system s hardware limitations led to design principles that still influence the development of modern video games Many prominent game franchises originated on the NES including Nintendo s own Super Mario Bros The Legend of Zelda and Metroid Capcom s Mega Man franchise Konami s Castlevania franchise Square s Final Fantasy and Enix s Dragon Quest franchises br Following the release of the Famicom Nintendo Entertainment System the global video game industry began recovering with annual sales exceeding billion by with of the market dominated by Nintendo In Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi noted that Atari collapsed because they gave too much freedom to third party developers and the market was swamped with rubbish games In response Nintendo limited the number of titles that third party developers could release for their system each year and promoted its Seal of Quality which it allowed to be used on games and peripherals by publishers that met Nintendo s quality standards br Japan s first personal computers for gaming soon appeared the Sord M in and Sharp MZ K in In Japan both consoles and computers became major industries with the console market dominated by Nintendo and the computer market dominated by NEC s PC and PC A key difference between Western and Japanese computers at the time was the display resolution with Japanese systems using a higher resolution of x to accommodate Japanese text which in turn affected video game design and allowed more detailed graphics Japanese computers were also using Yamaha s FM synth sound boards from the early s During the bit era the PC Sharp X and FM Towns became popular in Japan The X and FM Towns were capable of producing near arcade quality hardware sprite graphics and sound quality when they first released in the mid to late s br The Wizardry series translated by ASCII Entertainment became popular and influential in Japan even more so than at home Japanese developers created the action RPG subgenre in the early s combining RPG elements with arcade style action and action adventure elements The trend of combining role playing elements with arcade style action mechanics was popularized by The Tower of Druaga an arcade game released by Namco in June While the RPG elements in Druaga were very subtle its success in Japan inspired the near simultaneous development of three early action role playing games combining Druaga s real time hack and slash gameplay with stronger RPG mechanics all released in late Dragon Slayer Courageous Perseus and Hydlide A rivalry developed between the three games with Dragon Slayer and Hydlide continuing their rivalry through subsequent sequels The Tower of Druaga Dragon Slayer and Hydlide were influential in Japan where they laid the foundations for the action RPG genre influencing titles such as Ys and The Legend of Zelda br The action role playing game Hydlide was an early open world game rewarding exploration in an open world environment Hydlide influenced The Legend of Zelda an influential open world game Zelda had an expansive coherent open world design inspiring many games to adopt a similar open world design br Bokosuka Wars is considered an early prototype real time strategy game TechnoSoft s Herzog is regarded as a precursor to the real time strategy genre being the predecessor to Herzog Zwei and somewhat similar in nature Herzog Zwei released for the Sega Mega Drive Genesis home console in is the earliest example of a game with a feature set that falls under the contemporary definition of modern real time strategy br Data East s Karate Champ from is credited with establishing and popularizing the one on one fighting game genre and went on to influence Konami s Yie Ar Kung Fu from Capcom s Street Fighter introduced the use of special moves that could only be discovered by experimenting with the game controls Street Fighter II established the conventions of the fighting game genre and allowed players to play against each other br In Sega AM s Hang On designed by Yu Suzuki and running on the Sega Space Harrier hardware was the first of Sega s Super Scaler arcade system boards that allowed pseudo D sprite scaling at high frame rates The pseudo D sprite tile scaling was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture mapped polygonal D games of the s Designed by Sega AM s Yu Suzuki he stated that his designs were always D from the beginning All the calculations in the system were D even from Hang On I calculated the position scale and zoom rate in D and converted it backwards to D So I was always thinking in D It was controlled using a video game arcade cabinet resembling a motorbike which the player moves with their body This began the Taikan trend the use of motion controlled hydraulic arcade cabinets in many arcade games of the late s two decades before motion controls became popular on video game consoles br Sega s Space Harrier a rail shooter released in broke new ground graphically and its wide variety of settings across multiple levels gave players more to aim for than high scores also saw the release of Konami s Gradius which gave the player greater control over the choice of weaponry thus introducing another element of strategy The game also introduced the need for the player to memorise levels in order to achieve any measure of success Gradius with its iconic protagonist defined the side scrolling shoot em up and spawned a series spanning several sequels The following year saw the emergence of one of Sega s forefront series with its game Fantasy Zone The game received acclaim for its surreal graphics and setting and the protagonist Opa Opa was for a time considered Sega s mascot The game borrowed Defender s device of allowing the player to control the direction of flight and along with the earlier TwinBee is an early archetype of the cute em up subgenre br Hydlide II Shine of Darkness in featured an early morality meter where the player can be aligned with justice normal or evil which is affected by whether the player kills evil monsters good monsters or humans and in turn affects the reactions of the townsfolk towards the player In the same year Yuji Horii and his team at Chunsoft began production on Dragon Quest Dragon Warrior After Enix published the game in early it became the template for future console RPGs Horii s intention behind Dragon Quest was to create a RPG that appeals to a wider audience unfamiliar with the genre or video games in general This required the creation of a new kind of RPG that didn t rely on previous D D experience didn t require hundreds of hours of rote fighting and that could appeal to any kind of gamer The streamlined gameplay of Dragon Quest thus made the game more accessible to a wider audience than previous computer RPGs The game also placed a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement building on Horii s previous work Portopia Serial Murder Case but this time introducing a coming of age tale for Dragon Quest that audiences could relate to making use of the RPG level building gameplay as a way to represent this It also featured elements still found in most console RPGs like major quests interwoven with minor subquests an incremental spell system the damsel in distress storyline that many RPGs follow and a romance element that remains a staple of the genre alongside anime style art by Akira Toriyama and a classical score by Koichi Sugiyama that was considered revolutionary for console video game music With Dragon Quest becoming widely popular in Japan such that local municipalities were forced to place restrictions on where and when the game could be sold the Dragon Quest series is still considered a bellwether for the Japanese video game market br Shoot em ups featuring characters on foot rather than spacecraft became popular in the mid s in the wake of action movies such as Rambo First Blood Part II The origins of this type go back to Sheriff by Nintendo released in Taito s Front Line established the upwards scrolling formula later popularized by Capcom s Commando in and SNK s Ikari Warriors Commando also drew comparisons to Rambo and indeed contemporary critics considered military themes and protagonists similar to Rambo or Schwarzenegger prerequisites for a shoot em up as opposed to an action adventure game In Arsys Software released WiBArm a shooter that switched between a D side scrolling view in outdoor areas to a fully D polygonal third person perspective inside buildings while bosses were fought in an arena style D battle with the game featuring a variety of weapons and equipment br The late s to early s is considered the golden age of Japanese computer gaming which would flourish until its decline around the mid s as consoles eventually dominated the Japanese market A notable Japanese computer RPG from around this time was WiBArm the earliest known RPG to feature D polygonal graphics It was a role playing shooter released by Arsys Software for the PC in Japan and ported to MS DOS for Western release by Br derbund In WiBArm the player controls a transformable mecha robot switching between a D side scrolling view during outdoor exploration to a fully D polygonal third person perspective inside buildings while bosses are fought in an arena style D shoot em up battle The game featured a variety of weapons and equipment as well as an automap and the player could upgrade equipment and earn experience to raise stats Unlike first person RPGs at the time that were restricted to degree movements WiBArm s use of D polygons allowed full degree movement br br On October the PC Engine made its debut in the Japanese market and it was a tremendous success The console had an elegant eye catching design and it was very small compared to its rivals The PC Engine TurboGrafx known as TurboGrafx in the rest of the world was a collaborative effort between Hudson Soft who created video game software and NEC a major company which was dominant in the Japanese personal computer market with their PC and PC platforms br R Type an acclaimed side scrolling shoot em up was released in by Irem employing slower paced scrolling than usual with difficult levels calling for methodical strategies s Raiden was the beginning of another acclaimed and enduring series to emerge from this period In Square s D WorldRunner was an early stereoscopic D shooter played from a third person perspective followed later that year by its sequel JJ and the following year by Space Harrier D which used the SegaScope D shutter glasses Also in Konami created Contra as a coin op arcade game that was particularly acclaimed for its multi directional aiming and two player cooperative gameplay br Digital Devil Story Megami Tensei by Atlus for the Nintendo Famicom abandoned the common medieval fantasy setting and sword and sorcery theme in favour of a modern science fiction setting and horror theme It also introduced the monster catching mechanic with its demon summoning system which allowed the player to recruit enemies into their party through a conversation system that gives the player a choice of whether to kill or spare an enemy and allows them to engage any opponent in conversation Sega s original Phantasy Star for the Master System combined sci fi fantasy setting that set it apart from the D D staple It was also one of the first games to feature a female protagonist and animated monster encounters and allowed inter planetary travel between three planets Another title Miracle Warriors Seal of the Dark Lord was a third person RPG that featured a wide open world and a mini map on the corner of the screen br According to Wizardry developer Roe R Adams early action adventure games were basically arcade games done in a fantasy setting citing Castlevania and Trojan as examples IGN UK argues that The Legend of Zelda helped to establish a new subgenre of action adventure becoming a success due to how it combined elements from different genres to create a compelling hybrid including exploration adventure style inventory puzzles an action component a monetary system and simplified RPG style level building without the experience points The Legend of Zelda was the most prolific action adventure game series through to the s br The first Nintendo Space World show was held on July It was a video game trade show that was hosted by Nintendo until At the same year Phantasy Star II for the Genesis established many conventions of the RPG genre including an epic dramatic character driven storyline dealing with serious themes and subject matter and a strategy based battle system The game s science fiction story was also unique reversing the common alien invasion scenario by instead presenting Earthlings as the invading antagonists rather than the defending protagonists Capcom s Sweet Home for the NES introduced a modern Japanese horror theme and laid the foundations for the survival horror genre later serving as the main inspiration for Resident Evil Tengai Makyo Ziria released for the PC Engine CD that same year was the first RPG released on CD ROM and the first in the genre to feature animated cut scenes and voice acting The game s plot was also unusual for its feudal Japan setting and its emphasis on humour the plot and characters were inspired by the Japanese folk tale Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari The music for the game was also composed by noted musician Ryuichi Sakamoto br The golden age of console RPGs is often dated in the s Console RPGs distinguished themselves from computer RPGs to a greater degree in the early s As console RPGs became more heavily story based than their computer counterparts one of the major differences that emerged during this time was in the portrayal of the characters with most American computer RPGs at the time having characters devoid of personality or background as their purpose was to represent avatars which the player uses to interact with the world in contrast to Japanese console RPGs which depicted pre defined characters who had distinctive personalities traits and relationships such as Final Fantasy and Lufia with players assuming the roles of people who cared about each other fell in love or even had families Romance in particular was a theme that was common in most console RPGs but alien to most computer RPGs at the time Japanese console RPGs were also generally more faster paced and action adventure oriented than their American computer counterparts During the s console RPGs had become increasingly dominant br In Dragon Quest IV introduced a new method of storytelling segmenting the plot into segregated chapters The game also introduced an AI system called Tactics which allowed the player to modify the strategies used by the allied party members while maintaining full control of the hero Final Fantasy III introduced the classic job system a character progression engine allowing the player to change the character classes as well as acquire new and advanced classes and combine class abilities during the course of the game That same year also saw the release of Nintendo s Fire Emblem Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi a game that set the template for the tactical role playing game genre and was the first entry in the Fire Emblem series Another notable strategy RPG that year was Koei s Bandit Kings of Ancient China which was successful in combining the strategy RPG and management simulation genres building on its own Nobunaga s Ambition series that began in Several early RPGs set in a post apocalyptic future were also released that year including Digital Devil Story Megami Tensei II and Crystalis which was inspired by Hayao Miyazaki s Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind Crystalis also made advances to the action role playing game subgenre being a true action RPG that combined the real time action adventure combat and open world of The Legend of Zelda with the level building and spell casting of traditional RPGs like Final Fantasy That year also saw the release of Phantasy Star III Generations of Doom which featured an innovative and original branching storyline which spans three generations of characters and can be altered depending on which character the protagonist of each generation marries leading to four possible endings br In Final Fantasy IV was one of the first role playing games to feature a complex involving plot placing a much greater emphasis on character development personal relationships and dramatic storytelling It also introduced a new battle system the Active Time Battle system developed by Hiroyuki Ito where the time keeping system does not stop The fact that enemies can attack or be attacked at any time is credited with injecting urgency and excitement into the combat system The ATB combat system was considered revolutionary for being a hybrid between turn based and real time combat with its requirement of faster reactions from players appealing to those who were more used to action games br br Nintendo executives were initially reluctant to design a new system but as the market transitioned to the newer hardware Nintendo saw the erosion of the commanding market share it had built up with the Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo s fourth generation console the Super Famicom was released in Japan on November Nintendo s initial shipment of units sold out within hours Despite stiff competition from the Mega Drive Genesis console the Super NES eventually took the top selling position selling million units worldwide and would remain popular well into the fifth generation of consoles Nintendo s market position was defined by their machine s increased video and sound capabilities as well as exclusive first party franchise titles such as Super Mario World The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past and Super Metroid br In the early s the arcades experienced a major resurgence with the release of Capcom s Street Fighter II which popularized competitive fighting games and revived the arcade industry to a level of popularity not seen since the days of Pac Man setting off a renaissance for the arcade game industry in the early s Its success led to a wave of other popular games which mostly were in the fighting genre such as Fatal Fury King of Fighters by SNK Virtua Fighter by SEGA and The King of Fighters by SNK In Electronic Games noted that when historians look back at the world of coin op during the early s one of the defining highlights of the video game art form will undoubtedly focus on fighting martial arts themes which it described as the backbone of the industry at the time br A new type of shoot em up emerged in the early s variously termed bullet hell manic shooters maniac shooters and danmaku barrage these games required the player to dodge overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles and called for still more consistent reactions from players Bullet hell games arose from the need for D shoot em up developers to compete with the emerging popularity of D games huge numbers of missiles on screen were intended to impress players Toaplan s Batsugun provided the prototypical template for this new breed with Cave formed by former employees of Toaplan including Batsugun s main creator Tsuneki Ikeda after the latter company collapsed inventing the type proper with s DonPachi Bullet hell games marked another point where the shoot em up genre began to cater to more dedicated players Games such as Gradius had been more difficult than Space Invaders or Xevious but bullet hell games were yet more inward looking and aimed at dedicated fans of the genre looking for greater challenges While shooter games featuring protagonists on foot largely moved to D based genres popular long running series such as Contra and Metal Slug continued to receive new sequels Rail shooters have rarely been released in the new millennium with only Rez and Panzer Dragoon Orta achieving cult recognition br saw the release of Dragon Quest V a game that has been praised for its involving emotional family themed narrative divided by different periods of time something that has appeared in very few video games before or since It has also been credited as the first known video game to feature a playable pregnancy a concept that has since appeared in later games such as Story of Seasons Dragon Quest V s monster collecting mechanic where monsters can be defeated captured added to the party and gain their own experience levels also influenced many later franchises such as Pok mon Digimon and Dokapon In turn the concept of collecting everything in a game in the form of achievements or similar rewards has since become a common trend in video games Shin Megami Tensei released in for the SNES introduced an early moral alignment system that influences the direction and outcome of the storyline leading to different possible paths and multiple endings This has since become a hallmark of the Megami Tensei series Another non linear RPG released that year was Romancing Saga an open world RPG by Square that offered many choices and allowed players to complete quests in any order with the decision of whether or not to participate in any particular quest affecting the outcome of the storyline The game also allowed players to choose from eight different characters each with their own stories that start in different places and offer different outcomes Data East s Heracles no Eik III written by Kazushige Nojima introduced the plot element of a nameless immortal suffering from amnesia and Nojima would later revisit the amnesia theme in Final Fantasy VII and Glory of Heracles The TurboGrafx CD port of Dragon Knight II released that year was also notable for introducing erotic adult content to consoles though such content had often appeared in Japanese computer RPGs since the early s That same year Game Arts began the Lunar series on the Sega CD with Lunar The Silver Star one of the first successful CD ROM RPGs featuring both voice and text and considered one of the best RPGs in its time The game was praised for its soundtrack emotionally engaging storyline and strong characterization It also introduced an early form of level scaling where the bosses would get stronger depending on the protagonist s level a mechanic that was later used in Enix s The th Saga and extended to normal enemies in Square s Romancing Saga and later Final Fantasy VIII br D polygon graphics were popularized by the Sega Model games Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter followed by racing games like the Namco System title Ridge Racer and Sega Model title Daytona USA and light gun shooters like Sega s Virtua Cop gaining considerable popularity in the arcades br In Square s Secret of Mana the second in the Mana series further advanced the action RPG subgenre with its introduction of cooperative multiplayer into the genre The game was created by a team previously responsible for the first three Final Fantasy titles Nasir Gebelli Koichi Ishii and Hiromichi Tanaka The game received considerable acclaim for its innovative pausable real time battle system the Ring Command menu system its innovative cooperative multiplayer gameplay where the second or third players could drop in and out of the game at any time rather than players having to join the game at the same time and the customizable AI settings for computer controlled allies The game has influenced a number of later action RPGs That same year also saw the release of Phantasy Star IV The End of the Millennium which introduced the use of pre programmable combat manoeuvers called macros a means of setting up the player s party AI to deliver custom attack combos That year also saw the release of Romancing Saga which further expanded the non linear gameplay of its predecessor While in the original Romancing Saga scenarios were changed according to dialogue choices during conversations Romancing Saga further expanded on this by having unique storylines for each character that can change depending on the player s actions including who is chosen what is said in conversation what events have occurred and who is present in the party PCGamesN credits Romancing SaGa for having laid the foundations for modern Japanese RPGs with its progressive non linear open world design and subversive themes br In Final Fantasy VI moved away from the medieval setting of its predecessors instead being set in a steampunk environment The game received considerable acclaim and is seen as one of the greatest RPGs of all time for improvements such as its broadened thematic scope plotlines characters multiple choice scenarios and variation of play Final Fantasy VI dealt with mature themes such as suicide war crimes child abandonment teen pregnancy and coping with the deaths of loved ones Square s Live A Live released for the Super Famicom in Japan featured eight different characters and stories with the first seven unfolding in any order the player chooses as well as four different endings The game s ninja chapter in particular was an early example of stealth game elements in an RPG requiring the player to infiltrate a castle rewarding the player if the entire chapter can be completed without engaging in combat Other chapters had similar innovations such as Akira s chapter where the character uses telepathic powers to discover information Robotrek by Quintet and Ancient was a predecessor to Pok mon in the sense that the protagonist does not himself fight but sends out his robots to do so Like Pok mon Robotrek was designed to appeal to a younger audience allowed team customization and each robot was kept in a ball br FromSoftware released their first video game titled King s Field as a launch title for the PlayStation in The game was later called the brainchild of company founder Naotoshi Zin who was considered a key creative figure in the series The eventual success of the first King s Field prompted the development of sequels establishing the King s Field series The design of King s Field would influence later titles by FromSoftware including Shadow Tower Demon s Souls and the Dark Souls series The latter would propel FromSoftware to international fame br In Square s Romancing Saga featured a storyline that could be told differently from the perspectives of up to eight different characters and introduced a level scaling system where the enemies get stronger as the characters do a mechanic that was later used in a number of later RPGs including Final Fantasy VIII Sega s Sakura Wars for the Saturn combined
