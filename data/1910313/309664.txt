title: Fog of war
id: 309664
The fog of war German Nebel des Krieges is the uncertainty in situational awareness experienced by participants in military operations The term seeks to capture the uncertainty regarding one s own capability adversary capability and adversary intent during an engagement operation or campaign Military forces try to reduce the fog of war through military intelligence and friendly force tracking systems br The term has become commonly used to define uncertainty mechanics in wargames br br br Origin br The word fog German Nebel but not the exact phrase in reference to uncertainty in war was introduced by the Prussian military analyst Carl von Clausewitz in his posthumously published book Vom Kriege the English translation of which was published as On War br br War is the realm of uncertainty three quarters of the factors on which action in war is based are wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty A sensitive and discriminating judgment is called for a skilled intelligence to scent out the truth br It has been pointed out that von Clausewitz does not use the exact phrase fog of war and also uses multiple similar metaphors such as twilight and moonlight to describe a lack of clarity br The first known use of the exact phrase in text dates to in a poem entitled The Battle of Bunker Hill by McDonald Clarke The poem describes an assault by British forces upon an American redoubt during the Battle of Bunker Hill br br Will they dare a third attack br Is a question seen in every eye Old Put across the neck and back br Rides slowly their vengeance to defy br Wildy in that deadly hour br The Ramparts shove their bolted shower br While mid the waving fog of war br Thunders the Yankee s loud hurrah br br The first known attempt to explicitly define the fog of war in a military text was made in in a book titled The Fog of War by Sir Lonsdale Augustus Hale where it is described as the state of ignorance in which commanders frequently find themselves as regards the real strength and position not only of their foes but also of their friends br br br Military br br The fog of war is a reality in all military conflict Precision and certainty are unattainable goals but modern military doctrine suggests a trade off of precision and certainty for speed and agility Militaries employ command and control C systems and doctrine to partially alleviate the fog of war br The term also applies to the experience of individual soldiers in battle often cited is the pure confusion of direction location and perspective on a battlefield Officers and soldiers become separated orders become confused and subject to revision with poor communication Sounds and vision are limited from the perspective of the individual and may not be easily resolved resulting in a continuing uncertainty a perceptual fog br The fog of war has been decreasing as intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance technology is improving In Chief of Staff of the United States Army Gen Mark A Milley stated that On the future battlefield if you stay in one place longer than two or three hours you will be dead With enemy drones and sensors constantly on the hunt for targets there won t even be time for four hours unbroken sleep br br br Simulations and games br br Abstract and military board games sometimes try to capture the effect of the fog of war by hiding the identity of playing pieces by keeping them face down or turned away from the opposing player as in Stratego or covered as in Squad Leader Other games such as the Dark chess and Kriegspiel chess variants playing pieces could be hidden from the players by using a duplicate hidden game board br Another version of fog of war emulation is used by block wargaming where much like Stratego the blocks face each player hiding their value However this also allows for incremental damage where the block is rotated up to four times to indicate battle damage before the unit is eliminated from the playing field br Solitaire games also by their nature attempt to recreate fog of war using random dice rolls or card draws to determine events Complex double blind miniature wargames including military simulations may make use of two identical maps or model landscapes one or more referees providing limited intelligence to the opposing sides participants in the roles of sub unit leaders and the use of radio sets or intercoms br br br In video games br br A computer s ability to effectively hide information from a player is seen as a distinct advantage over board games when simulating war Fog of war in strategy video games refers to enemy units and often terrain being hidden from the player this is lifted once the area is explored but the information is often fully or partially re hidden whenever the player does not have a unit in that area br The earliest use of fog of war was in the game Empire by Walter Bright Another early use of fog of war was the game Tanktics designed by Chris Crawford which was criticized for its unreliable and confusing fog of war system Crawford in suggested limit ing the amount of information available to the human player to compensate for the computer s lack of intelligence In a Computer Gaming World article Dave Arneson called fog of war one of the biggest plus factors in computer simulations while Crawford concluded using Tanktics as an example that video game fog of war systems became less fun the more realistic they were leading the medium to instead use simplified systems br Two large Blizzard franchises Warcraft and StarCraft use a fog of war which only reveals terrain features and enemy units through a player s reconnaissance Without a unit actively observing previously revealed areas of the map are subject to a shroud through which only terrain is visible but changes in enemy units or bases are not This is also common in both turn based and real time strategy games such as League of Legends the Close Combat series Total War series Age of Empires series Red Alert series Advance Wars series Fire Emblem series Sid Meier s Civilization series and the Supreme Commander series br Fog of war gives players an incentive to uncover a game s world A compulsion to reveal obscured parts of a map has been described to give a sense of exploring the unknown Crawford said that reasonable uses of fog of war such as needing to send out scouts not only seem natural but add to the realism and excitement of the game Merchant Prince displays over unexplored territory what Computer Gaming World described as a renaissance style map of dubious accuracy In some strategy games that make use of fog of war enemy AI may have knowledge of the positions of all other units and buildings on the map regardless to compensate for lack of true intelligence which players may consider as cheating if discovered A designer may use fog of war to keep a game that has become impossible to win enjoyable by hiding this fact from the player br
