id: 31462586
In chemical biology and biomolecular engineering rational design RD is an umbrella term which invites the strategy of creating new molecules with a certain functionality based upon the ability to predict how the molecule s structure specifically derived from motifs will affect its behavior through physical models This can be done either from scratch or by making calculated variations on a known structure and usually complements directed evolution br br br Applications br As an example rational design is used to decipher collagen stability mapping ligand receptor interactions unveiling protein folding and dynamics and creating extra biological structures by using fluorinated amino acids To treat cancer rational design is used for targeted therapies where proteins are engineered to modify the communication of cells with their environment There is also the rational design of alfa alkyl auxin molecules which are auxin analogs capable of binding and blocking the formation of the hormone receptor complex br Other applications of rational design include br br Protein design br Nucleic acid design br Drug design br Pathway design br br br
