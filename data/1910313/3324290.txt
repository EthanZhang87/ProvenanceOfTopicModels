id: 3324290
An episodic video game is a video game of a shorter length that is commercially released as an installment to a continuous and larger series Episodic games differ from conventional video games in that they often contain less content but are developed on a more frequent basis br Such a series may or may not have continuity but will always share settings characters and or themes Episodic production in this manner has become increasingly popular among video game developers since the advent of low cost digital distribution systems which can immensely reduce their distribution overhead and make episodes financially viable Alternatively it can be used to describe the narrative of the game Examples of episodic video games include most Telltale games Alan Wake BioShock Infinite Burial at Sea Grand Theft Auto Episodes from Liberty City Life Is Strange Resident Evil Revelations and Revelations Half Life Episode One and Two and Star Trek Online br br br Concept br To consumers episodic games are very similar in nature to expansion packs An expansion is an add on to an original non episodic product however something of a lower order In an episodic series there is no dominant first game each installment although perhaps of the same length and price point as an expansion is a main event that drives the core experience forward This particular aspect of this type of game underpins the developer focus on the game s story br In terms of the narrative framework episodic games tend to end in cliffhangers because it serves as a tool to deploy a seamless transition These scenes are also dramatic drawing the interest of the players so that they anxiously await for the next installment br br br Advantages br Episodic games have several advantages A cheaper purchase price per episode leads to lower immediate risk for consumers and increased uptake Other benefits include br br The lack of the safety net for disengaging periods provided by longer less focused games coupled with the need to keep consumers on board for multiple release produces greater motivation for the production of quality and innovative titles br Exposure and experience from early episodes can benefit the production quality of future releases br Lower risk investment for the developers as the games cost less to develop and to sell and are quicker onto the market br Higher quality of life for developers with more manageable focused projects br Faster games to market as many high production titles often take anywhere from years to complete with episodic gaming the wait time is often reduced to an annual or semi annual basis br Developing in smaller chunks means developers can better adapt to community feedback in between releases br The developer gets several chances to hit the market with a lower level of risk each time as opposed to a single chance to make good a lone product that has far more investment riding on it br New advancements can be added to the next release br br br Disadvantages br Essentially the business model of the episodic gaming is still considered high risk for developers due to the fact that this type of game is still new compared to traditional video games and its development thus entails a number of risks Experts cite that this can be demonstrated in the limited number of successes of episodic game ventures Specific disadvantages include the following br br After buying all episodes the total cost for consumers may be more than that of the typical game br Some developers choose the episodic model because they lack the resources to complete a full length game and hope the sales of episodes will fund further development If earlier episodes fail to sell then funding for future episodes may suffer or disappear forcing developers to renege on promises of future episodes and cut storylines short Notable episodic series that have been aborted early include Sin Episodes Bone and Insecticide br Certain game designs would find it counter productive to use this method as opposed to plainly producing a full fledged sequel or series of titles simply because the nature of the game is difficult or impossible to split into episodes Examples include sandbox titles such as the GTA and Sims series br Most episodic content is distributed primarily or exclusively over the internet to offset the potential extra costs of distributing more physical copies to retail e g hard copies for chapters over years as opposed to shipping a single item once This is a disadvantage to consumers with limited or slow internet access who might have to wait for a physically published collection of episodes or never get anything at all It is particularly onerous if the game s chapters are all available only through online systems e g Sonic the Hedgehog for Wiiware PSN Xbox Live Arcade br Some content will always need to be created up front for example rendering technology This makes bespoke engine software unsuitable in its complex modern form br A player trying to progress through a series of episodes may find the technological advances over time distracting in extreme cases they may even be put off by the primitive techniques used in episodes produced years before br br br Single player episodic gaming br The first episodic game appeared in Automated Simulations Dunjonquest series started with Temple of Apshai and in the same year several mini episodes using the same game system and world were released The sequel Hellfire Warrior and several full sized add on packs for both main games followed Wizardry was likewise appended with additional scenarios that allowed importing of the first games save data br Following Nihon Falcom s expansion pack Xanadu Scenario II for the action role playing game Dragon Slayer II Xanadu the fifth Dragon Slayer title Sorcerian in introduced a scenario system where the player can play through fifteen scenarios in their order of choice Soon after additional expansion packs were released containing a number of new scenarios The game introduced an aging system where one or more years pass by and the characters age during each scenario with the additional scenario packs in mind That same year saw the beginning of the Kroz series a seven part series of games featuring similar text based graphics and gameplay with renewed levels These were not released on a regular schedule but were sold in packages with the first episode being available freely as shareware During the Italian publisher Simulmondo published several games in bite sized episodes among them the comic book adaption Diabolik Episodes and the original series Time Runners Episodes br Adventure games Shin Onigashima Y y ki and Famicom Tantei Club series for the Family Computer Disk System were released in two disks with both disks being separate releases but forming a single game br Single player games particularly real time strategy games and first person shooters have in the past experimented with a limited form of episodic gaming by adding new stages levels weapons enemies or missions with expansion packs Early examples include Wing Commander Secret Ops which was released episodically over the internet in However this series was a failure and was discontinued after it failed to attract significant player numbers One of the contributing factors was its MB download size which may have been prohibitively large in an age in which k internet access was the norm Limitations in bandwidth have also been cited as one of the reasons for the failure of the episodic alternate reality game Majestic as it required an initial download of an hour or more on a dial up connection br Another example of a more casual episodic game is Goodnight Mister Snoozleberg an online game created by Sarbakan that was released in on TF s website later on CBC and now available for download on Trygames El Dorado s Gate was a Japan only episodic game released by Capcom in br Kuma Reality Games has developed first person shooter episodic games since its inception in Some of the game isodes that the company has developed include The DinoHunters which documents a group of off key time travelers hunting dinosaurs and other prehistoric beasts and the controversial Kuma War which focuses on recent military action in the world especially in Iraq and Afghanistan Recently Kuma Games produced a series mirroring The History Channel s Shootout series The games created were modeled on the battles featured in the TV show adding another level of media depth to episodic gaming in general br From to the world s first digital satellite radio broadcaster St GIGA transmitted episodic video games with voice acted overdubs a technique called SoundLink to be played in Japan on partner Nintendo s Super Famicom video game console with its Satellaview peripheral The first SoundLink title BS Zelda no Densetsu was released in four discrete broadcast episodes starting in August Nintendo has said it to be the world s first integrated radio game br Shining Force III is a three part RPG released by Sega for the Sega Saturn between and The narrative of the game was distributed through three distinct scenarios each showing a part of the complete story br Other games have contemplated going the route of episodic development and distribution only to decide against it Examples of this include Quantic Dream s Fahrenheit Ubisoft s Rayman Origins and a planned series of episodes starring Duke Nukem by ARUSH Entertainment br Valve s Steam platform is being used as a content delivery platform for several episodic games including Half Life Episodes developed by Valve themselves br Telltale Games is one of the heaviest supporters of episodic gaming thus far as well as its successor AdHoc Studio after its closure Their game Bone is an adventure title that literally adapts chapters from Jeff Smith s Bone comic book saga into game episodes on a periodic basis with two episodes having been released Telltale s Sam Max Save the World was their first fully completed episodic series followed by Sam Max Beyond Time and Space and Sam Max The Devil s Playhouse Other series based on various other franchises include Strong Bad s Cool Game for Attractive People Wallace and Gromit s Grand Adventures Tales of Monkey Island Back to the Future The Game and The Walking Dead br Minerva is a single player modification that has adopted an episodic development structure It is one of the first mods to do so for Valve s Half Life br Turner Broadcasting s GameTap has made large investments in episodic game development The online game service s first episodic game Sam Max was co published with Telltale Games Each episode premiered on GameTap days before becoming available on the Telltale Games web site GameTap s second foray into episodic games was monthly content deliveries for Myst Online Uru Live an online massive multiplayer game by Cyan Worlds In February GameTap announced a third episodic game Galactic Command Echo Squad developed in conjunction with AD Their most recently announced game the episode American McGee s Grimm was announced in May for an early launch GameTap s VP of content Ricardo Sanchez has written for sites like Gamasutra and GameDaily and presented at the D I C E Summit on the subject His Three Laws of Episodics lay out rules by which GameTap determines whether a title is episodic or not and rules out Bone and Half Life Episodes due to the unknown duration of time between episodes br Dimps and Sonic Team created the episodic video game Sonic the Hedgehog for various formats the first episode of which was released in October with Episode released in May A third episode was planned but was canceled br Telltale s episodic adventure games inspired Roy and Ronen Gluzman to revive their popular Israeli video game franchise Piposh with a four part entry br As of Deltarune is being released in an episodic format The first two chapters of the game are available together as a free demo and the third and fourth chapters have been announced as releasing in a paid bundle The game s menu implies there will be seven chapters however Toby Fox has only officially confirmed the first five br br br Massively multiplayer online gaming br Since episodic gaming is mostly driven through linear storytelling outside of story driven single player games it is mostly found in MMOGs Much as they worked for offline games expansion packs have often been sold to increase available content to MMOG players by adding additional worlds to explore and additional gameplay features such as new weapons and characters br As the term relates to this genre episodes are typically contrasted to the traditional expansion pack as in the Asheron s Call franchise where episodic content was downloaded without an additional fee to the standing subscription price This included new expansive story arcs comparable to those found in offline RPGs and were updated on a bi monthly basis Retail expansion packs were still created for the Asheron s Call games br Another MMOG featuring an episodic design is the Guild Wars series developed by ArenaNet The company s business model involves releasing new independent chapters for the game on a six month basis Since Guild Wars does not charge a monthly fee and there is no requirement to own the newer chapters it is one of the few games entirely reliant on the episodic games model to continue its service To this end Guild Wars Factions was released on April which was subsequently followed by Guild Wars Nightfall released worldwide on October and finally Guild Wars Eye of the North on August br br br See also br Gaiden br br br br br br Other sources br Catalin Z Alexandru December Episodic
