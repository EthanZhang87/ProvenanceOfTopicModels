id: 1193299
In shooter games rocket jumping is the technique of using the knockback of an explosive weapon most often a rocket launcher to launch the shooter into the air The aim of this technique is to reach heights distances and speed that standard character movement cannot achieve Although the origin of rocket jumping is unclear its usage was popularized by Quake br Rocket jumping is used often in competitive play where it can allow the player to gain quick bursts of speed reach normally unobtainable heights secure positional advantages or in speedrunning However a potential consequence of rocket jumping is that it can injure the player either from the blast or from fall damage This effect makes the technique less useful in games where the damage from the blast and or fall is high or where health is difficult to replenish such as in Half Life where rocket jumps leave the player with approximately health Rocket jumping from standing is impractical in real life and would be certainly fatal if attempted However ejection seats from an aircraft are in effect a combination of a seated rocket jump and a parachute br br br In the Quake series br While using explosives to propel oneself was first seen in Doom the modern technique became a core mechanic in Quake By exploiting the physics of the Quake engine many advanced movement techniques were spawned such as circle jumping strafing bunny hopping and explosive jumping Rocket jumping was kept as an intentional mechanic for the leading games in the Quake series In Quake III Arena some of the computer controlled opponents use rocket jumps br br br Forms br Rocket jumping has appeared in several games in a variety of forms sometimes as a form of emergent gameplay br br br Horizontal br A horizontal form of rocket jumping appears in Doom where it is used to reach the secret exit in E M br br br Vertical br The first games to feature vertical rocket jumping were Bungie s Marathon and D Realms Rise of the Triad which were both released on the same day It was featured the same year on The Outfoxies Rocket jumping became very popular in the original Quake and was used as an advanced technique for deathmatch play as well as for the Quake done Quick series br In the game Team Fortress the Soldier class can use his rockets to rocket jump This is an intentional feature with several mechanics associated with it The game features numerous unlockable weapons with attributes that only affect rocket jumping or only apply while rocket jumping The Demoman class can achieve a similar effect using his own assortment of explosive weapons such as the Stickybomb Launcher or by crouching and jumping with his Ullapool Caber melee weapon It is also possible to use knockback provided by enemy explosives to perform a similarly boosted jump as any class br In Minecraft the player can activate TNT in order to propel themselves While it is usually fatal when attempted equipping armour can allow players to survive the blast damage enabling it to be used as a form of transportation It can also be attempted with creepers in game entities that explode upon close contact br In Overwatch multiple characters have explosive projectiles that can be used to rocket jump br br br Other variations br A similar technique can often be performed with other explosives such as grenades remotely detonated bombs or explosive objects in the level depending on the game these might be more equally or less viable alternatives to rocket jumps br Some games offer weapons that knock the user back with their recoil In the Unreal series of games in addition to traditional rocket jumps the weapons can be charged up for a powerful melee attack that can be aimed at the ground to boost the player In Half Life the tau cannon can be charged for a stronger attack that pushes the user back in the multiplayer mode of the game the weapon charges up faster and the knockback is increased to a point where it can also be directed vertically allowing players to use this as a form of mobility In the Halo game franchise players often use guns such as the Concussion rifle or Frag grenades to launch the player faster or higher for speedrunning purposes or to reach normally unreachable areas or easter eggs br In Fortnite Battle Royale it is possible to ride launched missiles to reach other places that are time consuming difficult or impossible to access on foot provided that the rider safely disembarks at a nearby platform before the missile explodes This technique called rocket riding does not follow the typical definition of rocket jumping in that it does not leverage the force of a rocket explosion but can be seen to be related to it in that it inherits its risks br br br Outside video games br Rocket jumping has appeared in other media as well br br In the live action film Transformers the character Ironhide performs a rocket jump over a screaming woman after transforming from his truck mode br In the film Planet Terror lead character Cherry Darling uses her false leg a machine gun with underslung grenade launcher to rocket jump over a tall wall br In the film Tokyo Gore Police lead character Ruka uses a bazooka to rocket jump to a building s rooftop br In Freddie Wong s and Brandon Laatsch s video The Rocket Jump the rocket jump is featured as the main part of the YouTube short This later influenced their channel and studio into being renamed RocketJump br In the episode The Librarians and the Point of Salvation of the second season of the TV series The Librarians rocket jumping is specifically referred to but done using grenades br br br
