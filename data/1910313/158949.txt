CiteSeerX formerly called CiteSeer is a public search engine and digital library for scientific and academic papers primarily in the fields of computer and information science br CiteSeer s goal is to improve the dissemination and access of academic and scientific literature As a non profit service that can be freely used by anyone it has been considered part of the open access movement that is attempting to change academic and scientific publishing to allow greater access to scientific literature CiteSeer freely provided Open Archives Initiative metadata of all indexed documents and links indexed documents when possible to other sources of metadata such as DBLP and the ACM Portal To promote open data CiteSeerX shares its data for non commercial purposes under a Creative Commons license br CiteSeer is considered a predecessor of academic search tools such as Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search CiteSeer like engines and archives usually only harvest documents from publicly available websites and do not crawl publisher websites For this reason authors whose documents are freely available are more likely to be represented in the index br CiteSeer changed its name to ResearchIndex at one point and then changed it back br br br History br br br CiteSeer and CiteSeer IST br CiteSeer was created by researchers Lee Giles Kurt Bollacker and Steve Lawrence in while they were at the NEC Research Institute now NEC Labs Princeton New Jersey US CiteSeer s goal was to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the web and use autonomous citation indexing to permit querying by citation or by document ranking them by citation impact At one point it was called ResearchIndex br CiteSeer became public in and had many new features unavailable in academic search engines at that time These included br br Autonomous Citation Indexing automatically created a citation index that can be used for literature search and evaluation br Citation statistics and related documents were computed for all articles cited in the database not just the indexed articles br Reference linking allowing browsing of the database using citation links br Citation context showed the context of citations to a given paper allowing a researcher to quickly and easily see what other researchers have to say about an article of interest br Related documents were shown using citation and word based measures and an active and continuously updated bibliography is shown for each document br CiteSeer was granted a United States patent titled Autonomous citation indexing and literature browsing using citation context on September The patent was filed on May and has priority to January A continuation patent US Patent was filed on May and granted on May br After NEC in it was hosted as CiteSeer IST on the World Wide Web at the College of Information Sciences and Technology The Pennsylvania State University and had over documents For enhanced access performance and research similar versions of CiteSeer were supported at universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of Z rich and the National University of Singapore However these versions of CiteSeer proved difficult to maintain and are no longer available Because CiteSeer only indexes freely available papers on the web and does not have access to publisher metadata it returns fewer citation counts than sites such as Google Scholar that have publisher metadata br CiteSeer had not been comprehensively updated since due to limitations in its architecture design It had a representative sampling of research documents in computer and information science but was limited in coverage because it was limited to papers that are publicly available usually at an author s homepage or those submitted by an author To overcome some of these limitations a modular and open source architecture for CiteSeer was designed CiteSeerX br br br CiteSeerX br CiteSeerX replaced CiteSeer and all queries to CiteSeer were redirected CiteSeerX is a public search engine and digital library and repository for scientific and academic papers primarily with a focus on computer and information science However recently CiteSeerX has been expanding into other scholarly domains such as economics physics and others Released in it was loosely based on the previous CiteSeer search engine and digital library and is built with a new open source infrastructure SeerSuite and new algorithms and their implementations It was developed by researchers Isaac Councill and C Lee Giles at the College of Information Sciences and Technology Pennsylvania State University It continues to support the goals outlined by CiteSeer to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the public web and to use a citation inquiry by citations and ranking of documents by the impact of citations Currently Lee Giles Prasenjit Mitra Susan Gauch Min Yen Kan Pradeep Teregowda Juan Pablo Fern ndez Ram rez Pucktada Treeratpituk Jian Wu Douglas Jordan Steve Carman Jack Carroll Jim Jansen and Shuyi Zheng are or have been actively involved in its development Recently a table search feature was introduced It has been funded by the National Science Foundation NASA and Microsoft Research br CiteSeerX continues to be rated as one of the world s top repositories and was rated number in July It currently has over million documents with nearly million unique authors and million citations br CiteSeerX also shares its software data databases and metadata with other researchers currently by Amazon S and by rsync Its new modular open source architecture and software available previously on SourceForge but now on GitHub is built on Apache Solr and other Apache and open source tools which allows it to be a testbed for new algorithms in document harvesting ranking indexing and information extraction br CiteSeerX caches some PDF files that it has scanned As such each page includes a DMCA link which can be used to report copyright violations br br br Current features br br br Automated information extraction br CiteSeerX uses automated information extraction tools usually built on machine learning methods such ParsCit to extract scholarly document metadata such as title authors abstract citations etc As such there are sometime errors in authors and titles Other academic search engines have similar errors br br br Focused crawling br CiteSeerX crawls publicly available scholarly documents primarily from author webpages and other open resources and does not have access to publisher metadata As such citation counts in CiteSeerX are usually less than those in Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search who have access to publisher metadata br br br Usage br CiteSeerX has nearly one million users worldwide based on unique IP addresses and has millions of hits daily Annual downloads of document PDFs were nearly million for br br br Data br CiteSeerX data is regularly shared under a Creative Commons BY NC SA license with researchers worldwide and has been and is used in many experiments and competitions br Thanks to its OAI PMH endpoint CiteSeerX is an open archive and its content is indexed like an institutional repository in academic search engines for instance BASE and Unpaywall consumers br br br Other SeerSuite based search engines br The CiteSeer model had been extended to cover academic documents in business with SmealSearch and in e business with eBizSearch However these were not maintained by their sponsors An older version of both of these could be once found at BizSeer IST but is no longer in service br Other Seer like search and repository systems have been built for chemistry ChemXSeer and for archaeology ArchSeer Another had been built for robots txt file search BotSeer All of these are built on the open source tool SeerSuite which uses the open source indexer Lucene br br br See
