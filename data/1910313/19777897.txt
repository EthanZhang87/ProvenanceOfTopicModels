title: Nonviolent video game
id: 19777897
Nonviolent video games are video games characterized by little or no violence As the term is vague game designers developers and marketers that describe themselves as non violent video game makers as well as certain reviewers and members of the non violent gaming community often employ it to describe games with comparatively little or no violence The definition has been applied flexibly to games in such purposive genres as the Christian video game However a number of games at the fringe of the non violence label can only be viewed as objectively violent br The purposes behind the development of the nonviolent genre are primarily reactionary in nature As video quality and level of gaming technology have increased the violent nature of some video games has gained worldwide attention from moral political gender and medical psychological quarters The popularity of violent video games and increases in youth violence have led to much research into the degree to which video games may be blamed for societally negative behaviors Despite the inconclusive nature of the scientific results a number of groups have rejected violent video games as offensive and have promoted the development of non violent alternatives The existence of a market for such games has in turn led to the manufacture and distribution of a number of games specifically designed for the nonviolent gaming community Video game reviewers have additionally identified a number of games belonging to traditionally violent gameplay genres as nonviolent in comparison to a typical game from the violent genre Despite the fact that some of these games contain mild violence many of them have entered the argot of nonviolent gamers as characteristic non violent games br br br Video game violence and attendant controversies br br Controversies surrounding the negative influences of video games are nearly as old as the medium itself In Marshall McLuhan a noted media theorist suggested in his book Understanding Media The Extensions of Man that t he games people play reveal a great deal about them This was built upon in the early s in an anti video game crusade spearheaded by the former Long Island PTA president Ronnie Lamm who spoke about her cause on the MacNeil Lehrer NewsHour in December The same year Surgeon General C Everett Koop had suggested that games had no merit and offered little in the way of anything constructive to young people Despite early general claims of the negative effects of video games however effects of these concerns were relatively minor prior to the early s br Discussion of the impact of violence in video games came as early as s Death Race arcade game a game with black and white graphics which involved running over screaming zombies In the s titles such as Exidy s Chiller Namco s Splatterhouse and Midway s NARC raised concerns about video game violence in the arcade Home games such as Palace s Barbarian featured the ability to decapitate opponents It was not until graphic capabilities increased and a wave of new ultra violent titles were released in the early s that the mainstream news began to pay significant attention to the phenomenon In with Midway s release of the first Mortal Kombat video game and then in with id s Doom genuine controversy was first ignited as the wide and growing popularity of violent video games came into direct conflict with the moral and religious ethics of concerned citizens Protests and game bannings followed the publicizing of these conflicts and controversies would erupt periodically throughout the s with the releases of such games as Dreamweb Wolfenstein D Mortal Kombat II Phantasmagoria Duke Nukem D Blood Grand Theft Auto Carmageddon Postal Mortal Kombat Carmageddon II Carpocalypse Now Blood II The Chosen Grand Theft Auto and Requiem Avenging Angel among others br In April the fears of the media and violence watch groups were legitimated in their eyes as investigations into the lives of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold the shooters in the Columbine High School massacre in Columbine Colorado revealed that they had been fans of the video game Doom and had even created levels for it today dubbed the Harris levels A great deal of discussion of violence in video games followed this event with strong arguments made on both sides and research into the phenomenon which had begun during the s received renewed support and interest br In December Surgeon General David Satcher led a study on violence in youth and determined that while the impact of video games on violent behavior has yet to be determined findings suggest that media violence has a relatively small impact on violence and that meta analysis had demonstrated that the overall effect size for both randomized and correlational studies was small for physical aggression and moderate for aggressive thinking br Despite this the controversies and debate have persisted and this has been the catalyst for the emergence of the non violent video game genre Non violent video games are defined in the negative by a Modus tollendo ponens disjunctive argument In other words in order to recognize a non violent game an identifier must recognize the violent game as a distinct class This has led to a degree of ambiguity in the term as it relies upon a definition of violence which for different identifiers may mean different things In general violence may be placed into at least three distinct categories br br Totally non violent games Games in which absolutely no violence occurs This category contains games characterized by lack of the death of characters lack of sudden noise or movement and often lack of traditional conflict e g Below the Root or Sudoku Gridmaster br Games in which the player acts non violently Games where violence occurs to the character player as a result of environmental hazards or enemies but the character player s reaction is to run away or otherwise distance himself from the violence br Games with environmental hazards only Games lacking enemies but containing a potentially violent environment e g Alleyway or Roller Coaster br Games with enemies Games with violent enemies which the player character must avoid e g the Eggerland series br Games in which the player acts non violently to other sentient beings Games where a player acts violently against robots or other non living non sentient enemies e g Descent br br br Education br The majority of these games have not been scientifically tested to see whether children learn the skills the games claim to teach In another study performed in Chile educational video games were put into some first and second grade classrooms Children who had the games in their classroom showed more progress in math reading comprehension and spelling than the children who did not use games in their classrooms br br br Research br br The history of video game development shares approximate contemporaneity with media violence research in general In the early studies were conducted on the effects of violence in cartoons and throughout the s and s a number of studies were conducted on how televised violence influenced viewers especially younger viewers The focus of many of these studies was on the effects of exposure of children to violence and these studies frequently employed the social learning theory framework developed by Albert Bandura to explore violent behavioral modeling br br With advancements in video technology and the rise of video games containing graphic violence in the late s and early s media violence research shifted to a great degree from televised violence to video game violence Although under current debate a number of researchers have claimed that violent games may cause more intense feelings of aggression than nonviolent games and may trigger feelings of anger and hostility Theoretical explanations for these types of effects have been explained in myriad theories including social cognitive theory excitation transfer theory priming effect and the General Aggression Model However recent scholarship has suggested that social cognitive theories of aggression are outdated and should be retired br One difference between video games and television which nearly all media violence studies recognize is that video games are primarily interactive while television is primarily passive in nature Video game players identify with the character they control in the video games and there have been suggestions that the interactivity available in violent video games narrows the gap between the theory and practice of youth violence in a manner that goes beyond the effects of televised violence Acknowledgment of the fact that for better or worse video games are likely to remain a part of modern society has led to a brace of comparative studies between violent games and non violent games As technology has advanced such studies have adapted to include the effects of violent games and non violent games in new media methods such as immersive virtual reality simulations br Results have varied with some research indicating correlation between violence in video games and violence in players of the games and other research indicating minimal if any relationship Despite the lack of solid conclusion on the issue the suggestion that violent games cause youth violence together with the clear popularity of violent video game genres such as the first person shooter have led some game designers to publish non violent alternatives br br br Lawsuits and legislation br As research supporting the view that video game violence leads to youth violence has been produced there have been a number of lawsuits initiated by victims to gain compensation for loss alleged to have been caused by video game related violence Similarly in the US Congress and the legislatures of states and other countries a number of legislative actions have been taken to mandate rating systems and to curb the distribution of violent video games At times individual games considered too violent have been censored or banned in such countries as Australia Greece etc br br In Christian conservative activist and now former attorney Jack Thompson brought suit against Atari Nintendo Sega and Sony Computer Entertainment on behalf of the victims of Heath High School shooting in James v Meow Media The suit was dismissed in absolving the companies of responsibility for the shooter s actions based on a lack of remedy under Kentucky tort law In the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal and in the U S Supreme Court denied certiorari refusing to review the case because it was not dismissed on st Amendment grounds br In the County Council for St Louis Missouri enacted Ordinance that barred minors from purchasing renting or playing violent video games deemed to contain any visual depiction or representation of realistic injury to a human or a human like being that appealed to minors morbid interest in violence This ordinance was challenged in by the Interactive Digital Software Association IDSA as violative of freedom of expression as guaranteed by the first amendment The IDSA cited the th Circuit case of American Amusement Machine Association v Kendrick as precedent suggesting that video game content was a form of freedom of expression however in the Eastern District Court of Missouri ultimately issued the controversial ruling that video games are not a form of expression protected by the First Amendment in Interactive Digital Software Association v St Louis County br In the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre a billion lawsuit was filed in against a number of video game companies and id Software the makers of the purportedly violent video game Doom by victims of the tragedy Also named in the suit were Acclaim Entertainment Activision Capcom Eidos Interactive GT Interactive Interplay Entertainment Nintendo Sony Computer Entertainment Square Co Midway Games Apogee Software Atari Corporation Meow Media and Sega Violent video games mentioned by name included Doom Quake Redneck Rampage and Duke Nukem The suit was dismissed by Judge Babcock in March in a ruling suggesting that a decision against the game makers would have a chilling effect on free speech Babcock noted that it is manifest that there is social utility in expressive and imaginative forms of entertainment even if they contain violence br In Washington State enacted a statute banning the sale or rental to minors of video games containing aggressive conflict in which the player kill injures or otherwise causes physical harm to a human form in the game who is depicted by dress or other recognizable symbols as a public law enforcement officer In this statute was subsequently declared an unconstitutional violation of the first amendment right to free speech in the Federal District Court case of Video Software Dealers Ass n v Maleng br In Jack Thompson brought suit against Sony Computer Entertainment and Grand Theft Auto in representation of the victims of the Devin Moore shooting incident On November Thompson withdrew from Strickland v Sony stating It was my idea to leave the case He was quick to mention that the case would probably do well with or without his presence This decision followed scrutiny from Judge James Moore however Thompson claimed he received no pressure to withdraw At the same time Judge James Moore had taken the motion to revoke Thompson s license under advisement Jack Thompson appeared in court to defend his pro hac vice right to practice law in Alabama following accusations that he violated legal ethics Shortly thereafter the case was dismissed and Thompson s license was revoked following a denial of his pro hac vice standing by Judge Moore who noted that Mr Thompson s actions before this Court suggest that he is unable to conduct himself in a manner befitting practice in this state In March the Alabama Supreme Court upheld Judge Moore s ruling against the dismissal of the case br In California State Senator Leland Yee introduced California Assembly Bills which barred ultra violent video games and mandated the application of ESRB ratings for video games Yee a former child psychologist has publicly criticized such games as Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and Manhunt and opposes the U S Army s Global Gaming League Both of these bills were passed by the assembly and signed by Gov Arnold Schwarzenegger in October By December both bills had been struck down in court by Judge Ronald Whyte as unconstitutional thereby preventing either from going into effect on January Similar bills were subsequently filed in such states as Michigan and Illinois but to date all have been ruled to be unconstitutional br In in reaction to such controversial games as Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Senator Hillary Clinton along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act S intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games by imposing a federal mandate for inclusion of ESRB ratings All three senators have actively sought restrictions on video game content with Sen Lieberman denouncing the violence contained in video games and attempting to regulate sales of violent video games to minors arguing that games should have to be labeled based upon age appropriateness Regarding Grand Theft Auto Lieberman has stated The player is rewarded for attacking a woman pushing her to the ground kicking her repeatedly and then ultimately killing her shooting her over and over again I call on the entertainment companies they ve got a right to do that but they have a responsibility not to do it if we want to raise the next generation of our sons to treat women with respect br In June the Louisiana case of Entertainment Software Association v Foti struck down a state statute that sought to bar minors from purchasing video games with violent content The statute was declared an unconstitutional violation of the st Amendment Amici filing briefs included Jack Thompson br On September Senator Sam Brownback R KS introduced the United States Truth in Video Game Rating Act S The act would require the ESRB to have access to the full content of and hands on time with the games it was to rate rather than simply relying on the video demonstrations submitted by developers and publishers Two days later Congressman Fred Upton introduced the Video Game Decency Act H R to the House br br br Degrees of violence br br Video game rating boards exist in a number of countries typically placing restrictions suggested or under force of law for content that is violent or sexual in nature About of games fall into a category rated mature and recommended to those years old and older Those games account for about a quarter of all video game sales Gamers seeking violence find themselves increasingly age restricted as identified violence level increases This means that non violent games which are the least restricted are available to all players at any age This moral or legislative public policy against violence has the indirect effect of encouraging players of all ages and especially younger players to play non violent games however it also produces something of a forbidden fruit effect For this and other reasons the effectiveness of rating systems such as the ESRB to actually curb violent gameplay in youth gaming has been characterized as futile br Table of violence ratings br br br Gender perspective br br A number of studies have been conducted specifically analyzing the differences between male and female preference in video game styles Studies have vacillated between findings that the gender effect on violence preference in games is significant and insignificant however no firm conclusions have been achieved to date The number of studies in this field has blossomed contemporaneously with greater gender studies and a degree of tension exists in the field between the traditional stereotype of violence as a male dominant characteristic and the realities of the marketing data for violent games br In an example of such studies was funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention U S Department of Justice to the Center for Mental Health and Media These studies were released in the book Grand Theft Childhood wherein it was found that among girls nine of the top ten most popular video games were nonviolent games such as Mario titles Dance Dance Revolution or simulation games compared to a majority of violent games in the top ten favorites of boys Ultimately the conclusion reached in Grand Theft Childhood was that focusing on such easy but minor targets as violent video games causes parents social activists and public policy makers to ignore the much more powerful and significant causes of youth violence that have already been well established including a range of non gender linked social behavioral economic biological and mental health factors This conclusion supports Surgeon General Satcher s study supra br Despite this conclusion general awareness of the issue together with traditional stereotyping has led a number of game developers and designers to create non violent video games specifically for female audiences Advertisement placement and other marketing techniques have in the past targeted women as more receptive to non violent video game genres such as life simulation games strategy games or puzzle video games Although these genres often contain certain degrees of violence they lack the emphasis on graphic violence characterized for instance by the first person shooter genre br br br Religious perspective br br Criticism for the violent aspects of video game culture has come from a number of anti violence groups and perhaps the most vocal of these are the numerous religious opposition groups The moral codes of nearly all major religions contain prohibitions against murder and violence in general In some cases this prohibition even extends to aggression wrath and anger Violent video games while merely vicarious in nature have been the focus of religious disapproval or outrage in various circles Notable anti violent video game crusader former attorney Jack Thompson is a self proclaimed Christian conservative and his legal actions against violent video games have been intimately linked to his religious views As groups like the fundamentalist Christian population have increased in number of adherents new marketing opportunities have developed contemporaneously Several religion centric games forums such as GameSpot s Religion and Philosophy forum have developed within the greater gaming community in reaction to this growing niche br br br Christian games br br There has been a rapid increase in Christian video games since the s however as Christian games have striven to compete with their more popular secular progenitors there has been an increasing number of games released that blur the lines between Christian and non Christian values Jack Thompson for instance has publicly decried such Christian games as Left Behind Eternal Forces stating It s absurd you can be the Christians blowing away the infidels and if that doesn t hit your hot button you can be the Antichrist blowing away all the Christians The game reviewers IGN Ars Technica and GameSpy have disagreed that Left Behind Eternal Forces is overtly violent Similarly James Dobson PhD founder of the Focus on the Family group has advised parents in relation to video games to avoid the violent ones altogether br br Although Christian games have been around since Sparrow Records Music Machine for the Atari there have been few genres as unassailably violent as that of the first person shooter FPS The majority of games that have been banned for violence have been FPS games and for this reason Christian games in the FPS genre have struggled to overcome the blurring effects of the violence inherent to the genre Games such as Revelation and Xibalba for instance have attempted to avoid claims of violence by using off the wall absurdist humor with enemies such as flying bat winged clown heads modeled after the biblical Jezebel that shoot rays out of their nose or alien Nazis a mocking reference to Ra lian religious beliefs Other Christian FPS games such as Eternal War have avoided the issue by expressing the view that justified violence is morally acceptable br Some of these games despite containing objectively violent content have been affirmatively labeled non violent video games by marketers and faith based non violent gaming communities In direct response to the Columbine High School massacre alleged to have been caused by the shooters obsession with the game Doom Rev Ralph Bagley began production on Catechumen a Christian first person game produced by N Lightening Software involving holy swords instead of guns In Catechumen the player fights inhuman demons using holy armament When sent back the demons produce no blood or gore and for this reason it has been described as a non violent game The intent of Catechumen according to Rev Bagley is to build the genre of Christian gaming People are tired of having these violent demonic games dictating to their kids Among Christian FPS games a lack of gore has often been used as the minimum standard for non violence Christian game reviewers have at times characterized non Christian games such as Portal and Narbacular Drop as comparatively non violent games despite their lack of a Christian focus br An example of a notable Christian video game organization is the Christian Game Developers Foundation focusing on family friendly gameplay and Biblical principles Another well known Christian video game creator and distributor is Wisdom Tree which is best known for its unlicensed Christian video games on the Nintendo Entertainment System br br br Hindu games br In Escapist magazine reported that a Hindu first person shooter entitled My Hindu Shooter was in the works In My Hindu Shooter a game based on the Unreal Engine the player employs the Vedic abilities of astrology Ayurvedic healing breathing meditation herbalism Gandharva Veda music architecture which let you purify demonic areas and yagyas rituals Gameplay involved acquisition of the siddhis of clairvoyance levitation invisibility shrinking and strength and the ultimate goal of the game was to achieve pure consciousness by removing karma through completion of quests and cleansing the six chakras in ascending order The only way to actually win the game is to complete it without harming or killing any other living creature Despite the violence free requirements of the main character however a player could die and be reincarnated in a number of different forms like a human a pig a dog or a worm Whatever form you came back as would limit the way in which you could interact with other characters in the game Like the majority of games that have been labeled non violent violence in the game that is applied to the character rather than that the character applies is not considered to make the game a violent game br br br Buddhist games br According to Buddhist morality the first of the Five Precepts of la is a personal rule of not killing This moral guideline extends to human as well as non human life br There are five conditions to violate the first precept br br The being must be alive br There must be the knowledge that it is a sentient living being br There must be an intention to cause death br An act must be done to cause death br There must be death as the result of the said act br As the first precept requires an actual living being to be killed to be considered as violated Buddhists can still enjoy video games with violence because there is no real being that is dying or being hurt The fuller extent of the first precept is to maintain a harmless attitude towards all The main problem is the mind which is the main focus of Buddhism Violent video games tend to create ill will and tension thus it is not conducive for meditation practice Other than that the action of the mind also creates kamma action which will bear its fruit when the conditions are right br Although primarily browser games a number of stand alone video games eschewing violence such as the Thai game Ethics Game have been created that promote the Five Precepts and Buddhism generally The Buddhist concept of dharma has been emphasized in a number of Buddhist games as a reaction to perceptions of the adharmic state of modern games The concept of zen has also influenced a number of nonviolent video games such as Zen of Sudoku and The Game Factory s Zenses series br br br Jewish games br While the earliest games to feature a Jewish main character the Wolfenstein series William B J Blazkowicz are characterized by militant anti Nazism a number of non violent Jewish games such as the Avner series by Torah Educational Software primarily aimed at younger audiences has emerged with the intention of promoting Jewish religious concepts related to the Torah One notable non violent game that explores Jewish themes is The Shivah a puzzle adventure game featuring a non violent battle between Rabbis that takes the form of an insult swordfight br br br Muslim games br Despite notoriety in the Western press for controversial violent games such as Under Ash and Under Siege Muslim developer Afkar Media has also produced at least one non violent game entitled Road Block Buster In Road Block Buster the hero must jump around doing tricks to soldiers attempt to get over any barrier or road block implanted by Israeli Defense forces without using violence and earn respect by helping surrounded people whom sic can t get through the separation walls br br br Sikh games br Exceptionally rare the few Sikh games e g Sikh Game in existence are primarily browser based Sarbloh Warriors was developed by Taranjit Singh as a game revolving around Sikh It was planned for it to contain mild violence In Singh complained that the game was unfairly stereotyped and that BBC misrepresented the game as anti muslim The game was never released br br br Bah games br In January artist Chris Nelson produced a non violent art game called The Seven Valleys which he exhibited during the ACSW conference at the University of Ballarat Based on the Unreal Tournament engine The Seven Valleys was designed with the intention of illustrat ing the unillustratable and subvert ing the image of violent video games in the process Nelson was interviewed by ABC Radio on the subject in February of the same month br br br Taoist games br Video game publisher Destineer s non violent puzzle video game WordJong for the Nintendo DS has been considered a Taoist puzzle game br br br Religion neutral games br Non profit organization Heartseed set out to produce several non violent games drawing inspiration from a claimed agreement between several religions under the sign of nonviolence Christianity Hinduism Islam Buddhism Taoism Judaism and others because throughout all of them can be found a common thread of decency meant to propel us toward spiritual enlightenment This project seems to have been discontinued br br br Types of non violent video games br Non violent video games as a genre are characterized as a genre by purpose Unlike genres described by style of gameplay non violent video games span a wide number of gameplay genres Defined in the negative the purpose of non violent games is to provide the player with an experience that lacks violence Many traditional gameplay genres naturally lack violence and application of the term non violent video games to titles that fall under these categories raises no questions regarding accuracy For game developers and designers who self identify as non violent video game makers however the challenge has been to expand the concepts of non violence into such traditionally violent gameplay genres as action games role playing games strategy games and the first person shooter br Emergent and more recent gameplay genres such as music video games are for the most part naturally non violent Purposive video game genres such as educational games also are primarily non violent in nature Other electronic game genres like audio games are also most frequently non violent The indisputably non violent nature of these games are often considered self evident by members of both the non violent gaming community and the gaming community at large As such they are often not explicitly identified as such Typically explicit identification is applied counterintuitively to titles where there might otherwise be a question concerning non violence This has led such categorization to be viewed with mistrust hostility and mockery by those who fail to recognize the comparative nature of the definition or who disagree fundamentally with the underlying purpose of the genre br br br Traditionally non violent games br br Among traditionally non violent games are included maze games adventure games life simulation games construction and management simulation games visual novels and some vehicle simulation games among others These games are generally less frequently described as non violent due to the self evident nature of the descriptive term Prior to the development of games specifically designed for non violence non violent gamers were limited to these traditionally non violent genres however a number of games even under the traditionally non violent umbrella may be considered arguably violent Minesweeper for instance is an abstraction of a scenario that often leads to a patently violent result br Other common traditionally non violent genres include puzzle games music video games programming games party games and traditional games br Examples of traditionally non violent games include br br Sudoku Gridmaster A totally non violent game wherein the player must assign the mathematically appropriate number to the corresponding blank in a grid br Roller Coaster A game featuring a non violent main character wherein the player must navigate a dangerous amusement park to collect pieces of money br Alleyway A game with only environmental hazards featuring a non violent main character wherein the player must break blocks mild violence with a ball while avoiding the floor of the level br The Eggerland series A series with enemies featuring a non violent main character wherein the player must solve block sliding puzzles in order to secure a key and unlock the door to the next room br Robots A game lacking violence to sentient beings wherein a player must either bomb malfunctioning robots or conserve bombs by stepping strategically in order to induce the robots to crash into one another br br br Non violent action games br br Action games have typically been among the most violent of video games genres with the liberal employment of enemies to thwart the actions of the player character and an emphasis on killing these enemies to neutralize them As action games have developed they have become progressively more violent over the years as advances in graphic capabilities allowed for more realistic enemies and death sequences Nevertheless some companies like Nintendo have tended to shy away from this kind of realism in favor of cartoon and fantasy violence a concept also implicated in the increase of youth violence by media violence researchers This has created a spectrum of violence in action games Non violent video game proponents have labeled a number of games containing comparatively low level violence as non violent as well as games such as the anti violent serious game Food Force br Studies have also shown that there are tangible benefits to violence in action games such as increased ability to process visual information quickly and accurately This has led to support for the development of action games that are non violent which will allow players to retain the positive visual processing benefits without the negatives associated with violence br Examples of non violent action games include br br Journey Multi awarded Game of the Year Journey is a game where a non violent player meets and travels with a second anonymous player on a journey to a mountaintop br Seiklus A totally non violent game wherein the player traverses a natural landscape as a small person in order to get to the end br Sunday Funday A game featuring a non violent main character wherein the player avoids bullies clowns and businessmen in order to skateboard to Sunday school br Knytt A game with only environmental hazards featuring a non violent main character wherein the player must guide a small creature through a series of caverns and mountains containing pitfalls and hazards in order to get to the end br Marble Madness A game with enemies featuring a non violent main character wherein the player must navigate his way through a marble maze while enemy marbles and other enemies attempt to knock him off or otherwise destroy him br Barbie A game lacking violence to sentient beings wherein Barbie must rescue Ken by defeating a host of shopping mall related machines gone haywire br Barney s Hide and Seek A game lacking violence to any living creature the player must find children and missing objects The game is also educational and teaches young children about safety lessons br Crash Dummy Vs The Evil D Troit br Treasure Quest a puzzle action game br Knytt Stories br Steer Madness a vegetarian themed game endorsed by PETA br br br Non violent first person shooters br The application of the term non violent to genres such as the first person shooter FPS that many players consider inherently or definitionally violent has at times generated vociferous arguments that the concept is inconceivable and at best oxymoronic This argument typically derives from a strict definition of violence as extreme destructive or uncontrollable force especially of natural events intensity of feeling or expression a definition by which the vast majority of video games may be described as violent Despite arguments to the contrary however such characterizations have been employed as a marketing tool by makers and distributors of non violent video games and the degree of popularity enjoyed by games so described may be attributed to the comparative violence of other more violent members of the supergenre br Non violent first person shooter developers have expressed the notion that it is the challenge of making a non violent game in a violent genre that motivates them in part Rarely FPS games such as Garry s Mod and Portal that have been developed without the specific intent of non violence have been identified by reviewers and the non violent gaming community as non violent FPSes Such characterizations have led to the concern that parents may allow their children to play these games not realizing that there are still some elements of violence including violent deaths Further ambiguities arise when determining whether a game is a first person shooter as in certain games such as Narbacular Drop the player doesn t shoot anything at all but merely clicks walls with the cursor Similarly in games such as realMyst the player merely interacts with the environment by touching things in the first person and the term shooter is seen to be objectively inaccurate Despite this non violent first person games have often been characterized oxymoronically as shooters because of all comparable genres these games are most closely similar to the FPS and often employ engines designed for the FPS genre br Often modeled upon violent FPS games non violent FPSes such as Chex Quest or the newer Sherlock Holmes games may bear striking resemblance to the violent game whose engine they are using Developers of such games often have done little to change the game other than replacing violent or scary imagery and recasting the storyline to describe zorching slobbing or otherwise non lethally incapacitating enemies Examples of simple changes intended to reduce violence for non violent FPSes include the alteration of the red shroud from the death sequence in Doom to become the green shroud from the slime sequence in Chex Quest or the removal of the red shroud from the death sequence in Half Life for the deaths in Portal At times similarities between violent progenitors and their non violent descendants have proved strong enough that the non violent developers have cast their game as a spoof of the violent version This is apparent in Chex Quest Off beat and absurdist humor have been employed in a number of games order to tone down the serious content by makers of non violent FPSes br One subgenre of the FPS that typically is not characterized as non violent despite the fact that gameplay revolves to a great degree around avoidance of battle is that of stealth games Although much of the gameplay characteristic to stealth games accords closely with the requirements of the non violent genre stealth games most frequently simply delay chaotic violence to focus instead upon controlled precision violence When stealth and violence are both present as options stealth is often presented as the superior option for being morally superior or requiring greater skill br Examples of non violent FPSes include br br H U R L A game featuring a non violent main character wherein the player must navigate a playing field avoiding enemies as they attempt to slob him with trash br Narbacular Drop A game with only environmental hazards featuring a non violent main character wherein the player must navigate her way out of a dungeon filled with hazards br Chex Quest A game with enemies featuring a non violent main character wherein the player must rescue his fellow cereal pieces by zorching hordes of flemoids back to their home planet with various zorch guns Instead of the player s face bleeding the Chex piece becomes progressively more covered in slime br Descent A game lacking violence to sentient beings wherein the player in a ship rescues human miners trapped in mines guarded by malfunctioning mining robots The player has to navigate maze like mines in order to save the hostages and shutdown the malfunctioning mine br Postal Though Postal is renowned for its impressive levels of graphic violence gore and irreverent humour it is possible to complete the game without harming a single person For players who choose such a route the game will praise them as Jesus at the end of the final screen br Chex Quest The sequel of the original Chex Quest featuring the same premise of non violent action br Elebits A Wii based first person hide and seek game br Gotcha Extreme Paintball A non lethal paintball FPS br Extreme Paintbrawl A non lethal paintball FPS br Foreign Ground A military game made by the Swedish Defence University created only for corporate training environments br Greg Hastings Tournament Paintball A non lethal paintball FPS br Greg Hastings Tournament Paintball MAX D A non lethal paintball FPS br Ken s Labyrinth a non violent Wolfenstein clone br Laser Arena non violent arena style laser tag FPS br Nerf Arena Blast A non lethal Nerf FPS br NRA Gun Club A first person target shooting game br Super D Noah s Ark A non violent Christian video game br Nanashi no Game non violent survival horror first person game from Japan br br br Non violent role playing games br br Though infrequently regarded as explicitly violent role playing video games RPGs have traditionally focused on the adventures of a party of travelers as they spend days and months leveling up to fight greater and greater foes Fighting in these games is highly stylized and often turn based however the actions of the player characters and the enemies that attack them are distinctly violent There have been some attempts made to reduce this violence by rendering it in cartoonish format as in some members of the Final Fantasy series or by recasting the enemies deaths as fainting sleeping or becoming stunned as in the Pok mon series however neither of these series has been explicitly labeled non violent br One rare example of an RPG that was designed as a non violent video game is Spiritual Warfare a game with enemies featuring a non violent main character wherein the player wanders about converting the denizens of his town to Christianity while fending off the attacks of wild animals with holy food Another example is A Tale in the Desert an MMORPG based on economic development br Secular examples include Capcom s Ace Attorney series and Victor s Story of Seasons series a simulation RPG game Additionally such RPGs as Ultima IV Quest of the Avatar Planescape Torment and Deus Ex have all been identified as containing certain modes of play that are mostly non violent This concept is also explored in the higher difficulty levels of the Thief series br The fan funded indie RPG Undertale allows players to resolve violence through peaceful means br br br Non violent strategy games br As with role playing games strategy games have traditionally focused on the development and expansion of a group as they defend themselves from the attacks of enemies Strategy games tend not to be explicitly described as violent however they nearly universally contain violent content in the form of battles wars and other skirmishes Additionally strategy games tend to more often strive for realistic scenarios and depictions of the battles that result Counteracting this violence however is the fact that strategy games tend to be set at a distant third party perspective and as such the violence of the battles tends to be minute and highly stylized br For the most part non violent groups have not explored this genre of violent game Gender marketers have designed strategy games for both male and female audiences however gender linked treatment of violence has not occurred in this genre and as such male and female oriented strategy games tend to contain equal degrees of violence Christian developers have made various attempts at the genre including Left Behind Eternal Forces in which the player attempts to convert as many civilians in an apocalyptic future as possible by raising their spirit level and shielding them from the corrupting influences of rock and roll music and general secularism The game has been criticized by such anti violent video game personalities as former attorney Jack Thompson for strategy involving the slaying of infidels and non believers and for the ability of players engaged in multi play modes to play as
