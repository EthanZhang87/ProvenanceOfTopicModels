Photography is the art application and practice of creating images by recording light either electronically by means of an image sensor or chemically by means of a light sensitive material such as photographic film It is employed in many fields of science manufacturing e g photolithography and business as well as its more direct uses for art film and video production recreational purposes hobby and mass communication A person who makes photographs is called a photographer br Typically a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure With an electronic image sensor this produces an electrical charge at each pixel which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image which is later chemically developed into a visible image either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base known as a print either by using an enlarger or by contact printing br br br Etymology br The word photography was created from the Greek roots ph t s genitive of ph s light and graph representation by means of lines or drawing together meaning drawing with light br Several people may have coined the same new term from these roots independently H rcules Florence a French painter and inventor living in Campinas Brazil used the French form of the word photographie in private notes which a Brazilian historian believes were written in This claim is widely reported but is not yet largely recognized internationally The first use of the word by Florence became widely known after the research of Boris Kossoy in br The German newspaper Vossische Zeitung of February contained an article entitled Photographie discussing several priority claims especially Henry Fox Talbot s regarding Daguerre s claim of invention The article is the earliest known occurrence of the word in public print It was signed J M believed to have been Berlin astronomer Johann von Maedler The astronomer John Herschel is also credited with coining the word independent of Talbot in br The inventors Nic phore Ni pce Talbot and Louis Daguerre seem not to have known or used the word photography but referred to their processes as Heliography Ni pce Photogenic Drawing Talbotype Calotype Talbot and Daguerreotype Daguerre br br br History br br br Precursor technologies br br Photography is the result of combining several technical discoveries relating to seeing an image and capturing the image The discovery of the camera obscura dark chamber in Latin that provides an image of a scene dates back to ancient China Greek mathematicians Aristotle and Euclid independently described a camera obscura in the th and th centuries BCE In the th century CE Byzantine mathematician Anthemius of Tralles used a type of camera obscura in his experiments br The Arab physicist Ibn al Haytham Alhazen also invented a camera obscura as well as the first true pinhole camera The invention of the camera has been traced back to the work of Ibn al Haytham While the effects of a single light passing through a pinhole had been described earlier Ibn al Haytham gave the first correct analysis of the camera obscura including the first geometrical and quantitative descriptions of the phenomenon and was the first to use a screen in a dark room so that an image from one side of a hole in the surface could be projected onto a screen on the other side He also first understood the relationship between the focal point and the pinhole and performed early experiments with afterimages laying the foundations for the invention of photography in the th century br Leonardo da Vinci mentions natural camerae obscurae that are formed by dark caves on the edge of a sunlit valley A hole in the cave wall will act as a pinhole camera and project a laterally reversed upside down image on a piece of paper Renaissance painters used the camera obscura which in fact gives the optical rendering in color that dominates Western Art It is a box with a small hole in one side which allows specific light rays to enter projecting an inverted image onto a viewing screen or paper br The birth of photography was then concerned with inventing means to capture and keep the image produced by the camera obscura Albertus Magnus discovered silver nitrate and Georg Fabricius discovered silver chloride and the techniques described in Ibn al Haytham s Book of Optics are capable of producing primitive photographs using medieval materials br Daniele Barbaro described a diaphragm in Wilhelm Homberg described how light darkened some chemicals photochemical effect in The fiction book Giphantie published in by French author Tiphaigne de la Roche described what can be interpreted as photography br In June British inventor Thomas Wedgwood made the first known attempt to capture the image in a camera obscura by means of a light sensitive substance He used paper or white leather treated with silver nitrate Although he succeeded in capturing the shadows of objects placed on the surface in direct sunlight and even made shadow copies of paintings on glass it was reported in that the images formed by means of a camera obscura have been found too faint to produce in any moderate time an effect upon the nitrate of silver The shadow images eventually darkened all over br br br Invention br br The first permanent photoetching was an image produced in by the French inventor Nic phore Ni pce but it was destroyed in a later attempt to make prints from it Ni pce was successful again in In he made the View from the Window at Le Gras the earliest surviving photograph from nature i e of the image of a real world scene as formed in a camera obscura by a lens br br Because Ni pce s camera photographs required an extremely long exposure at least eight hours and probably several days he sought to greatly improve his bitumen process or replace it with one that was more practical In partnership with Louis Daguerre he worked out post exposure processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more light sensitive resin but hours of exposure in the camera were still required With an eye to eventual commercial exploitation the partners opted for total secrecy br Ni pce died in and Daguerre then redirected the experiments toward the light sensitive silver halides which Ni pce had abandoned many years earlier because of his inability to make the images he captured with them light fast and permanent Daguerre s efforts culminated in what would later be named the daguerreotype process The essential elements a silver plated surface sensitized by iodine vapor developed by mercury vapor and fixed with hot saturated salt water were in place in The required exposure time was measured in minutes instead of hours Daguerre took the earliest confirmed photograph of a person in while capturing a view of a Paris street unlike the other pedestrian and horse drawn traffic on the busy boulevard which appears deserted one man having his boots polished stood sufficiently still throughout the several minutes long exposure to be visible The existence of Daguerre s process was publicly announced without details on January The news created an international sensation France soon agreed to pay Daguerre a pension in exchange for the right to present his invention to the world as the gift of France which occurred when complete working instructions were unveiled on August In that same year American photographer Robert Cornelius is credited with taking the earliest surviving photographic self portrait br br In Brazil Hercules Florence had apparently started working out a silver salt based paper process in later naming it Photographie br Meanwhile a British inventor William Fox Talbot had succeeded in making crude but reasonably light fast silver images on paper as early as but had kept his work secret After reading about Daguerre s invention in January Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it At first like other pre daguerreotype processes Talbot s paper based photography typically required hours long exposures in the camera but in he created the calotype process which used the chemical development of a latent image to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype In both its original and calotype forms Talbot s process unlike Daguerre s created a translucent negative which could be used to print multiple positive copies this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day as daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera Talbot s famous tiny paper negative of the Oriel window in Lacock Abbey one of a number of camera photographs he made in the summer of may be the oldest camera negative in existence br In France Hippolyte Bayard invented his own process for producing direct positive paper prints and claimed to have invented photography earlier than Daguerre or Talbot br British chemist John Herschel made many contributions to the new field He invented the cyanotype process later familiar as the blueprint He was the first to use the terms photography negative and positive He had discovered in that sodium thiosulphate was a solvent of silver halides and in he informed Talbot and indirectly Daguerre that it could be used to fix silver halide based photographs and make them completely light fast He made the first glass negative in late br br In the March issue of The Chemist Frederick Scott Archer published his wet plate collodion process It became the most widely used photographic medium until the gelatin dry plate introduced in the s eventually replaced it There are three subsets to the collodion process the Ambrotype a positive image on glass the Ferrotype or Tintype a positive image on metal and the glass negative which was used to make positive prints on albumen or salted paper br Many advances in photographic glass plates and printing were made during the rest of the th century In Gabriel Lippmann introduced a process for making natural color photographs based on the optical phenomenon of the interference of light waves His scientifically elegant and important but ultimately impractical invention earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in br Glass plates were the medium for most original camera photography from the late s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the s Although the convenience of the film greatly popularized amateur photography early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their glass plate equivalents and until the late s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old Because of the superior dimensional stability of glass the use of plates for some scientific applications such as astrophotography continued into the s and in the niche field of laser holography it has persisted into the st century br br br Film br br Hurter and Driffield began pioneering work on the light sensitivity of photographic emulsions in Their work enabled the first quantitative measure of film speed to be devised br The first flexible photographic roll film was marketed by George Eastman founder of Kodak in but this original film was actually a coating on a paper base As part of the processing the image bearing layer was stripped from the paper and transferred to a hardened gelatin support The first transparent plastic roll film followed in It was made from highly flammable nitrocellulose known as nitrate film br Although cellulose acetate or safety film had been introduced by Kodak in at first it found only a few special applications as an alternative to the hazardous nitrate film which had the advantages of being considerably tougher slightly more transparent and cheaper The changeover was not completed for X ray films until and although safety film was always used for mm and mm home movies nitrate film remained standard for theatrical mm motion pictures until it was finally discontinued in br Films remained the dominant form of photography until the early st century when advances in digital photography drew consumers to digital formats Although modern photography is dominated by digital users film continues to be used by enthusiasts and professional photographers The distinctive look of film based photographs compared to digital images is likely due to a combination of factors including differences in spectral and tonal sensitivity S shaped density to exposure H D curve with film vs linear response curve for digital CCD sensors resolution and continuity of tone br br br Black and white br br Originally all photography was monochrome or black and white Even after color film was readily available black and white photography continued to dominate for decades due to its lower cost chemical stability and its classic photographic look The tones and contrast between light and dark areas define black and white photography Monochromatic pictures are not necessarily composed of pure blacks whites and intermediate shades of gray but can involve shades of one particular hue depending on the process The cyanotype process for example produces an image composed of blue tones The albumen print process publicly revealed in produces brownish tones br Many photographers continue to produce some monochrome images sometimes because of the established archival permanence of well processed silver halide based materials Some full color digital images are processed using a variety of techniques to create black and white results and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form sometimes when presented as black and white or single color toned images they are found to be more effective Although color photography has long predominated monochrome images are still produced mostly for artistic reasons Almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard RGB color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color br br br Color br br Color photography was explored beginning in the s Early experiments in color required extremely long exposures hours or days for camera images and could not fix the photograph to prevent the color from quickly fading when exposed to white light br The first permanent color photograph was taken in using the three color separation principle first published by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in The foundation of virtually all practical color processes Maxwell s idea was to take three separate black and white photographs through red green and blue filters This provides the photographer with the three basic channels required to recreate a color image Transparent prints of the images could be projected through similar color filters and superimposed on the projection screen an additive method of color reproduction A color print on paper could be produced by superimposing carbon prints of the three images made in their complementary colors a subtractive method of color reproduction pioneered by Louis Ducos du Hauron in the late s br br Russian photographer Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin Gorskii made extensive use of this color separation technique employing a special camera which successively exposed the three color filtered images on different parts of an oblong plate Because his exposures were not simultaneous unsteady subjects exhibited color fringes or if rapidly moving through the scene appeared as brightly colored ghosts in the resulting projected or printed images br Implementation of color photography was hindered by the limited sensitivity of early photographic materials which were mostly sensitive to blue only slightly sensitive to green and virtually insensitive to red The discovery of dye sensitization by photochemist Hermann Vogel in suddenly made it possible to add sensitivity to green yellow and even red Improved color sensitizers and ongoing improvements in the overall sensitivity of emulsions steadily reduced the once prohibitive long exposure times required for color bringing it ever closer to commercial viability br Autochrome the first commercially successful color process was introduced by the Lumi re brothers in Autochrome plates incorporated a mosaic color filter layer made of dyed grains of potato starch which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments After an Autochrome plate was reversal processed to produce a positive transparency the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and the tiny colored points blended together in the eye synthesizing the color of the subject by the additive method Autochrome plates were one of several varieties of additive color screen plates and films marketed between the s and the s br Kodachrome the first modern integral tripack or monopack color film was introduced by Kodak in It captured the three color components in a multi layer emulsion One layer was sensitized to record the red dominated part of the spectrum another layer recorded only the green part and a third recorded only the blue Without special film processing the result would simply be three superimposed black and white images but complementary cyan magenta and yellow dye images were created in those layers by adding color couplers during a complex processing procedure br Agfa s similarly structured Agfacolor Neu was introduced in Unlike Kodachrome the color couplers in Agfacolor Neu were incorporated into the emulsion layers during manufacture which greatly simplified the processing Currently available color films still employ a multi layer emulsion and the same principles most closely resembling Agfa s product br Instant color film used in a special camera which yielded a unique finished color print only a minute or two after the exposure was introduced by Polaroid in br Color photography may form images as positive transparencies which can be used in a slide projector or as color negatives intended for use in creating positive color enlargements on specially coated paper The latter is now the most common form of film non digital color photography owing to the introduction of automated photo printing equipment After a transition period centered around color film was relegated to a niche market by inexpensive multi megapixel digital cameras Film continues to be the preference of some photographers because of its distinctive look br br br Digital br br In Sony unveiled the first consumer camera to use a charge coupled device for imaging eliminating the need for film the Sony Mavica While the Mavica saved images to disk the images were displayed on television and the camera was not fully digital br The first digital camera to both record and save images in a digital format was the Fujix DS P created by Fujfilm in br In Kodak unveiled the DCS the first commercially available digital single lens reflex camera Although its high cost precluded uses other than photojournalism and professional photography commercial digital photography was born br Digital imaging uses an electronic image sensor to record the image as a set of electronic data rather than as chemical changes on film An important difference between digital and chemical photography is that chemical photography resists photo manipulation because it involves film and photographic paper while digital imaging is a highly manipulative medium This difference allows for a degree of image post processing that is comparatively difficult in film based photography and permits different communicative potentials and applications br br Digital photography dominates the st century More than of photographs taken around the world are through digital cameras increasingly through smartphones br br br Techniques br br A large variety of photographic techniques and media are used in the process of capturing images for photography These include the camera dualphotography full spectrum ultraviolet and infrared media light field photography and other imaging techniques br br br Cameras br br The camera is the image forming device and a photographic plate photographic film or a silicon electronic image sensor is the capture medium The respective recording medium can be the plate or film itself or a digital magnetic or electronic memory br Photographers control the camera and lens to expose the light recording material to the required amount of light to form a latent image on plate or film or RAW file in digital cameras which after appropriate processing is converted to a usable image Digital cameras use an electronic image sensor based on light sensitive electronics such as charge coupled device CCD or complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS technology The resulting digital image is stored electronically but can be reproduced on a paper br The camera or camera obscura is a dark room or chamber from which as far as possible all light is excluded except the light that forms the image It was discovered and used in the th century by painters The subject being photographed however must be illuminated Cameras can range from small to very large a whole room that is kept dark while the object to be photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated This was common for reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were used see Process camera br As soon as photographic materials became fast sensitive enough for taking candid or surreptitious pictures small detective cameras were made some actually disguised as a book or handbag or pocket watch the Ticka camera or even worn hidden behind an Ascot necktie with a tie pin that was really the lens br The movie camera is a type of photographic camera that takes a rapid sequence of photographs on recording medium In contrast to a still camera which captures a single snapshot at a time the movie camera takes a series of images each called a frame This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism The frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific speed called the frame rate number of frames per second While viewing a person s eyes and brain merge the separate pictures to create the illusion of motion br br br Stereoscopic br br Photographs both monochrome and color can be captured and displayed through two side by side images that emulate human stereoscopic vision Stereoscopic photography was the first that captured figures in motion While known colloquially as D photography the more accurate term is stereoscopy Such cameras have long been realized by using film and more recently in digital electronic methods including cell phone cameras br br br Dualphotography br br Dualphotography consists of photographing a scene from both sides of a photographic device at once e g camera for back to back dualphotography or two networked cameras for portal plane dualphotography The dualphoto apparatus can be used to simultaneously capture both the subject and the photographer or both sides of a geographical place at once thus adding a supplementary narrative layer to that of a single image br br br Full spectrum ultraviolet and infrared br br Ultraviolet and infrared films have been available for many decades and employed in a variety of photographic avenues since the s New technological trends in digital photography have opened a new direction in full spectrum photography where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions br Modified digital cameras can detect some ultraviolet all of the visible and much of the near infrared spectrum as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about nm to nm An off the shelf digital camera contains an infrared hot mirror filter that blocks most of the infrared and a bit of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor narrowing the accepted range from about nm to nm br Replacing a hot mirror or infrared blocking filter with an infrared pass or a wide spectrally transmitting filter allows the camera to detect the wider spectrum light at greater sensitivity Without the hot mirror the red green and blue or cyan yellow and magenta colored micro filters placed over the sensor elements pass varying amounts of ultraviolet blue window and infrared primarily red and somewhat lesser the green and blue micro filters br Uses of full spectrum photography are for fine art photography geology forensics and law enforcement br br br Layering br Layering is a photographic composition technique that manipulates the foreground subject or middle ground and background layers in a way that they all work together to tell a story through the image Layers may be incorporated by altering the focal length distorting the perspective by positioning the camera in a certain spot People movement light and a variety of objects can be used in layering br br br Light field br br Digital methods of image capture and display processing have enabled the new technology of light field photography also known as synthetic aperture photography This process allows focusing at various depths of field to be selected after the photograph has been captured As explained by Michael Faraday in the light field is understood as dimensional with each point in D space having attributes of two more angles that define the direction of each ray passing through that point br These additional vector attributes can be captured optically through the use of microlenses at each pixel point within the dimensional image sensor Every pixel of the final image is actually a selection from each sub array located under each microlens as identified by a post image capture focus algorithm br br br Other br Besides the camera other methods of forming images with light are available For instance a photocopy or xerography machine forms permanent images but uses the transfer of static electrical charges rather than photographic medium hence the term electrophotography Photograms are images produced by the shadows of objects cast on the photographic paper without the use of a camera Objects can also be placed directly on the glass of an image scanner to produce digital pictures br br br Types br br br Amateur br Amateur photographers take photos for personal use as a hobby or out of casual interest rather than as a business or job The quality of amateur work can be comparable to that of many professionals Amateurs can fill a gap in subjects or topics that might not otherwise be photographed if they are not commercially useful or salable Amateur photography grew during the late th century due to the popularization of the hand held camera Twenty first century social media and near ubiquitous camera phones have made photographic and video recording pervasive in everyday life In the mid s smartphone cameras added numerous automatic assistance features like color management autofocus face detection and image stabilization that significantly decreased skill and effort needed to take high quality images br br br Commercial br br Commercial photography is probably best defined as any photography for which the photographer is paid for images rather than works of art In this light money could be paid for the subject of the photograph or the photograph itself The commercial photographic world could include br br Advertising photography There are photographs made to illustrate and usually sell a service or product These images such as packshots are generally done with an advertising agency design firm or with an in house corporate design team br Architectural photography focuses on capturing photographs of buildings and architectural structures that are aesthetically pleasing and accurate in terms of representations of their subjects br Event photography focuses on photographing guests and occurrences at mostly social events br Fashion and glamour photography usually incorporates models and is a form of advertising photography Fashion photography like the work featured in Harper s Bazaar emphasizes clothes and other products glamour emphasizes the model and body form while glamour photography is popular in advertising and men s magazines Models in glamour photography sometimes work nude br product photography displays a series of photos to give the impression of a rotating object This technique is commonly used by ecommerce websites to help shoppers visualise products br Concert photography focuses on capturing candid images of both the artist or band as well as the atmosphere including the crowd Many of these photographers work freelance and are contracted through an artist or their management to cover a specific show Concert photographs are often used to promote the artist or band in addition to the venue br Crime scene photography consists of photographing scenes of crime such as robberies and murders A black and white camera or an infrared camera may be used to capture specific details br Still life photography usually depicts inanimate subject matter typically commonplace objects which may be either natural or man made Still life is a broader category for food and some natural photography and can be used for advertising purposes br Real estate photography focuses on the production of photographs showcasing a property that is for sale such photographs requires the use of wide lens and extensive knowledge in high dynamic range imaging photography br br Food photography can be used for editorial packaging or advertising use Food photography is similar to still life photography but requires some special skills br Photojournalism can be considered a subset of editorial photography Photographs made in this context are accepted as a documentation of a news story br Paparazzi is a form of photojournalism in which the photographer captures candid images of athletes celebrities politicians and other prominent people br Portrait and wedding photography Are photographs made and sold directly to the end user of the images br Landscape photography typically captures the presence of nature but can also focus on human made features or disturbances of landscapes br Wildlife photography demonstrates the life of wild animals br br br Art br br During the th century both fine art photography and documentary photography became accepted by the English speaking art world and the gallery system In the United States a handful of photographers including Alfred Stieglitz Edward Steichen John Szarkowski F Holland Day and Edward Weston spent their lives advocating for photography as a fine art br At first fine art photographers tried to imitate painting styles This movement is called Pictorialism often using soft focus for a dreamy romantic look In reaction to that Weston Ansel Adams and others formed the Group f to advocate straight photography the photograph as a sharply focused thing in itself and not an imitation of something else br The aesthetics of photography is a matter that continues to be discussed regularly especially in artistic circles Many artists argued that photography was the mechanical reproduction of an image If photography is authentically art then photography in the context of art would need redefinition such as determining what component of a photograph makes it beautiful to the viewer The controversy began with the earliest images written with light Nic phore Ni pce Louis Daguerre and others among the very earliest photographers were met with acclaim but some questioned if their work met the definitions and purposes of art br Clive Bell in his classic essay Art states that only significant form can distinguish art from what is not art br br There must be some one quality without which a work of art cannot exist possessing which in the least degree no work is altogether worthless What is this quality What quality is shared by all objects that provoke our aesthetic emotions What quality is common to Sta Sophia and the windows at Chartres Mexican sculpture a Persian bowl Chinese carpets Giotto s frescoes at Padua and the masterpieces of Poussin Piero della Francesca and Cezanne Only one answer seems possible significant form In each lines and colors combined in a particular way certain forms and relations of forms stir our aesthetic emotions br On February Sotheby s London sold the photograph Cent II Diptychon for an unprecedented to an anonymous bidder making it the most expensive at the time br Conceptual photography turns a concept or idea into a photograph Even though what is depicted in the photographs are real objects the subject is strictly abstract br br In parallel to this development the then largely separate interface between painting and photography was closed in the second half of the th century with the chemigram of Pierre Cordier and the chemogram of Josef H Neumann In the chemograms by Josef H Neumann concluded the separation of the painterly background and the photographic layer by showing the picture elements in a symbiosis that had never existed before as an unmistakable unique specimen in a simultaneous painterly and at the same time real photographic perspective using lenses within a photographic layer united in colors and shapes This Neumann chemogram from the seventies of the th century thus differs from the beginning of the previously created cameraless chemigrams of a Pierre Cordier and the photogram Man Ray or L szl Moholy Nagy of the previous decades These works of art were almost simultaneous with the invention of photography by various important artists who characterized Hippolyte Bayard Thomas Wedgwood William Henry Fox Talbot in their early stages and later Man Ray and L szl Moholy Nagy in the twenties and by the painter in the thirties Edmund Kesting and Christian Schad by draping objects directly onto appropriately sensitized photo paper and using a light source without a camera br br br Photojournalism br br Photojournalism is a particular form of photography the collecting editing and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast that employs images in order to tell a news story It is now usually understood to refer only to still images but in some cases the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography e g documentary photography social documentary photography street photography or celebrity photography by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms Photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media and help communities connect with one other Photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door They deliver news in a creative format that is not only informative but also entertaining including sports photography br br br Science and forensics br br The camera has a long and distinguished history as a means of recording scientific phenomena from the first use by Daguerre and Fox Talbot such as astronomical events eclipses for example small creatures and plants when the camera was attached to the eyepiece of microscopes in photomicroscopy and for macro photography of larger specimens The camera also proved useful in recording crime scenes and the scenes of accidents such as the Wootton bridge collapse in The methods used in analysing photographs for use in legal cases are collectively known as forensic photography Crime scene photos are usually taken from three vantage points overview mid range and close up br In Francis Ronalds the Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory invented the first successful camera to make continuous recordings of meteorological and geomagnetic parameters Different machines produced or hour photographic traces of the minute by minute variations of atmospheric pressure temperature humidity atmospheric electricity and the three components of geomagnetic forces The cameras were supplied to numerous observatories around the world and some remained in use until well into the th century Charles Brooke a little later developed similar instruments for the Greenwich Observatory br Science regularly uses image technology that has derived from the design of the pinhole camera to avoid distortions that can be caused by lenses X ray machines are similar in design to pinhole cameras with high grade filters and laser radiation br Photography has become universal in recording events and data in science and engineering and at crime scenes or accident scenes The method has been much extended by using other wavelengths such as infrared photography and ultraviolet photography as well as spectroscopy Those methods were first used in the Victorian era and improved much further since that time br The first photographed atom was discovered in by physicists at Griffith University Australia They used an electric field to trap an Ion of the element Ytterbium The image was recorded on a CCD an electronic photographic film br br br Wildlife photography br br Wildlife photography involves capturing images of various forms of wildlife Unlike other forms of photography such as product or food photography successful wildlife photography requires a photographer to choose the right place and right time when specific wildlife are present and active It often requires great patience and considerable skill and command of the right photographic equipment br br br Social and cultural implications br br There are many ongoing questions about different aspects of photography In her On Photography Susan Sontag dismisses the objectivity of photography This is a highly debated subject within the photographic community Sontag argues To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed It means putting one s self into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge and therefore like power Photographers decide what to take a photo of what elements to exclude and what angle to frame the photo and these factors may reflect a particular socio historical context Along these lines it can be argued that photography is a subjective form of representation br Modern photography has raised a number of concerns on its effect on society In Alfred Hitchcock s Rear Window the camera is presented as promoting voyeurism Although the camera is an observation station the act of photographing is more than passive observing br br The camera doesn t rape or even possess though it may presume intrude trespass distort exploit and at the farthest reach of metaphor assassinate all activities that unlike the sexual push and shove can be conducted from a distance and with some detachment br br Digital imaging has raised ethical concerns because of the ease of manipulating digital photographs in post processing Many photojournalists have declared they will not crop their pictures or are forbidden from combining elements of multiple photos to make photomontages passing them as real photographs Today s technology has made image editing relatively simple for even the novice photographer However recent changes of in camera processing allow digital fingerprinting of photos to detect tampering for purposes of forensic photography br Photography is one of the new media forms that changes perception and changes the structure of society Further unease has been caused around cameras in regards to desensitization Fears that disturbing or explicit images are widely accessible to children and society at large have been raised Particularly photos of war and pornography are causing a stir Sontag is concerned that to photograph is to turn people into objects that can be symbolically possessed Desensitization discussion goes hand in hand with debates about censored images Sontag writes of her concern that the ability to censor pictures means the photographer has the ability to construct reality br One of the practices through which photography constitutes society is tourism Tourism and photography combine to create a tourist gaze br in which local inhabitants are positioned and defined by the camera lens However it has also been argued that there exists a reverse gaze through which indigenous photographees can position the tourist photographer as a shallow consumer of images br br br Law br br Photography is both restricted and protected by the law in many jurisdictions Protection of photographs is typically achieved through the granting of copyright or moral rights to the photographer In the United States photography is protected as a First Amendment right and anyone is free to photograph anything seen in public spaces as long as it is in plain view In the UK a recent law Counter Terrorism Act increases the power of the police to prevent people even press photographers from taking pictures in public places In South Africa any person may photograph any other person without their permission in public spaces and the only specific restriction placed on what may not be photographed by government is related to anything classed as national security Each country
