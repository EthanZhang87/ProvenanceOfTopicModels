used to produce a product industrial commodity or handicraft br Under the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs a WIPO administered treaty a procedure for an international registration exists To qualify for registration the national laws of most member states of WIPO require the design to be novel An applicant can file for a single international deposit with WIPO or with the national office in a country party to the treaty The design will then be protected in as many member countries of the treaty as desired Design rights started in the United Kingdom in with the Designing and Printing of Linen Act and have expanded from there br Registering for an industrial design right is related to granting a patent br br br Law making br br br Kenya br According to industrial property Act an industrial design is defined as any composition of lines or colours or any three dimensional form whether or not associated with lines or colours provided that such composition or form gives a special appearance to a product of industry or handicraft and can serve as pattern for a product of industry or handicraft br An industrial design is registrable if it is new An industrial design is deemed to be new if it has not been disclosed to the public anywhere in the world by publication in tangible form or in Kenya by use or in any other way prior to the filing date or where applicable the priority date of the application for registration However a disclosure of the industrial design is not taken into consideration if it occurred not earlier than twelve months before the filing date or where applicable the priority date of the application and if it was by reason or in consequence of acts committed by the applicant or his predecessor in title or an evident abuse committed by a third party in relation to the applicant or his predecessor in title br br br India br India s Design Act was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to protection of design and to comply with the articles and of Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights TRIPS agreement The new act earlier Patent and Design Act was repealed by this act now defines design to mean only the features of shape configuration pattern ornament or composition of lines or colours applied to any article whether in two or three dimensional or in both forms by any industrial process or means whether manual or mechanical or chemical separate or combined which in the finished article appeal to and are judged solely by the eye but does not include any mode or

Canada br Canadian law affords ten years of protection to industrial designs that are registered there is no protection for unregistered designs The Industrial Design Act defines design or industrial design to mean features of shape configuration pattern or ornament and any combination of those features that in a finished article appeal to and are judged solely by the eye The design must also be original in the Patent Appeal Board rejected a design for a trash can and gave guidance as to what the Act requires br br The degree of originality required to register an original design is greater than that laid down by Canadian copyright legislation but less than that required to register a patent br The articles being compared should not be examined side by side but separate so that imperfect recollection comes into play br One is to look at the design as a whole br Any change must be substantial It must not be trivial or infinitesimal br During the existence of an exclusive right no person can make import for the purpose of trade or business or sell rent or offer or expose for sale or rent any article in respect of which the design is registered The rule also applies to kits and substantial differences are in reference to previously published designs br Registering an industrial design in Canada may be appropriate for a variety of articles such as consumer products vehicles sports equipment packaging etc having an original aesthetic appearance and may even be used to protect new technologies such as electronic icons Industrial designs can also serve to complement other forms of intellectual property rights such as patents and trade marks br The Canadian courts see infrequent litigation concerning industrial designs the first case in almost two decades took place in between Bodum and Trudeau Corporation concerning visual features of double wall drinking glasses br It is possible for a registered design to also receive protection under Canadian copyright or trademark law br br a useful article ie one with a utilitarian function will receive copyright protection where it is reproduced in a quantity of fifty or less but that limitation does not apply with respect to br a graphic or photographic representation that is applied to the face of an article br a trade mark or a representation thereof or a label br material that has a woven or knitted pattern or that is suitable for piece goods or surface coverings or for making wearing apparel br a representation of a real or fictitious being event or place that is applied to an article as a feature of shape configuration pattern or ornament br where a registered design has become publicly identifiable with the product it may be eligible for registration as a distinguishing guise under trademark law but such registration cannot be used to limit the development of any art or industry br br br European Union br br Registered and unregistered community designs are available which provide a unitary right covering the European Community Protection for a registered community design is for up to years subject to the payment of renewal fees every five years The unregistered community design lasts for three years after a design is made available to the public and infringement only occurs if the protected design has been copied br br br United Kingdom br br Legislation given in Britain during the years to protected designs for textiles The Copyright of Design Act passed in allowed other material designs such as those for metal and earthenware objects to be registered with a diamond mark to indicate the date of registration br In addition to the design protection available under community designs UK law provides its own national registered design right Registered Designs Act later amended by Copyright Designs and Patents Act and an unregistered design right The unregistered right which exists automatically if the requirements are met can last for up to years The registered design right can last up to years subject to the payment of maintenance fees The topography of semi conductor circuits are also covered by integrated circuit layout design protection a form of protection which lasts years br br br Japan br br Article of the Japanese Design Law states This law was designed to protect and utilize designs and to encourage creation of designs in order to contribute to industrial development The protection period in Japan is years from the day of registration br br br United States br U S design patents last fifteen years from the date of grant if filed on or after May fourteen years if filed before May and cover the ornamental aspects of utilitarian objects Objects that lack a use beyond that conferred by their appearance or the information they convey may be covered by copyright a form of intellectual property of much longer duration that exists as soon as a qualifying work is created In some circumstances rights may also be acquired in trade dress but trade dress protection is akin to trademark rights and requires that the design have source significance or secondary meaning It is useful only to prevent source misrepresentations trade dress protection br br br Australia br In Australia design patent registration lasts for years with an option to be extended once for an additional years For the patent to be granted a formalities exam is needed If infringement action is to be taken the design needs to become certified which involves a substantive examination This process ensures that the design is truly unique and eligible for protection under Australian patent law br br br Duration of design rights br Depending on the jurisdiction registered design rights have a duration between and years Members of the WIPO Hague system have to publish their maximum term of protection for design rights These terms are presented in the table below Some of the jurisdiction below are unions or collaborative office for design registration like the African Intellectual Property Organization the European Union and the Benelux br br br Industrial design applications br br Between and the early s the offices of Japan and the United States of America averaged a similar number of industrial design applications rarely exceeding The office of Japan received the highest number of applications per year from the s thru to the late s reaching approximately annual filings at its peak The office of China which received applications when it first began receiving applications in has seen an unprecedented rate of growth peaking at applications filed in The office of the Republic of Korea surpassed the office of Japan in and has remained in second position ever since In the office of the US moved ahead of Japan to become the third largest globally The EUIPO began receiving applications in and moved up to fourth position in Among these top five offices the EUIPO is the only one to have a multiple design system Applications filed at the European Union IP Office contained designs in br In about million industrial design applications were filed worldwide Asia accounted for of all designs in applications filed
