id: 1728199
Service design is the activity of planning and arranging people infrastructure communication and material components of a service in order to improve its quality and the interaction between the service provider and its users Service design may function as a way to inform changes to an existing service or create a new service entirely br The purpose of service design methodologies is to establish the most effective practices for designing services according to both the needs of users and the competencies and capabilities of service providers If a successful method of service design is adapted then the service will be user friendly and relevant to the users while being sustainable and competitive for the service provider For this purpose service design uses methods and tools derived from different disciplines ranging from ethnography to information and management science to interaction design br Service design concepts and ideas are typically portrayed visually using different representation techniques according to the culture skill and level of understanding of the stakeholders involved in the service processes Krucken and Meroni With the advent of emerging technologies from the Fourth Industrial Revolution the significance of Service Design has increased as it is believed to facilitate a more feasible productization of these new technologies into the market br br br Definition br Service design practice is the specification and construction of processes which deliver valuable capacities for action to a particular user Service design practice can be both tangible and intangible and can involve artifacts or other elements such as communication environment and behaviour Several of the authors of service design theory including Pierre Eiglier Richard Normann Nicola Morelli propose that services come to existence at the same moment they are both provided and used In contrast products are created and exist before being purchased and used While a designer can prescribe the exact configuration of a product they cannot prescribe in the same way the result of the interaction between users and service providers nor can they prescribe the form and characteristics of any emotional value produced by the service br Consequently service design is an activity that among other things suggests behavioural patterns or scripts for the actors interacting in the service Understanding how these patterns interweave and support each other are important aspects of the character of design and service This allows greater user freedom and better provider adaptability to the users needs br Service design is the process of creating and improving services to meet the needs and expectations of customers br Service design involves creating a service concept that defines the customer s experience as well as the physical human and technological resources required to deliver the service Service design focuses on the experience including customer interactions service delivery and support processes br br br History br br br Early service design and theory br br Early contributions to service design were made by G Lynn Shostack a bank and marketing manager and consultant in the form of written articles and books The activity of designing a service was considered to be part of the domain of marketing and management disciplines in the early years For instance in Shostack proposed the integration of the design of material components products and immaterial components services This design process according to Shostack can be documented and codified using a service blueprint to map the sequence of events in a service and its essential functions in an objective and explicit manner A service blueprint is an extension of a user journey map and this document specifies all the interactions a user has with an organisation throughout their user lifecycle br Servicescape is a model developed by B H Booms and Mary Jo Bitner to focus upon the impact of the physical environment in which a service process takes place and to explain the actions of people within the service environment with a view to designing environments which accomplish organisational goals in terms of achieving desired responses br br br Service design education and practice br In service design was first introduced as a design discipline by professors Michael Erlhoff and Brigit Mager at K ln International School of Design KISD In the Service Design Network was launched by K ln International School of Design Carnegie Mellon University Link pings Universitet Politecnico di Milano and Domus Academy in order to create an international network for service design academics and professionals br In Livework the first service design and innovation consultancy opened for business in London In Engine initially founded in in London as an ideation company positioned themselves as a service design consultancy br br br Service design principles br The book This Is Service Design Doing Applying Service Design Thinking in the Real World by Adam Lawrence Jakob Schneider Marc Stickdorn and Markus Edgar Hormess proposes six service design principles br br Human centred Consider the experience of all the people affected by the service br Collaborative Stakeholders of various backgrounds and functions should be actively engaged in the service design process br Iterative Service design is an exploratory adaptive and experimental approach iterating toward implementation br Sequential The service should be visualized and orchestrated as a sequence of interrelated actions br Real Needs should be researched in reality ideas prototyped in reality and intangible values evidenced as physical or digital reality br Holistic Services should sustainably address the needs of all stakeholders through the entire service and across the business br In the book This is Service Design Thinking Basics Tools Cases the first principle is user centred User refers to any user of the service system including customers and employees Thus the authors revised user centred to human centred in their new book This is service design doing to clarify that human includes service providers customers and all others relevant stakeholders For instance service design must consider not only the customer experience but also the interests of all relevant people in retailing br Collaborative and iterative come from the principle co creative in this is service design thinking The service exists with the participation of users and is created by a group of people from different backgrounds In most cases people tend to focus only on the meaning of collaborative stressing the co operative and interdisciplinary nature of service design but ignored the caveat that a service only exists with the participation of a user Therefore in the definition of new service design principles the co creative is divided into two principles of collaborative and iterative Collaboration is used to indicate the process of creation by the entire stakeholders from different backgrounds Iteration is used to describe service design is an iterating process keeping evolve to adapt the change of business posture br Sequential means that services need to be logically rhythmically and visually displayed Service design is a dynamic process over a period of time The timeline is important for users in the service system For example when a customer shops at an online website the first information showed up should be the regions where the products can be delivered In this way if the customer finds that the products cannot be delivered to their region they will not continually browse the products on the website br Service is often invisible and occurs in a state that the user cannot perceive Real means that the intangible service needs to be displayed in a tangible way For example when people order food in a restaurant they can t perceive the various attributes of the food If we play the cultivation and picking process of vegetables in the restaurant people can perceive the intangible services in the backstage such as the cultivation of organic vegetables and get a quality service experience This service also helps the restaurant establish a natural and organic brand image to customers br Thinking in a holistic way is the cornerstone of service design Holistic thinking needs to consider both intangible and tangible service and ensure that every moment the user interacts with the service such moments known as touchpoints is considered and optimised Holistic thinking also needs to understand that users have multiple logics to complete an experience process Thus a service designer should think about each aspect from different perspectives to ensure that no needs are left unattended to br br br Methodology br Together with the most traditional methods used for product design service design requires methods and tools to control new elements of the design process such as the time and the interaction between actors An overview of the methodologies for designing services is proposed by Nicola Morelli in who proposes three main directions br br Identification of the actors involved in the definition of the service by means of appropriate analytical tools br Definition of possible service scenarios verifying use cases and sequences of actions and actors roles in order to define the requirements for the service and its logical and organisational structure br Representation of the service by means of techniques that illustrate all the components of the service including physical elements interactions logical links and temporal sequences br Analytical tools refer to anthropology social studies ethnography and social construction of technology Appropriate elaborations of those tools have been proposed with video ethnography and different observation techniques to gather data about users actions Other methods such as cultural probes have been developed in the design discipline which aim to capture information on users in their context of use Gaver Dunne et al Lindsay and Rocchi br Design tools aim at producing a blueprint of the service which describes the nature and characteristics of the interaction in the service Design tools include service scenarios which describe the interaction and use cases which illustrate the detail of time sequences in a service encounter Both techniques are already used in software and systems engineering to capture the functional requirements of a system However when used in service design they have been adequately adapted to include more information concerning material and immaterial components of a service as well as time sequences and physical flows Crowdsourced information has been shown to be highly beneficial in providing such information for service design purposes particularly when the information has either a very low or very high monetary value Other techniques such as IDEF just in time and total quality management are used to produce functional models of the service system and to control its processes However it is important to note that such tools may prove too rigid to describe services in which users are supposed to have an active role because of the high level of uncertainty related to the user s behaviour br Because of the need for communication between inner mechanisms of services and actors such as final users representation techniques are critical in service design For this reason storyboards are often used to illustrate the interaction of the front office Other representation techniques have been used to illustrate the system of interactions or a platform in a service Manzini Collina et al Recently video sketching Jegou Keitsch et al and prototypes Blomkvist have also been used to produce quick and effective tools to stimulate users participation in the development of the service and their involvement in the value production process br br br Standards br In the United Kingdom British Standard BS part of the BS Design management systems series covers service design br br br Public sector service design br br Public sector service design is associated with civic technology open government e government and can constitute either government led or citizen led initiatives The public sector is the part of the economy composed of public services and public enterprises Public services include public goods and governmental services such as the military police infrastructure public roads bridges tunnels water supply sewers electrical grids telecommunications etc public transit public education along with health care and those working for the government itself such as elected officials Due to new investments in hospitals schools cultural institutions and security infrastructures in the last few years the public sector has expanded in many countries The number of jobs in public services has also grown such growth can be associated with the large and rapid social change that is in itself a trigger for fresh design In this context some governments are considering service design as a means to bring about better designed public services br br br Denmark br In MindLab an innovation public sector service design group was established by the Danish ministries of Business and Growth Employment and Children and Education MindLab was the one of the world s first public sector design innovation labs and their work inspired the proliferation of similar labs and user centred design methodologies deployed in many countries worldwide The design methods used at MindLab are typically an iterative approach of prototyping and testing to evolve not just their government projects but also the government s organisational structure using ethnographic inspired user research creative ideation processes and visualisation and modelling of service prototypes In Denmark design within the public sector has been applied to a variety of projects including rethinking Copenhagen s waste management improving social interactions between convicts and guards in Danish prisons transforming services in Odense for mentally disabled adults and more br br br United Kingdom br br In and documents from the British government explore the concept of user driven public services and scenarios of highly personalised public services The documents proposed a new view on the role of service providers and users in the development of new and highly customised public services employing user involvement methods While this approach has been explored through an early initiative in the UK the possibilities of service design for the public sector are also being researched picked up and promoted in European Union countries including Belgium br The Behavioural Insights Team BIT were originally established under the auspices of the Cabinet Office in in order to apply nudge theory to try to improve UK government policy interventions and save money In BIT was spun out to become a company allied to Nesta charity BIT employees and the UK government each owning a third of this new business That same year a Nudge unit was added to the United States government under President Obama referred to as the US Nudge Unit working within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy br br br New Zealand br In recent years New Zealand has seen a significant increase in the use of Service Design approaches and methods applied to challenges faced by the public sector One instance of service design approaches being applied is with the Family project which focused on the experiences of families living in urban poverty in Auckland A report Speaking for Ourselves Archived at the Wayback Machine and a companion empathy tool Demonstrating the complexities of being poor Archived at the Wayback Machine were released in July The report and empathy tool were released as the result of a collective service design effort by the Auckland Council Auckland City Mission ThinkPlace a Service Design consultancy as well as researchers from Waikato University Massey University and the University of Auckland Since its release the report has seen extensive use and has assisted in both the engagement of stakeholders as well as the development of public services focussed on achieving better outcomes for those experiencing urban poverty br br br Private sector service design br Real world service design work can be experienced as new and useful approaches as well as entail some challenges in practice as identified in field research see e g Jevnaker et al br A practical example of service design thinking can be found at the Myyrmanni shopping mall in Vantaa Finland The management attempted to improve the customer flow to the second floor as there were queues at the landscape lifts and the KONE steel car lifts were ignored To improve customer flow to the second floor of the mall Kone Lifts implemented their People Flow Service Design Thinking by turning the elevators into a Hall of Fame for the Incredibles comic strip characters Making their elevators more attractive to the public solved the people flow problem This case of service design thinking by Kone Elevator Company is used in literature as an example of extending products into services br br br Service design in health care br br Clinical service redesign is an approach to improving quality and productivity in health care A redesign is ideally clinically led and involves all stakeholders e g primary and secondary care clinicians senior management patients commissioners etc to ensure national and local clinical standards are set and communicated across the care settings By following the patient s journey or pathway the team can focus on improving both the patient experience and the outcomes of care br br br See also br Chief experience officer br
