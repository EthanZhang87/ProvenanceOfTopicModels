title: Design for All (in ICT)
id: 25066324
Design for All in the context of information and communications technology ICT is the conscious and systematic effort to proactively apply principles methods and tools to promote universal design in computer related technologies including Internet based technologies thus avoiding the need for a posteriori adaptations or specialised design br Design for All is design for human diversity such as that described in the diversity in the workplace or business social inclusion and equality It should not be conceived of as an effort to advance a single solution for everybody but as a user centred approach to providing products that can automatically address the possible range of human abilities skills requirements and preferences Consequently the outcome of the design process is not intended to be a singular design but a design space populated with appropriate alternatives together with the rationale underlying each alternative that is the specific user and usage context characteristics for which each alternative has been designed br Traditionally accessibility problems have been solved with adaptations and the use of assistive technology products has been a technical approach to obtain adaptations Universal Access implies the accessibility and usability of information and telecommunications technologies by anyone at any place and at any time and their inclusion in any living context It aims to enable equitable access and active participation of potentially all people in existing and emerging computer mediated human activities by developing universally accessible and usable products and services and suitable support functionalities in the environment These products and services must be capable of accommodating individual user requirements in different contexts of use independent of location target machine or runtime environment Therefore the approach aiming to grant the use of equipment or services is generalized seeking to give access to the Information Society as such Citizens are supposed to live in environments populated with intelligent objects where the tasks to be performed and the way of performing them are completely redefined involving a combination of activities of access to information interpersonal communication and environmental control Citizens must be given the possibility of carrying them out easily and pleasantly br For a thorough discussion of the challenges and benefits of Design for All in the context of ICT see also the EDeAN White Paper and the Report on the impact of technological developments on eAccessibility of the DfA eInclusion project br br br Benefits and challenges br The European Commission Communication on e Accessibility identified a core of practical challenges as well as market legal and policy issues towards improving eAccessibility and e Inclusion in Europe and elaborated a three fold approach based on br br accessibility requirements in public procurement br accessibility certification and br better use of existing legislation br In that respect the challenges that need to be addressed include br br the introduction of specific legislative measures to complement and enhance existing legislation br addressing and motivating the industry br effective benchmarking br providing harmonised standardisation br the creation of a curriculum for DfA and br addressing future research activities br br br Legislative and regulative background br The present policy context of accessibility in the Information Society in Europe is the i initiative The i A European Information Society for growth and employment initiative was launched by the European Commission as a framework for addressing the main challenges and developments in the information society and media sectors up to It promotes an open and competitive digital economy and emphasises ICT as a driver of inclusion and quality of life The initiative contains a range of EU policy instruments to encourage the development of the digital economy such as regulatory instruments research and partnerships with stakeholders br br br Equality and non discrimination br The goal of the European Union Disability Strategy is a society that is open and accessible to all The barriers need to be identified and removed The European Union Disability Strategy has three main focuses co operation between the Commission and the Member States full participation of people with disabilities and mainstreaming disability in policy formulation br Non discrimination is also one of the general principles of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December and was opened for signatures on March br br br Telecommunications and information society br There is a long tradition of European legislation with regard to telecommunications In the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services covering all forms of fixed and wireless telecoms data transmission and broadcasting From a Design for All perspective the most important Directives are the Directive on a common regulatory framework and the Directive on universal service and users rights relating to electronic communications networks and services Universal Service Directive br br br Public procurement br Public procurement is an important economic force and therefore it is an important tool to promote accessibility The legislative package of public procurement Directives approved in by the European Parliament and the EU s Council of Ministers will help simplify and modernize procurement procedures br The new directives make it possible to take accessibility needs into account at several stages of a procurement process br It is most convenient to refer to standards when making technical specifications There are already many CEN ETSI and ITU standards which can be used for this purpose and many sources which can be useful in practice Likewise guidelines like the WAI guidelines for example or national guidelines have been used br In the future it will be easier to find suitable standards Mandate M has been given by the European Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations CEN CENELEC and ETSI to come up with a solution for common requirements and conformance assessment br br br Copyright br Not all products are accessible for persons with disabilities When producing audio books or certain other accessible works an additional copy is created and copyright can be a problem in this situation On the other hand copyright is an essential part of the sustainability of a creative society This conflict of interests must be solved somehow in order to ensure the Information Society is a Society for All There is international and European legislation in this field The objectives of the Directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society are to adapt legislation on copyright and related rights to reflect technological developments and to transpose into Community law the main international obligations arising from the two treaties on copyright and related rights adopted within the framework of the World Intellectual Property Organisation WIPO in December br br br Protection of privacy br The relationship between design and privacy is not necessarily obvious Modern technology which is a result of design is able to collect significant amounts of personal information The user has an interest in that information being correct and in it being used appropriately The person may want to keep something confidential and have access to the information that has been collected In other words privacy is desired br In the European Union adopted a Directive on the processing of personal data br This directive established the basic principles for the collection storage and use of personal data which should be respected by governments businesses and any other organizations or individuals engaged in handling personal data br Within the context of Design for All in ICT privacy protection is called Privacy by Design br br br Relevant guidelines and standards br In the US Australia Japan and in the European Union more and more legislative actions are put in place to require public bodies and companies to make sure that their products and services are accessible and usable not only by standard users but also by others such as elderly persons or people with an impairment As it would be unwise to write down technical and therefore time bound requirements into a law legislative texts preferably refer to international standards br br br Standardisation general overview br Standardisation i e in very general terms producing a standard French norme standard German Norm Spanish br norma is a voluntary action set up in the past almost uniquely by commercial partners who believe that the standardisation will permit easier exchanges of products and goods This implied very often that the acceptance of the standards is also voluntary and triggered by expected commercial benefits Only to a very limited extent consumer representatives did participate in standardisation br On the other hand laws in many countries are referring more and more to the required acceptance of several standards e g on safety or on ecological aspects The net result of this need for standards is that nowadays many standardisation initiatives are stimulated subsidised by public bodies or in Europe directly and indirectly by the European Commission Also many guidelines have been created by stakeholder groups br br br Recent developments in DfA related standardisation formal standards br As DfA standardisation was explicitly mentioned in the eEurope and i Action Plans br of the European Union several new actions were established since then Four major recent strategies can be distinguished br br the set up of coordinating working groups and organisations br the democratisation of the standardisation processes themselves br the increasing impact of non formal standardisation bodies and br the establishment of standardisation related discussion fora open for non specialists br br br DfA in ICT related standards br ETSI EG V br ETSI Guide Human Factors HF Guidelines for ICT products and services Design for All br br Web Content Accessibility Guidelines br The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG is a technical standard that covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities including blindness and low vision deafness and hearing loss learning disabilities cognitive limitations limited movement speech disabilities photosensitivity and combinations of these Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general br br BS Web accessibility Code of Practice br BS Web accessibility Code of Practice provides guidance on how to embed accessibility concerns into organisation s policies and digital production processes The Standard provides non technical website owners a better understanding of the value of inclusive design and a framework for how to use guidelines like WCAG to help them create products which are Designed for All The Standard s lead author Jonathan Hassell has created a summary of BS to help organisations better understand how the standard can help them br br br Application domains br The application domains of Design for All in the context of ICT practically include every field involving Information and Communication Technologies br The significance of the application domains reflects their role in establishing a coherent and socially acceptable Information Society but also the diverse range of human activities affected br The critical application domains for Design for All can be summarised as follows br br Life long learning br Public information systems terminals and information appliances e g kiosks smart home environments br Transaction services e g banking br Electronic commerce applications and services br Social services for the citizens e g administration elderly transport health care awareness br Tools to allow for added value information services e g creation storage retrieval and exchange of user experiences traces and views br Security br The White Paper Toward an Information Society for All An International R D Agenda published by the International Scientific Forum Towards an Information Society for All ISF IS ALL has discussed the significance of these application domains br br Life long learning is a critical area where emphasis should be placed in the knowledge society of the future It entails a continuous engagement in the acquisition of knowledge and skills to facilitate and sustain equitable participation in the Information Society New technologies may play a catalytic role in providing new educational mechanisms and structures thus allowing learning to become an inseparable part of life long human activities in the context of knowledge intensive learning communities and social interaction amongst groups of people br Another important application area and a critical short term target is the development of general purpose public information systems terminals and information appliances e g information kiosks for access to community wide information services These are expected to be used in increasingly different contexts including public places homes classrooms etc and provide the means for ubiquitous and nomadic access Environmental control will also become increasingly important Smart environments will progressively penetrate a wide range of human activities in hospitals hotels public administration buildings etc Teleoperation of such environments will also gain increasing attention to facilitate responsiveness to unforeseen events enhanced mobility and security br Finally a broad range of transaction services e g banking advertising entertainment social services for the citizens e g administration health care education transport and electronic commerce applications will become increasingly important in reshaping business and residential human activities security privacy and control are central themes in the evolution of a socially acceptable Information Society and should receive immediate attention At the same time they will increasingly constitute more complex targets to accomplish as they span across different levels of the telecommunications infrastructure from network services to application services such as business transactions and entertainment terminals and information appliances br br br Education and training br One major lever to improve awareness and practice in Design for All is the development of education and training programs Professionals are needed who have acquired comprehensive specialist knowledge and skills in Design for All in addition those professionals who currently work in ICT industry need to acquire additional knowledge and skills concerning Design for All br Little evidence can be found of university degree programmes that specialize in Design for All or Universal Design or that explicitly includes a module about this This lack was tackled in the project DfA eInclusion which devised curricula br br A bachelor level introductory course which aims to enable students to have an understanding of the ethical and social issues of Design for All and the role of Design for All as an enabler of accessibility and participation in the information society br A masters level programme which aims to enable students to have the relevant knowledge personal and professional skills competencies to design develop implement evaluate and manage a wide range of ICT systems products and services that adhere to the principles and practices of Design for All br The implementation of such programmes is already under way in a few places for example at Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences the Middlesex University UK University of Linz Austria and the University of Tr s os Montes e Alto Douro Portugal Core topics include an understanding of the principles of human rights the development of standards regulations and legislation the design and development of assistive technologies as well as improved access of mainstream products and services br Web accessibility is an important component of accessing the information society and information and guidance is offered by the World Wide Web Consortium s Web Accessibility Initiative WAI as well as online tutorials for example Opera s Web Standards Curriculum br The complementary approach of training for professionals in ICT industry has also been tackled by the DfA eInclusion project br A comprehensive curriculum for such trainings has been recommended and is currently subject to a CEN workshop negotiation The CEN workshop Curriculum for training professionals in Universal Design UD Prof has been implemented in May Following the general rules for CEN workshops it offers all interested stakeholders an opportunity to discuss and improve this DfA curriculum for ICT professionals br br br Examples of good practice br Opera web browser was designed with the commitment to be used by as many people as possible thus following a Design for All approach br Audiobooks are good examples for Design for All because they enable people to read a book Virtually anyone who does not have a hearing disability can use audiobooks for leisure learning and information br e Government uses information and communication ICT technology to provide and improve government services transactions and interactions with citizens businesses and other arms of government br Elevators provide an alternative way to reach different floor levels Modern accessible elevators use information and communication technology to adapt themselves to any user imaginable The closing speed of the doors is adjustable so people can safely enter quickly or slowly as required Controls of the elevator provide visual and audible feedback to the user so that people with different sensory abilities can operate the elevator without assistance Blind people profit from tactile keys Braille labeling is located besides the keys so that they are not accidentally pushed while reading them The emergency intercom system operates aurally and visually Wireless tagging e g RFID facial recognition remote controls further enhance the capabilities of a modern elevator which can be used by almost anyone br The Inclusive Design Toolkit presents examples of how Design for All principles can be implemented br Other examples of Design for All in ICT are presented in EDeAN s Education and Training Resource br br br Related networks and projects br br br European Design for all eAccessibility Network br The European Design for All e Accessibility Network EDeAN is a network of organisations in European Union member states The goal of the network is to support all citizens access to the Information Society EDeAN provides br br a European forum for Design for All issues supporting EU s e inclusion goals br awareness raising in the public and private sectors br online resources on Design for All br The network is coordinated by the EDeAN Secretariat which rotates annually and the corresponding National Contact Centres which are the contact points for EDeAN in each EU member state br br br Design for All Europe br EIDD Design for All Europe is a self financed European organisation that covers the entire area of theory and practice of Design for All from the built environment and tangible products to communication service and system design Originally set up in as the European Institute for Design and Disability EIDD to enhance the quality of life through Design for All it changed its name in to bring it into line with its core business EIDD Design for All Europe disseminates the application of Design for All to business and administration communities previously unaware of its benefits and currently has active member organisations in European countries The aim of EIDD is to encourage active interaction and communication between professionals interested in the theory and practice of Design for All and to build bridges between on the one hand these and other members of the design community and on the other hand all those other communities where Design for All can make a real difference to the quality of life for everyone br br br Examples of EU funded research projects addressing ICT and inclusion br Design for all for e Inclusion br This is a support project to EDeAN The project aims to develop an exemplary training course for Design for all targeted to the Industry course structures and curricula for studying Design for All in undergraduate and postgraduate levels as well as an online knowledge base on Design for All br br DIADEM Delivering Inclusive Access for Disabled or Elderly Members of the Community br The project aims to develop an adaptable web browser interface for people with reduced cognitive skills which can be used at home and at work br br I Home Intuitive interaction for everyone with home appliances based on industry standards br The project seeks to develop a universal remote console that will allow networked access to everyday appliances in the home br br SHARE IT Supported Human Autonomy for Recovery and Enhancement of cognitive and motor abilities using Information Technologies br This project is developing scalable and adaptive add ons which will allow assistive technologies to be integrated into intelligent ICTs for the home br br HaH Hearing at Home br This project is looking at the next generation of assistive devices which will help hearing impaired people to participate fully in the Information Society br br CogKnow Helping people with mild dementia navigate their day br CogKnow aims to develop and prototype a cognitive prosthetic device to help those struggling with dementia to perform their daily activities br br MonAmi Mainstreaming Ambient Intelligence br The project seeks to mainstream the accessibility of consumer goods and services The aim is to develop technology platforms that allow elderly and disabled people to continue living in their own homes and stay in their communities br br USEM User Empowerment in Standardisation br The project aims to train end users in standardisation related issues and to enable them to participate in standardisation activities in the area of ICT br br VAALID Accessibility and Usability Validation Framework for AAL Interaction Design Process br The project aims at creating modeling and simulation supporting tools to optimize user interaction design and accessibility and usability validation process when developing Ambient Assisted Living solutions br br PERSONA Perceptive Spaces promoting Independent Aging br The project aims at further develop Ambient Assisted Living products and services that are affordable easy to use and commercially viable The project develops an integrated technological platform that seamlessly links up the different products and services for social inclusion for support in daily life activities for early risk detection for personal protection from health and environmental risks for support in mobility and displacements within his neighbourhood town all of which make a life of freedom worth living within their families and within the society br br br See also br Design for All design philosophy br Universal Design br Computer accessibility
