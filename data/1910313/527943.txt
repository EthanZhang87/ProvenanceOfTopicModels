Interaction design often abbreviated as IxD is the practice of designing interactive digital products environments systems and services xxvii While interaction design has an interest in form similar to other design fields its main area of focus rests on behavior xxvii Rather than analyzing how things are interaction design synthesizes and imagines things as they could be This element of interaction design is what characterizes IxD as a design field as opposed to a science or engineering field br Interaction design borrows from a wide range of fields like psychology human computer interaction information architecture and user research to create designs that are tailored to the needs and preferences of users This involves understanding the context in which the product will be used identifying user goals and behaviors and developing design solutions that are responsive to user needs and expectations br While disciplines such as software engineering have a heavy focus on designing for technical stakeholders interaction design is focused on meeting the needs and optimizing the experience of users within relevant technical or business constraints xviii br br br History br The term interaction design was coined by Bill Moggridge and Bill Verplank in the mid s but it took years before the concept started to take hold To Verplank it was an adaptation of the computer science term user interface design for the industrial design profession To Moggridge it was an improvement over soft face which he had coined in to refer to the application of industrial design to products containing software br The earliest programs in design for interactive technologies were the Visible Language Workshop started by Muriel Cooper at MIT in and the Interactive Telecommunications Program founded at NYU in by Martin Elton and later headed by Red Burns br The first academic program officially named Interaction Design was established at Carnegie Mellon University in as a Master of Design in Interaction Design At the outset the program focused mainly on screen interfaces before shifting to a greater emphasis on the big picture aspects of interaction people organizations culture service and system br In Gillian Crampton Smith founded the Computer Related Design MA at the Royal College of Art RCA in London which in was renamed Design Interactions headed by Anthony Dunne In Crampton Smith helped found the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea IDII a specialized institute in Olivetti s hometown in Northern Italy dedicated solely to interaction design In after IDII closed due to a lack of funding some of the people originally involved with IDII set up the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design CIID in Denmark After Ivrea Crampton Smith and Philip Tabor added the Interaction Design IxD track in the Visual and Multimedia Communication at the University of Venice Italy br In the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research founded The Interactive Institute a Swedish research institute in the field of interaction design br br br Methodologies br br br Goal oriented design br Goal oriented design or Goal Directed design is concerned with satisfying the needs and desires of the users of a product or service xxviii br Alan Cooper argues in The Inmates Are Running the Asylum that we need a new approach to solving interactive software based problems The problems with designing computer interfaces are fundamentally different from those that do not include software e g hammers Cooper introduces the concept of cognitive friction which is when the interface of a design is complex and difficult to use and behaves inconsistently and unexpectedly possessing different modes br Alternatively interfaces can be designed to serve the needs of the service product provider User needs may be poorly served by this approach br br br Usability br Usability answers the question can someone use this interface Jakob Nielsen describes usability as the quality attribute that describes how usable the interface is Shneiderman proposes principles for designing more usable interfaces called Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design which are well known heuristics for creating usable systems br br br Personas br Personas are archetypes that describe the various goals and observed behaviour patterns among users br A persona encapsulates critical behavioural data in a way that both designers and stakeholders can understand remember and relate to Personas use storytelling to engage users social and emotional aspects which helps designers to either visualize the best product behaviour or see why the recommended design is successful br br br Cognitive dimensions br The cognitive dimensions framework provides a vocabulary to evaluate and modify design solutions Cognitive dimensions offer a lightweight approach to analysis of a design quality rather than an in depth detailed description They provide a common vocabulary for discussing notation user interface or programming language design br Dimensions provide high level descriptions of the interface and how the user interacts with it examples include consistency error proneness hard mental operations viscosity and premature commitment These concepts aid the creation of new designs from existing ones through design maneuvers that alter the design within a particular dimension br br br Affective interaction design br br Designers must be aware of elements that influence user emotional responses For instance products must convey positive emotions while avoiding negative ones Other important aspects include motivational learning creative social and persuasive influences One method that can help convey such aspects is for example the use of dynamic icons animations and sound to help communicate creating a sense of interactivity Interface aspects such as fonts color palettes and graphical layouts can influence acceptance Studies showed that affective aspects can affect perceptions of usability br Emotion and pleasure theories exist to explain interface responses These include Don Norman s emotional design model Patrick Jordan s pleasure model and McCarthy and Wright s Technology as Experience framework br br br Five dimensions br The concept of dimensions of interaction design were introduced in Moggridge s book Designing Interactions Crampton Smith wrote that interaction design draws on four existing design languages D D D D Kevin Silver later proposed a fifth dimension behaviour br br br Words br This dimension defines interactions words are the element that users interact with br br br Visual representations br Visual representations are the elements of an interface that the user perceives these may include but are not limited to typography diagrams icons and other graphics br br br Physical objects or space br This dimension defines the objects or space with which or within which users interact br br br Time br The time during which the user interacts with the interface An example of this includes content that changes over time such as sound video or animation br br br Behavior br Behavior defines how users respond to the interface Users may have different reactions in this interface br br br Interaction Design Association br The Interaction Design Association was created in to serve the community The organization has over members and more than local groups IxDA hosts Interaction the annual interaction design conference and the Interaction Awards br br br Related disciplines br Industrial design br The core principles of industrial design overlap with those of interaction design Industrial designers use their knowledge of physical form color aesthetics human perception and desire and usability to create a fit of an object with the person using it br Human factors and ergonomics br Certain basic principles of ergonomics provide grounding for interaction design These include anthropometry biomechanics kinesiology physiology and psychology as they relate to human behavior in the built environment br Cognitive psychology br Certain basic principles of cognitive psychology provide grounding for interaction design These include mental models mapping interface metaphors and affordances Many of these are laid out in Donald Norman s influential book The Design of Everyday Things br Human computer interaction br Academic research in human computer interaction HCI includes methods for describing and testing the usability of interacting with an interface such as cognitive dimensions and the cognitive walkthrough br Design research br Interaction designers are typically informed through iterative cycles of user research User research is used to identify the needs motivations and behaviors of end users They design with an emphasis on user goals and experience and evaluate designs in terms of usability and affective influence br Architecture br As interaction designers increasingly deal with ubiquitous computing urban informatics and urban computing the architects ability to make place and create context becomes a point of contact between the disciplines br User interface design br Like user interface design and experience design interaction design is often associated with the design of system interfaces in a variety of media but concentrates on the aspects of the interface that define and present its behavior over time with a focus on developing the system to respond to the user s experience and not the other way around br br
