id: 2634162
Design for testing or design for testability DFT consists of IC design techniques that add testability features to a hardware product design The added features make it easier to develop and apply manufacturing tests to the designed hardware The purpose of manufacturing tests is to validate that the product hardware contains no manufacturing defects that could adversely affect the product s correct functioning br Tests are applied at several steps in the hardware manufacturing flow and for certain products may also be used for hardware maintenance in the customer s environment The tests are generally driven by test programs that execute using automatic test equipment ATE or in the case of system maintenance inside the assembled system itself In addition to finding and indicating the presence of defects i e the test fails tests may be able to log diagnostic information about the nature of the encountered test fails The diagnostic information can be used to locate the source of the failure br In other words the response of vectors patterns from a good circuit is compared with the response of vectors using the same patterns from a DUT device under test If the response is the same or matches the circuit is good Otherwise the circuit is not manufactured as it was intended br DFT plays an important role in the development of test programs and as an interface for test application and diagnostics Automatic test pattern generation or ATPG is much easier if appropriate DFT rules and suggestions have been implemented br br br History br DFT techniques have been used at least since the early days of electric electronic data processing equipment Early examples from the s s are the switches and instruments that allowed an engineer to scan i e selectively probe the voltage current at some internal nodes in an analog computer analog scan DFT often is associated with design modifications that provide improved access to internal circuit elements such that the local internal state can be controlled controllability and or observed observability more easily The design modifications can be strictly physical in nature e g adding a physical probe point to a net and or add active circuit elements to facilitate controllability observability e g inserting a multiplexer into a net While controllability and observability improvements for internal circuit elements definitely are important for test they are not the only type of DFT Other guidelines for example deal with the electromechanical characteristics of the interface between the product under test and the test equipment Examples are guidelines for the size shape and spacing of probe points or the suggestion to add a high impedance state to drivers attached to probed nets such that the risk of damage from back driving is mitigated br Over the years the industry has developed and used a large variety of more or less detailed and more or less formal guidelines for desired and or mandatory DFT circuit modifications The common understanding of DFT in the context of Electronic Design Automation EDA for modern microelectronics is shaped to a large extent by the capabilities of commercial DFT software tools as well as by the expertise and experience of a professional community of DFT engineers researching developing and using such tools Much of the related body of DFT knowledge focuses on digital circuits while DFT for analog mixed signal circuits takes somewhat of a backseat br br br Objectives of DFT for microelectronics products br DFT affects and depends on the methods used for test development test application and diagnostics br Most tool supported DFT practiced in the industry today at least for digital circuits is predicated on a Structural test paradigm Structural test makes no direct attempt to determine if the overall functionality of the circuit is correct Instead it tries to make sure that the circuit has been assembled correctly from some low level building blocks as specified in a structural netlist For example are all specified logic gates present operating correctly and connected correctly The stipulation is that if the netlist is correct and structural testing has confirmed the correct assembly of the circuit elements then the circuit should be functioning correctly br Note that this is very different from functional testing which attempts to validate that the circuit under test functions according to its functional specification This is closely related to functional verification problem of determining if the circuit specified by the netlist meets the functional specifications assuming it is built correctly br One benefit of the Structural paradigm is that test generation can focus on testing a limited number of relatively simple circuit elements rather than having to deal with an exponentially exploding multiplicity of functional states and state transitions While the task of testing a single logic gate at a time sounds simple there is an obstacle to overcome For today s highly complex designs most gates are deeply embedded whereas the test equipment is only connected to the primary Input outputs I Os and or some physical test points The embedded gates hence must be manipulated through intervening layers of logic If the intervening logic contains state elements then the issue of an exponentially exploding state space and state transition sequencing creates an unsolvable problem for test generation To simplify test generation DFT addresses the accessibility problem by removing the need for complicated state transition sequences when trying to control and or observe what s happening at some internal circuit element br Depending on the DFT choices made during circuit design implementation the generation of Structural tests for complex logic circuits can be more or less automated or self automated Archived at the Wayback Machine One key objective of DFT methodologies hence is to allow designers to make trade offs between the amount and type of DFT and the cost benefit time effort quality of the test generation task br Another benefit is to diagnose a circuit in case any problem emerges in the future Its like adding some features or provisions in the design so that device can be tested in case of any fault during its use br br br Looking forward br One challenge for the industry is keeping up with the rapid advances in chip technology I O count size placement spacing I O speed internal circuit count speed power thermal control etc without being forced to continually upgrade the test equipment Modern DFT techniques hence have to offer options that allow next generation chips and assemblies to be tested on existing test equipment and or reduce the requirements cost for new test equipment As a result DFT techniques are continually being updated such as incorporation of compression in order to make sure that tester application times stay within certain bounds dictated by the cost target for the products under test br br br Diagnostics br Especially for advanced semiconductor technologies it is expected some of the chips on each manufactured wafer contain defects that render them non functional The primary objective of testing is to find and separate those non functional chips from the fully functional ones meaning that one or more responses captured by the tester from a non functional chip under test differ from the expected response The percentage of chips that fail test hence should be closely related to the expected functional yield for that chip type In reality however it is not uncommon that all chips of a new chip type arriving at the test floor for the first time fail so called zero yield situation In that case the chips have to go through a debug process that tries to identify the reason for the zero yield situation In other cases the test fall out percentage of test fails may be higher than expected acceptable or fluctuate suddenly Again the chips have to be subjected to an analysis process to identify the reason for the excessive test fall out br In both cases vital information about the nature of the underlying problem may be hidden in the way the chips fail during test To facilitate better analysis additional fail information beyond a simple pass fail is collected into a fail log The fail log typically contains information about when e g tester cycle where e g at what tester channel and how e g logic value the test failed Diagnostics attempt to derive from the fail log at which logical physical location inside the chip the problem most likely started By running a large number of failures through the diagnostics process called volume diagnostics systematic failures can be identified br In some cases e g Printed circuit boards Multi Chip Modules MCMs embedded or stand alone memories it may be possible to repair a failing circuit under test For that purpose diagnostics must quickly find the failing unit and create a work order for repairing replacing the failing unit br DFT approaches can be more or less diagnostics friendly The related objectives of DFT are to facilitate simplify fail data collection and diagnostics to an extent that can enable intelligent failure analysis FA sample selection as well as improve the cost accuracy speed and throughput of diagnostics and FA br br br Scan design br The most common method for delivering test data from chip inputs to internal circuits under test CUTs for short and observing their outputs is called scan design In scan design registers flip flops or latches in the design are connected in one or more scan chains which are used to gain access to internal nodes of the chip Test patterns are shifted in via the scan chain s functional clock signals are pulsed to test the circuit during the capture cycle s and the results are then shifted out to chip output pins and compared against the expected good machine results br Straightforward application of scan techniques can result in large vector sets with corresponding long tester time and memory requirements Test compression techniques address this problem by decompressing the scan input on chip and compressing the test output Large gains are possible since any particular test vector usually only needs to set and or examine a small fraction of the scan chain bits br The output of a scan design may be provided in forms such as Serial Vector Format SVF to be executed by test equipment br br br Debug using DFT features br In addition to being useful for manufacturing go no go testing scan chains can also be used to debug chip designs In this context the chip is exercised in normal functional mode for example a computer or mobile phone chip might execute assembly language instructions At any time the chip clock can be stopped and the chip re configured into test mode At this point the full internal state can be dumped out or set to any desired values by use of the scan chains Another use of scan to aid debug consists of scanning in an initial state to all memory elements and then go back to functional mode to perform system debug The advantage is to bring the system to a known state without going through many clock cycles This use of scan chains along with the clock control circuits are a related sub discipline of logic design called Design for Debug or Design for
