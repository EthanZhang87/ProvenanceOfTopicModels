and br br br Gameplay br br Doom II was not dramatically different from its predecessor There were no major technological developments graphical improvements or substantial gameplay changes Instead the development team took advantage of advances in computer hardware since the release of the original game that allowed them to do more with their game engine by making much larger and more intricate levels The game still consists of the player navigating large nonlinear levels Each level is infested with demons that can be killed with a variety of weapons that can be picked up throughout the game Levels are completed by finding an exit whether it be a switch or a teleporter the goal is simply to advance to the next area As with its predecessor Doom II s levels can be completed in a straightforward fashion However because the levels are nonlinear players can wander off the beaten path and those that do are often rewarded with bonuses like health pickups and more powerful weapons Due to the larger and more complicated maps with larger groups of monsters the game had somewhat higher system requirements than the original br Rather than the player playing through three related episodes as in the first Doom gameplay takes place over levels two of which are secret levels that can be accessed from level albeit with interludes for when the story develops Instead of watching the player s progress on a map as in the original episodes of Doom the screens between each level simply show a background a style carried over to the bonus fourth episode of Doom available in The Ultimate Doom the retail re release of the original Doom This also means the player is never forced to lose all of their inventory after completing an episode br Doom II doubled the number of non boss monster types and started using bosses from the original Doom as normal level enemies in addition to adding a new weapon the super shotgun a very powerful double barreled shotgun and a new power up the megasphere br br br Multiplayer br Doom s multiplayer functionality was greatly improved in Doom II including out of the box support for a vastly increased number of dial up modems The two player dial up connection allowed one player to dial into the other player s computer in order to play either cooperatively or in deathmatch style combat There was also local area network LAN functionality added which was improved upon as patches and updates were released This functionality was later incorporated into the original Doom As with the original Doom multiplayer games used to be played using the dial up or LAN by the internal setup program setup exe through the online service DWANGO or with once popular programs like Kali and Kahn using SPX in Windows Nowadays in the modern standards Doom II can be played with almost any version of Windows across the internet using third party source ports such as Odamex Zandronum ZDaemon and are still popular today The Xbox Live Arcade port of Doom II supports online multiplayer via Xbox Live br br br Plot br Immediately following the events in Doom the player once again assumes the role of Doomguy After defeating the Spider Mastermind the marine finds a portal to Earth opened by demons After returning to Earth the marine finds that it has also been invaded by the demons who have killed billions of people br The humans who survived the attack have developed a plan to build massive spaceships which will carry the remaining survivors into space Unfortunately Earth s only ground spaceport has been taken over by the demons who placed a barrier over it preventing any ships from leaving The marine battles hordes of demons and is able to deactivate the force field allowing the remaining humans to escape Once all the survivors have escaped Earth the marine is the only human left on the planet br Just as he sits down to await death knowing that he saved humanity the marine then receives an off planet transmission from the survivors in orbit who have managed to find out where the armies of Hell are coming from The message reveals that the demonic base is in the center of the marine s own hometown He then fights through the city until he reaches the base but sees there is no way to stop the invasion on that side He decides to step into the portal to try deactivating it from the other side entering Hell br After fighting through the hordes of Hell the marine reaches the location of the biggest demon he has ever seen called the Icon of Sin Baphomet He kills the Icon of Sin by firing rockets into its exposed brain Its death causes devastation on Hell and the portal to Earth is sealed The marine wonders where evil people will go when they die now that Hell has been destroyed and reflects that rebuilding the world will be more fun than saving it as he begins his journey back home br br br Development br Most of the levels were designed by Sandy Petersen with American McGee playing a significant role as well The final level Icon of Sin contains an easter egg where two of the artists put the severed head of John Romero as the sprite hidden behind the icon on the wall which must be damaged by rocket splash damage three times to win the game Romero while playing the level to work on its sound effects accidentally stumbled upon this in joke of himself After realising what his co workers had done Romero himself answered by recording his voice saying To win the game you must kill me John Romero putting it through various filters to distort it then reverse the recording to create the demonic chant spoken by the head upon spotting the player The photo that was scanned for the John Romero s head sprite was from a Businessweek photo shot in One of Sandy s ideas that never made it to the final game
