title: Electric guitar design
id: 8892017
Electric guitar design is a type of industrial design where the looks and efficiency of the shape as well as the acoustical aspects of the guitar are important factors In the past many guitars have been designed with various odd shapes as well as very practical and convenient solutions to improve the usability of the object br br br History br George Beauchamp is occasionally credited with inventing the electric guitar by designing a lap steel guitar with a pickup though a lap steel does not have functional frets or a standard guitar type neck br The earliest electrified fretted guitars were hollow bodied archtop acoustic guitars to which some form of electromagnetic transducer had been attached The first commercial electrified guitar was the Electro Spanish Ken Roberts model produced from to by Rickenbacker with one Beauchamp designed pickup and an early Vib rola hand vibrato created by Doc Kauffman br br br Early years br br Paul Tutmarc built and may have offered an electric solid body guitar as early as under the brand Audiovox Tutmarc is also credited as the co inventor of the magnetic pickup along with Art Stimpson and the fretted electric bass guitar br Bob Wisner worked for Tutmarc converting tube radio amplifiers into guitar amplifiers eventually developing his own amplifier circuits so Tutmark s instruments could be sold matched up with amplifiers Paul was unsuccessful at obtaining a patent for his magnetic pickup as it was too similar to the telephone microphone coil sensor device br Audiovox production was handed over to Paul s son Bud Tutmarc who continued building these instruments under the Bud Electro brand until the early s Bud Tutmarc had been delegated by the senior Tutmarc the task of winding the pickup coils and he continued producing them for his own guitars He used horseshoe magnets in a single coil and later a hum cancelling dual coil configuration br When Wisner was hired by Rickenbacher later Rickenbacker he may have passed along Tutmarc s magnetic pickup design which strongly resembles the pickup on their cast aluminum lap steel guitar nicknamed The Frying Pan or The Pancake Guitar released in br Another early solid body electric guitar was built by musician and inventor Les Paul in the early s working after hours in the Epiphone Guitar factory His log guitar a wood post with a neck attached to it and two hollow body halves attached to the sides for appearance only was patented and is often considered to be the first of its kind although it shares nothing of design or hardware in common with the solid body Les Paul model later created by Gibson br br br Fender br br In and amplifier builder Leo Fender designed the first commercially successful solid body electric guitar with a single magnetic pickup which was initially named the Esquire The later two pickup version of the Esquire was called the Broadcaster The bolt on neck was consistent with Leo Fender s belief that the instrument design should be modular to allow cost effective and consistent manufacture and assembly as well as simplified repair or replacement The Broadcaster name was changed to Telecaster because of a legal dispute over the name br In the Fender Electric Instrument Company introduced the Fender Stratocaster or Strat It was positioned as a deluxe model and offered various product improvements and innovations over the Telecaster often based upon responses from working musicians These innovations included an ash or alder double cutaway body design with an integrated vibrato mechanism called a synchronized tremolo by Fender thus beginning a confusion of the terms that still continues three single coil pickups and comfort contours where the body edges are significantly contoured Leo Fender is also credited with developing the first commercially successful electric bass the Fender Precision Bass introduced in br br br Gibson br br The more traditionally designed and styled Gibson solid body instruments were a contrast to Leo Fender s modular designs and heavily contoured slab bodies with the most notable differentiator being the method of neck attachment and the scale of the neck Gibson Fender br Gibson like many guitar manufacturers had long offered semi acoustic guitars with pickups and previously rejected Les Paul and his log electric in the s In apparent response to the Telecaster Gibson introduced the first Gibson Les Paul solid body guitar in Les Paul was brought in only towards the end of the design process for details of the design and for marketing endorsement Features of the Les Paul include a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top much like a violin and earlier Gibson archtop hollow body electric guitars and contrasting edge binding two single coil soapbar pickups a scale mahogany neck with a more traditional glued in set neck joint binding on the edges of the fretboard and a tilt back headstock with three machine heads tuners to a side The earliest version had a combination bridge and trapeze tailpiece design as specified by Les Paul himself but was largely disliked and discontinued after the first year br Gibson then developed the Tune o matic bridge and separate stop tailpiece an adjustable non vibrato design still in wide use By Gibson had made the final major change to the Les Paul of today the humbucking pickup or humbucker The pickup invented by Seth Lover was a dual coil pickup which featured two windings connected out of phase and reverse wound in order to cancel the cycle mains hum that plagued single coil pickups as a byproduct the two coil design also produces a distinctive more mellow tone which appeals to many guitarists br br br Vox br In Vox introduced the pentagonal Phantom guitar originally made in England but soon after made by EKO of Italy It was followed a year later by the teardrop shaped Mark VI the prototype of which was used by Brian Jones of The Rolling Stones Vox guitars also experimented with onboard effects and electronics The Teardrop won a prize for its design In the mid s as the sound of electric string guitar became popular Vox introduced the Phantom XII and Mark XII electric string guitars Vox produced many more traditional and string electric guitars in both England and Italy It may be noted that the Phantom guitar shape was quite similar to that of first fretted electric bass guitar the Audiovox Electric Bass Fiddle of br In Vox introduced the revolutionary but problematic GuitarOrgan a Phantom VI guitar with internal organ electronics The instrument s trigger mechanism required a specially wired plectrum that completed circuit connections to each fret resulting in a very wide and unwieldy neck John Lennon was given one in a bid to secure an endorsement though this never panned out According to Up Tight the Velvet Underground Story Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones also tried one when asked by the Velvets if it worked his answer was negative The instrument never became popular but it was a precursor to the modern guitar synthesizer br br br Multiscale Fanned Fret Guitars br In recent years guitars and basses with multi scale or fanned fret fingerboards started to appear These instruments are supposed to offer an advantage over the classical fixed scale guitars and basses by providing more freedom in setting the tension of each string at the design and manufacturing phases This may result in a more uniform tension of the strings as well as possibly offer timbre and tonal characteristics somewhat different from the usual fixed scale instruments br br br Variant designs br Materials other than wood have been used Travis Bean and Kramer built guitars with aluminium necks The Gittler guitar was a skeleton design from the late s largely stainless steel br In for the Chicago NAMM trade show Ibanez built a pound solid brass guitar primarily as an attention getting gimmick but also to demonstrate that while such extreme mass would provide very long note sustain a characteristic sought by many guitarists the tonal qualities suffered br br Various plastics and composites have been employed Some hollow body Danelectro had Masonite body shells The Ampeg guitars designed by Dan Armstrong pioneered acrylic as a body material Fiberglass was used by Valco called Res O Glas for some models of hollow body Airline guitars sold through Montgomery Ward Carbon fiber has been used for necks as well as bodies br saw the introduction of guitar designer Jol Dantzig s first truly workable acoustic electric hybrid guitar design The instrument called the DuoTone was conceived while Dantzig was at Hamer Guitars Dantzig was also the designer of the first string bass Adapted by players like Ty Tabor Stone Gossard Elvis Costello and Jeff Tweedy the DuoTone was a full duplex instrument that could switch between acoustic and electric tones Recently there have been many entries in the hybrid category capable of both acoustic and electric tones including the T by Taylor Michael Kelly s Hybrid the Parker Fly and the Anderson Crowdster br In the s the band Neptune began building a weird metal guitar with rd bridge options incorporated A predecessor of this type of guitars is the Pencilina Linda Manzer designed the Pikasso guitar with multiple necks br br br See also br br br
