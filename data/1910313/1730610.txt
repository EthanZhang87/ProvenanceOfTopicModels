id: 1730610
Video games featuring sexual content have existed since the early days of the industry They can be found on most platforms and can be of any video game genre br The inclusion of sex in games has been subject to varying levels of controversy over the decades sometimes resulting in calls for increased regulation and legislation dealing directly with adult content br In Western gaming the promise of sexual content in games is commonly used as a marketing tool but many highly sexualized games do not feature any explicitly adult content Though some games do use sex acts or nudity as a narrative device in game reward or a gameplay element purely pornographic games are uncommon br However the Japanese pornographic eroge subgenre is popular worldwide First appearing in the s these games vary significantly in narrative complexity as well as the level of interactivity taking forms ranging from the visual novel to virtual reality experiences br br br History br br br s br One of the earliest video games to feature sexual themes was the text based Softporn Adventure published by On Line Systems for the Apple II Despite heavy piracy the game still sold copies roughly equivalent to of the number of Apple II computers sold at the time In a article in Time On Line reported that they were making a version of the game for straight women though this never materialized br Several pornographic games such as X Man were created for the Atari in the early s The video game company American Multiple Industries released three unlicensed games for the Atari Beat Em Eat Em Custer s Revenge and Bachelor Party The games were poorly received particularly Custer s Revenge which is considered to be one of the worst games ever made and AMI went out of business in Company PlayAround purchased the rights to these games and began distributing them under new titles in in cartridges br In Entertainment Enterprises Ltd released an arcade game called Swinging Singles which was mostly meant for bars adult stores and sex clubs The game requires the player to drive through the city maze gathering dots like Pac Man before reaching a brothel where the player is required to fight off venereal disease and collect keys to unlock sex scenes br Also released in was Strip Poker A Sizzling Game of Chance for the Commodore and other bit platforms which Artworx Software created br In Martech released a strip poker game featuring digitized pictures of Samantha Fox on the C ZX Spectrum and Amstrad The same company would later release the controversial Vixen featuring another page model Corinne Russell br Also in On line Systems now called Sierra On Line asked game designer Al Lowe to create an adult game in the graphical adventure style made popular by their King s Quest series Lowe took the basic elements of Softporn Adventure greatly expanded it and released it as the game Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards Sierra did not advertise the game and retailers were loath to carry it so initial sales were low However word of mouth spread and soon the Leisure Suit Larry series was a success spawning two sequels before the end of the decade s Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love in Several Wrong Places and s Leisure Suit Larry III Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals br br br s br With CD ROM and multimedia based games in the s most adult games featured video clips with limited interactivity Both pre rendered and real time D graphics were also used While most games could be considered nothing more than pornography some attempted to include actual stories and plots This can be seen in some games with less explicit content equal to an R rated or PG rated movie br saw the release of the first game in the Gals Panic series The game derived gameplay elements from an older title called Qix which did not have sexual images The object of the games is to slowly remove pieces of the playing field while avoiding an enemy or groups of enemies Removing the playing field slowly reveals pictures of models in escalating states of undress The game had nine sequels throughout the s with a final game in br Voyeur by Philips came out in for their CD i console While the game does not show any explicit nudity it allows the player to spy on several characters in lingerie and foreplay and explores taboos such as BDSM and incest br In the s NEC on the PC Engine series and PC FX and Sega on Sega Saturn were the only companies who officially allowed sexual content on their consoles in Japan but eroge was more prevalent on the NEC PC and FM Towns computer platforms br br br s br br Modern console publishers often have policies against depictions of nudity and explicit sexuality particularly Sony Computer Entertainment with its PlayStation brand of consoles BMX XXX for the PlayStation was censored in the American release while versions on the Xbox and GameCube were not and featured nudity However Sony allowed nudity in the title God of War and also developed by Sony a game based on Greek mythology set in Ancient Greece where nudity was perceived differently Nudity was subsequently featured in the game s sequels God of War II God of War Chains of Olympus God of War III God of War Ghost of Sparta and God of War Ascension which were also based on Greek mythology The full motion video quiz game The Guy Game gained notoriety for its use of an underage model The scenes in question led to a lawsuit by a woman who explained that she was only seventeen years old when the footage was taken thus classifying it as child pornography which is illegal to own or sell in some countries br Sex scenes and nudity have also appeared in Quantic Dream s Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain released for the PlayStation and PlayStation respectively br Sexuality and sexual frustration is also a theme prevalent in the Silent Hill series of survival horror games br A new generation of adult social games has emerged that bring multiple users together in sexual environments Examples include Red Light Center Singles Flirt Up Your Life and Playboy The Mansion While it is not explicitly intended for purely adult oriented entertainment the virtual world of Second Life which is made up almost entirely of player made content has an array of very exotic adult entertainment including nudity and full on sexual activities br Adult games may take the form of bootlegs circumventing mainstream publishers who may have policies against such games Patches or hacks to mainstream non adult games may add sexual and pornographic themes mostly for humor especially when sexuality was never intended in the original game Examples include the Tomb Raider video games the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Hot Coffee mod The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim and the Half Life FakeFactory Cinematic mod and ROM hacks for console emulators br The Internet has allowed adult games to receive wider availability and recognition including amateur games in Adobe Flash or Java It has also allowed amateurs to create and distribute adult text adventure games known as Adult Interactive Fiction or AIF br Modern consumer virtual reality headsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive allow users to engage in virtual sex through simulated environments An example is VR Kanojo br br br s br Blizzard Entertainment s game Overwatch has inspired a notable amount of fan made porn Short porn videos featuring official characters have been animated via Source Filmmaker and are popular on porn sites such as Pornhub Despite its popularity Blizzard has issued cease and desist orders to some of the creators br Indie games have expanded the reach of adult games and Steam now allows adult games onto its storefront Patreon provides direct funding to adult developers allowing games like Hardcoded to appeal to niche markets that previously would not have been created br The continuing rise of open source software development practices has also influenced adult video games allowing communities of amateurs to collaboratively create and distribute adult games via the Internet br br br Eroge br br In Japan s Koei founded by husband and wife team Yoichi and Keiko Erikawa and later known for strategy video games released the first erotic computer game with sexually explicit graphics Night Life an early graphic adventure game for the NEC PC That same year Koei released another erotic title Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku Seduction of the Condominium Wife which was an early role playing adventure game with colour graphics owing to the eight color palette of the NEC PC computer It became a hit helping Koei become a major software company br In another opinion Yuji Horii recalled in that he saw a demonstration of a Yaky ken like game running on the FM in the end of and he considered Yaky ken was the origin of adult games Some writers say that Yaky ken produced for Sharp MZ computers by Hudson Soft is the first Japanese adult game br Like with Koei several other now famous Japanese companies such as Enix Square and Nihon Falcom also released erotic adult games for the PC computer in the early s before they became mainstream Early eroge usually had simplistic stories and extreme sexual content such as rape and lolicon In some of the early erotic games the erotic content is meaningfully integrated into a thoughtful and mature storyline though others often used it as simply an excuse for pornography br In Key released Kanon It contains about brief erotic scenes in a sentimental story the size of a long novel an all ages version was also released afterward Kanon sold over copies br In response to increasing pressure from Japanese lobby groups in mid Sega of Japan announced that they would no longer permit Sega Saturn games to include nudity br Many fanservice video games with sexual content have some brief nudity The M rated series Senran Kagura has some nudity in both gameplay and cutscenes but genitals are not displayed Fanservice games rated T such as Hyperdimension Neptunia offer similar content but less than what Senran Kagura has However since Sony has now issued new regulations for PlayStation games with both fanservice and sexual content For the localized release of Senran Kagura Burst Re Newal Intimacy Mode a mode where the player can play with the characters bodies was removed but by comparison this mode is still available in the series previous titles Senran Kagura Estival Versus and Senran Kagura Peach Beach Splash The PC release of Burst Re Newal was not changed Many other recent PS games with sexual content are facing the same problem from Sony including Neptunia Date a Live Rio Reincarnation Death end re Quest and the Nekopara series although Sony did allow nudity and a sex scene in The Last of Us Part II This controversy had become a problem for the development of Senran Kagura even in which publishers Marvelous are now reconsidering the game and series producer Kenichiro Takaki is now leaving Marvelous br br br Lists of related games br List of erotic video games br List of regionally censored
