id: 13777
A hard disk drive HDD hard disk hard drive or fixed disk is an electro mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material The platters are paired with magnetic heads usually arranged on a moving actuator arm which read and write data to the platter surfaces Data is accessed in a random access manner meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order HDDs are a type of non volatile storage retaining stored data when powered off Modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box br Hard disk drives were introduced by IBM in and were the dominant secondary storage device for general purpose computers beginning in the early s HDDs maintained this position into the modern era of servers and personal computers though personal computing devices produced in large volume like mobile phones and tablets rely on flash memory storage devices More than companies have produced HDDs historically though after extensive industry consolidation most units are manufactured by Seagate Toshiba and Western Digital HDDs dominate the volume of storage produced exabytes per year for servers Though production is growing slowly by exabytes shipped sales revenues and unit shipments are declining because solid state drives SSDs have higher data transfer rates higher areal storage density somewhat better reliability and much lower latency and access times br The revenues for SSDs most of which use NAND flash memory slightly exceeded those for HDDs in Flash storage products had more than twice the revenue of hard disk drives as of Though SSDs have four to nine times higher cost per bit they are replacing HDDs in applications where speed power consumption small size high capacity and durability are important As of the cost per bit of SSDs is falling and the price premium over HDDs has narrowed br The primary characteristics of an HDD are its capacity and performance Capacity is specified in unit prefixes corresponding to powers of a terabyte TB drive has a capacity of gigabytes where gigabyte megabytes kilobytes million bytes billion Typically some of an HDD s capacity is unavailable to the user because it is used by the file system and the computer operating system and possibly inbuilt redundancy for error correction and recovery There can be confusion regarding storage capacity since capacities are stated in decimal gigabytes powers of by HDD manufacturers whereas the most commonly used operating systems report capacities in powers of which results in a smaller number than advertised Performance is specified as the time required to move the heads to a track or cylinder average access time the time it takes for the desired sector to move under the head average latency which is a function of the physical rotational speed in revolutions per minute and finally the speed at which the data is transmitted data rate br The two most common form factors for modern HDDs are inch for desktop computers and inch primarily for laptops HDDs are connected to systems by standard interface cables such as SATA Serial ATA USB SAS Serial Attached SCSI or PATA Parallel ATA cables br br br History br br The first production IBM hard disk drive the disk storage shipped in as a component of the IBM RAMAC system It was approximately the size of two large refrigerators and stored five million six bit characters megabytes on a stack of disks surfaces used The had a single arm with two read write heads one facing up and the other down that moved both horizontally between a pair of adjacent platters and vertically from one pair of platters to a second set Variants of the IBM were the IBM IBM and IBM br In IBM announced and in shipped the IBM disk storage unit which superseded br the IBM and similar drives The consisted of one for Model or two for model modules each containing platters each platter about inch mm thick and inches mm in diameter While the earlier IBM disk drives used only two read write heads per arm the used an array of heads comb each array moving horizontally as a single unit one head per surface used Cylinder mode read write operations were supported and the heads flew about micro inches about m above the platter surface Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning The cabinet was about the size of three large refrigerators placed side by side storing the equivalent of about million eight bit bytes per module Access time was about a quarter of a second br Also in IBM introduced the model disk drive which was about the size of a washing machine and stored two million characters on a removable disk pack Users could buy additional packs and interchange them as needed much like reels of magnetic tape Later models of removable pack drives from IBM and others became the norm in most computer installations and reached capacities of megabytes by the early s Non removable HDDs were called fixed disk drives br In IBM introduced the with twice the track capacity and twice as many tracks per cylinder as the The had one for Model or two for Model modules each containing a separate comb for the first tracks and the last tracks br Some high performance HDDs were manufactured with one head per track e g Burroughs B in IBM in so that no time was lost physically moving the heads to a track and the only latency was the time for the desired block of data to rotate into position under the head Known as fixed head or head per track disk drives they were very expensive and are no longer in production br In IBM introduced a new type of HDD code named Winchester Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down Instead the heads were allowed to land on a special area of the disk surface upon spin down taking off again when the disk was later powered on This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day Instead the first models of Winchester technology drives featured a removable disk module which included both the disk pack and the head assembly leaving the actuator motor in the drive upon removal Later Winchester drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to non removable platters br In IBM introduced the swinging arm actuator made feasible because the Winchester recording heads function well when skewed to the recorded tracks The simple design of the IBM GV Gulliver drive invented at IBM s UK Hursley Labs became IBM s most licensed electro mechanical invention of all time the actuator and filtration system being adopted in the s eventually for all HDDs and still universal nearly years and billion arms later br Like the first removable pack drive the first Winchester drives used platters inches mm in diameter In IBM introduced a swing arm drive the IBM Piccolo with eight inch platters exploring the possibility that smaller platters might offer advantages Other eight inch drives followed then in mm drives sized to replace the contemporary floppy disk drives The latter were primarily intended for the then fledgling personal computer PC market br Over time as recording densities were greatly increased further reductions in disk diameter to and were found to be optimum Powerful rare earth magnet materials became affordable during this period and were complementary to the swing arm actuator design to make possible the compact form factors of modern HDDs br As the s began HDDs were a rare and very expensive additional feature in PCs but by the late s their cost had been reduced to the point where they were standard on all but the cheapest computers br Most HDDs in the early s were sold to PC end users as an external add on subsystem The subsystem was not sold under the drive manufacturer s name but under the subsystem manufacturer s name such as Corvus Systems and Tallgrass Technologies or under the PC system manufacturer s name such as the Apple ProFile The IBM PC XT in included an internal MB HDD and soon thereafter internal HDDs proliferated on personal computers br External HDDs remained popular for much longer on the Apple Macintosh Many Macintosh computers made between and featured a SCSI port on the back making external expansion simple Older compact Macintosh computers did not have user accessible hard drive bays indeed the Macintosh K Macintosh K and Macintosh Plus did not feature a hard drive bay at all so on those models external SCSI disks were the only reasonable option for expanding upon any internal storage br HDD improvements have been driven by increasing areal density listed in the table above Applications expanded through the s from the mainframe computers of the late s to most mass storage applications including computers and consumer applications such as storage of entertainment content br In the s and s NAND began supplanting HDDs in applications requiring portability or high performance NAND performance is improving faster than HDDs and applications for HDDs are eroding In the largest hard drive had a capacity of TB while the largest capacity SSD had a capacity of TB As of HDDs were forecast to reach TB capacities around but as of the expected pace of improvement was pared back to TB by Smaller form factors inches and below were discontinued around The cost of solid state storage NAND represented by Moore s law is improving faster than HDDs NAND has a higher price elasticity of demand than HDDs and this drives market growth During the late s and s the product life cycle of HDDs entered a mature phase and slowing sales may indicate the onset of the declining phase br The Thailand floods damaged the manufacturing plants and impacted hard disk drive cost adversely between and br In Western Digital closed its last Malaysian HDD factory due to decreasing demand to focus on SSD production All three remaining HDD manufacturers have had decreasing demand for their HDDs since br br br Technology br br br Magnetic recording br br A modern HDD records data by magnetizing a thin film of ferromagnetic material on both sides of a disk Sequential changes in the direction of magnetization represent binary data bits The data is read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization User data is encoded using an encoding scheme such as run length limited encoding which determines how the data is represented by the magnetic transitions br A typical HDD design consists of a spindle that holds flat circular disks called platters which hold the recorded data The platters are made from a non magnetic material usually aluminum alloy glass or ceramic They are coated with a shallow layer of magnetic material typically nm in depth with an outer layer of carbon for protection For reference a standard piece of copy paper is mm nm thick br br The platters in contemporary HDDs are spun at speeds varying from RPM in energy efficient portable devices to rpm for high performance servers The first HDDs spun at rpm and for many years rpm was the norm As of November the platters in most consumer grade HDDs spin at or RPM br Information is written to and read from a platter as it rotates past devices called read and write heads that are positioned to operate very close to the magnetic surface with their flying height often in the range of tens of nanometers The read and write head is used to detect and modify the magnetization of the material passing immediately under it br In modern drives there is one head for each magnetic platter surface on the spindle mounted on a common arm An actuator arm or access arm moves the heads on an arc roughly radially across the platters as they spin allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins The arm is moved using a voice coil actuator or in some older designs a stepper motor Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second resulting in all tracks having the same amount of data per track but modern drives since the s use zone bit recording increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones br In modern drives the small size of the magnetic regions creates the danger that their magnetic state might be lost because of thermal effects thermally induced magnetic instability which is commonly known as the superparamagnetic limit To counter this the platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers separated by a three atom layer of the non magnetic element ruthenium and the two layers are magnetized in opposite orientation thus reinforcing each other Another technology used to overcome thermal effects to allow greater recording densities is perpendicular recording PMR first shipped in and as of used in certain HDDs Perpendicular recording may be accompanied by changes in the manufacturing of the read write heads to increase the strength of the magnetic field created by the heads br In a higher density recording media was introduced consisting of coupled soft and hard magnetic layers So called exchange spring media magnetic storage technology also known as exchange coupled composite media allows good writability due to the write assist nature of the soft layer However the thermal stability is determined only by the hardest layer and not influenced by the soft layer br Flux control MAMR FC MAMR allows a hard drive to have increased recording capacity without the need for new hard disk drive platter materials MAMR hard drives have a microwave generating spin torque generator STO on the read write heads which allows physically smaller bits to be recorded to the platters increasing areal density Normally hard drive recording heads have a pole called a main pole that is used for writing to the platters and adjacent to this pole is an air gap and a shield The write coil of the head surrounds the pole The STO device is placed in the air gap between the pole and the shield to increase the strength of the magnetic field created by the pole FC MAMR technically doesn t use microwaves but uses technology employed in MAMR The STO has a Field Generation Layer FGL and a Spin Injection Layer SIL and the FGL produces a magnetic field using spin polarised electrons originating in the SIL which is a form of spin torque energy br br br Components br br A typical HDD has two electric motors a spindle motor that spins the disks and an actuator motor that positions the read write head assembly across the spinning disks The disk motor has an external rotor attached to the disks the stator windings are fixed in place Opposite the actuator at the end of the head support arm is the read write head thin printed circuit cables connect the read write heads to amplifier electronics mounted at the pivot of the actuator The head support arm is very light but also stiff in modern drives acceleration at the head reaches g br br The actuator is a permanent magnet and moving coil motor that swings the heads to the desired position A metal plate supports a squat neodymium iron boron NIB high flux magnet Beneath this plate is the moving coil often referred to as the voice coil by analogy to the coil in loudspeakers which is attached to the actuator hub and beneath that is a second NIB magnet mounted on the bottom plate of the motor some drives have only one magnet br The voice coil itself is shaped rather like an arrowhead and is made of doubly coated copper magnet wire The inner layer is insulation and the outer is thermoplastic which bonds the coil together after it is wound on a form making it self supporting The portions of the coil along the two sides of the arrowhead which point to the center of the actuator bearing then interact with the magnetic field of the fixed magnet Current flowing radially outward along one side of the arrowhead and radially inward on the other produces the tangential force If the magnetic field were uniform each side would generate opposing forces that would cancel each other out Therefore the surface of the magnet is half north pole and half south pole with the radial dividing line in the middle causing the two sides of the coil to see opposite magnetic fields and produce forces that add instead of canceling Currents along the top and bottom of the coil produce radial forces that do not rotate the head br The HDD s electronics controls the movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk and transfers data to from a disk controller Feedback of the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to servo feedback These are either complete concentric circles in the case of dedicated servo technology or segments interspersed with real data in the case of embedded servo otherwise known as sector servo technology The servo feedback optimizes the signal to noise ratio of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice coil motor to rotate the arm A more modern servo system also employs milli and or micro actuators to more accurately position the read write heads The spinning of the disks uses fluid bearing spindle motors Modern disk firmware is capable of scheduling reads and writes efficiently on the platter surfaces and remapping sectors of the media that have failed br br br Error rates and handling br Modern drives make extensive use of error correction codes ECCs particularly Reed Solomon error correction These techniques store extra bits determined by mathematical formulas for each block of data the extra bits allow many errors to be corrected invisibly The extra bits themselves take up space on the HDD but allow higher recording densities to be employed without causing uncorrectable errors resulting in much larger storage capacity For example a typical TB hard disk with byte sectors provides additional capacity of about GB for the ECC data br In the newest drives as of low density parity check codes LDPC were supplanting Reed Solomon LDPC codes enable performance close to the Shannon limit and thus provide the highest storage density available br Typical hard disk drives attempt to remap the data in a physical sector that is failing to a spare physical sector provided by the drive s spare sector pool also called reserve pool while relying on the ECC to recover stored data while the number of errors in a bad sector is still low enough The S M A R T Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology feature counts the total number of errors in the entire HDD fixed by ECC although not on all hard drives as the related S M A R T attributes Hardware ECC Recovered and Soft ECC Correction are not consistently supported and the total number of performed sector remappings as the occurrence of many such errors may predict an HDD failure br The No ID Format developed by IBM in the mid s contains information about which sectors are bad and where remapped sectors have been located br Only a tiny fraction of the detected errors end up as not correctable Examples of specified uncorrected bit read error rates include br br specifications for enterprise SAS disk drives state the error rate to be one uncorrected bit read error in every bits read br specifications for consumer SATA hard drives state the error rate to be one uncorrected bit read error in every bits br Within a given manufacturers model the uncorrected bit error rate is typically the same regardless of capacity of the drive br The worst type of errors are silent data corruptions which are errors undetected by the disk firmware or the host operating system some of these errors may be caused by hard disk drive malfunctions while others originate elsewhere in the connection between the drive and the host br br br Development br br The rate of areal density advancement was similar to Moore s law doubling every two years through per year during during and during Speaking in Gordon Moore called the increase flabbergasting while observing later that growth cannot continue forever Price improvement decelerated to per year during as the growth of areal density slowed The rate of advancement for areal density slowed to per year during and there was difficulty in migrating from perpendicular recording to newer technologies br As bit cell size decreases more data can be put onto a single drive platter In a production desktop TB HDD with four platters would have had an areal density of about Gbit in which would have amounted to a bit cell comprising about magnetic grains by grains Since the mid s areal density progress has been challenged by a superparamagnetic trilemma involving grain size grain magnetic strength and ability of the head to write In order to maintain acceptable signal to noise smaller grains are required smaller grains may self reverse electrothermal instability unless their magnetic strength is increased but known write head materials are unable to generate a strong enough magnetic field sufficient to write the medium in the increasingly smaller space taken by grains br Magnetic storage technologies are being developed to address this trilemma and compete with flash memory based solid state drives SSDs In Seagate introduced shingled magnetic recording SMR intended as something of a stopgap technology between PMR and Seagate s intended successor heat assisted magnetic recording HAMR SMR utilises overlapping tracks for increased data density at the cost of design complexity and lower data access speeds particularly write speeds and random access k speeds br By contrast HGST now part of Western Digital focused on developing ways to seal helium filled drives instead of the usual filtered air Since turbulence and friction are reduced higher areal densities can be achieved due to using a smaller track width and the energy dissipated due to friction is lower as well resulting in a lower power draw Furthermore more platters can be fit into the same enclosure space although helium gas is notoriously difficult to prevent escaping Thus helium drives are completely sealed and do not have a breather port unlike their air filled counterparts br Other recording technologies are either under research or have been commercially implemented to increase areal density including Seagate s heat assisted magnetic recording HAMR HAMR requires a different architecture with redesigned media and read write heads new lasers and new near field optical transducers HAMR is expected to ship commercially in late or Technical issues delayed the introduction of HAMR by a decade from earlier projections of and the first half of Some drives have adopted dual independent actuator arms to increase read write speeds and compete with SSDs HAMR s planned successor bit patterned recording BPR has been removed from the roadmaps of Western Digital and Seagate Western Digital s microwave assisted magnetic recording MAMR also referred to as energy assisted magnetic recording EAMR was sampled in with the first EAMR drive the Ultrastar HC shipping in late Two dimensional magnetic recording TDMR and current perpendicular to plane giant magnetoresistance CPP GMR heads have appeared in research papers A D actuated vacuum drive DHD concept and D magnetic recording have been proposed br Depending upon assumptions on feasibility and timing of these technologies Seagate forecasts that areal density will grow per year during br br br Capacity br br The highest capacity HDDs shipping commercially in are TB The capacity of a hard disk drive as reported by an operating system to the end user is smaller than the amount stated by the manufacturer for several reasons e g the operating system using some space use of some space for data redundancy space use for file system structures Confusion of decimal prefixes and binary prefixes can also lead to errors br br br Calculation br Modern hard disk drives appear to their host controller as a contiguous set of logical blocks and the gross drive capacity is calculated by multiplying the number of blocks by the block size This information is available from the manufacturer s product specification and from the drive itself through use of operating system functions that invoke low level drive commands Older IBM and compatible drives e g IBM using the CKD record format have variable length records such drive capacity calculations must take into account the characteristics of the records Some newer DASD simulate CKD and the same capacity formulae apply br The gross capacity of older sector oriented HDDs is calculated as the product of the number of cylinders per recording zone the number of bytes per sector most commonly and the count of zones of the drive Some modern SATA drives also report cylinder head sector CHS capacities but these are not physical parameters because the reported values are constrained by historic operating system interfaces The C H S scheme has been replaced by logical block addressing LBA a simple linear addressing scheme that locates blocks by an integer index which starts at LBA for the first block and increments thereafter When using the C H S method to describe modern large drives the number of heads is often set to although a typical modern hard disk drive has between one and four platters In modern HDDs spare capacity for defect management is not included in the published capacity however in many early HDDs a certain number of sectors were reserved as spares thereby reducing the capacity available to the operating system Furthermore many HDDs store their firmware in a reserved service zone which is typically not accessible by the user and is not included in the capacity calculation br For RAID subsystems data integrity and fault tolerance requirements also reduce the realized capacity For example a RAID array has about half the total capacity as a result of data mirroring while a RAID array with n drives loses n of capacity which equals to the capacity of a single drive due to storing parity information RAID subsystems are multiple drives that appear to be one drive or more drives to the user but provide fault tolerance Most RAID vendors use checksums to improve data integrity at the block level Some vendors design systems using HDDs with sectors of bytes to contain bytes of user data and eight checksum bytes or by using separate byte sectors for the checksum data br Some systems may use hidden partitions for system recovery reducing the capacity available to the end user without knowledge of special disk partitioning utilities like diskpart in Windows br br br Formatting br br Data is stored on a hard drive in a series of logical blocks Each block is delimited by markers identifying its start and end error detecting and correcting information and space between blocks to allow for minor timing variations These blocks often contained bytes of usable data but other sizes have been used As drive density increased an initiative known as Advanced Format extended the block size to bytes of usable data with a resulting significant reduction in the amount of disk space used for block headers error checking data and spacing br The process of initializing these logical blocks on the physical disk platters is called low level formatting which is usually performed at the factory and is not normally changed in the field High level formatting writes data structures used by the operating system to organize data files on the disk This includes writing partition and file system structures into selected logical blocks For example some of the disk space will be used to hold a directory of disk file names and a list of logical blocks associated with a particular file br Examples of partition mapping scheme include Master boot record MBR and GUID Partition Table GPT Examples of data structures stored on disk to retrieve files include the File Allocation Table FAT in the DOS file system and inodes in many UNIX file systems as well as other operating system data structures also known as metadata As a consequence not all the space on an HDD is available for user files but this system overhead is usually small compared with user data br br br Units br br In the early days of computing the total capacity of HDDs was specified in seven to nine decimal digits frequently truncated with the idiom millions br By the s the total capacity of HDDs was given by manufacturers using SI decimal prefixes such as megabytes MB bytes gigabytes GB bytes and terabytes TB bytes However capacities of memory are usually quoted using a binary interpretation of the prefixes i e using powers of instead of br Software reports hard disk drive or memory capacity in different forms using either decimal or binary prefixes The Microsoft Windows family of operating systems uses the binary convention when reporting storage capacity so an HDD offered by its manufacturer as a TB drive is reported by these operating systems as a GB HDD Mac OS X Snow Leopard uses decimal convention when reporting HDD capacity The default behavior of the df command line utility on Linux is to report the HDD capacity as a number of byte units br The difference between the decimal and binary prefix interpretation caused some consumer confusion and led to class action suits against HDD manufacturers The plaintiffs argued that the use of decimal prefixes effectively misled consumers while the defendants denied any wrongdoing or liability asserting that their marketing and advertising complied in all respects with the law and that no class member sustained any damages or injuries In a California court ruled that use of the decimal prefixes with a decimal meaning was not misleading br br br Form factors br br IBM s first hard disk drive the IBM used a stack of fifty inch platters stored MB of data approximately the size of one modern digital picture and was of a size comparable to two large refrigerators In IBM introduced its model disk which used six inch nominal size platters in a removable pack and was roughly the size of a washing machine This became a standard platter size for many years used also by other manufacturers The IBM used platters of the same size in an eleven high pack and introduced the drive in a drawer layout sometimes called the pizza oven although the drawer was not the complete drive Into the s HDDs were offered in standalone cabinets of varying dimensions containing from one to four HDDs br Beginning in the late s drives were offered that fit entirely into a chassis that would mount in a inch rack Digital s RK and RL were early examples using single inch platters in removable packs the entire drive fitting in a inch high rack space six rack units In the mid to late s the similarly sized Fujitsu Eagle which used coincidentally inch platters was a popular product br With increasing sales of microcomputers having built in floppy disk drives FDDs HDDs that would fit to the FDD mountings became desirable Starting with the Shugart Associates SA HDD form factors initially followed those of inch inch and inch floppy disk drives Although referred to by these nominal sizes the actual sizes for those three drives respectively are and wide Because there were no smaller floppy disk drives smaller HDD form factors such as inch drives actually wide developed from product offerings or industry standards br As of inch and inch hard disks are the most popular sizes By all manufacturers had discontinued the development of new products for the inch inch and inch form factors due to falling prices of flash memory which has no moving parts While nominal sizes are in inches actual dimensions are specified in millimeters br br br Performance characteristics br br The factors that limit the time to access the data on an HDD are mostly related to the mechanical nature of the rotating disks and moving heads including br br Seek time is a measure of how long it takes the head assembly to travel to the track of the disk that contains data br Rotational latency is incurred because the desired disk sector may not be directly under the head when data transfer is requested Average rotational latency is shown in the table based on the statistical relation that the average latency is one half the rotational period br The bit rate or data transfer rate once the head is in the right position creates delay which is a function of the number of blocks transferred typically relatively small but can be quite long with the transfer of large contiguous files br Delay may also occur if the drive disks are stopped to save energy br Defragmentation is a procedure used to minimize delay in retrieving data by moving related items to physically proximate areas on the disk Some computer operating systems perform defragmentation automatically Although automatic defragmentation is intended to reduce access delays performance will be temporarily reduced while the procedure is in progress br Time to access data can be improved by increasing rotational speed thus reducing latency or by reducing the time spent seeking Increasing areal density increases throughput by increasing data rate and by increasing the amount of data under a set of heads thereby potentially reducing seek activity for a given amount of data The time to access data has not kept up with throughput increases which themselves have not kept up with growth in bit density and storage capacity br br br Latency br br br Data transfer rate br As of a typical rpm desktop HDD has a sustained disk to buffer data transfer rate up to Mbit s This rate depends on the track location the rate is higher for data on the outer tracks where there are more data sectors per rotation and lower toward the inner tracks where there are fewer data sectors per rotation and is generally somewhat higher for rpm drives A current widely used standard for the buffer to computer interface is Gbit s SATA which can send about megabyte s bit encoding from the buffer to the computer and thus is still comfortably ahead of today s disk to buffer transfer rates Data transfer rate read write can be measured by writing a large file to disk using special file generator tools then reading back the file Transfer rate can be influenced by file system fragmentation and the layout of the files br HDD data transfer rate depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates Higher speeds require a more powerful spindle motor which creates more heat While areal density advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk and the number of sectors per track only the latter increases the data transfer rate for a given rpm Since data transfer rate performance tracks only one of the two components of areal density its performance improves at a lower rate br br br Other considerations br Other performance considerations include quality adjusted price power consumption audible noise and both operating and non operating shock resistance br br br Access and interfaces br br Current hard drives connect to a computer over one of several bus types including parallel ATA Serial ATA SCSI Serial Attached SCSI SAS and Fibre Channel Some drives especially external portable drives use IEEE or USB All of these interfaces are digital electronics on the drive process the analog signals from the read write heads Current drives present a consistent interface to the rest of the computer independent of the data encoding scheme used internally and independent of the physical number of disks and heads within the drive br Typically a DSP in the electronics inside the drive takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses PRML and Reed Solomon error correction to decode the data then sends that data out the standard interface That DSP also watches the error rate detected by error detection and correction and performs bad sector remapping data collection for Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology and other internal tasks br Modern interfaces connect the drive to the host interface with a single data control cable Each drive also has an additional power cable usually direct to the power supply unit Older interfaces had separate cables for data signals and for drive control signals br br Small Computer System Interface SCSI originally named SASI for Shugart Associates System Interface was standard on servers workstations Commodore Amiga Atari ST and Apple Macintosh computers through the mid s by which time most models had been transitioned to newer interfaces The length limit of the data cable allows for external SCSI devices The SCSI command set is still used in the more modern SAS interface br Integrated Drive Electronics IDE later standardized under the name AT Attachment ATA with the alias PATA Parallel ATA retroactively added upon introduction of SATA moved the HDD controller from the interface card to the disk drive This helped to standardize the host controller interface reduce the programming complexity in the host device driver and reduced system cost and complexity The pin IDE ATA connection transfers bits of data at a time on the data cable The data cable was originally conductor but later higher speed requirements led to an ultra DMA UDMA mode using an conductor cable with additional wires to reduce crosstalk at high speed br EIDE was an unofficial update by Western Digital to the original IDE standard with the key improvement being the use of direct memory access DMA to transfer data between the disk and the computer without the involvement of the CPU an improvement later adopted by the official ATA standards By directly transferring data between memory and disk DMA eliminates the need for the CPU to copy byte per byte therefore allowing it to process other tasks while the data transfer occurs br Fibre Channel FC is a successor to parallel SCSI interface on enterprise market It is a serial protocol In disk drives usually the Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop FC AL connection topology is used FC has much broader usage than mere disk interfaces and it is the cornerstone of storage area networks SANs Recently other protocols for this field like iSCSI and ATA over Ethernet have been developed as well Confusingly drives usually use copper twisted pair cables for Fibre Channel not fibre optics The latter are traditionally reserved for larger devices such as servers or disk array controllers br Serial Attached SCSI SAS The SAS is a new generation serial communication protocol for devices designed to allow for much higher speed data transfers and is compatible with SATA SAS uses a mechanically compatible data and power connector to standard inch SATA SATA HDDs and many server oriented SAS RAID controllers are also capable of addressing SATA HDDs SAS uses serial communication instead of the parallel method found in traditional SCSI devices but still uses SCSI commands br Serial ATA SATA The SATA data cable has one data pair for differential transmission of data to the device and one pair for differential receiving from the device just like EIA That requires that data be transmitted serially A similar differential signaling system is used in RS LocalTalk USB FireWire and differential SCSI SATA I to III are designed to be compatible with and use a subset of SAS commands and compatible interfaces Therefore a SATA hard drive can be connected to and controlled by a SAS hard drive controller with some minor exceptions such as drives controllers with limited compatibility However they cannot be connected the other way round a SATA controller cannot be connected to a SAS drive br br br Integrity and failure br br Due to the extremely close spacing between the heads and the disk surface HDDs are vulnerable to being damaged by a head crash a failure of the disk in which the head scrapes across the platter surface often grinding away the thin magnetic film and causing data loss Head crashes can be caused by electronic failure a sudden power failure physical shock contamination of the drive s internal enclosure wear and tear corrosion or poorly manufactured platters and heads br The HDD s spindle system relies on air density inside the disk enclosure to support the heads at their proper flying height while the disk rotates HDDs require a certain range of air densities to operate properly The connection to the external environment and density occurs through a small hole in the enclosure about mm in breadth usually with a filter on the inside the breather filter If the air density is too low then there is not enough lift for the flying head so the head gets too close to the disk and there is a risk of head crashes and data loss Specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high altitude operation above about m ft Modern disks include temperature sensors and adjust their operation to the operating environment Breather holes can be seen on all disk drives they usually have a sticker next to them warning the user not to cover the holes The air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters This air passes through an internal recirculation or recirc filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture any particles or chemicals that may have somehow entered the enclosure and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation Very high humidity present for extended periods of time can corrode the heads and platters An exception to this are hermetically sealed helium filled HDDs that largely eliminate environmental issues that can arise due to humidity or atmospheric pressure changes Such HDDs were introduced by HGST in their first successful high volume implementation in br For giant magnetoresistive GMR heads in particular a minor head crash from contamination that does not remove the magnetic surface of the disk still results in the head temporarily overheating due to friction with the disk surface and can render the data unreadable for a short period until the head temperature stabilizes so called thermal asperity a problem which can partially be dealt with by proper electronic filtering of the read signal br When the logic board of a hard disk fails the drive can often be restored to functioning order and the data recovered by replacing the circuit board with one of an identical hard disk In the case of read write head faults they can be replaced using specialized tools in a dust free environment If the disk platters are undamaged they can be transferred into an identical enclosure and the data can be copied or cloned onto a new drive In the event of disk platter failures disassembly and imaging of the disk platters may be required For logical damage to file systems a variety of tools including fsck on UNIX like systems and CHKDSK on Windows can be used for data recovery Recovery from logical damage can require file carving br A common expectation is that hard disk drives designed and marketed for server use will fail less frequently than consumer grade drives usually used in desktop computers However two independent studies by Carnegie Mellon University and Google found that the grade of a drive does not relate to the drive s failure rate br A summary of research into SSD and magnetic disk failure patterns by Tom s Hardware summarized research findings as follows br br Mean time between failures MTBF does not indicate reliability the annualized failure rate is higher and usually more relevant br HDDs do not tend to fail during early use and temperature has only a minor effect instead failure rates steadily increase with age br S M A R T warns of mechanical issues but not other issues affecting reliability and is therefore not a reliable indicator of condition br Failure rates of drives sold as enterprise and consumer are very much similar although these drive types are customized for their different operating environments br In drive arrays one drive s failure significantly increases the short term risk of a second drive failing br As of Backblaze a storage provider reported an annualized failure rate of two percent per year for a storage farm with off the shelf HDDs with the reliability varying widely between models and manufacturers Backblaze subsequently reported that the failure rate for HDDs and SSD of equivalent age was similar br To minimize cost and overcome failures of individual HDDs storage systems providers rely on redundant HDD arrays HDDs that fail are replaced on an ongoing basis br br br Market segments br br br Consumer segment br br Desktop HDDs br Desktop HDDs typically have two to five internal platters rotate at to rpm and have a media transfer rate of Gbit s or higher GB bytes Gbit s bit s Earlier s drives tend to be slower in rotation speed As of May the highest capacity desktop HDDs stored TB with plans to release TB drives later in TB HDDs were released in As of the typical speed of a hard drive in an average desktop computer is RPM whereas low cost desktop computers may use RPM or RPM drives For some time in the s and early s some desktop users and data centers also used RPM drives such as Western Digital Raptor but such drives have become much rarer as of and are not commonly used now having been replaced by NAND flash based SSDs br Mobile laptop HDDs br Smaller than their desktop and enterprise counterparts they tend to be slower and have lower capacity because typically has one internal platter and were or physical size instead of more common for desktops form factor Mobile HDDs spin at rpm rpm rpm or rpm with rpm being the most common rpm drives tend to be more expensive and have smaller capacities while rpm models usually have very high storage capacities Because of smaller platter s mobile HDDs generally have lower capacity than their desktop counterparts br Consumer electronics HDDs br These drives typically spin at RPM and include br br Video hard drives sometimes called surveillance hard drives are embedded into digital video recorders and provide a guaranteed streaming capacity even in the face of read and write errors br Drives embedded into automotive vehicles they are typically built to resist larger amounts of shock and operate over a larger temperature range br External and portable HDDs br br Current external hard disk drives typically connect via USB C earlier models use USB B sometimes with using of a pair of ports for better bandwidth or rarely eSATA connection Variants using USB interface generally have slower data transfer rates when compared to internally mounted hard drives connected through SATA Plug and play drive functionality offers system compatibility and features large storage options and portable design As of March available capacities for external hard disk drives ranged from GB to TB External hard disk drives are usually available as assembled integrated products but may be also assembled by combining an external enclosure with USB or other interface with a separately purchased drive They are available in inch and inch sizes inch variants are typically called portable external drives while inch variants are referred to as desktop external drives Portable drives are packaged in smaller and lighter enclosures than the desktop drives additionally portable drives use power provided by the USB connection while desktop drives require external power bricks Features such as encryption Wi Fi connectivity biometric security or multiple interfaces for example FireWire are available at a higher cost There are pre assembled external hard disk drives that when taken out from their enclosures cannot be used internally in a laptop or desktop computer due to embedded USB interface on their printed circuit boards and lack of SATA or Parallel ATA interfaces br br br Enterprise and business segment br Server and workstation HDDs br br Typically used with multiple user computers running enterprise software Examples are transaction processing databases internet infrastructure email webserver e commerce scientific computing software and nearline storage management software Enterprise drives commonly operate continuously in demanding environments while delivering the highest possible performance without sacrificing reliability Maximum capacity is not the primary goal and as a result the drives are often offered in capacities that are relatively low in relation to their cost br The fastest enterprise HDDs spin at or rpm and can achieve sequential media transfer speeds above Gbit s and a sustained transfer rate up to Gbit s Drives running at or rpm use smaller platters to mitigate increased power requirements as they have less air drag and therefore generally have lower capacity than the highest capacity desktop drives Enterprise HDDs are commonly connected through Serial Attached SCSI SAS or Fibre Channel FC Some support multiple ports so they can be connected to a redundant host bus adapter br Enterprise HDDs can have sector sizes larger than bytes often or bytes The additional per sector space can be used by hardware RAID controllers or applications for storing Data Integrity Field DIF or Data Integrity Extensions DIX data resulting in higher reliability and prevention of silent data corruption br Surveillance hard drives br Video recording HDDs used in network video recorders br br br Economy br br br Price evolution br HDD price per byte decreased at the rate of per year during per year during and per year during The price decrease slowed down to per year during as areal density increase slowed and the Thailand floods damaged manufacturing facilities and have held at per year during br The Federal Reserve Board has published a quality adjusted price index for large scale enterprise storage systems including three or more enterprise HDDs and associated controllers racks and cables Prices for these large scale storage systems decreased at the rate of per year during and per year during br br br Manufacturers and sales br br More than companies have manufactured HDDs over time but consolidations have concentrated production to just three manufacturers today Western Digital Seagate and Toshiba Production is mainly in the Pacific rim br HDD unit shipments peaked at million units in and have been declining since then to million units in Seagate at of units had the largest market share br br br Competition from SSDs br HDDs are being superseded by solid state drives SSDs in markets where the higher speed up to gigabytes per second for M NGFF NVMe drives and gigabytes per second for PCIe expansion card drives ruggedness and lower power of SSDs are more important than price since the bit cost of SSDs is four to nine times higher than HDDs As of HDDs are reported to have a failure rate of per year while SSDs have fewer failures per year However SSDs have more un correctable data errors than HDDs br SSDs offer larger capacities up to TB than the largest HDD and or higher storage densities TB and TB SSDs are housed in inch HDD cases but with the same height as a inch HDD although their cost remains prohibitive br A laboratory demonstration of a Tb D NAND chip with layers NAND commonly used in solid state drives SSDs had Tbit in as of while the maximum areal density for HDDs is Tbit in The areal density of flash memory is doubling every two years similar to Moore s law per year and faster than the per year for HDDs As of the maximum capacity was terabytes for an HDD and terabytes for an SSD HDDs were used in of the desktop and notebook computers produced in and SSDs were used in The usage share of HDDs is declining and could drop below in according to one forecast because SSDs are replacing smaller capacity less than one terabyte HDDs in desktop and notebook computers and MP players br The market for silicon based flash memory NAND chips used in SSDs and other applications is growing faster than for HDDs Worldwide NAND revenue grew per year from billion to billion during while production grew
