Protein design is the rational design of new protein molecules to design novel activity behavior or purpose and to advance basic understanding of protein function Proteins can be designed from scratch de novo design or by making calculated variants of a known protein structure and its sequence termed protein redesign Rational protein design approaches make protein sequence predictions that will fold to specific structures These predicted sequences can then be validated experimentally through methods such as peptide synthesis site directed mutagenesis or artificial gene synthesis br Rational protein design dates back to the mid s Recently however there were numerous examples of successful rational design of water soluble and even transmembrane peptides and proteins in part due to a better understanding of different factors contributing to protein structure stability and development of better computational methods br br br Overview and history br The goal in rational protein design is to predict amino acid sequences that will fold to a specific protein structure Although the number of possible protein sequences is vast growing exponentially with the size of the protein chain only a subset of them will fold reliably and quickly to one native state Protein design involves identifying novel sequences within this subset The native state of a protein is the conformational free energy minimum for the chain Thus protein design is the search for sequences that have the chosen structure as a free energy minimum In a sense it is the reverse of protein structure prediction In design a tertiary structure is specified and a sequence that will fold to it is identified Hence it is also termed inverse folding Protein design is then an optimization problem using some scoring criteria an optimized sequence that will fold to the desired structure is chosen br When the first proteins were rationally designed during the s and s the sequence for these was optimized manually based on analyses of other known proteins the sequence composition amino acid charges and the geometry of the desired structure The first designed proteins are attributed to Bernd Gutte who designed a reduced version of a known catalyst bovine ribonuclease and tertiary structures consisting of beta sheets and alpha helices including a binder of DDT Urry and colleagues later designed elastin like fibrous peptides based on rules on sequence composition Richardson and coworkers designed a residue protein with no sequence homology to a known protein In the s the advent of powerful computers libraries of amino acid conformations and force fields developed mainly for molecular dynamics simulations enabled the development of structure based computational protein design tools Following the development of these computational tools great success has been achieved over the last years in protein design The first protein successfully designed completely de novo was done by Stephen Mayo and coworkers in and shortly after in Peter S Kim and coworkers designed dimers trimers and tetramers of unnatural right handed coiled coils In David Baker s laboratory designed a full protein to a fold never seen before in nature Later in Baker s group computationally designed enzymes for two different reactions In one of the most powerful broadly neutralizing antibodies was isolated from patient serum using a computationally designed protein probe Due to these and other successes e g see examples below protein design has become one of the most important tools available for protein engineering There is great hope that the design of new proteins small and large will have uses in biomedicine and bioengineering br br br Underlying models of protein structure and function br Protein design programs use computer models of the molecular forces that drive proteins in in vivo environments In order to make the problem tractable these forces are simplified by protein design models Although protein design programs vary greatly they have to address four main modeling questions What is the target structure of the design what flexibility is allowed on the target structure which sequences are included in the search and which force field will be used to score sequences and structures br br br Target structure br br Protein function is heavily dependent on protein structure and rational protein design uses this relationship to design function by designing proteins that have a target structure or fold Thus by definition in rational protein design the target structure or ensemble of structures must be known beforehand This contrasts with other forms of protein engineering such as directed evolution where a variety of methods are used to find proteins that achieve a specific function and with protein structure prediction where the sequence is known but the structure is unknown br Most often the target structure is based on a known structure of another protein However novel folds not seen in nature have been made increasingly possible Peter S Kim and coworkers designed trimers and tetramers of unnatural coiled coils which had not been seen before in nature The protein Top developed in David Baker s lab was designed completely using protein design algorithms to a completely novel fold More recently Baker and coworkers developed a series of principles to design ideal globular protein structures based on protein folding funnels that bridge between secondary structure prediction and tertiary structures These principles which build on both protein structure prediction and protein design were used to design five different novel protein topologies br br br Sequence space br br In rational protein design proteins can be redesigned from the sequence and structure of a known protein or completely from scratch in de novo protein design In protein redesign most of the residues in the sequence are maintained as their wild type amino acid while a few are allowed to mutate In de novo design the entire sequence is designed anew based on no prior sequence br Both de novo designs and protein redesigns can establish rules on the sequence space the specific amino acids that are allowed at each mutable residue position For example the composition of the surface of the RSC probe to select HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies was restricted based on evolutionary data and charge balancing Many of the earliest attempts on protein design were heavily based on empiric rules on the sequence space Moreover the design of fibrous proteins usually follows strict rules on the sequence space Collagen based designed proteins for example are often composed of Gly Pro X repeating patterns The advent of computational techniques allows designing proteins with no human intervention in sequence selection br br br Structural flexibility br br In protein design the target structure or structures of the protein are known However a rational protein design approach must model some flexibility on the target structure in order to increase the number of sequences that can be designed for that structure and to minimize the chance of a sequence folding to a different structure For example in a protein redesign of one small amino acid such as alanine in the tightly packed core of a protein very few mutants would be predicted by a rational design approach to fold to the target structure if the surrounding side chains are not allowed to be repacked br Thus an essential parameter of any design process is the amount of flexibility allowed for both the side chains and the backbone In the simplest models the protein backbone is kept rigid while some of the protein side chains are allowed to change conformations However side chains can have many degrees of freedom in their bond lengths bond angles and dihedral angles To simplify this space protein design methods use rotamer libraries that assume ideal values for bond lengths and bond angles while restricting dihedral angles to a few frequently observed low energy conformations termed rotamers br Rotamer libraries are derived from the statistical analysis of many protein structures Backbone independent rotamer libraries describe all rotamers Backbone dependent rotamer libraries in contrast describe the rotamers as how likely they are to appear depending on the protein backbone arrangement around the side chain Most protein design programs use one conformation e g the modal value for rotamer dihedrals in space or several points in the region described by the rotamer the OSPREY protein design program in contrast models the entire continuous region br Although rational protein design must preserve the general backbone fold a protein allowing some backbone flexibility can significantly increase the number of sequences that fold to the structure while maintaining the general fold of the protein Backbone flexibility is especially important in protein redesign because sequence mutations often result in small changes to the backbone structure Moreover backbone flexibility can be essential for more advanced applications of protein design such as binding prediction and enzyme design Some models of protein design backbone flexibility include small and continuous global backbone movements discrete backbone samples around the target fold backrub motions and protein loop flexibility br br br Energy function br br Rational protein design techniques must be able to discriminate sequences that will be stable under the target fold from those that would prefer other low energy competing states Thus protein design requires accurate energy functions that can rank and score sequences by how well they fold to the target structure At the same time however these energy functions must consider the computational challenges behind protein design One of the most challenging requirements for successful design is an energy function that is both accurate and simple for computational calculations br The most accurate energy functions are those based on quantum mechanical simulations However such simulations are too slow and typically impractical for protein design Instead many protein design algorithms use either physics based energy functions adapted from molecular mechanics simulation programs knowledge based energy functions or a hybrid mix of both The trend has been toward using more physics based potential energy functions br Physics based energy functions such as AMBER and CHARMM are typically derived from quantum mechanical simulations and experimental data from thermodynamics crystallography and spectroscopy These energy functions typically simplify physical energy function and make them pairwise decomposable meaning that the total energy of a protein conformation can be calculated by adding the pairwise energy between each atom pair which makes them attractive for optimization algorithms Physics based energy functions typically model an attractive repulsive Lennard Jones term between atoms and a pairwise electrostatics coulombic term between non bonded atoms br br Statistical potentials in contrast to physics based potentials have the advantage of being fast to compute of accounting implicitly of complex effects and being less sensitive to small changes in the protein structure These energy functions are based on deriving energy values from frequency of appearance on a structural database br Protein design however has requirements that can sometimes be limited in molecular mechanics force fields Molecular mechanics force fields which have been br used mostly in molecular dynamics simulations are optimized for the simulation of single sequences but protein design searches through many conformations of many sequences Thus molecular mechanics force fields must be tailored for protein design In practice protein design energy functions often incorporate both statistical terms and physics based terms For example the Rosetta energy function one of the most used energy functions incorporates physics based energy terms originating in the CHARMM energy function and statistical energy terms such as rotamer probability and knowledge based electrostatics Typically energy functions are highly customized between laboratories and specifically tailored for every design br br br Challenges for effective design energy functions br Water makes up most of the molecules surrounding proteins and is the main driver of protein structure Thus modeling the interaction between water and protein is vital in protein design The number of water molecules that interact with a protein at any given time is huge and each one has a large number of degrees of freedom and interaction partners Instead protein design programs model most of such water molecules as a continuum modeling both the hydrophobic effect and solvation polarization br Individual water molecules can sometimes have a crucial structural role in the core of proteins and in protein protein or protein ligand interactions Failing to model such waters can result in mispredictions of the optimal sequence of a protein protein interface As an alternative water molecules can be added to rotamers br br br As an optimization problem br br The goal of protein design is to find a protein sequence that will fold to a target structure A protein design algorithm must thus search all the conformations of each sequence with respect to the target fold and rank sequences according to the lowest energy conformation of each one as determined by the protein design energy function Thus a typical input to the protein design algorithm is the target fold the sequence space the structural flexibility and the energy function while the output is one or more sequences that are predicted to fold stably to the target structure br The number of candidate protein sequences however grows exponentially with the number of protein residues for example there are protein sequences of length Furthermore even if amino acid side chain conformations are limited to a few rotamers see Structural flexibility this results in an exponential number of conformations for each sequence Thus in our residue protein and assuming that each amino acid has exactly rotamers a search algorithm that searches this space will have to search over protein conformations br The most common energy functions can be decomposed into pairwise terms between rotamers and amino acid types which casts the problem as a combinatorial one and powerful optimization algorithms can be used to solve it In those cases the total energy of each conformation belonging to each sequence can be formulated as a sum of individual and pairwise terms between residue positions If a designer is interested only in the best sequence the protein design algorithm only requires the lowest energy conformation of the lowest energy sequence In these cases the amino acid identity of each rotamer can be ignored and all rotamers belonging to different amino acids can be treated the same Let ri be a rotamer at residue position i in the protein chain and E ri the potential energy between the internal atoms of the rotamer Let E ri rj be the potential energy between ri and rotamer rj at residue position j Then we define the optimization problem as one of finding the conformation of minimum energy ET br br The problem of minimizing ET is an NP hard problem Even though the class of problems is NP hard in practice many instances of protein design can be solved exactly or optimized satisfactorily through heuristic methods br br br Algorithms br Several algorithms have been developed specifically for the protein design problem These algorithms can be divided into two broad classes exact algorithms such as dead end elimination that lack runtime guarantees but guarantee the quality of the solution and heuristic algorithms such as Monte Carlo that are faster than exact algorithms but have no guarantees on the optimality of the results Exact algorithms guarantee that the optimization process produced the optimal according to the protein design model Thus if the predictions of exact algorithms fail when these are experimentally validated then the source of error can be attributed to the energy function the allowed flexibility the sequence space or the target structure e g if it cannot be designed for br Some protein design algorithms are listed below Although these algorithms address only the most basic formulation of the protein design problem Equation when the optimization goal changes because designers introduce improvements and extensions to the protein design model such as improvements to the structural flexibility allowed e g protein backbone flexibility or including sophisticated energy terms many of the extensions on protein design that improve modeling are built atop these algorithms For example Rosetta Design incorporates sophisticated energy terms and backbone flexibility using Monte Carlo as the underlying optimizing algorithm OSPREY s algorithms build on the dead end elimination algorithm and A to incorporate continuous backbone and side chain movements Thus these algorithms provide a good perspective on the different kinds of algorithms available for protein design br In scientists reported the development of an AI based process using genome databases for evolution based designing of novel proteins They used deep learning to identify design rules In a study reported deep learning software that can design proteins that contain prespecified functional sites br br br With mathematical guarantees br br br Dead end elimination br br The dead end elimination DEE algorithm reduces the search space of the problem iteratively by removing rotamers that can be provably shown to be not part of the global lowest energy conformation GMEC On each iteration the dead end elimination algorithm compares all possible pairs of rotamers at each residue position and removes each rotamer r i that can be shown to always be of higher energy than another rotamer ri and is thus not part of the GMEC

dead end elimination criterion This algorithm has also been extended to handle continuous rotamers with provable guarantees br Although the Dead end elimination algorithm runs in polynomial time on each iteration it cannot guarantee convergence If after a certain number of iterations the dead end elimination algorithm does not prune any more rotamers then either rotamers have to be merged or another search algorithm must be used to search the remaining search space In such cases the dead end elimination acts as a pre filtering algorithm to reduce the search space while other algorithms such as A Monte Carlo Linear Programming or FASTER are used to search the remaining search space br br br Branch and bound br br The protein design conformational space can be represented as a tree where the protein residues are ordered in an arbitrary way and the tree branches at each of the rotamers in a residue Branch and bound algorithms use this representation to efficiently explore the conformation tree At each branching branch and bound algorithms bound the conformation space and explore only the promising branches br A popular search algorithm for protein design is the A search algorithm A computes a lower bound score on each partial tree path that lower bounds with guarantees the energy of each of the expanded rotamers Each partial conformation is added to a priority queue and at each iteration the partial path with the lowest lower bound is popped from the queue and expanded The algorithm stops once a full conformation has been enumerated and guarantees that the conformation is the optimal br The A score f in protein design consists of two parts f g h g is the exact energy of the rotamers that have already been assigned in the partial conformation h is a lower bound on the energy of the rotamers that have not yet been assigned Each is designed as follows where d is the index of the last assigned residue in the partial conformation br br br br br g br

programming relaxation of the problem where qi and qij are allowed to take continuous values in combination with a branch and cut algorithm to search only a small portion of the conformation space for the optimal solution ILP solvers have been shown to solve many instances of the side chain placement problem br br br Message passing based approximations to the linear programming dual br ILP solvers depend on linear programming LP algorithms such as the Simplex or barrier based methods to perform the LP relaxation at each branch These LP algorithms were developed as general purpose optimization methods and are not optimized for the protein design problem Equation In consequence the LP relaxation becomes the bottleneck of ILP solvers when the problem size is large Recently several alternatives based on message passing algorithms have been designed specifically for the optimization of the LP relaxation of the protein design problem These algorithms can approximate both the dual or the primal instances of the integer programming but in order to maintain guarantees on optimality they are most useful when used to approximate the dual of the protein design problem because approximating the dual guarantees that no solutions are missed Message passing based approximations include the tree reweighted max product message passing algorithm and the message passing linear programming algorithm br br br Optimization algorithms without guarantees br br br Monte Carlo and simulated annealing br Monte Carlo is one of the most widely used algorithms for protein design In

overcome local minima br br br FASTER br The FASTER algorithm uses a combination of deterministic and stochastic criteria to optimize amino acid sequences FASTER first uses DEE to eliminate rotamers that are not part of the optimal solution Then a series of iterative steps optimize the rotamer assignment br br br Belief propagation br In belief propagation for protein design the algorithm exchanges messages that describe the belief that each residue has about the probability of each rotamer in neighboring residues The algorithm updates messages on every iteration and iterates until convergence or until a fixed number of iterations Convergence is not guaranteed in protein design The message mi j rj that a residue i sends to every rotamer rj at neighboring residue j is defined as

have been used to optimize protein design br br br Applications and examples of designed proteins br br br Enzyme design br The design of new enzymes is a use of protein design with huge bioengineering and biomedical applications In general designing a protein structure can be different from designing an enzyme because the design of enzymes must consider many states involved in the catalytic mechanism However protein design is a prerequisite of de novo enzyme design because at the very least the design of catalysts requires a scaffold in which the catalytic mechanism can be inserted br Great progress in de novo enzyme design and redesign was made in the first decade of the st century In three major studies David Baker and coworkers de novo designed enzymes for the retro aldol reaction a Kemp elimination reaction and for the Diels Alder reaction Furthermore Stephen Mayo and coworkers developed an iterative method to design the most efficient known enzyme for the Kemp elimination reaction Also in the laboratory of Bruce Donald computational protein design was used to switch the specificity of one of the protein domains of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase that produces Gramicidin S from its natural substrate phenylalanine to other noncognate substrates including charged amino acids the redesigned enzymes had activities close to those of the wild type br br br Semi rational design br Semi rational design is a purposeful modification method based on a certain understanding of the sequence structure and catalytic mechanism of enzymes This method is between irrational design and rational design It uses known information and means to perform evolutionary modification on the specific functions of the target enzyme The characteristic of semi rational design is that it does not rely solely on random mutation and screening but combines the concept of directed evolution It creates a library of random mutants with diverse sequences through mutagenesis error prone RCR DNA recombination and site saturation mutagenesis At the same time it uses the understanding of enzymes and design principles to purposefully screen out mutants with desired characteristics br The methodology of semi rational design emphasizes the in depth understanding of enzymes and the control of the evolutionary process It allows researchers to use known information to guide the evolutionary process thereby improving efficiency and success rate This method plays an important role in protein function modification because it can combine the advantages of irrational design and rational design and can explore unknown space and use known knowledge for targeted modification br Semi rational design has a wide range of applications including but not limited to enzyme optimization modification of drug targets evolution of biocatalysts etc Through this method researchers can more effectively improve the functional properties of proteins to meet specific biotechnology or medical needs Although this method has high requirements for information and technology and is relatively difficult to implement with the development of computing technology and bioinformatics the application prospects of semi rational design in protein engineering are becoming more and more broad br br br Design for affinity br Protein protein interactions are involved in most biotic processes Many of the hardest to treat diseases such as Alzheimer s many forms of cancer e g TP and human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection involve protein protein interactions Thus to treat such diseases it is desirable to design protein or protein like therapeutics that bind one of the partners of the interaction and thus disrupt the disease causing interaction This requires designing protein therapeutics for affinity toward its partner br Protein protein interactions can be designed using protein design algorithms because the principles that rule protein stability also rule protein protein binding Protein protein interaction design however presents challenges not commonly present in protein design One of the most important challenges is that in general the interfaces between proteins are more polar than protein cores and binding involves a tradeoff between desolvation and hydrogen bond formation To overcome this challenge Bruce Tidor and coworkers developed a method to improve the affinity of antibodies by focusing on electrostatic contributions They found that for the antibodies designed in the study reducing the desolvation costs of the residues in the interface increased the affinity of the binding pair br br br Scoring binding predictions br Protein design energy functions must be adapted to score binding predictions because binding involves a trade off between the lowest energy conformations of the free proteins EP and EL and the lowest energy conformation of the bound complex EPL br br br br br br br br G br br br br br

limits x in PL e E x RT sum limits x in P e E x RT sum limits x in L e E x RT br br br br Design for specificity br The design of protein protein interactions must be highly specific because proteins can interact with a large number of proteins successful design requires selective binders Thus protein design algorithms must be able to distinguish between on target or positive design and off target binding or negative design One of the most prominent examples of design for specificity is the design of specific bZIP binding peptides by Amy Keating and coworkers for out of the bZIP families of these peptides were specific for their intended partner over competing peptides Further positive and negative design was also used by Anderson and coworkers to predict mutations in the active site of a drug target that conferred resistance to a new drug positive design was used to maintain wild type activity while negative design was used to disrupt binding of the drug Recent computational redesign by Costas Maranas and coworkers was also capable of experimentally switching the cofactor specificity of Candida boidinii xylose reductase from NADPH to NADH br br br Protein resurfacing br Protein resurfacing consists of designing a protein s surface while preserving the overall fold core and boundary regions of the protein intact Protein resurfacing is especially useful to alter the binding of a protein to other proteins One of the most important applications of protein resurfacing was the design of the RSC probe to select broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies at the NIH Vaccine Research Center First residues outside of the binding interface between the gp HIV envelope protein and the formerly discovered b antibody were selected to be designed Then the sequence spaced was selected based on evolutionary information solubility similarity with the wild type and other considerations Then the RosettaDesign software was used to find optimal sequences in the selected sequence space RSC was later used to discover the broadly neutralizing antibody VRC in the serum of a long term HIV infected non progressor individual br br br Design of globular proteins br Globular proteins are proteins that contain a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic surface Globular proteins often assume a stable structure unlike fibrous proteins which have multiple conformations The three dimensional structure of globular proteins is typically easier to determine through X ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance than both fibrous proteins and membrane proteins which makes globular proteins more attractive for protein design than the other types of proteins Most successful protein designs have involved globular proteins Both RSD and Top were de novo designs of globular proteins Five more protein structures were designed synthesized and verified in by the Baker group These new proteins serve no biotic function but the structures are intended to act as building blocks that can be expanded to incorporate functional active sites The structures were found computationally by using new heuristics based on analyzing the connecting loops between parts of the sequence that specify secondary structures br br br Design of membrane proteins br Several transmembrane proteins have been successfully designed along with many other membrane associated peptides and proteins Recently Costas Maranas and his coworkers developed an automated tool to redesign the pore size of Outer Membrane Porin Type F OmpF from E coli to any desired sub nm size and assembled them in membranes to perform precise angstrom scale separation br br br Other applications br One of the most desirable uses for protein design is for biosensors proteins that will sense the presence of specific compounds Some attempts in the design of biosensors include sensors for unnatural molecules including TNT More recently Kuhlman and coworkers designed a biosensor of the PAK br In a sense protein design is a
