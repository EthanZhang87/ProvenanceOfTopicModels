Information design is the practice of presenting information in a way that fosters an efficient and effective understanding of the information The term has come to be used for a specific area of graphic design related to displaying information effectively rather than just attractively or for artistic expression Information design is closely related to the field of data visualization and is often taught as part of graphic design courses The broad applications of information design along with its close connections to other fields of design and communication practices have created some overlap in the definitions of communication design data visualization and information architecture br According to Per Mollerup information design is explanation design It explains facts of the universe and leads to knowledge and informed action br br br History br The term information design emerged as a multidisciplinary area of study in the s Use of the term is said to have started with graphic designers and it was solidified with the publication of the Information Design Journal in Later the related International Institute for Information Design IIID was set up in and Information Design Association IDA established in br In Edward Tufte produced a book on information design called The Visual Display of Quantitative Information br The term information graphics tends to be used by those primarily concerned with diagramming and display of quantitative information such as technical communicators and graphic designers br br In technical communication information design refers to creating an information structure for a set of information aimed at specified audiences It can be practised on different scales br br On a large scale it implies choosing relevant content and dividing it into separate manuals by audience and purpose br On a medium scale it means organizing the content in each manual and making sure that overviews concepts examples references and definitions are included and that topics follow an organizing principle br On a small or detailed scale it includes logical development of topics emphasis on what s important clear writing navigational clues and even page design choice of font and use of white space br There are many similarities between information design and information architecture The title of information designer is sometimes used by graphic designers who specialize in creating websites The skillset of the information designer as the title is applied more globally is closer to that of the information architect in the U S Similar skills for organization and structure are brought to bear in designing web sites and digital media with additional constraints and functions that earn a designer the title information architect br In computer science and information technology information design is sometimes a rough synonym for but is not necessarily the same discipline as information architecture the design of information systems databases or data structures This sense includes data modeling and process analysis br br br Early examples br br Information design is associated with the age of technology but it does have historical roots Early instances of modern information design include these effective examples br br William Playfair s line bar pie and area charts illustrating England s trade and br John Snow s spot maps which pinpointed the source of a deadly cholera outbreak in s London br Charles Joseph Minard s diagram depicting Napoleon s Russian campaign of br W E B Du Bois s data visualization on the lives of Black Americans for the World s Fair br Otto Neurath s International Picture Language of the s br Florence Nightingale s information graphic depicting army mortality rates br The Minard diagram shows the losses suffered by Napoleon s army in the period Six variables are plotted the size of the army its location on a two dimensional surface x and y time direction of movement and temperature This multivariate display on a two dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility Edward Tufte wrote in that It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn br br br Applications br br Information design can be used for broad audiences such as signs in airports or specific audiences such as personalized telephone bills The resulting work often seeks to improve a user s trust of a product such as medicine packaging inserts operational instructions for industrial machinery and information for emergencies The example of signs also highlights a niche category known as wayfinding br Governments and regulatory authorities have legislated about a number of information design issues such as the minimum size of type in financial small print the labelling of ingredients in processed food and the testing of medicine labelling Examples of this are the Truth in Lending Act in the USA which introduced the Schumer box a concise summary of charges for people applying for a credit card and the Guideline on the Readability of the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products for Human Use European Commission Revision January br Professor Edward Tufte explained that users of information displays are executing particular analytical tasks such as making comparisons or determining causality The design principle of the information graphic should support the analytical task showing the comparison or causality br br br Simplicity br Simplicity is a major concern in information design The aim is clarity and understanding Simplification of messages may imply quantitative reduction but is not restricted to that Sometimes more information means more clarity Also simplicity is a highly subjective matter and should always be evaluated with the information user in mind Simplicity can be easy when following five simple steps when it comes to information design br br Tell the truth br Get to the point br Pick the right tool for the job br Highlight what is important br Of course keep it simple br These steps will help an information designer narrow down results as well as keeping their audience engaged br br br See also br br br br br br External links br InformationDesign org br International Institute for Information Design br Communication Research
