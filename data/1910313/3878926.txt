User generated content UGC alternatively known as user created content UCC is generally any form of content such as images videos audio text testimonials and software e g video game mods that has been posted by users on online content aggregation platforms such as social media discussion forums and wikis It is a product consumers create to disseminate information about online products or the firms that market them br User generated content is used for a wide range of applications including problem processing news entertainment customer engagement advertising gossip research and many more It is an example of the democratization of content production and the flattening of traditional media hierarchies The BBC adopted a user generated content platform for its websites in and TIME Magazine named You as the Person of the Year in referring to the rise in the production of UGC on Web platforms CNN also developed a similar user generated content platform known as iReport There are other examples of news channels implementing similar protocols especially in the immediate aftermath of a catastrophe or terrorist attack Social media users can provide key eyewitness content and information that may otherwise have been inaccessible By businesses are increasingly leveraging User Generated Content to promote their products as it is seen as a cost effective and authentic way to grow a brand s image and sales Due to new media and technology affordances such as low cost and low barriers to entry the Internet is an easy platform to create and dispense user generated content allowing the dissemination of information at a rapid pace in the wake of an event br br br Definition br The advent of user generated content marked a shift among media organizations from creating online content to providing facilities for amateurs to publish their own content User generated content has also been characterized as citizen media as opposed to the packaged goods media of the past century Citizen Media is audience generated feedback and news coverage People give their reviews and share stories in the form of user generated and user uploaded audio and user generated video The former is a two way process in contrast to the one way distribution of the latter Conversational or two way media is a key characteristic of so called Web which encourages the publishing of one s own content and commenting on other people s content br The role of the passive audience therefore has shifted since the birth of new media and an ever growing number of participatory users are taking advantage of these interactive opportunities especially on the Internet to create independent content Grassroots experimentation then generated an innovation in sounds artists techniques and associations with audiences which then are being used in mainstream media The active participatory and creative audience is prevailing today with relatively accessible media tools and applications and its culture is in turn affecting mass media corporations and global audiences br The Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD has defined three central schools for UGC br br Publication requirement While user generated content UGC could be produced by a user that contributes to the Internet and never published online or elsewhere we focus here on the work that is published in some context be it on a publicly accessible website or on a page on a social networking site only accessible to a select group of people e g fellow university students This is a valuable way to exclude email two way instant messages and the like button br Creative effort Creative effort was put into creating the work or adapting existing works to construct a new one i e users must add their own value to the work UGC often also has a collaborative element to it as is the case with websites that users can edit collaboratively For example merely copying a portion of a television show and posting it to an online video website an activity frequently seen on the UGC sites would not be considered UGC However uploading photographs expressing one s thoughts in a blog post or creating a new music video could be considered UGC Yet the minimum amount of creative effort is hard to define and depends on the context br Creation outside of professional routines and practices User generated content is generally created outside of professional routines and practices It often does not have an institutional or a commercial market context In extreme cases UGC may be produced by non professionals without the expectation of profit or remuneration Motivating factors include connecting with peers achieving a certain level of fame notoriety or prestige and the desire to express oneself br br br Media pluralism br br According to Cisco in an average of petabytes was transferred monthly over the Internet more than twice as many as in In the number of active websites surpassed billion up from approximately million in This means the content we like others currently have access to is even more diverse incorporated and unique than ever before br Reaching billion daily active users in Q Facebook has emerged as the most popular social media platform globally Other social media platforms are also dominant at the regional level such as Twitter in Japan Naver in the Republic of Korea Instagram owned by Facebook and LinkedIn owned by Microsoft in Africa VKontakte VK and Odnoklassniki eng Classmates in Russia and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe WeChat and QQ in China br However a concentration phenomenon is occurring globally giving the dominance to a few online platforms that become popular for some unique features they provide most commonly for the added privacy they offer users through disappearing messages or end to end encryption e g WhatsApp Snapchat Signal and Telegram but they have tended to occupy niches and to facilitate the exchanges of information that remain rather invisible to larger audiences br Production of freely accessible information has been increasing since In January Wikipedia had more than million articles almost twice as many as in January This corresponded to a progressive diversification of content and increase in contributions in languages other than English In less than percent of Wikipedia content was in English down from percent in Graham Straumann and Hogan say that increase in the availability and diversity of content has not radically changed the structures and processes for the production of knowledge For example while content on Africa has dramatically increased a significant portion of this content has continued to be produced by contributors operating from North America and Europe rather than from Africa itself br br br History br The massive multi volume Oxford English Dictionary was exclusively composed of user generated content In Richard Chenevix Trench of the London Philological Society sought public contributions throughout the English speaking world for the creation of the first edition of the OED As Simon Winchester recounts br br So what we re going to do if I have your agreement that we re going to produce such a dictionary is that we re going to send out invitations were going to send these invitations to every library every school every university every book shop that we can identify throughout the English speaking world everywhere where English is spoken or read with any degree of enthusiasm people will be invited to contribute words And the point is the way they do it the way they will be asked and instructed to do it is to read voraciously and whenever they see a word whether it s a preposition or a sesquipedalian monster they are to if it interests them and if where they read it they see it in a sentence that illustrates the way that that word is used offers the meaning of the day to that word then they are to write it on a slip of paper the top left hand side you write the word the chosen word the catchword which in this case is twilight Then the quotation the quotation illustrates the meaning of the word And underneath it the citation where it came from whether it was printed or whether it was in manuscript and then the reference the volume the page and so on and send these slips of paper these slips are the key to the making of this dictionary into the headquarters of the dictionary br In the following decades hundreds of thousands of contributions were sent to the editors br In the s several electronic bulletin board systems were based on user generated content Some of these systems have been converted into websites including the film information site IMDb which started as rec arts movies in With the growth of the World Wide Web the focus moved to websites several of which were based on user generated content including Wikipedia and Flickr br User generated Internet video was popularized by YouTube an online video platform founded by Chad Hurley Jawed Karim and Steve Chen in April It enabled the video streaming of MPEG AVC H user generated content from anywhere on the World Wide Web br The BBC set up a pilot user generated content team in April with staff In the wake of the July London bombings and the Buncefield oil depot fire the team was made permanent and was expanded reflecting the arrival in the mainstream of the citizen journalist After the Buncefield disaster the BBC received over photos from viewers The BBC does not normally pay for content generated by its viewers br In CNN launched CNN iReport a project designed to bring user generated news content to CNN Its rival Fox News Channel launched its project to bring in user generated news similarly titled uReport This was typical of major television news organizations in who realized particularly in the wake of the London July bombings that citizen journalism could now become a significant part of broadcast news Sky News for example regularly solicits for photographs and video from its viewers br User generated content was featured in Time magazine s Person of the Year in which the person of the year was you meaning all of the people who contribute to user generated media including YouTube Wikipedia and Myspace A precursor to user generated content uploaded on YouTube was America s Funniest Home Videos br br br Motivation for creating UGC br The benefits derived from user generated content for the content host are clear these include a low cost promotion positive impact on product sales and fresh content However the benefit to the contributor is less direct There are various theories behind the motivation for contributing user generated content ranging from altruistic to social to materialistic Due to the high value of user generated content many sites use incentives to encourage their generation These incentives can be generally categorized into implicit incentives and explicit incentives Sometimes users are also given monetary incentives to encourage them to create captivating and inspiring UGC br br Implicit incentives These incentives are not based on anything tangible Social incentives are the most common form of implicit incentives These incentives allow the user to feel good as an active member of the community These can include the relationship between users such as Facebook s friends or Twitter s followers Social incentives also include the ability to connect users with others as seen on the sites already mentioned as well as sites like YouTube Instagram and Twitter which allow users to share media from their lives with others Users also share the experiences that they have while using a particular product service This will improve the customer experience as they can make informed decisions in buying a product which makes them smart buyers Other common social incentives are status badges or levels within the site something a user earns when they reach a certain level of participation which may or may not come with additional privileges Yahoo Answers is an example of this type of social incentive Another social incentive is social comparison Being aware of the user s own ranking or level among the whole community could affect the behavior as well Social incentives cost the host site very little and can catalyze vital growth however their very nature requires a sizable existing community before it can function Social incentive can also be split into identification and integration The identification motivation has strong external standardization and internalization of behavioral goals such as social identity that is users will follow some subjective norms and images to constrain and practice their behaviors The integration has the strongest external standardization and goal internalization and the agent often integrates its actual actions with the subjective norms of the environment so it has the effect of self restraint and self realization such as the sense of belonging Naver Knowledge iN is another example of this type of social incentive It uses a point system to encourage users to answer more questions by receiving points br Explicit incentives These incentives refer to tangible rewards Explicit incentives can be split into externality and projection External motivation is more inclined to economic and material incentives such as the reward for engaging in a task which has little internalization and lacks relevant external norms and constraints Examples include financial payment entry into a contest a voucher a coupon or frequent traveler miles Direct explicit incentives are easily understandable by most and have immediate value regardless of the community size sites such as the Canadian shopping platform Wishabi and Amazon Mechanical Turk both use this type of financial incentive in slightly different ways to encourage users participation The projective agent has some external norms but the degree of internalization is not enough that is it has not been fully recognized by the actor The drawback to explicit incentives is that they may cause the user to be subject to the overjustification effect eventually believing the only reason for participating is for the explicit incentive This reduces the influence of the other form of social or altruistic motivation making it increasingly costly for the content host to retain long term contributors br br br Ranking and assessment br The distribution of UGC across the Web provides a high volume data source that is accessible for analysis and offers utility in enhancing the experiences of end users Social science research can benefit from having access to the opinions of a population of users and use this data to make inferences about their traits Applications in information technology seek to mine end user data to support and improve machine based processes such as information retrieval and recommendation However processing the high volumes of data offered by UGC necessitate the ability to automatically sort and filter these data points according to their value br Determining the value of user contributions for assessment and ranking can be difficult due to the variation in the quality and structure of this data The quality and structure of the data provided by UGC is application dependent and can include items such as tags reviews or comments that may or may not be accompanied by useful metadata Additionally the value of this data depends on the specific task for which it will be utilized and the available features of the application domain Value can ultimately be defined and assessed according to whether the application will provide service to a crowd of humans a single end user or a platform designer br The variation of data and specificity of value has resulted in various approaches and methods for assessing and ranking UGC The performance of each method essentially depends on the features and metrics that are available for analysis Consequently it is critical to have an understanding of the task objective and its relation to how the data is collected structured and represented in order to choose the most appropriate approach to utilizing it The methods of assessment and ranking can be categorized into two classes human centered and machine centered Methods emphasizing human centered utility consider the ranking and assessment problem in terms of the users and their interactions with the system whereas the machine centered method considers the problem in terms of machine learning and computation The various methods of assessment and ranking can be classified into one of four approaches community based user based designer based and hybrid br br Community based approaches rely on establishing ground truth based on the wisdom of the crowd regarding the content of interest The assessments provided by the community of end users is utilized to directly rank content within the system in human centered methods The machine centered method applies these community judgments in training algorithms to automatically assess and rank UGC br User based approaches emphasize the differences between individual users so that ranking and assessment can interactively adapt or be personalized given the particular requirements of each user The human centered approach accentuates interactive interfaces where the user can define and redefine their preferences as their interests shift On the other hand machine centered approaches model the individual user according to explicit and implicit knowledge that is gathered through system interactions br Designer based approaches primarily use machine centered methods to essentially maximize the diversity of content presented to users in order to avoid constraining the space of topic selections or perspectives The diversity of content can be assessed with respect to various dimensions such as authorship topics sentiments and named entities br Hybrid approaches seek to combine methods from the various frameworks in order to develop a more robust approach for assessing and ranking UGC Approaches are most often combined in one of two ways the crowd based approach is often used to identify hyperlocal content for a user based approach or a user based approach is used to maintain the intent of a designer based approach br Key concepts br br Contribution is by users of a product rather than the firm br Creative in nature and adds something new br Posted online and generally accessible br br br Types br There are many types of user generated content Internet forums where people talk about different topics blogs are services where users can post about many topics product reviews on a supplier website or in social media wikis such as Wikipedia and Fandom allow users sometimes including anonymous users to edit the content Another type of user generated content are social networking sites like Facebook Instagram Tumblr Twitter Snapchat Twitch TikTok or VK where users interact with other people via chatting writing messages posting images or links and sharing content Media hosting sites such as YouTube and Vimeo allow users to post content Some forms of user generated content such as a social commentary blog can be considered as a form of citizen journalism br br br Blogs br br Blogs are websites created by individuals groups and associations They mostly consist of journal style text and enable interaction between a blogger and reader in the form of online comments Self hosted blogs can be created by professional entities such as entrepreneurs and small businesses Blog hosting platforms include WordPress Blogger and Medium Typepad is often used by media companies Weebly is geared for online shopping Social networking blogging platforms include Tumblr LiveJournal and Weibo Among the many blogs on the web Boing Boing is a group blog with themes including technology and science fiction HuffPost blogs include opinions on subjects such as politics entertainment and technology There are also travel blogs such as Head for Points Adventurous Kate and an early form of The Points Guy br br br Websites br br Entertainment social media and information sharing websites include Reddit gag chan Upworthy and Newgrounds Sites like Gag allow users to create memes and quick video clips Sites like Tech in Asia and Buzzfeed engage readers with professional communities by posting articles with user generated comment sections Other websites include fanfiction sites such as FanFiction Net imageboards artwork communities like DeviantArt mobile photos and video sharing sites such as Picasa and Flickr audio social networks such as SoundCloud crowd funding or crowdsourcing sites like Kickstarter Indiegogo and ArtistShare and customer review sites such as Yelp br After launching in the mid s major UGC based adult websites like Pornhub YouPorn and xHamster and became the dominant mode of consumption and distribution of pornographic content on the internet The appearance of pornographic content on sites like Wikipedia and Tumblr led moderators and site owners to institute stricter limits on uploads br The travel industry in particular has begun utilizing user generated content to show authentic traveler experiences Travel related companies such as The Millennial Gen Z and Busabout relaunched their websites featuring UGC images and social content by their customers posted in real time TripAdvisor includes reviews and recommendations by travelers about hotels restaurants and activities br The restaurant industry has also been altered by a review system the places more emphasis on online reviews and content from peers than traditional media reviews In Yelp contained of reviews for restaurants in the Seattle area compared to Food Wine Magazine containing less than percent br br br Video games br Video games can have fan made content in the form of mods fan patches fan translations or server emulators Some games come with level editor programs to aid in their creation A few massively multiplayer online games including Star Trek Online Dota and EverQuest have UGC systems integrated into the game itself A metaverse can be a user generated world such as Second Life Second Life is a D virtual world which provides its users with tools to modify the game world and participate in an economy trading user content created via online creation for virtual currency br br br Advertising br A popular use of UGC involves collaboration between a brand and a user An example is the Elf Yourself videos by Jib Jab that come back every year around Christmas The Jib Jab website lets people use their photos of friends and family that they have uploaded to make a holiday video to share across the internet Then you cut and paste the faces of the people in the pictures to animated dancing elves to make this work br Some brands are also using UGC images to boost the performance of their paid social ads For example Toyota leveraged UGC for their Feeling the Streets Facebook ad campaign and were able to increase their total ad engagement by br br br Retailers br Some bargain hunting websites feature user generated content such as eBay Dealsplus and FatWallet which allow users to post discuss and control which bargains get promoted within the community Because of the dependency of social interaction these sites fall into the category of social commerce br br br Educational br Wikipedia a free encyclopedia is one of the largest user generated content databases in the world Platforms such as YouTube have frequently been used as an instructional aide Organizations such as the Khan Academy and the Green brothers have used the platform to upload series of videos on topics such as math science and history to help aid viewers master or better understand the basics Educational podcasts have also helped in teaching through an audio platform Personal websites and messaging systems like Yahoo Messenger have also been used to transmit user generated educational content There have also been web forums where users give advice to each other br Students can also manipulate digital images or video clips to their advantage and tag them with easy to find keywords then share them to friends and family worldwide The category of student performance content has risen in the form of discussion boards and chat logs Students could write reflective journals and diaries that may help others The websites SparkNotes and Shmoop are used to summarize and analyze books so that they are more accessible to the reader br br br Photo sharing br Photo sharing websites are another popular form of UGC Flickr is a site in which users are able to upload personal photos they have taken and label them in regards to their motivation Flickr not only hosts images but makes them publicly available for reuse and reuse with modification Instagram is a social media platform that allows users to edit upload and include location information with photos they post Panoramio com and Flickr use metadata such as GPS coordinates that allows for geographic placement of images br In Webshots was one of the first online photo sharing platforms Webshots offered an easy to use interface and basic photo editing tools In SmugMug was founded focusing on providing a high quality photo sharing experience for professional photographers SmugMug offers features such as custom photo galleries and e commerce options In Yahoo Photos was one of the most popular photo sharing platforms thanks to its integration with Yahoo s email and search services br br br Video sharing br Video sharing websites are another popular form of UGC YouTube and TikTok allow users to create and upload videos br br br Effect on journalism br The incorporation of user generated content into mainstream journalism outlets is considered to have begun in with the BBC s creation of a user generated content team which was expanded and made permanent in the wake of the July London bombings The incorporation of Web technologies into news websites allowed user generated content online to move from more social platforms such as MySpace LiveJournal and personal blogs into the mainstream of online journalism in the form of comments on news articles written by professional journalists but also through surveys content sharing and other forms of citizen journalism br Since the mid s journalists and publishers have had to consider the effects that user generated content has had on how news gets published read and shared A study on publisher business models suggests that readers of online news sources value articles written both by professional journalists as well as users provided that those users are experts in a field relevant to the content that they create In response to this it is suggested that online news sites must consider themselves not only a source for articles and other types of journalism but also a platform for engagement and feedback from their communities The ongoing engagement with a news site that is possible due to the interactive nature of user generated content is considered a source of sustainable revenue for publishers of online journalism going forward br Journalists are increasingly sourcing UGC from platforms such as Facebook and TikTok as news shifts to a digital space This form of crowdsourcing can include using user content to support claims using social media platforms to contact witnesses and obtain relevant images and videos for articles br br br Use in marketing br The use of user generated content has been prominent in the efforts of marketing online especially among millennials A good reason for this may be that of consumers say authenticity is important when deciding which brands they support and believe user generated content is not only the most authentic form of content but also the most influential when making purchasing decisions br An increasing number of companies have been employing UGC techniques into their marketing efforts such as Starbucks with their White Cup Contest campaign where customers competed to create the best doodle on their cups br The effectiveness of UGC in marketing has been shown to be significant as well For instance the Share a Coke by Coca Cola campaign in which customers uploaded images of themselves with bottles to social media attributed to a two percent increase in revenue Of millennials UGC can influence purchase decisions up to fifty nine percent of the time and eighty four percent say that UGC on company websites has at least some influence on what they buy typically in a positive way As a whole consumers place peer recommendations and reviews above those of professionals br User generated content used in a marketing context has been known to help brands in numerous ways br br It encourages more engagement with its users and doubles the likeliness that the content will be shared br It builds trust with consumers With a majority of consumers trusting UGC over brand provided information UGC can allow for better brand consumer relationships br It provides SEO Value for brands This in turn means more traffic is driven to the brands websites and that more content is linked back to the website br It reassures purchase decisions which will keep customers shopping With UGC the conversion rate increases by as much as br It increases follower count on various social media platforms br It helps integration with traditional marketing promotional techniques which in turn drives more conversions for the companies br It helps in increasing profit with significant reduction in costs for the company br It typically low cost promotion since content given by free for firm s customers br User generated content facts and statistics br br of companies leverage UGC in their marketing techniques br of potential customers seek reviews from existing customers br of customers look for reviews and ratings before they start their checkout process br of brands have seen an evident increase in their click through rates using UGC in their ads br Keeping your emails authentic and genuine can help increase the click through rate by br of Gen Z trusts UGC br increase is found in conversion rates simply because of UGC used in the product pages br br br Opportunities br There are many opportunities in user generated content The advantage of UGC is that it is a quick easy way to reach the masses Here are some examples br br The companies could use social media for branding and set up contests for the audience to submit their own creations br The consumers and general audience members like to engage Some have used a storytelling platform to both share and converse with others br To raise awareness whether it be for an organization company or event br Reviews play a major role in a customers decision making br Gain perspectives from members that one would not otherwise get to engage with br Personalization of the content put out of consumers like personalized ads br Encouraging participation can be weakened by company claims to owning this content br br br Criticism br The term user generated content has received some criticism The criticism to date has addressed issues of fairness quality privacy the sustainable availability of creative work and effort among legal issues namely related to intellectual property rights such as copyrights etc br Some commentators assert that the term user implies an illusory or unproductive distinction between different kinds of publishers with the term users exclusively used to characterize publishers who operate on a much smaller scale than traditional mass media outlets or who operate for free Such classification is said to perpetuate an unfair distinction that some argue is diminishing because of the prevalence and affordability of the means of production and publication A better response might be to offer optional expressions that better capture the spirit and nature of such work such as EGC Entrepreneurial Generated Content see external reference below br Sometimes creative works made by individuals are lost because there are limited or no ways to precisely preserve creations when a UGC Web site service closes down One example of such loss is the closing of the Disney massively multiplayer online game VMK VMK like most games has items that are traded from user to user Many of these items are rare within the game Users are able to use these items to create their own rooms avatars and pin lanyard This site shut down at pm CDT on May There are ways to preserve the essence if not the entirety of such work through the users copying text and media to applications on their personal computers or recording live action or animated scenes using screen capture software and then uploading elsewhere Long before the Web creative works were simply lost or went out of publication and disappeared from history unless individuals found ways to keep them in personal collections br Another criticized aspect is the vast array of user generated product and service reviews that can at times be misleading for consumer on the web br A study conducted at Cornell University found that an estimated to percent of positive user generated online hotel reviews are fake br Another concern of platforms that rely heavily on user generated content such as Twitter and Facebook is how easy it is to find people who holds the same opinions and interests in addition to how well they facilitate the creation of networks or closed groups While the strength of these services are that users can broaden their horizon by sharing their knowledge and connect with other people from around the world these platforms also make it very easy to connect with only a restricted sample of people who holds similar opinions see Filter bubble br There is also criticism regarding whether or not those who contribute to a platform should be paid for their content In a group of famous content creators on Vine attempted to negotiate a deal with Vine representatives to secure a million contract for a guaranteed videos a month This negotiation was not successful br br br Legal issues br The ability for services to accept user generated content opens up a number of legal concerns from the broader sense to specific local laws In general knowing who committed the online crime is difficult because many use pseudonyms or remain anonymous Sometimes it can be traced back But in the case of a public coffee shop they have no way of pinpointing the exact user There is also a problem with the issues surrounding extremely harmful but not legal acts For example the posting of content that instigates a person s suicide It is a criminal offense if there is proof of beyond reasonable doubt but different situations may produce different outcomes Depending on the country there is certain laws that come with the Web In the United States the Section exemptions of the Communications Decency Act state that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider This clause effectively provides a general immunity for websites that host user generated content that is defamatory deceptive or otherwise harmful even if the operator knows that the third party content is harmful and refuses to take it down An exception to this general rule may exist if a website promises to take down the content and then fails to do so br br br Copyright laws br Copyright laws also play a factor in relation to user generated content as users may use such services to upload works particularly videos that they do not have the sufficient rights to distribute In many cases the use of these materials may be covered by local fair use laws especially if the use of the material submitted is transformative Local laws also vary on who is liable for any resulting copyright infringements caused by user generated content in the United States the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act OCILLA a portion of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA dictates safe harbor provisions for online service providers as defined under the act which grants immunity from secondary liability for the copyright infringing actions of their users as long as they promptly remove access to allegedly infringing materials upon the receipt of a notice from a copyright holder or registered agent and they do not have actual knowledge that their service is being used for infringing activities br In the UK the Defamation Act of says that if a person is not the author editor or publisher and did not know about the situation they are not convicted Furthermore ISPs are not considered authors editors or publishers and they cannot have responsibility for people they have no effective control over Just like the DMCA once the ISP learns about the content they must delete it immediately The European Union s approach is horizontal by nature which means that civil and criminal liability issues are addressed under the Electronic Commerce Directive Section deals with liability of the ISP while conducting mere conduit services caching and web hosting services br br br Research br A study on YouTube analyzing one of the video on demand systems was conducted in The length of the video had decreased by two fold from the non UGC content but they saw a fast production rate The user behavior is what perpetuates the UGC The act of P P peer to peer was studied and saw a great benefit to the system They also studied the impact of content aliasing sharing of multiple copies and illegal uploads br A study from York University in Ontario in conducted research that resulted in a proposed framework for comparing brand related UGC and to understand how the strategy used by a company could influence the brand sentiment across different social media channels including YouTube Twitter and Facebook The three scholars of this study examined two clothing brands Lulu Lemon and American Apparel The difference between these two brands is that Lulu Lemon had a social media following while American Apparel was the complete opposite with no social media following Unsurprisingly Lulu Lemon had much more positive contributions compared to American Apparel which had less positive contributions Lulu Lemon has three times the number of positive contributions percent vs percent for American Apparel on Twitter while on Facebook and YouTube they had roughly an equal number of contributions This proves that social media can influence how a brand is perceived usually in a more positive light A study by Dhar and Chang published in found that the volume of blogs posted on a music album was positively correlated with future sales of that album br br br See also br br br General sources br This article incorporates text from a free content work Licensed
