In safe life design products are intended to be removed from service at a specific design life br Safe life is particularly relevant to simple metal aircraft where airframe components are subjected to alternating loads over the lifetime of the aircraft which makes them susceptible to metal fatigue In certain areas such as in wing or tail components structural failure in flight would be catastrophic br The safe life design technique is employed in critical systems which are either very difficult to repair or whose failure may cause severe damage to life and property These systems are designed to work for years without requirement of any repairs br The disadvantage of the safe life design philosophy is that serious assumptions must be made regarding the alternating loads imposed on the aircraft so if those assumptions prove to be inaccurate cracks may commence prior to the component being removed from service To counter this disadvantage alternative design philosophies like fail safe design and fault tolerant design were developed br br br The automotive industry br One way the safe life approach is planning and envisaging the toughness of the mechanisms in the automotive industry When the repetitive loading on mechanical structures intensified with the advent of the steam engine back in the mid s this approach was established Oja According to Michael Oja Engineers and academics began to understand the effect that cyclic stress or strain has on the life of a component a curve was developed relating the magnitude of the cyclic stress S to the logarithm of the number of cycles to failure N Oja The S N curve because the fundamental relation is in safe life designs The curve is reliant on many conditions including the ratio of maximum load to minimum load R ratio the type of material being inspected and the regularity at which the cyclic stresses or strains are applied Today the curve is still consequential by experimentally testing laboratory specimens at many continuous cyclic load levels and detecting the number of cycles to failure Oja Michael Oja states that Unsurprisingly as the load decreases the life of the specimen increases Oja The practical limit of experimental challenges has been due to frequency confines of hydraulic powered test machines The load at which this high cycle life happens has come to be recognized as the fatigue asset of the material Oja br br br Aerospace br br br Aircraft structure br There are two generic types of aircraft structure safe life and fail safe The former is one that has low residual strength if a primary load bearing member should fail whereas the latter has alternative load paths so that if a primary load bearing member cracks residual strength remains because the loads can be assumed by adjacent members In modern aircraft fail safe structures with up to three alternative load paths are provided but back in the main load bearing structure was safe life This did not matter on an interim airframe designed for operations in the calm upper air but at around ft the loads and stresses were more volatile br br br Helicopter structure br The safe life design philosophy is applied to all helicopter structures In the current generation of Army helicopters such as the UH Black Hawk composite materials make up as great as percent of the airframe and rotor weight Reddick Harold Reddick states that With the advent of major helicopter composite structures R D projects such as the Advanced Composite Airframe Program ACAP and Manufacturing Methods and Technology MM T projects such as UH Low Cost Composite Blade Program it is estimated that within a few years composite materials could be applied to as much as of the airframe and rotor weight of a helicopter in a production program Reddick Along with this application it is the essential obligation that sound definitive design criteria be industrialized in order that the composite structures have high fatigue lives for economy of ownership and good damage tolerance for flight safety Safe life and damage tolerant criteria are practical to all helicopter flight critical components Reddick br br br See also br Fail safe br Fault tolerant design br Safety engineering br Damage tolerance br Australian National Airways Stinson crash br br br br br br Citations br Oja Michael Structural Design Concepts Overview of Safe Life and Damage Tolerance Vextec com Reducing Life Cycle Costs From Design To Field Service Retrieved br Fatigue material Wikipedia retrieved br Reddick Harold Safe Life and Damage Tolerant Design Approaches for Helicopter Structures PDF NASA Retrieved June br br br External links br br br br br br br br br br
