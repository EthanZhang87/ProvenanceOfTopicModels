Video game music VGM is the soundtrack that accompanies video games Early video game music was once limited to sounds of early sound chips such as programmable sound generators PSG or FM synthesis chips These limitations have led to the style of music known as chiptune which became the sound of the first video games br With technological advances video game music has grown to include a wider range of sounds Players can hear music in video games over a game s title screen menus and gameplay Game soundtracks can also change depending on a player s actions or situation such as indicating missed actions in rhythm games informing the player they are in a dangerous situation or rewarding them for specific achievements br Video game music can be one of two kinds original or licensed br The popularity of video game music has created education and job opportunities generated awards and led video game soundtracks to be commercially sold and performed in concerts br br br History br br br Early video game technology and computer chip music br At the time video games had emerged as a popular form of entertainment in the late s music was stored on physical media in analog waveforms such as cassette tapes and phonograph records Such components were expensive and prone to breakage under heavy use making them less than ideal for use in an arcade cabinet though in rare cases such as Journey they were used A more affordable method of having music in a video game was to use digital means where a specific computer chip would change electrical impulses from computer code into analog sound waves on the fly for output on a speaker Sound effects for the games were also generated in this fashion An early example of such an approach to video game music was the opening chiptune in Tomohiro Nishikado s Gun Fight br While this allowed for the inclusion of music in early arcade video games it was usually monophonic looped or used sparingly between stages or at the start of a new game such as the Namco titles Pac Man composed by Toshio Kai or Pole Position composed by Nobuyuki Ohnogi The first game to use a continuous background soundtrack was Tomohiro Nishikado s Space Invaders released by Taito in It had four descending chromatic bass notes repeating in a loop though it was dynamic and interacted with the player increasing pace as the enemies descended on the player The first video game to feature continuous melodic background music was Rally X released by Namco in featuring a simple tune that repeats continuously during gameplay The decision to include any music into a video game meant that at some point it would have to be transcribed into computer code Some music was original some was public domain music such as folk songs Sound capabilities were limited the popular Atari home system for example was capable of generating only two tones at a time br As advances were made in silicon technology and costs fell a definitively new generation of arcade machines and home consoles allowed for great changes in accompanying music In arcades machines based on the Motorola CPU and accompanying various Yamaha YM programmable sound generator sound chips allowed for several more tones or channels of sound sometimes eight or more The earliest known example of this was Sega s arcade game Carnival which used an AY chip to create an electronic rendition of the classical composition Over The Waves by Juventino Rosas br Konami s arcade game Frogger introduced a dynamic approach to video game music using at least eleven different gameplay tracks in addition to level starting and game over themes which change according to the player s actions This was further improved upon by Namco s arcade game Dig Dug where the music stopped when the player stopped moving Dig Dug was composed by Yuriko Keino who also composed the music for other Namco games such as Xevious and Phozon Sega s arcade game Super Locomotive featured a chiptune rendition of Yellow Magic Orchestra s Rydeen several later computer games also covered the song such as Trooper Truck by Rabbit Software as well as Daley Thompson s Decathlon and Stryker s Run composed by Martin Galway br Home console systems also had a comparable upgrade in sound ability beginning with the ColecoVision in capable of four channels However more notable was the Japanese release of the Famicom in which was later released in the US as the Nintendo Entertainment System in It was capable of five channels one being capable of simple PCM sampled sound The home computer Commodore released in was capable of early forms of filtering effects different types of waveforms and eventually the undocumented ability to play bit samples on a pseudo fourth sound channel Its comparatively low cost made it a popular alternative to other home computers as well as its ability to use a TV for an affordable display monitor br Approach to game music development in this time period usually involved using simple tone generation and or frequency modulation synthesis to simulate instruments for melodies and use of a noise channel for simulating percussive noises Early use of PCM samples in this era was limited to short sound bites Monopoly or as an alternate for percussion sounds Super Mario Bros The music on home consoles often had to share the available channels with other sound effects For example if a laser beam was fired by a spaceship and the laser used a Hz square wave then the square wave channel that was in use by music would stop playing music and start playing the sound effect br The mid to late s software releases for these platforms had music developed by more people with greater musical experience than before Quality of composition improved noticeably and evidence of the popularity of the music of this time period remains even today Composers who made a name for themselves with their software include Koichi Sugiyama Dragon Quest Nobuo Uematsu Final Fantasy Rob Hubbard Monty On the Run International Karate Koji Kondo Super Mario Bros The Legend of Zelda Miki Higashino Gradius Yie Ar Kung Fu Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Hiroshi Kawaguchi Space Harrier Hang On Out Run Hirokazu Tanaka Metroid Kid Icarus EarthBound Martin Galway Daley Thompson s Decathlon Stryker s Run Times of Lore David Wise Donkey Kong Country Yuzo Koshiro Dragon Slayer Ys Shinobi ActRaiser Streets of Rage Mieko Ishikawa Dragon Slayer Ys and Ryu Umemoto visual novels shoot em ups By the late s video game music was being sold as cassette tape soundtracks in Japan inspiring American companies such as Sierra Cinemaware and Interplay to give more serious attention to video game music by The Golden Joystick Awards introduced a category for Best Soundtrack of the Year in won by Sanxion br Some games for cartridge systems have been sold with extra audio hardware on board including Pitfall II for the Atari and several late Famicom titles These chips add to the existing sound capabilities br br br Early digital synthesis and sampling br br From around some arcade games began taking steps toward digitized or sampled sounds Namco s arcade game Rally X was the first known game to use a digital to analog converter DAC to produce sampled tones instead of a tone generator That same year the first known video game to feature speech synthesis was also released Sunsoft s shoot em up game Stratovox Around the same time the introduction of frequency modulation synthesis FM synthesis first commercially released by Yamaha for their digital synthesizers and FM sound chips allowed the tones to be manipulated to have different sound characteristics where before the tone generated by the chip was limited to the design of the chip itself Konami s arcade game Gyruss used five synthesis sound chips along with a DAC which were used to create an electronic version of J S Bach s Toccata and Fugue in D minor br Beyond arcade games significant improvements to personal computer game music were made possible with the introduction of digital FM synth boards which Yamaha released for Japanese computers such as the NEC PC and PC in the early s and by the mid s the PC and FM had built in FM sound The sound FM synth boards produced are described as warm and pleasant sound Musicians such as Yuzo Koshiro and Takeshi Abo utilized to produce music that is still highly regarded within the chiptune community The widespread adoption of FM synthesis by consoles would later be one of the major advances of the bit era by which time bit arcade machines were using multiple FM synthesis chips br One of the earliest home computers to make use of digital signal processing in the form of sampling was the Amiga in The computer s sound chip featured four independent bit digital to analog converters Developers could use this platform to take samples of a music performance sometimes just a single note long and play it back through the computer s sound chip from memory This differed from Rally X in that its hardware DAC was used to play back simple waveform samples and a sampled sound allowed for a complexity and authenticity of a real instrument that an FM simulation could not offer For its role in being one of the first and affordable the Amiga would remain a staple tool of early sequenced music composing especially in Europe br The Amiga offered these features before most other competing home computer platforms though the Macintosh which had been introduced a year earlier had similar capabilities The Amiga s main rival the Atari ST sourced the Yamaha YM Programmable Sound Generator PSG Compared to the in house designed Amiga sound engine the PSG could only handle channel of sampled sound and needed the computer s CPU to process the data for it This made it impractical for game development use until with the release of the Atari STE which used DMA techniques to play back PCM samples at up to kHz The ST however remained relevant as it was equipped with a MIDI controller and external ports It became the choice of by many professional musicians as a MIDI programming device br IBM PC clones in would not see any significant development in multimedia abilities for a few more years and sampling would not become popular in other video game systems for several years Though sampling had the potential to produce much more realistic sounds each sample required much more data in memory This was at a time when all memory solid state ROM cartridge magnetic floppy disk or otherwise was still very costly per kilobyte Sequenced soundchip generated music on the other hand was generated with a few lines of comparatively simple code and took up far less precious memory br Arcade systems pushed game music forward in with the introduction of FM Frequency Modulation synthesis providing more organic sounds than previous PSGs The first such game Marble Madness used the Yamaha YM FM synthesis chip br As home consoles moved into the fourth generation or bit era the hybrid approach sampled and tone to music composing continued to be used The Sega Genesis offered advanced graphics over the NES and improved sound synthesis features also using a Yamaha chip the YM but largely held the same approach to sound design Ten channels in total for tone generation with one for PCM samples were available in stereo instead of the NES s five channels in mono one for PCM As before it was often used for percussion samples The Genesis did not support bit sampled sounds Despite the additional tone channels writing music still posed a challenge to traditional composers and it forced much more imaginative use of the FM synthesizer to create an enjoyable listening experience The composer Yuzo Koshiro utilized the Genesis hardware effectively to produce progressive catchy techno style compositions far more advanced than what players were used to for games such as The Revenge of Shinobi and the Streets of Rage series setting a new high watermark for what music in games could sound like The soundtrack for Streets of Rage in particular is considered revolutionary and ahead of its time for its blend of house music with dirty electro basslines and trancey electronic textures that would feel as comfortable in a nightclub as a video game Another important FM synth composer was the late Ryu Umemoto who composed music for many visual novels and shoot em ups during the s br As the cost of magnetic memory declined in the form of diskettes the evolution of video game music on the Amiga and some years later game music development in general shifted to sampling in some form It took some years before Amiga game designers learned to wholly use digitized sound effects in music an early exception case was the title music of text adventure game The Pawn By this time computer and game music had already begun to form its own identity and thus many music makers intentionally tried to produce music that sounded like that heard on the Commodore and NES which resulted in the chiptune genre br The release of a freely distributed Amiga program named Soundtracker by Karsten Obarski in started the era of MOD format which made it easy for anyone to produce music based on digitized samples Module files were made with programs called trackers after Obarski s Soundtracker This MOD tracker tradition continued with PC computers in the s Examples of Amiga games using digitized instrument samples include David Whittaker s soundtrack for Shadow of the Beast Chris H lsbeck s soundtrack for Turrican and Matt Furniss s tunes for Laser Squad Richard Joseph also composed some theme songs featuring vocals and lyrics for games by Sensible Software most famous being Cannon Fodder with a song War Has Never Been So Much Fun and Sensible World of Soccer with a song Goal Scoring Superstar Hero These songs used long vocal samples br A similar approach to sound and music developments had become common in the arcades by this time and had been used in many arcade system boards since the mid s This was further popularized in the early s by games like Street Fighter II on the CPS which used voice samples extensively along with sampled sound effects and percussion Neo Geo s MVS system also carried powerful sound development which often included surround sound br br The evolution also carried into home console video games such as the release of the Super Famicom in and its US EU version Super NES in It sported a specialized custom Sony chip for both the sound generation and for special hardware DSP It was capable of eight channels of sampled sounds at up to bit resolution had a wide selection of DSP effects including a type of ADSR usually seen in high end synthesizers of the time and full stereo sound This allowed experimentation with applied acoustics in video games such as musical acoustics early games like Super Castlevania IV F Zero Final Fantasy IV Gradius III and later games like Chrono Trigger directional Star Fox and spatial acoustics Dolby Pro Logic was used in some games like King Arthur s World and Jurassic Park as well as environmental and architectural acoustics A Link to the Past Secret of Evermore Many games also made heavy use of the high quality sample playback capabilities Super Star Wars Tales of Phantasia The only real limitation to this powerful setup was the still costly solid state memory Other consoles of the generation could boast similar abilities yet did not have the same circulation levels as the Super NES The Neo Geo home system was capable of the same powerful sample processing as its arcade counterpart but was several times the cost of a Super NES The Sega CD the Mega CD outside North America hardware upgrade to the Mega Drive Genesis in the US offered multiple PCM channels but they were often passed over instead to use its capabilities with the CD ROM itself br The popularity of the Super NES and its software remained limited to regions where NTSC television was the broadcast standard Partly because of the difference in frame rates of PAL broadcast equipment many titles released were never redesigned to play appropriately and ran much slower than had been intended or were never released This showed a divergence in popular video game music between PAL and NTSC countries that still shows to this day This divergence would be lessened as the fifth generation of home consoles launched globally and as Commodore began to take a back seat to general purpose PCs and Macs for developing and gaming br Though the Mega CD Sega CD and to a greater extent the PC Engine in Japan would give gamers a preview of the direction video game music would take in streaming music the use of both sampled and sequenced music continues in game consoles even today The huge data storage benefit of optical media would be coupled with progressively more powerful audio generation hardware and higher quality samples in the Fifth Generation In the CD ROM equipped PlayStation supported channels of bit samples of up to kHz sample rate samples equal to CD audio in quality It also sported a few hardware DSP effects like reverb Many Square titles continued to use sequenced music such as Final Fantasy VII Legend of Mana and Final Fantasy Tactics The Sega Saturn also with a CD drive supported channels of PCM at the same resolution as the original PlayStation In the Nintendo still using a solid state cartridge actually supported an integrated and scalable sound system that was potentially capable of channels of PCM and an improved sample rate of kHz Games for the N because of the cost of the solid state memory typically had samples of lesser quality than the other two however and music tended to be simpler in construct br The more dominant approach for games based on CDs however was shifting toward streaming audio br br br MIDI on the PC br br In the same timeframe of the late s to mid s the IBM PC clones using the x architecture became more ubiquitous yet had a very different path in sound design than other PCs and consoles Early PC gaming was limited to the PC speaker and some proprietary standards such as the IBM PCjr voice chip While sampled sound could be achieved on the PC speaker using pulse width modulation doing so required a significant proportion of the available processor power rendering its use in games rare br With the increase of x PCs in the market there was a vacuum in sound performance in home computing that expansion cards attempted to fill The first two recognizable standards were the Roland MT followed by the AdLib sound card Roland s solution was driven by MIDI sequencing using advanced LA synthesizers This made it the first choice for game developers to produce upon but its higher cost as an end user solution made it prohibitive The AdLib used a low cost FM synthesis chip from Yamaha and many boards could operate compatibly using the MIDI standard br The AdLib card was usurped in by Creative s Sound Blaster which used the same Yamaha FM chip in the AdLib for compatibility but also added bit kHz later kHz digital audio recording and playback of a single stereo channel As an affordable end user product the Sound Blaster constituted the core sound technology of the early s a combination of a simple FM engine that supported MIDI and a DAC engine of one or more streams Only a minority of developers ever used Amiga style tracker formats in commercial PC games Unreal typically preferring to use the MT or AdLib SB compatible devices As general purpose PCs using x became more ubiquitous than the other PC platforms developers drew their focus towards that platform br The last major development before streaming music came in Roland Corporation released the first General MIDI card the sample based SCC an add in card version of the SC desktop MIDI module The comparative quality of the samples spurred similar offerings from Soundblaster but costs for both products were still high Both companies offered daughterboards with sample based synthesizers that could be later added to a less expensive soundcard which only had a DAC and a MIDI controller to give it the features of a fully integrated card br Unlike the standards of Amiga or Atari a PC using x even then could be using a broad mix of hardware Developers increasingly used MIDI sequences instead of writing soundtrack data for each type of soundcard they generally wrote a fully featured data set for the Roland application that would be compatible with lesser featured equipment so long as it had a MIDI controller to run the sequence However different products used different sounds attached to their MIDI controllers Some tied into the Yamaha FM chip to simulate instruments some daughterboards of samples had very different sound qualities meaning that no single sequence performance would be accurate to every other General MIDI device br All of these considerations in the products reflected the high cost of memory storage which rapidly declined with the optical CD format br br br Pre recorded and streaming music br br Taking entirely pre recorded music had many advantages over sequencing for sound quality Music could be produced freely with any kind and number of instruments allowing developers to simply record one track to be played back during the game Quality was only limited by the effort put into mastering the track itself Memory space costs that was previously a concern was somewhat addressed with optical media becoming the dominant media for software games CD quality audio allowed for music and voice that had the potential to be truly indistinguishable from any other source or genre of music br In fourth generation home video games and PCs this was limited to playing a Mixed Mode CD audio track from a CD while the game was in play such as Sonic CD The earliest examples of Mixed Mode CD audio in video games include the TurboGrafx CD RPG franchises Tengai Maky composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto from and the Ys series composed by Yuzo Koshiro and Mieko Ishikawa and arranged by Ryo Yonemitsu in The Ys soundtracks particularly Ys I II are still regarded as some of the most influential video game music ever composed br However there were several disadvantages of regular CD audio Optical drive technology was still limited in spindle speed so playing an audio track from the game CD meant that the system could not access data again until it stopped the track from playing Looping the most common form of game music was also a problem as when the laser reached the end of a track it had to move itself back to the beginning to start reading again causing an audible gap in playback br To address these drawbacks some PC game developers designed their own container formats in house for each application in some cases to stream compressed audio This would cut back on memory used for music on the CD allowed for much lower latency and seek time when finding and starting to play music and also allowed for much smoother looping due to being able to buffer the data A minor drawback was that use of compressed audio meant it had to be decompressed which put load on the CPU of a system As computing power increased this load became minimal and in some cases dedicated chips in a computer such as a sound card would actually handle all the decompressing br Fifth generation home console systems also developed specialised streaming formats and containers for compressed audio playback Games would take full advantage of this ability sometimes with highly praised results Castlevania Symphony of the Night Games ported from arcade machines which continued to use FM synthesis often saw superior pre recorded music streams on their home console counterparts Street Fighter Alpha Even though the game systems were capable of CD quality sound these compressed audio tracks were not true CD quality Many of them had lower sampling rates but not so significant that most consumers would notice Using a compressed stream allowed game designers to play back streamed music and still be able to access other data on the disc without interruption of the music at the cost of CPU power used to render the audio stream Manipulating the stream any further would require a far more significant level of CPU power available in the th generation br Some games such as the Wipeout series continued to use full Mixed Mode CD audio for their soundtracks br This overall freedom offered to music composers gave video game music the equal footing with other popular music it had lacked A musician could now with no need to learn about programming or the game architecture itself independently produce the music to their satisfaction This flexibility would be exercised as popular mainstream musicians would be using their talents for video games specifically An early example is Way of the Warrior on the DO with music by White Zombie A more well known example is Trent Reznor s score for Quake br An alternate approach as with the TMNT arcade was to take pre existing music not written exclusively for the game and use it in the game The game Star Wars X Wing vs TIE Fighter and subsequent Star Wars games took music composed by John Williams for the Star Wars films of the s and s and used it for the game soundtracks br Both using new music streams made specifically for the game and using previously released recorded music streams are common approaches for developing sound tracks to this day It is common for X games sports based video games to come with some popular artists recent releases SSX Tony Hawk Initial D as well as any game with heavy cultural demographic theme that has tie in to music Need For Speed Underground Gran Turismo and Grand Theft Auto Sometimes a hybrid of the two are used such as in Dance Dance Revolution br Many sports game titles like Madden NFL NBA K and FIFA use popular and underground songs in their soundtrack to give their menus atmosphere The phrase FIFA song has become popular in recent years it describes a song often not American that is upbeat and has lots of rhythm The inclusion on the FIFA soundtrack has given many artists exposure that helped launch their music careers br Sequencing samples continue to be used in modern gaming where fully recorded audio is not viable Until the mid s many larger games on home consoles used sequenced audio to save space Additionally most games on the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS used sequenced music due to storage limitations Sometimes a cross between sequencing samples and streaming music is used Games such as Republic The Revolution music composed by James Hannigan and Command Conquer Generals music composed by Bill Brown have utilised sophisticated systems governing the flow of incidental music by stringing together short phrases based on the action on screen and the player s most recent choices see dynamic music Other games dynamically mixed the sound on the game based on cues of the game environment br As processing power increased dramatically in the th generation of home consoles it became possible to apply special effects in realtime to streamed audio In SSX a recent video game series if a snowboarder takes to the air after jumping from a ramp the music softens or muffles a bit and the ambient noise of wind and air blowing becomes louder to emphasize being airborne When the snowboarder lands the music resumes regular playback until its next cue The LucasArts company pioneered this interactive music technique with their iMUSE system used in their early adventure games and the Star Wars flight simulators Star Wars X Wing and Star Wars TIE Fighter Action games such as these will change dynamically to match the amount of danger Stealth based games will sometimes rely on such music either by handling streams differently or dynamically changing the composition of a sequenced soundtrack br br br Personalized soundtracks br Being able to play one s own music during a game in the past usually meant turning down the game audio and using an alternative music player Some early exceptions were possible on PC Windows gaming in which it was possible to independently adjust game audio while playing music with a separate program running in the background Some PC games such as Quake play music from the CD while retrieving game data exclusively from the hard disk thereby allowing the game CD to be swapped for any music CD The first PC game to introduce in game support for custom soundtracks was Lionhead Studio s Black White The game included an in game interface for Winamp that enabled the players to play audio tracks from their own playlists In addition this would sometimes trigger various reactions from the player s Creature like dancing or laughing br Some PlayStation games supported this by swapping the game CD with a music CD although when the game needed data players had to swap the CDs again One of the earliest games Ridge Racer was loaded entirely into RAM letting the player insert a music CD to provide a soundtrack throughout the entirety of the gameplay In Vib Ribbon this became a gameplay feature with the game generating levels based entirely on the music on whatever CD the player inserted br Microsoft s Xbox allowed music to be copied from a CD onto its internal hard drive to be used as a Custom Soundtrack if enabled by the game developer The feature carried over into the Xbox where it became supported by the system software and could be enabled at any point The Wii is also able to play custom soundtracks if it is enabled by the game Excite Truck Endless Ocean The PlayStation Portable can in games like Need for Speed Carbon Own the City and FIFA play music from a Memory Stick br The PlayStation has the ability to utilize custom soundtracks in games using music saved on the hard drive however few game developers used this function MLB The Show released in has a My MLB sound track feature that allows the user to play music tracks of their choice saved on the hard drive of their PS rather than the preprogrammed tracks incorporated into the game by the developer An update to Wipeout HD released on the PlayStation Network was made to also incorporate this feature br In the video game Audiosurf custom soundtracks are the main aspect of the game Users have to pick a music file to be analyzed The game will generate a race track based on tempo pitch and complexity of the sound The user will then race on this track synchronized with the music br Games in the Grand Theft Auto series have supported custom soundtracks using them as a separate in game radio station The feature was primarily exclusive to PC versions and was adopted to a limited degree on console platforms On a PC inserting custom music into the stations is done by placing music files into a designated folder For the Xbox version a CD must be installed into the console s hard drive For the iPhone version of Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars players create an iTunes playlist which is then played by the game br Forza Horizon used a similar technology of custom soundtracks with the help of Groove Music br br br Developments in the s br br The Xbox supports Dolby Digital software sampling and playback rate of bit kHz internal with bit hardware D A converters hardware codec streaming and potential of audio simultaneous channels While powerful and flexible none of these features represent any major change in how game music is made from the last generation of console systems PCs continue to rely on third party devices for in game sound reproduction and SoundBlaster is largely the only major player in the entertainment audio expansion card business br The PlayStation handles multiple types of surround sound technology including Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio with up to channels and with sampling rates of up to kHz br Nintendo s Wii console shares many audio components with the GameCube from the previous generation including Dolby Pro Logic II These features are extensions of technology already currently in use br The game developer of today has many choices on how to develop music More likely changes in video game music creation will have very little to do with technology and more to do with other factors of game development as a business whole Video game music has diversified much to the point where scores for games can be presented with a full orchestra or simple bit chiptunes This degree of freedom has made the creative possibilities of video game music limitless to developers As sales of video game music diverged from the game itself in the West compared to Japan where game music CDs had been selling for years business elements also wield a new level of influence Music from outside the game developer s immediate employment such as music composers and pop artists have been contracted to produce game music just as they would for a theatrical movie Many other factors have growing influence such as editing for content politics on some level of the development and executive input br br br Impact and importance br Many video game players believe that music can enhance game play and outlets such as Popular Science have stated that it is designed to simultaneously stimulate your senses and blend into the background of your brain because that s the point of the soundtrack It has to engage you the player in a task without distracting from it In fact the best music would actually direct the listener to the task br Sound effects within game play are also believed to impact game performance Ambient sounds such as those present in Resident Evil are seen to enhance the tension felt by players something that GameSpot stated was also used in cinema Speeding up the sound effects and music in games such as Space Invaders is also stated to have a strong impact on the gaming experience when done properly Properly done this can help create realism within virtuality and alert players to important scenes and information br Music and sound effects can become memorable enabling people to instantly recognize music or sound effects as well as hum or mimic the tune or sound effect Polygon has stated that despite the popularity of video game music people may not always know the name of the composer br br br Licensing br Using licensed music for video games became more popular as the medium used to distribute games grew large enough to accommodate songs alongside a game s other assets Additionally with the large growth of the video game market in the s song licensing became a lucrative route for music rights holders to gain part of that revenue Games like those in the Grand Theft Auto series became showcases of licensed music Music licensing is generally complicated due to various copyright laws typically with at least two separate copyrights to consider the songwriters and the performers contributions Most large video game developers and publishers who use licensed music typically have staff proficient in licensing to clear songs for use in video games with the various music labels and other creative persons br Games with licensed music can have problems well past release if perpetual rights for the music are not secured for the game Early games before the onset of digital distribution would have perpetual right for the music since there was no practical way to update the game following release at retail to deal with curtailed rights However digital distribution platforms like Steam Xbox Live and PlayStation Network keep games up to date automatically Music licenses for games sold through digital distribution may include limited terms requiring the publisher to re negotiate rights with the music s owner or otherwise the music must be removed from the game through these updates Notably Alan Wake by Remedy Entertainment first released in had to be pulled from digital sale in due to expiring music rights However with Microsoft s help Remedy was able to re secure these rights a year later and returned the game for sale Alpha Protocol by Obsidian Entertainment was also pulled from sale in due to expiring music license rights though there are no known plans if publisher Sega will seek to renew these br Licensed music in video games has also affected video game streaming such as Let s Play videos Due to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA most popular video sharing and streaming sites implement automatic forms of detecting copyrighted music from most music labels and flag or block user videos that employ that music such as YouTube s Content ID system These actions apply equally to videos of people playing video games flagging the video from the licensed music in the game To avoid this games using licensed music may offer a stream safe music option either disabling the music playback or replacing the licensed music with copyright free or royalty free music br br br Game music as a genre br br Many games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and other early game consoles feature a similar style of musical composition that is sometimes described as the video game genre Some aspects of this style continue to influence certain music today though gamers do not associate many modern game soundtracks with the older style The genre s compositional elements largely developed due to technological restraints while also being influenced by electronic music bands particularly Yellow Magic Orchestra YMO who were popular during the late s to s YMO sampled sounds from several classic arcade games in their early albums most notably Space Invaders in the hit song Computer Game In turn the band would have a major influence on much of the video game music produced during the bit and bit eras br Features of the video game music genre include br br Pieces designed to repeat indefinitely rather than having an arranged ending or fading out they however create an atmosphere especially in important scenes of the game They introduce a philosophical dimension in the game as they may introduce questioning in the mind of players in relationship with their next action br Pieces lacking lyrics and playing over gameplay sounds br Limited polyphony Only three notes can be played simultaneously on the Nintendo Entertainment System A great deal of effort was put into composition to create the illusion of more notes playing at once br Although the tones featured in NES music can be thought of as emulating a traditional four piece rock band triangle wave used as a bass two pulse waves analogous to two guitars and a white noise channel used for drums composers would often go out of their way to compose complex and rapid sequences of notes in part due to the restrictions mentioned above This is similar to music composition during the Baroque period when composers particularly when creating solo pieces focused on musical embellishments to compensate for instruments such as the harpsichord that do not allow for expressive dynamics For the same reason many early compositions also feature a distinct jazz influence These would overlap with later influences from heavy metal and J pop music resulting in an equally distinct compositional style in the bit era br In an unrelated but parallel course in the European and North American developer scene similar limitations were driving the musical style of home computer games Module file format music particularly MOD used similar techniques but was more heavily influenced by the electronic music scene as it developed and resulted in another very distinct subgenre Demos and the developing demoscene played a big part in the early years and still influence video game music today br As technological limitations gradually lifted composers were given more freedom and with the advent of CD ROM pre recorded soundtracks came to dominate resulting in a noticeable shift in composition and voicing style Popular early CD ROM titles were released with high resolution graphics and recorded music Since the audio was not reliant on a sound card s synthesis CD ROM technology ensured that composers and sound designers could know what audio would sound like on most consumer configurations and could also record sound effects live instruments vocals and in game dialogue br br br Outside video games br br Appreciation for video game music is strong among fans and composers particularly for music from the third and fourth generations of home video game consoles and sometimes newer generations This appreciation has been shown outside the context of a video game in the form of CDs sheet music public performances art installations and popular music br br br CDs and sheet music br Selling video game soundtracks separately as CDs has become increasingly popular in the industry Interpretive albums remixes and live performance albums were also common variations to original soundtracks OSTs br Koichi Sugiyama was an early figure in this practice and following the release of the first Dragon Quest game in a live performance CD of his compositions was released and performed by the Tokyo Strings Ensemble then later by other groups including the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra br By Sega were selling to game soundtrack CDs annually Yuzo Koshiro another early figure released a live performance of the Actraiser soundtrack Both Koshiro s and fellow Falcom composer Mieko Ishikawa s contributions to Ys music would have such long lasting impact that there were more albums released of Ys music than of almost all other game type music br Like anime soundtracks these soundtracks and even sheet music books were usually marketed exclusively in Japan Therefore interested gamers outside Japan had to import the soundtracks and or sheet music books through on or offline firms specifically dedicated to video game soundtrack imports This has been somewhat less of an issue more recently as domestic publishers of anime and video games have been producing western equivalent versions of the OSTs for sale in UK and US though these are often for more popular titles Video game music companies like Materia Collective have pursued and produced published book editions of video game music br The sale of video game soundtracks has created a growing symbiotic relationship between the music industry and the games industry Commonly games are being used to promote and sell licensed music rather than just original score and recording artists are being used to market and sell games Music marketing agency Electric Artists conducted a study that revealed a number of interesting statistics surrounding hard core gamers and their music habits of hard core gamers bought the CD after hearing a song they liked in a video game of gamers said soundtracks within games help sell more CDs and of respondents said a game introduced them to a new band or song then of them went out and bought what they heard Some game soundtracks have become so popular they have reached platinum status such as NBA Live br br br Public performance br Many original composers have publicly exhibited their music through symphonic concert performances Once again Koichi Sugiyama was the first to execute this practice in with his Family Classic Concert featuring live performances of Dragon Quest music and had continued these concert performances almost annually In he also formed a series called Orchestral Game Music Concerts notable for featuring music of other talented game composers such as Yoko Kanno Nobunaga s Ambition Romance of the Three Kingdoms Uncharted Waters

schools offering courses and degrees in video game design in the United States many of which include sound and music design Berklee College of Music Yale University New York University and the New England Conservatory have all introduced game music into their music programs These programs offer immersive education in music composition orchestration editing and production Other post secondary schools have more games focused programs such as DigiPen Institute of Technology Columbia College Chicago and Academy of Art University who all offer programs in Music and Sound Design These programs include courses in sound effect creation interactive sound design and scripting music br Similar programs have gained popularity in Europe The Utrecht School of the Arts Faculty of Art Media and

Academic research on video game music began in the late s and developed through the mid s Early research on the topic often involved historical studies of game music or comparative studies of video game music and film music see for instance Zach Whalen s article Play Along An Approach to Videogame Music which includes both The study of video game music is also known by some as ludomusicology a portmanteau of ludology the study of games and gameplay and musicology the study and analysis of music a term coined independently by Guillaume Laroche and Roger Moseley br A prominent figure in early video game music and audio research is Karen Collins who is associate professor at the University of Waterloo and Canada Research Chair in Interactive Audio at the University of Waterloo Games Institute Her monograph Game Sound An Introduction to the History Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design MIT Press is considered a seminal work in the field and was influential in the subsequent development of video game music studies br The Ludomusicology Research Group is an inter university research organisation focusing on the study of music in games music games and music in video game culture composed of four researchers Michiel Kamp Tim Summers Melanie Fritsch and Mark Sweeney Together they organise an annual international conference held in the UK or Europe at the time of writing the most recent was the Ludo conference held at Bath Spa University The group was founded by Kamp Summers and Sweeney in August who have also edited a collection of essays based around the study of game sound entitled Ludomusicology Approaches to Video Game Music published in July They also edited a double special issue of The Soundtrack and initiated a new book series for the Study in Game Sound and Music in In September Tim Summers book Understanding Video Game Music was published by Cambridge University Press br Fritsch officially joined the group in She had edited the nd issue of the online journal ACT Zeitschrift f r Musik und Performance published in July which included ludomusicological contributions written by Tim Summers Steven B Reale and Jason Brame She had been a regular at the conferences since and published several book chapters on the topic Whereas Kamp Summers and Sweeney have a background in musicology Fritsch s background is in performance studies br The North American Conference on Video Game Music NACVGM is an international conference on video game music held annually in North America since It is organised by Neil Lerner Steven Beverburg Reale and William Gibbons br In late the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games SSSMG was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference The SSSMG has the aim of bringing together both practitioners and researchers from across the globe in order to develop the field s understanding of sound and video game music and audio Its focus is the use of its website as a hub for communication and resource centralisation including a video game music research bibliography a project initially begun by the Ludomusicology Research Group br The Ludomusicology Society of Australia was launched by Barnabas Smith in April during the Ludo conference in Bath UK it aims to offer a centralised and local professional body nurturing game music studies for academics people in industry and game music fans alike in the Australasian region br br br Composers br br Creating and producing video game music requires strong teams and coordination among the different divisions of game development As the market has expanded so have the types of jobs in game music The process often starts with the game designer who will have a specific musical theme or genre in mind for the game Their options include contracting original composers or licensing existing music both of which require other music experts br During the arcade and early console era to the mid s most game music was composed by full time employees of the particular game company producing the game This was largely due to the very specialized nature of video game music where each system had its own technology and tool sets It was not uncommon for a game company like Capcom or Konami to have a room full of composers each at their own workstation with headphones writing music br Once the CD era hit and studio recorded music became more ubiquitous in games it became increasingly common for game music to be composed by independent contractors hired by the game developer on a per project basis Most bigger budget games such as Call of Duty Mass Effect Ghost Recon or Lost Planet hire composers in this fashion Approximately of game composers are freelance the remaining being employees of a game company Original score and soundtrack may require the hiring of a music director who will help create the game music as well as help book the resources needed for performing and recording the music Some music directors may work with a game s Sound Designer to create a dynamic score Notable exceptions include composer Koji Kondo who remains an employee at Nintendo and Martin O Donnell who worked at Bungie until early br The growth of casual mobile and social games has greatly increased opportunities for game music composers with job growth in the US market increasing more than over five years Independently developed games are a frequent place where beginning game composers gain experience composing for video games Game composers particularly for smaller games are likely to provide other services such as sound design of game composers also do some sound design integration of game composers also integrate their music into audio middleware or even computer coding or scripting br With the rising use of licensed popular music in video games job opportunities in game music have also come to include the role of a music supervisor Music supervisors work on behalf of a game developer or game publisher to source pre existing music from artists and music publishers These supervisors can be hired on a per project basis or can work in house like the Music Group for Electronic Arts EA that has a team of music supervisors A music supervisor is needed to not only help select music that will suit the game but to also ensure the music is fully licensed in order to avoid lawsuits or conflicts Music supervisors may also help negotiate payment which for artists and songwriters is often a one time buy out fee because games do not generate music royalties when they are sold A growing trend is to contract artists to write original songs for games to add to their value and exclusivity and once again supervisors can be a part of that process br br br Awards br br br Current br br br Defunct br br br Other br In video game music made its first appearance at the
