Cradle to cradle design also referred to as CC C C cradle cradle or regenerative design is a biomimetic approach to the design of products and systems that models human industry on nature s processes where materials are viewed as nutrients circulating in healthy safe metabolisms The term itself is a play on the popular corporate phrase cradle to grave implying that the C C model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations from the birth or cradle of one generation to the next generation versus from birth to death or grave within the same generation br C C suggests that industry must protect and enrich ecosystems and nature s biological metabolism while also maintaining a safe productive technical metabolism for the high quality use and circulation of organic and technical nutrients It is a holistic economic industrial and social framework that seeks to create systems that are not only efficient but also essentially waste free Building off the whole systems approach of John T Lyle s regenerative design the model in its broadest sense is not limited to industrial design and manufacturing it can be applied to many aspects of human civilization such as urban environments buildings economics and social systems br The term Cradle to Cradle is a registered trademark of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry MBDC consultants The Cradle to Cradle Certified Products Program began as a proprietary system however in MBDC turned the certification over to an independent non profit called the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute Independence openness and transparency are the Institute s first objectives for the certification protocols The phrase cradle to cradle itself was coined by Walter R Stahel in the s The current model is based on a system of lifecycle development initiated by Michael Braungart and colleagues at the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency EPEA in the s and explored through the publication A Technical Framework for Life Cycle Assessment br In Braungart and William McDonough published a book called Cradle to Cradle Remaking the Way We Make Things a manifesto for cradle to cradle design that gives specific details of how to achieve the model The model has been implemented by many companies organizations and governments around the world Cradle to cradle design has also been the subject of many documentary films such as Waste Food br br br Introduction br In the cradle to cradle model all materials used in industrial or commercial processes such as metals fibers dyes fall into one of two categories technical or biological nutrients br br Technical nutrients are strictly limited to non toxic non harmful synthetic materials that have no negative effects on the natural environment they can be used in continuous cycles as the same product without losing their integrity or quality In this manner these materials can be used over and over again instead of being downcycled into lesser products ultimately becoming waste br Biological nutrients are organic materials that once used can be disposed of in any natural environment and decompose into the soil providing food for small life forms without affecting the natural environment This is dependent on the ecology of the region for example organic material from one country or landmass may be harmful to the ecology of another country or landmass br The two types of materials each follow their own cycle in the regenerative economy envisioned by Keunen and Huizing br br br Structure br Initially defined by McDonough and Braungart the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute s five certification criteria are br br Material health which involves identifying the chemical composition of the materials that make up the product Particularly hazardous materials e g heavy metals pigments halogen compounds etc have to be reported whatever the concentration and other materials reported where they exceed ppm For wood the forest source is required The risk for each material is assessed against criteria and eventually ranked on a scale with green being materials of low risk yellow being those with moderate risk but are acceptable to continue to use red for materials that have high risk and need to be phased out and grey for materials with incomplete data The method uses the term risk in the sense of hazard as opposed to consequence and likelihood br Material reutilization which is about recovery and recycling at the end of product life br Assessment of energy required for production which for the highest level of certification needs to be based on at least renewable energy for all parts and subassemblies br Water particularly usage and discharge quality br Social responsibility which assesses fair labor practices br br br Health br Currently many human beings come into contact or consume directly or indirectly many harmful materials and chemicals daily In addition countless other forms of plant and animal life are also exposed C C seeks to remove dangerous technical nutrients synthetic materials such as mutagenic materials heavy metals and other dangerous chemicals from current life cycles If the materials we come into contact with and are exposed to on a daily basis are not toxic and do not have long term health effects then the health of the overall system can be better maintained For example a fabric factory can eliminate all harmful technical nutrients by carefully reconsidering what chemicals they use in their dyes to achieve the colours they need and attempt to do so with fewer base chemicals br br br Economics br The C C model shows high potential for reducing the financial cost of industrial systems For example in the redesign of the Ford River Rouge Complex the planting of Sedum stonecrop vegetation on assembly plant roofs retains and cleanses rain water It also moderates the internal temperature of the building in order to save energy The roof is part of an million rainwater treatment system designed to clean billion US gallons m of rainwater annually This saved Ford million that would otherwise have been spent on mechanical treatment facilities Following C C design principles product manufacture can be designed to cost less for the producer and consumer Theoretically they can eliminate the need for waste disposal such as landfills br br br Definitions br Cradle to cradle is a play on the phrase cradle to grave implying that the C C model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations br Technical nutrients are basically inorganic or synthetic materials manufactured by humans such as plastics and metals that can be used many times over without any loss in quality staying in a continuous cycle br Biological nutrients and materials are organic materials that can decompose into the natural environment soil water etc without affecting it in a negative way providing food for bacteria and microbiological life br Materials are usually referred to as the building blocks of other materials such as the dyes used in colouring fibers or rubbers used in the sole of a shoe br Downcycling is the reuse of materials into lesser products For example a plastic computer case could be downcycled into a plastic cup which then becomes a park bench etc this eventually leads to plastic waste In conventional understanding this is no different from recycling that produces a supply of the same product or material br Waste Food is a basic concept of organic waste materials becoming food for bugs insects and other small forms of life who can feed on it decompose it and return it to the natural environment which we then indirectly use for food ourselves br br br Existing synthetic materials br The question of how to deal with the countless existing technical nutrients synthetic materials that cannot be recycled or reintroduced to the natural environment is dealt with in C C design The materials that can be reused and retain their quality can be used within the technical nutrient cycles while other materials are far more difficult to deal with such as plastics in the Pacific Ocean br br br Hypothetical examples br One potential example is a shoe that is designed and mass produced using the C C model The sole might be made of biological nutrients while the upper parts might be made of technical nutrients The shoe is mass produced at a manufacturing plant that utilizes its waste material by putting it back into the cycle potentially by using off cuts from the rubber soles to make more soles instead of merely disposing of them this is dependent on the technical materials not losing their quality as they are reused Once the shoes have been manufactured they are distributed to retail outlets where the customer buys the shoe at a reduced price because the customer is only paying for the use of the materials in the shoe for the period of time that they will be wearing them When they outgrow the shoe or it is damaged they return it to the manufacturer When the manufacturer separates the sole from the upper parts separating the technical and biological nutrients the biological nutrients are returned to the natural environment while the technical nutrients can be used to create the sole of another shoe br Another example of C C design is a disposable cup bottle or wrapper made entirely out of biological materials When the user is finished with the item it can be disposed of and returned to the natural environment the cost of disposal of waste such as landfill and recycling is greatly reduced The user could also potentially return the item for a refund so it can be used again br br br Finished products br Rohner Textile AG Climatex textile br Biofoam a cradle to cradle alternative to expanded polystyrene br Sewage sludge treatment plants are facilities that may create fertiliser from sewage sludge This approach is green retrofit for the current inefficient system of organic waste disposal as composting toilets are a better approach in the long run br Aquion Energy large scale batteries br Ecovative Design packaging and insulation made from waste by binding it together with mycelium br br br Implementation br The C C model can be applied to almost any system in modern society urban environments buildings manufacturing social systems etc Five steps are outlined in Cradle to Cradle Remaking the Way We Make Things br br Get free of known culprits br Follow informed personal preferences br Create passive positive lists lists of materials used categorised according to their safety level br The X list substances that must be phased out such as teratogenic mutagenic carcinogenic br The gray list problematic substances that are not so urgently in need of phasing out br The P list the positive list substances actively defined as safe for use br Activate the positive list br Reinvent the redesign of the former system br Products that adhere to all steps may be eligible to receive C C certification Other certifications such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED and Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method BREEAM can be used to qualify for certification and vice versa in the case of BREEAM br C C principles were first applied to systems in the early s by Braungart s Hamburger Umweltinstitut HUI and The Environmental Institute in Brazil for biomass nutrient recycling of effluent to produce agricultural products and clean water as a byproduct br In MBDC and the EPEA formed a strategic partnership with global materials consultancy Material ConneXion to help promote and disseminate C C design principles by providing greater global access to C C material information certification and product development br As of January Material ConneXion s Materials Libraries in New York Milan Cologne Bangkok and Daegu Korea started to feature C C assessed and certified materials and in collaboration with MBDC and EPEA the company now offers C C Certification and C C product development br While the C C model has influenced the construction or redevelopment of smaller sites several large organizations and governments have also implemented the C C model and its ideas and concepts br br br Major implementations br The Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies incorporates holistic cyclic systems throughout the center Regenerative design is arguably the foundation for the trademarked C C br The Government of China contributed to the construction of the city of Huangbaiyu based on C C principles utilising the rooftops for agriculture This project is largely criticized as a failure to meet the desires constraints of the local people br The Ford River Rouge Complex redevelopment cleaning billion US gallons m of rainwater annually br The Netherlands Institute of Ecology NIOO KNAW planned to make its laboratory and office complex completely cradle to cradle compliant br Several private houses and communal buildings in the Netherlands br Fashion Positive an initiative to assist the fashion world in implementing the cradle to cradle model in five areas material health material reuse renewable energy water stewardship and social fairness br br br Coordination with other models br br The cradle to cradle model can be viewed as a framework that considers systems as a whole or holistically It can be applied to many aspects of human society and is related to life cycle assessment See for instance the LCA based model of the eco costs which has been designed to cope with analyses of recycle systems The cradle to cradle model in some implementations is closely linked with the car free movement such as in the case of large scale building projects or the construction or redevelopment of urban environments It is closely linked with passive solar design in the building industry and with permaculture in agriculture within or near urban environments An earthship is a perfect example where different re use models are used including cradle to cradle design and permaculture br br br Constraints br br A major constraint in the optimal recycling of materials is that at civic amenity sites products are not disassembled by hand and have each individual part sorted into a bin but instead have the entire product sorted into a certain bin br This makes the extraction of rare earth elements and other materials uneconomical at recycling sites products typically get crushed after which the materials are extracted by means of magnets chemicals special sorting methods and thus optimal recycling of for example metals is impossible an optimal recycling method for metals would require to sort all similar alloys together rather than mixing plain iron with alloys br Obviously disassembling products is not feasible at currently designed civic amenity sites and a better method would be to send back the broken products to the manufacturer so that the manufacturer can disassemble the product These disassembled product can then be used for making new products or at least to have the components sent separately to recycling sites for proper recycling by the exact type of material At present though few laws are put in place in any country to oblige manufacturers to take back their products for disassembly nor are there even such obligations for manufacturers of cradle to cradle products One process where this is happening is in the EU with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive Also the European Training Network for the Design and Recycling of Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Motors and Generators in Hybrid and Full Electric Vehicles ETN Demeter makes designs of electric motors of which the magnets can be easily removed for recycling the rare earth metals br br br Criticism and response br Criticism has been advanced on the fact that McDonough and Braungart previously kept C C consultancy and certification in their inner circle Critics argued that this lack of competition prevented the model from fulfilling its potential Many critics pleaded for a public private partnership overseeing the C C concept thus enabling competition and growth of practical applications and services br McDonough and Braungart responded to this criticism by giving control of the certification protocol to a non profit independent Institute called the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute McDonough said the new institute will enable our protocol to become a public certification program and global standard The new Institute announced the creation of a Certification Standards Board in June The new board under the auspices of the Institute will oversee the certification moving forward br Experts in the field of environment protection have questioned the practicability of the concept Friedrich Schmidt Bleek head of the German Wuppertal Institute called his assertion that the old environmental movement had hindered innovation with its pessimist approach pseudo psychological humbug Schmidt Bleek said of the Cradle to Cradle seat cushions Braungart developed for the Airbus I can feel very nice on Michael s seat covers in the airplane Nevertheless I am still waiting for a detailed proposal for a design of the other percent of the Airbus after his principles br In Schmidt Bleek stated that it is out of the question that the concept can be realized on a bigger scale br Some claim that C C certification may not be entirely sufficient in all eco design approaches Quantitative methodologies LCAs and more adapted tools regarding the product type which is considered could be used in tandem The C C concept ignores the use phase of a product According to variants of life cycle assessment see Life cycle assessment Variants the entire life cycle of a product or service has to be evaluated not only the material itself For many goods e g in transport the use phase has the most influence on the environmental footprint For example the more lightweight a car or a plane the less fuel it consumes and consequently the less impact it has Braungart fully ignores the use phase br It is safe to say that every production step or resource transformation step needs a certain amount of energy br The C C concept foresees its own certification of its analysis and therefore is in contradiction to international publishing standards ISO and ISO for life cycle assessment whereas an independent external review is needed in order to obtain comparative and resilient
