Systemic design is an interdiscipline that integrates systems thinking and design practices It is a pluralistic field with several dialects including systems oriented design Influences have included critical systems thinking and second order cybernetics In the Design Council UK began advocating for a systemic design approach and embedded it in a revision of their double diamond model br Systemic design is closely related to sustainability as it aims to create solutions that are not only designed to have a good environmental impact but are also socially and economically beneficial In fact from a systemic design approach the system to be designed its context with its relationships and its environment receive synchronous attention Systemic design s discourse has been developed through Relating Systems Thinking and Design a series of symposia held annually since br br br History br br br to br Systems thinking in design has a long history with origins in the design methods movement during the s and s such as the idea of wicked problems developed by Horst Rittel br The theories about complexity help the management of an entire system and the suggested design approaches help the planning of different divergent elements The complexity theories evolved on the basis that living systems continually draw upon external sources of energy and maintain a stable state of low entropy on the basis of the General Systems Theory by Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy Some of the next rationales applied those theories also on artificial systems complexity models of living systems address also productive models with their organizations and management where the relationships between parts are more important than the parts themselves br br br to br Treating productive organizations as complex adaptive systems allows for new management models that address economical social and environmental benefits Pisek and Wilson In that field cluster theory Porter evolved in more environmentally sensitive theories like industrial ecology Frosh and Gallopoulos and industrial symbiosis Chertow Design thinking offers a way to creatively and strategically reconfigure a design concept in a situation with systemic integration Buchanan br In Gunter Pauli and Heitor Gurgulino de Souza founded the research institute Zero Emission Research and Initiatives ZERI starting from the idea that progress should embed respect for the environment and natural techniques that will allow production processes to be part of the ecosystem br Strong interdisciplinary and transdisciplinarity approaches are critical during the design phase Fuller with the increasing involvement of different disciplines including urban planning public policy business management and environmental sciences Chertow et al As an interdiscipline systemic design joins systems thinking and design methodology to support humanity centred and systems oriented design academe and practice Bistagnino Sevaldson Nelson and Stolterman Jones Toso at al br br br to present br Numerous design projects demonstrate systemic design in their approach including diverse topics involving food networks industrial processes and water purification revitalization of internal areas through art and tourism circular economy exhibition and fairs social inclusion and marginalization br Since several scholarly journals have acknowledged systemic design with special publications and in the Systemic Design Association launched Contexts The Journal of Systemic Design The proceedings repository Relating Systems Thinking and
