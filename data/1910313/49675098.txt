A design sprint is a time constrained five phase process that uses design thinking with the aim of reducing the risk when bringing a new product service or a feature to the market The process aims to help teams to clearly define goals validate assumptions and decide on a product roadmap before starting development It seeks to address strategic issues using interdisciplinary expertise rapid prototyping and usability testing This design process is similar to Sprints in an Agile development cycle br br br How it started br There are multiple origins to the concept of mixing Agile and Design Thinking br The most popular was developed by a multi disciplinary team working out of Google Ventures The initial iterations of the approach were created by Jake Knapp and popularised by a series of blog articles outlining the approach and reporting on its successes within Google As it gained industry recognition the approach was further refined and added to by other Google staff including Braden Kowitz Michael Margolis John Zeratsky and Daniel Burka br It was later published in a book published by Google Ventures called Sprint How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days br br br Possible uses br Claimed uses of the approach include br br Launching a new product or a service br Extending an existing experience to a new platform br Existing MVP needing revised User experience design and or UI Design br Adding new features and functionality to a digital product br Opportunities for improvement of a product e g a high rate of cart abandonment br Opportunities for improvement of a service br Supporting organizations in their transformation towards new technologies e g AI br br br Phases br br The creators of the design sprint approach recommend preparation by picking the proper team environment materials and tools working with six key ingredients br br Understand Discover the business opportunity the audience the competition the value proposition and define metrics of success br Diverge Explore develop and iterate creative ways of solving the problem regardless of feasibility br Converge Identify ideas that fit the next product cycle and explore them in further detail through storyboarding br Prototype Design and prepare prototype s that can be tested with people br Test Conduct usability testing with people from the product s primary target audience Ask good questions br br br Deliverables br The main deliverables after the Design sprint br br Answers to a set of vital questions br Findings from the sprint notes user journey maps storyboards information architecture diagrams etc br Prototypes br Report from the usability testing with the findings backed by testing videos br A plan for next steps br Validate or invalidate hypotheses before committing resources to build the solution br br br Team br The suggested ideal number of people involved in the sprint is people and they include the facilitator designer a decision maker often a CEO if the company is a startup product manager engineer and someone from companies core business departments Marketing Content Operations etc br br br Variants br The concept sprint is a fast five day process for cross functional teams to brainstorm define and model new approaches to business issue Another common variant is the Service Design Sprint an approach to Design Sprints created in that uses Service Design tools and mechanics to tackle service innovation br br br
