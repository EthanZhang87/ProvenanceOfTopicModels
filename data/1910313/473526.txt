Video game design is the process of designing the rules and content br of video games in the pre production stage and designing the gameplay environment storyline and characters in the production stage Some common video game design subdisciplines are world design level design system design content design and user interface design Within the video game industry video game design is usually just referred to as game design which is a more general term elsewhere br The video game designer is very much like the director of a film the designer is the visionary of the game and controls the artistic and technical elements of the game in fulfillment of their vision However with very complex games such as MMORPGs or a big budget action or sports title designers may number in the dozens In these cases there are generally one or two principal designers and many junior designers who specify subsets or subsystems of the game As the industry has aged and embraced alternative production methodologies such as agile the role of a principal game designer has begun to separate some studios emphasizing the auteur model while others emphasizing a more team oriented model In larger companies like Electronic Arts each aspect of the game control level design may have a separate producer lead designer and several general designers br Video game design requires artistic and technical competence as well as sometimes including writing skills Historically video game programmers have sometimes comprised the entire design team This is the case of such noted designers as Sid Meier John Romero Chris Sawyer and Will Wright A notable exception to this policy was Coleco which from its very start separated the function of design and programming As video games became more complex computers and consoles became more powerful the job of the game designer became separate from the lead programmer Soon game complexity demanded team members focused on game design Many early veterans chose the game design path eschewing programming and delegating those tasks to others br br br Overview br br Video game design starts with an idea often a modification on an existing concept The game idea will fall within one or several genres Designers often experiment with mixing genres The game designer usually produces an initial game proposal document containing the concept gameplay feature list setting and story target audience requirements and schedule staff and budget estimates br Many decisions are made during the course of a game s development about the game s design it is the responsibility of the designer to decide which elements will be implemented For example consistency with the game s vision budget or hardware limitations Design changes have a significant positive or negative impact on required resources br The designer may use scripting languages to implement and preview design ideas without necessarily modifying the game s codebase A game designer often plays video games and demos to follow the markets development br Over time it has become common for a game designer s name to misleadingly be given an undue amount of association to the game neglecting the rest of the development team This is in stark contrast to the industries origins when creators were often given little to no recognition Coincidentally this lack of credit lead Warren Robinett to create the first Easter egg in a video game br Funding traditionally provided by game publishers who may have specific expectations from a game must be taken into account as most video games are market driven developed to sell for profit However if financial issues do not influence designer s decisions the game becomes design or designer driven few games are designed this way because of lack of funding though it is becoming more common among indie game developers alongside alternative sources of funding Alternatively a game may be technology driven such as Quake to show off a particular hardware achievement or to market the game engine Finally a game may be art driven such as Myst and Journey mainly to show off impressive visuals designed by artists br In Rules of Play Katie Salen and Eric Zimmermann write br br A game designer is a particular kind of designer much like a graphic designer industrial designer or architect A game designer is not necessarily a programmer visual designer or project manager although sometimes he or she can also play these roles in the creation of a game A game designer might work alone or as part of a larger team A game designer might create card games social games video games or any other kind of game The focus of a game designer is designing game play conceiving and designing rules and structures that result in an experience for players br Thus game design as a discipline requires a focus on games in and of themselves Rather than placing games in the service of another field such as sociology literary criticism or computer science our aim is to study games within their own disciplinary space Because game design is an emerging discipline we often borrow from other areas of knowledge from mathematics and cognitive science from semiotics and cultural studies We may not borrow in the most orthodox manner but we do so in the service of helping to establish a field of game design proper br br br Game designer br A game designer is a person who designs gameplay conceiving and designing the rules and structure of a game Many designers start their career in testing departments other roles in game development or in classroom conditions where mistakes by others can be seen first hand br br Lead designer coordinates the work of other designers and is the main visionary of the game Lead designer ensures team communication makes large design decisions and presents design outside of the team Often the lead designer is technically and artistically astute Keeping well presented documentation also falls within the lead designer responsibilities Lead designer may be the founder of a game development company or a promoted employee br Game mechanics designer or systems designer designs and balances the game s rules br Level designer or environment designer is a position becoming prominent in recent years Level designer is the person responsible for creating game environment levels and missions br Planner is a term referring to a game designer in the Japanese video game industry where game designers are typically credited as planners br br br Compensation br In a game designer with more than six years of experience earned an average of US sterling US with three to six years of experience and with less than years of experience Lead designers earned with three to six years of experience and with more than six years of experience In a game designer with less than years of experience earned on average A game designer with more than years of experience made on average The average salary of these designers varies depending on their region As of the salary of experienced workers has shifted to approximately US As of January the average annual pay for a game designer in the United States is a year br br br Disciplines br br br World design br br World design is the creation of a backstory setting and theme for the game often done by a lead designer World design can also be the creation of a universe or a map as well as topics or areas that are likely to be pursued by the player It is a map referenced for creation of everything as it shows where it is and allows for the most logistical design in any given game World design shapes the direction the game goes towards br br br System design br System design is the creation of game rules and underlying mathematical patterns System design is the enacted simulation of a game designed to interact or react with the player The experience a player has with a game is attributed to how the game s system is designed A complex system with depth leads to a more unpredictable strand of events to immerse the player into the video game br br br Content design br Content design is the creation of characters items puzzles missions or any aspect of the game that is not required for it to function properly and meet the minimum viable product standard In essence content is the complexity added to a minimum viable product to increase its value br br br Game writing br br Game writing involves writing dialogue text and story br This is one of the first steps that go into making a video game This encompasses many different elements of the process Writing in video games also includes the elements in which the literature is presented Voice acting text picture editing and music are all elements of game writing br br br Level design br br Level design is the construction of world levels and its features br Level design makes use of many different fields to create a game world Lighting space framing color and contrast are used to draw a player s attention A designer can then use these elements to guide or direct the player in a specific direction through the game world or mislead them br br br User interface design br User interface UI design deals with the construction the user interactions and feedback interface like menus or heads up displays br The user interface also incorporates game mechanics design Deciding how much information to give the player and in what way allows the designer to inform the player about the world or perhaps leave them uninformed Another aspect to consider is the method of input a game will use and deciding to what degree a player can interact with a game with these inputs These choices have a profound effect on the mood of the game as it directly affects the player in both noticeable and subtle ways br User interface design in video games has unique goals A conscious decision has to be made regarding the amount of information to relay to the player However the UI in games do not have to be absolutely streamlined Players expect challenges and are willing to accept them as long as the experience is sufficiently rewarding By the same token navigating or interaction with a game s UI can be satisfying without the need to be effortless br br br Audio design br Audio design involves the process of creating or incorporating all of the sounds that are in the game like music sound effects or voice acting This includes the theme song and jingles used in title screens and menus br br br User experience design br The disciplines listed above all combine to form the discipline of game feel It ensures that the flow of the game and the user interaction with the game elements are functioning smoothly br br br Game elements br br br Narrative br br Numerous games have narrative elements which give a context to an event in a game making the activity of playing it less abstract and enhance its entertainment value although narrative elements are not always clearly present or present at all The original version of Tetris is an example of a game apparently without narrative Some narratologists claim that all games have a narrative element Some go further and claim that games are essentially a form of narrative Narrative in practice can be the starting point for the development of a game or can be added to a design that started as a set of game mechanics br br br Gameplay br br Gameplay is the interactive aspects of video game design Gameplay involves player interaction with the game usually for the purpose of gameplay is entertainment education or training br br br Design process br br br Conceptualization br The design process varies from designer to designer and companies have different formal procedures and philosophies br br The typical textbook approach is to start with a concept or a previously completed game and from there create a game design document This document is intended to map out the complete game design and acts as a central resource for the development team This document should ideally be updated as the game evolves throughout the production process br br br Role Adaptation br Designers are frequently expected to adapt to multiple roles of widely varying nature for example concept prototyping can be assisted with the use of pre existing engines and tools like GameMaker Studio Unity Godot or Construct Level designs might be done first on paper and again for the game engine using a D modeling tool Scripting languages are used for many elements AI cutscenes GUI environmental processes and many other behaviors and effects that designers would want to tune without a programmer s assistance Setting story and character concepts require a research and writing process Designers may oversee focus testing write up art and audio asset lists and write game documentation In addition to the skillset designers are ideally clear communicators with attention to detail and ability to delegate responsibilities appropriately br br br Design Approval br Design approval in the commercial setting is a continuous process from the earliest stages until the game ships br When a new project is being discussed either internally or as a result of dialogue with potential publishers the designer may be asked to write a sell sheet of short concepts followed by a one or two page pitch of specific features audience platform and other details Designers will first meet with leads in other departments to establish agreement on the feasibility of the game given the available time scope and budget If the pitch is approved early milestones focus on the creation of a fleshed out design document Some developers advocate a prototyping phase before the design document is written to experiment with new ideas before they become part of the design br br br Production and Decision Making br As production progresses designers are asked to make frequent decisions about elements missing from the design The consequences of these decisions are hard to predict and often can only be determined after creating the full implementation These are referred to as the unknowns of the design and the faster they are uncovered the less risk the team faces later in the production process Outside factors such as budget cuts or changes in milestone expectations also result in cuts to the design and while overly large cuts can take the heart out of a project cuts can also result in a streamlined design with only the essential features polished well br br br Finalization and Quality Assurance br Towards the end of production designers take the brunt of responsibility for ensuring that the gameplay remains at a uniform standard throughout the game even in very long games This task is made more difficult under crunch conditions as the entire team may begin to lose sight of the core gameplay once pressured to hit a date for a finished and bug free game br br br Game design tools br Traditionally game designers used simple tools like Word Excel or just plain pen and paper As the field has evolved and player agency and localization started to play a bigger role in game development the need for professional tools has emerged for this particular field br Examples of software for narrative design and storytelling include articy draft and Twine Tools like these often help to inform the earliest stages of the design and development process before visual content and software development is started in earnest br There are various kinds of free D design software available to the public from the mainly graphically focussed such as Blender to game engines and software development toolkits such as Unreal Engine and Unity that promote communities that self educate as well as market D models and tutorials for beginners br br br See also br br Game art design br List of video game designers br List of video gaming topics br List of books about video games br First playable
