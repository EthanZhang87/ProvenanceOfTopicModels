Usage centered design is an approach to user interface design based on a focus on user intentions and usage patterns It analyzes users in terms of the roles they play in relation to systems and employs abstract essential use cases for task analysis It derives visual and interaction design from abstract prototypes based on the understanding of user roles and task cases br Usage centered design was introduced by Larry Constantine and Lucy Lockwood The primary reference is their book br br br Usage centered design methods br Usage centered design is largely based on formal abstract models such as models of interaction between user roles UML workflow models and task case and role profiles br Usage centered design proponents argue for abstract modelling while many designers use realistic personas scenarios and high fidelity prototypes The techniques have been applied with particular success in complex software projects some of which have been reported in case studies br br br Usage centered design and activity centered design approach br Usage centered design share some common ideas with activity centered design It is concerned more with the activities of users but not the users per se Constantine presents an integrated framework where the models of Usage centered design are enriched with concepts from the Activity theory br br br br br br Citations br br br Bibliography br Constantine L Activity Modeling Toward a Pragmatic Integration of Activity Theory with Usage Centered Design br Constantine L and Lockwood L Structure and Style in Use Cases for User Interfaces In M van Harmelan Ed Object Modeling and User Interface Design Boston Addison Wesley br Constantine L and Lockwood L Software for Use A Practical Guide to the Essential Models and Methods of Usage Centered Design Reading MA Addison Wesley Russian translation Chinese translation Japanese translation br Constantine L Usage Centered Software Engineering New Models Methods and Metrics In Purvis M ed Software Engineering Education Practice Los Alamitos CA IEEE Computer Society Press br Constantine L Essential Modeling Use Cases for User Interfaces ACM Interactions April br Strope J Designing for Breakthroughs in User Performance In L Constantine ed Performance by Design Proceedings of forUSE the Second International Conference on Usage Centered Design Rowley MA Ampersand Press br Windl H Designing a Winner Creating STEP lite with Usage Centered Design In L Constantine ed forUSE Proceedings of the First International Conference on Usage Centered Design Rowley MA Ampersand Press br br br Further reading br Usage centered design FAQ
