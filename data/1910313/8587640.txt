title: Health (game terminology)
id: 8587640
Health is a video game or tabletop game quality that determines the maximum amount of damage or fatigue something takes before leaving the main game In role playing games this typically takes the form of hit points HP a numerical attribute representing the health of a character or object The game character can be a player character a boss or a mob Health can also be attributed to destructible elements of the game environment or inanimate objects such as vehicles and their individual parts In video games health is often represented by visual elements such as a numerical fraction a health bar or a series of small icons though it may also be represented acoustically such as through a character s heartbeat br br br Mechanics br In video games as in tabletop role playing games an object usually loses health as a result of being attacked Protection points or armor help them to reduce the damage taken Characters acting as tanks usually have more health and armor In many games particularly role playing video games the player starts with a small number of health and defense points but can increase them by gaining the required number of experience points and raising the character s level br In game design it is considered important to clearly show that the player s character or other object that they control is losing health In his book Level Up The Guide to Great Video Game Design game designer Scott Rogers wrote that health should deplete in an obvious manner because with every hit a player is closer to losing their life As examples of visualizing health loss Rogers cited Arthur of Ghosts n Goblins who loses a piece of armor with each sustained hit as well as the cars in the Grand Theft Auto series in which smoke begins to flow from the hood after the car takes a significant amount of damage br The use of health points simplifies the game development process since developers do not need to create complex damage systems allows computers to simplify calculations associated with the game and makes it easier for the player to understand the game However more complex and realistic damage systems are used in a number of games In Dwarf Fortress instead of health points dwarves have separate body parts each of which can be damaged The Fallout games use health points but allow characters to inflict damage to different parts of the enemy s body which affects gameplay For example if a leg is injured the character can get a fracture which will reduce their movement speed and if their arm is injured the character can drop their weapon Health can also serve as a plot element In Assassin s Creed if the protagonist takes too much damage thus departing from the correct route the game ends and returns the player to the nearest checkpoint br In some games such as The Legend of Zelda and Monster Hunter only the player s health points are visible This is done so that the player does not know how many blows still need to be delivered which makes the game less predictable Contrariwise other games such as the Street Fighter series have both the player s and the opponent s health meters clearly visible which allows the player to understand how successful their combat strategy is and how many remaining blows need to be inflicted on the enemy br br br Regeneration br Players can often restore a character s health by using various items such as potions food or first aid kits In role playing video games the player often can also restore a character s health by visiting a doctor or resting at an inn A number of games incorporate a mechanic known as life steal or life leech which allows a character to restore health by siphoning it from an enemy Methods for replenishing health differ from each other and are dependent on the game s genre In more dynamic action games it is important to quickly restore a character s health while role playing games feature slower paced methods of health restoration to achieve realism br A number of games incorporate a regeneration system that automatically replenishes health if the character does not take damage This makes the game easier to play by giving the player the opportunity to restore the character s health after a difficult battle This system may allow the player to safely run through dangerous parts of the game without consequence br Tag team games often regenerate part of the health of a resting character br br br Armor class br In some role playing games armor class abbreviated AC also known as defense is a derived statistic that indicates how difficult it is to land a successful blow on a character with an attack it can also indicate damage reduction to a character s health AC is typically a representation of a character s physical defenses such as their ability to dodge attacks and their protective equipment Armor class is a mechanic that can be used as part of health and combat game balancing AC is roughly equivalent to defensive dodging in war games br br br Presentation br br The health indicator can be represented in various ways The most basic forms are fractions and health bars as well as various icons such as hearts or shields More recent games can use a nonlinear health bar where earlier hits take off more damage than later ones in order to make the game appear more exciting br The indicator can be combined with other elements of the game interface Doom uses a character portrait located at the bottom of the screen as such an indicator in addition to a numerical health percentage display If the hero takes damage his face will appear increasingly pained and blood covered The health point indicator can also be part of the character In Dead Space it is located on the main character s costume In Trespasser it is represented as a tattoo on the main character s chest In Half Life Alyx a VR game the indicator is located on the back of the player s non dominant hand requiring the player to physically look at their tracked hand to check their health The character s condition can be conveyed through sound In Dungeons of Daggorath the frequency of the player character s audible heartbeat is dependent on how much damage has been received Silent Hill uses a similar system but transmits the heartbeat via vibrations from the DualShock controller br The player character s health point indicator often occupies a significant position in the game s heads up display In The Legend of Zelda it occupies one third of the HUD However a number of games do without such an indicator In the Super Mario series the player character initially only has one health point and the character s appearance is used to signify the number of health points if the character collects a Super Mushroom they grow in size and gain an additional health point In a number of first person shooters such as Call of Duty or Halo the numerical value of the character s health points is hidden from the player However when the player character receives a large amount of damage the game screen or the part of the screen to which damage was dealt is painted red often including drops of blood which simulates the effect of real life injury As health is restored these effects gradually disappear br br br History br br br Hit points br The term hit points was coined by Dungeons Dragons co creator Dave Arneson While developing the tabletop role playing game Dungeons Dragons with Gary Gygax based on the latter s previous game Chainmail Arneson felt that it was more interesting for players to manage small squads than a large army This also allowed them to act out the role of each squad member However this approach had one drawback according to the rules of Chainmail the player rolls the dice during each battle and depending on the number rolled the character either kills the enemy or is killed Because players did not want to lose the characters they had become accustomed to Arneson created a hit point system based on similar mechanics previously used in the wargames Don t Give Up the Ship and Ironclads According to this system each character has a certain number of hit points which decreases with each blow dealt to them This allows the character to survive several hits from an enemy br Some of the first home computer games to use hit points are Rogue in which health is represented by a fraction and Dungeons of Daggorath which includes an audible heartbeat influenced by the player character s condition Action games also began moving away from one hit deaths to health systems allowing players to take multiple hits such as SNK s arcade shoot em up game Ozma Wars numerically representing an energy supply that depletes when taking hits and Mattel s Intellivision game Tron Deadly Discs allowing players to take multiple hits at the cost of reducing maneuverability br br br Health meter br br Before the introduction of health meters action video games typically used a lives system in which the player could only take damage once but could continue the game at the expense of a life The introduction of health meters granted players the right to make mistakes and allowed game developers to influence a game s difficulty by adjusting the damage an enemy character inflicts br Data East s Flash Boy for the arcade DECO Cassette System a scrolling action game based on the manga and anime series Astro Boy has an energy bar that gradually depletes over time and some of which can be sacrificed for temporary invincibility Punch Out an arcade boxing game developed by Nintendo has a stamina meter that replenishes every time the player successfully strikes the opponent and decreases if the player fails to dodge the opponent s blow if the meter is fully depleted the player character loses consciousness br Yie Ar Kung Fu an arcade fighting game developed by Konami replaced the point scoring system of Karate Champ with a health meter system Each fighter has a health meter which depletes as they take hits once a fighter s health meter is fully depleted it leads to a knockout Yie Ar Kung Fu established health meters as a standard feature in fighting games Kung Fu Master an arcade beat em up developed by Irem uses a health meter to represent player health with the bar depleting when taking damage In addition to the player character having a health meter the bosses also have health meters which leads to the game temporarily becoming a one on one fighting game during boss battles Kung Fu Master established health meters as a standard feature in side scrolling action games such as beat em ups br Health meters also began being used to represent hit points in role playing video games starting with The Black Onyx developed by Bullet Proof Software This inspired the use of a health bar in Hydlide an action role playing game by T E Soft which took it a step further with a regenerating health bar Namco s arcade action role playing title Dragon Buster further popularized the use of a health bar in role playing games br br br Regeneration br The Apple II platform game Crisis Mountain displays health as a number from full to dead and health gradually regenerates over time In Hydlide and the Ys series the character s health represented as both hit points and a health meter are restored when the character does not move Halo Combat Evolved is credited with popularizing the use of regeneration in first person shooters However according to GamesRadar s Jeff Dunn regeneration in its current form was introduced in The Getaway as Halo Combat Evolved only used shield regeneration br br br Defense br Arneson is also credited for the term armor class which was used in Chainmail and then Dungeons Dragons although armor class might have been inspired by the rules in Don t Give Up the Ship there is not an explicit attribute with that name in the game s rules It seems more likely that Arneson s house rules for armor class never made it into the final published version of the wargame However many role playing games that followed Dungeons Dragons moved away from the term armor class and simply replaced the term with defense br br br See also br Magic game
