Boiler design is the process of designing boilers used for various purposes The main function of a boiler is to heat water to generate steam Steam produced in a boiler can be used for a variety of purposes including space heating sterilisation drying humidification and power generation The temperature or condition of steam required for these applications is different so boiler designs vary accordingly br br br Modern design benefits br br Modern boiler design offers several benefits In the past improper design of boilers has caused explosions which led to loss of life and property Modern designs attempt to avoid such mishaps Further mathematical modeling can determine how much space a boiler will need and the type of materials to be used When the design specifications of a boiler are determined design engineers can estimate a cost and time schedule for the construction br Boiler design may be based upon br br Production of a maximum quantity of steam with minimal fuel consumption br Economic feasibility of installation br Minimal operator attention required during operation br Capability for quick starting br Conformity to safety regulations br Quality of raw water how hard or soft the water is will determine the material of the boiler br Heat source the fuel to be burned and its ash properties or the process material from which the heat is to be recovered br Capacity steam output required usually measured in tonnes per hour or kg s br Steam condition pressure temperature etc br Safety considerations br Mechanical constraints br Cost restrictions br Monetary cost br Tensile strength of material must be considered while using any joining processes br Accessories and mountings are devices which form an integral part of boiler but are not mounted on it They include economizers superheaters feed pumps and air pre heaters Accessories help in controlling and running the boiler efficiently Certain common mountings specifically those required by the Indian Boiler Act include br br Feed check valve regulates the flow of water into the boiler and prevents the back flow of water in case of failure of the feed pump br Steam stop valve regulates the flow of steam that is produced in the boiler to the steam pipe and may also be used to stop the supply of steam from the boiler br Fusible plug placed at the lowest level of water and above the combustion chamber its function is to extinguish the fire as soon as the water level in the shell of the boiler falls below a certain marked level br Blow off cock removes water from the shell at regular intervals to remove the various impurities that may be settled at the bottom of the shell br Safety valves automatically prevent the steam pressure from exceeding safe levels br Water level indicators indicate the level of water in the shell br br br br br br Bibliography br Malek Mohammad A Power boiler design inspection and repair ASME code simplified McGraw Hill ISBN br Stromeyer C E Marine boiler management and construction Longmans Green and Co br Outdoor wood fired boiler
