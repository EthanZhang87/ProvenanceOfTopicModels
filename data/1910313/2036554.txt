title: Design for X
id: 2036554
Design for excellence DfX or DFX is a term and abbreviation used interchangeably in the existing literature where the X in design for X is a variable which can have one of many possible values In many fields e g very large scale integration VLSI and nanoelectronics X may represent several traits or features including manufacturability power variability cost yield or reliability This gives rise to the terms design for manufacturability DfM DFM design for inspection DFI design for variability DfV design for cost DfC Similarly other disciplines may associate other traits attributes or objectives for X br Under the label design for X a wide set of specific design guidelines are summarized Each design guideline addresses a given issue that is caused by or affects the traits of a product The design guidelines usually propose an approach and corresponding methods that may help to generate and apply technical knowledge to control improve or even invent particular traits of a product From a knowledge based view the design guideline represents an explicit form of knowledge that contains information about knowing how to see Procedural knowledge However two problems are prevalent First this explicit knowledge i e the design guidelines were transformed from a tacit form of knowledge i e by experienced engineers or other specialists Thus it is not granted that a freshman or someone who is outside the subject area will comprehend this generated explicit knowledge This is because it still contains embedded fractions of knowledge or respectively include non obvious assumptions also called context dependency see e g Doz and Santos Second the traits of a product are likely to exceed the knowledge base of one human There exists a wide range of specialized fields of engineering and considering the whole life cycle of a product will require non engineering expertise For this purpose examples of design guidelines are listed in the following br br br Rules guidelines and methodologies along the product life cycle br DfX methodologies address different issues that may occur in one or more phase of a product life cycle br br Development phase br Production phase br Use phase br Disposal phase br Each phase is explained with two dichotomous categories of tangible products to show differences in prioritizing design issues in certain product life cycle phases br br Consumer durables br Capital goods br Non durables that are consumed physically when used e g chocolate or lubricants are not discussed There also exist a wide range of other classifications because products are either a goods b service or c both see OECD and Eurostat Thus one can also refer to whole product augmented product or extended product Also the business unit strategy of a firm are ignored even though it significantly influences priority setting in design br br br Development phase br Design rules br Basic rules of embodiment design clarity simplicity safety Pahl and Beitz br

assemblies Bralla br Design for low quantity production Bralla br br br Design rules br Design to cost and design to standards serves cost reduction in production operations or respectively supply chain operations Except for luxury goods or brands e g Swarovski crystals Haute couture fashion etc most goods even exclusive products rely on cost reduction if these are mass produced The same is valid for the functional production strategy of mass customization Through engineering design physical interfaces between a parts or components or assemblies of the product and b the manufacturing equipment and the logistical material flow systems can be changed and thus cost reducing effects in operating the latter may be achieved br br br Design guidelines br Design for manufacturability ensures the fabrication of single parts or components that are based on an integral design in mechanical engineering terms Every production technology has its own specific design guideline that needs to be consulted depending on the situation br Design for assembly addresses the combination of single parts or components to subassemblies assemblies modules systems etc that are based on a differential design in mechanical engineering terms An important issue is how the embodied interfaces within a product are designed mechanical engineering electrical engineering Contrary software or respectively firmware interfaces software engineering electrical engineering are not significant for assembly operations because these can be easily flash installed within one production step That is a cost efficient way to enable a wide range of product variants br Design for logistics covers issues along supply chain partners i e legally independent firms but is by its means closely related to the design for assembly guidelines In academic research design for logistics is tangent to the strategic alliances supply chain management and the engineering part of new product development For example Sanchez and Mahoney argued that product modularity i e how physical sub systems of a product are sub divided through interfaces also called product or system architecture and organizational modularity i e how organisational entities are structured depend on each other Fixson et al found that the relationship between product architecture and organisational structure is reciprocal in the contexts of early supplier involvement during system design and the concept phase of the product development process br br br Use phase br User focused see Product design Industrial design br Design

br br br Comparison consumer durables vs capital goods br User focused design guidelines may be associated with consumer durables and after sales focused design guidelines may be more important for capital goods However in case of capital goods design for ergonomics is needed to ensure clarity simplicity and safety between the human machine interface The intent is to avoid shop accidents as well as to ensure efficient work flows Also design for aesthetics has become more and more important for capital goods in recent years In business to business B B markets capital goods are usually ordered or respectively business transaction are initiated at industrial trade fairs The functional traits of capital goods in technical terms are assumed generally as fulfilled across all exhibiting competitors Therefore a purchaser may be subliminally influenced by the aesthetics of a capital good when it comes to a purchasing decision For consumer durables the aspect of after sales highly depends on the business unit s strategy in terms of service offerings therefore generally statements are not possible to formulate br br br Disposal phase br Design for Environment Bralla see also

level organisation concurrent engineering American simultaneous engineering British and overlapping parallel product development processes br Micro level organisation cross functional teams inter disciplinary teams etc br Looking at all life stages of a product product life cycle engineering is essential for design for X otherwise the X may be suboptimized or make no sense When asking what competencies are required for analysing situations that may occur along the life of a product it becomes clear that several departmental functions are required An historical assumption is that new product development is conducted in a departmental stage process that can be traced back to the classical theory of the firm e g Max Weber s bureaucracy or Henri Fayol s administration principles i e new product development activities are closely associated with certain department of a firm At the start of the s the concept of concurrent engineering gained popularity to overcome dysfunctions of departmental stage processes Concurrent engineering postulates that several departments must work closely together for certain new product development activities see Clark and Fujimoto The logical consequence was the emergence of the organisational mechanism of cross functional teams For example Filippini et al found evidence that overlapping product development processes only accelerate new product development projects if these are executed by a cross functional team vice versa br br br br br Design for X references br br Pahl G and Beitz W Engineering Design A Systematic Approach nd
