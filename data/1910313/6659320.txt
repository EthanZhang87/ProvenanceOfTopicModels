title: Design computing
id: 6659320
The terms design computing and other relevant terms including design and computation and computational design refer to the study and practice of design activities through the application and development of novel ideas and techniques in computing One of the early groups to coin this term was the Key Centre of Design Computing and Cognition at the University of Sydney in Australia which for nearly fifty years late s to today pioneered the research teaching and consulting of design and computational technologies This group organised the academic conference series Artificial Intelligence in Design AID published by Springer during that period AID was later renamed Design Computing and Cognition DCC and is currently a leading biannual conference in the field Other notable groups in this area are the Design and Computation group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology s School of Architecture Planning and the Computational Design group at Georgia Tech br Whilst these terms share in general an interest in computational technologies and design activity there are important differences in the various approaches theories and applications For example while in some circles the term computational design refers in general to the creation of new computational tools and methods in the context of computational thinking design computing is concerned with bridging these two fields in order to build an increased understanding of design br The Bachelor of Design Computing BDesComp was created in at the University of Sydney and continues to be a leading programme in interaction design and creative technologies now hosted by the Design Lab In that context design computing is defined to be the use and development of computational models of design processes and digital media to assist and or automate various aspects of the design process with the goal of producing higher quality and new design forms br br br Areas br In recent years a number of research and education areas have been grouped under the umbrella term design computing namely br br Artificial intelligence in design br Expert systems and knowledge based systems br Computational creativity br Computer aided design br Responsive computer aided design br Digital architecture br Digital morphogenesis br Visual and spatial modelling br Computational analogy br Automated design systems br Design support systems br Computer supported cooperative work CSCW br Building information modeling BIM br Extended reality XR and spatial computing br Digital place making br br br Research groups br The main research groups working in this area span from Faculties of Architecture Engineering and Computer Science Australia has been a pioneer in this area For the last five decades the Key Centre of Design Computing and Cognition KCDC currently known as the Design Lab at the University of Sydney has been active in establishing this area of research and teaching The University of Sydney offers a Bachelor of Design Computing and the University of New South Wales also in Sydney a Bachelor of Computational Design In the US this research area is also known as Design and Computation namely at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Other relevant research groups include br br Critical Research in Digital Architecture CRIDA Faculty of Architecture Building and Planning University of Melbourne br School of Architecture Carnegie Mellon br Department of Computer Science University College London br Department of Informatics Engineering Universidade de Coimbra br Department of
