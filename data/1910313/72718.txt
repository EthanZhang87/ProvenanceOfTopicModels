id: 72718
A prototype is an early sample model or release of a product built to test a concept or process It is a term used in a variety of contexts including semantics design electronics and software programming A prototype is generally used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real working system rather than a theoretical one Physical prototyping has a long history and paper prototyping and virtual prototyping now extensively complement it In some design workflow models creating a prototype a process sometimes called materialization is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea br A prototype can also mean a typical example of something such as in the use of the derivation prototypical This is a useful term in identifying objects behaviours and concepts which are considered the accepted norm and is analogous with terms such as stereotypes and archetypes br The word prototype derives from the Greek prototypon primitive form neutral of prototypos original primitive from protos first and typos impression originally in the sense of a mark left by a blow then by a stamp struck by a die note typewriter by implication a scar or mark by analogy a shape i e a statue figuratively style or resemblance a model for imitation or illustrative example note typical br br br Types br Prototypes explore different aspects of an intended design br br A proof of principle prototype serves to verify some key functional aspects of the intended design but usually does not have all the functionality of the final product br A working prototype represents all or nearly all of the functionality of the final product br A visual prototype represents the size and appearance but not the functionality of the intended design A form study prototype is a preliminary type of visual prototype in which the geometric features of a design are emphasized with less concern for color texture or other aspects of the final appearance br A user experience prototype represents enough of the appearance and function of the product that it can be used for user research br A functional prototype captures both function and appearance of the intended design though it may be created with different techniques and even different scale from final design br A paper prototype is a printed or hand drawn representation of the user interface of a software product Such prototypes are commonly used for early testing of a software design and can be part of a software walkthrough to confirm design decisions before more costly levels of design effort are expended br br br Differences in creating a prototype vs a final product br br In general the creation of prototypes will differ from creation of the final product in some fundamental ways br br Material The materials that will be used in a final product may be expensive or difficult to fabricate so prototypes may be made from different materials than the final product In some cases the final production materials may still be undergoing development themselves and not yet available for use in a prototype br Process Mass production processes are often unsuitable for making a small number of parts so prototypes may be made using different fabrication processes than the final product For example a final product that will be made by plastic injection molding will require expensive custom tooling so a prototype for this product may be fabricated by machining or stereolithography instead Differences in fabrication process may lead to differences in the appearance of the prototype as compared to the final product br Verification The final product may be subject to a number of quality assurance tests to verify conformance with drawings or specifications These tests may involve custom inspection fixtures statistical sampling methods and other techniques appropriate for ongoing production of a large quantity of the final product Prototypes are generally made with much closer individual inspection and the assumption that some adjustment or rework will be part of the fabrication process Prototypes may also be exempted from some requirements that will apply to the final product br Engineers and prototype specialists attempt to minimize the impact of these differences on the intended role for the prototype For example if a visual prototype is not able to use the same materials as the final product they will attempt to substitute materials with properties that closely simulate the intended final materials br br br Characteristics and limitations of prototypes br br Engineers and prototyping specialists seek to understand the limitations of prototypes to exactly simulate the characteristics of their intended design br It is important to recognize that by their very nature prototypes represent some compromise from the final production design This is due to not just the skill and choices of the designer s but the inevitable inherent limitations of a prototype due to the map territory relation Just as a map is a reduced abstraction representing far more detailed actual territory or the menu represents the meal but cannot capture all the detail of the actual delivered food a prototype is a necessarily inexact and limited approximation of a real final product br Further prototypers make both deliberate and unintended choices and tradeoffs for reasons ranging from cost time savings to what they consider important vs trivial aspects to focus design attention and execution on Due to differences in materials processes and design fidelity it is possible that a prototype may fail to perform acceptably although the production design may have been sound Conversely and somewhat counter intuitively prototypes may actually perform acceptably but the production design and outcome may prove unsuccessful as prototyping materials and processes may actually outperform their production counterparts br In general it can be expected that individual prototype costs will be substantially greater than the final production costs due to inefficiencies in materials and processes Prototypes are also used to revise the design for the purposes of reducing costs through optimization and refinement br It is possible to use prototype testing to reduce the risk that a design may not perform as intended however prototypes generally cannot eliminate all risk There are pragmatic and practical limitations to the ability of a prototype to match the intended final performance of the product and some allowances and engineering judgement are often required before moving forward with a production design br Building the full design is often expensive and can be time consuming especially when repeated several times building the full design figuring out what the problems are and how to solve them then building another full design As an alternative rapid prototyping or rapid application development techniques are used for the initial prototypes which implement part but not all of the complete design This allows designers and manufacturers to rapidly and inexpensively test the parts of the design that are most likely to have problems solve those problems and then build the full design br This counter intuitive idea that the quickest way to build something is first to build something else is shared by scaffolding and Thomson s telescope rule br br br Engineering sciences br In technology research a technology demonstrator is a prototype serving as proof of concept and demonstration model for a new technology or future product proving its viability and illustrating conceivable applications br In large development projects a testbed is a platform and prototype development environment for rigorous experimentation and testing of new technologies components scientific theories and computational tools br With recent advances in computer modeling it is becoming practical to eliminate the creation of a physical prototype except possibly at greatly reduced scales for promotional purposes instead modeling all aspects of the final product as a computer model An example of such a development can be seen in Boeing Dreamliner in which the first full sized physical realization is made on the series production line Computer modeling is now being extensively used in automotive design both for form in the styling and aerodynamics of the vehicle and in function especially for improving vehicle crashworthiness and in weight reduction to improve mileage br br br Mechanical and electrical engineering br The most common use of the word prototype is a functional although experimental version of a non military machine e g automobiles domestic appliances consumer electronics whose designers would like to have built by mass production means as opposed to a mockup which is an inert representation of a machine s appearance often made of some non durable substance br An electronics designer often builds the first prototype from breadboard or stripboard or perfboard typically using DIP packages br However more and more often the first functional prototype is built on a prototype PCB almost identical to the production PCB as PCB manufacturing prices fall and as many components are not available in DIP packages but only available in SMT packages optimized for placing on a PCB br Builders of military machines and aviation prefer the terms experimental and service test br br br Electronics br br br Computer programming and computer science br br Prototype software is often referred to as alpha grade meaning it is the first version to run Often only a few functions are implemented the primary focus of the alpha is to have a functional base code on to which features may be added Once alpha grade software has most of the required features integrated into it it becomes beta software for testing of the entire software and to adjust the program to respond correctly during situations unforeseen during development br Often the end users may not be able to provide a complete set of application objectives detailed input processing or output requirements in the initial stage After the user evaluation another prototype will be built based on feedback from users and again the cycle returns to customer evaluation The cycle starts by listening to the user followed by building or revising a mock up and letting the user test the mock up then back There is now a new generation of tools called Application Simulation Software which help quickly simulate application before their development br Extreme programming uses iterative design to gradually add one feature at a time to the initial prototype br br br Other programming computing concepts br In many programming languages a function prototype is the declaration of a subroutine or function and should not be confused with software prototyping This term is rather C C specific other terms for this notion are signature type and interface In prototype based programming a form of object oriented programming new objects are produced by cloning existing objects which are called prototypes br The term may also refer to the Prototype Javascript Framework br Additionally the term may refer to the prototype design pattern br Continuous learning approaches within organizations or businesses may also use the concept of business or process prototypes through software models br The concept of prototypicality is used to describe how much a website deviates from the expected norm and leads to a lowering of user preference for that site s design br br br Data prototyping br A data prototype is a form of functional or working prototype The justification for its creation is usually a data migration data integration or application implementation project and the raw materials used as input are an instance of all the relevant data which exists at the start of the project br The objectives of data prototyping are to produce br br A set of data cleansing and transformation rules which have been seen to produce data which is all fit for purpose br A dataset which is the result of those rules being applied to an instance of the relevant raw source data br To achieve this a data architect uses a graphical interface to interactively develop and execute transformation and cleansing rules using raw data The resultant data is then evaluated and the rules refined Beyond the obvious visual checking of the data on screen by the data architect the usual evaluation and validation approaches are to use Data profiling software and then to insert the resultant data into a test version of the target application and trial its use br br br Prototyping for Human Computer Interaction br When developing software or digital tools that humans interact with a prototype is an artifact that is used to ask and answer a design question Prototypes provide the means for examining design problems and evaluating solutions br HCI practitioners can employ several different types of prototypes br br Wizard of Oz prototype named after the Wizard of Oz in the film The Wizard of Oz This is a prototyping method with which the computer side of the interaction is faked by an offsite or hidden human This prototyping technique is particularly useful for demonstrating functionality that is difficult or lengthy to engineer such as applications like voice user interface br role prototype this prototype may not be engineered or look and feel like a finished product but the purpose of this type of prototype is to investigate and evaluation a user need or what the prototype could do for the user They can present features and functionality that the user might benefit from to demonstrate what role an artifact like the prototype might fulfill for the user A famous example of this kind of prototype would be the block of wood carried by Jeff Hawkins when developing the Palm Pilot br paper prototype this prototype may use cut paper cardboard or other inexpensive materials to demonstrate an interface The purpose of this prototype is to test with users without having to use a digital tool or develop a program to test functionality Recently paper prototyping has fallen out of favor within certain design circles particularly because the low fidelity nature of this method and the lack of effectiveness when testing with users br br br Scale modeling br br In the field of scale modeling which includes model railroading vehicle modeling airplane modeling military modeling etc a prototype is the real world basis or source for a scale model such as the real EMD GP locomotive which is the prototype of Athearn s among other manufacturers locomotive model Technically any non living object can serve as a prototype for a model including structures equipment and appliances and so on but generally prototypes have come to mean full size real world vehicles including automobiles the prototype Chevy has spawned many models military equipment such as M Shermans a favorite among US Military modelers railroad equipment motor trucks motorcycles and space ships real world such as Apollo Saturn Vs or the ISS br As of basic rapid prototype machines such as D printers cost about but larger and more precise machines can cost as much as br br br Architecture br In architecture prototyping refers to either architectural model making as form of scale modelling or as part of aesthetic or material experimentation such as the Forty Wall House open source material prototyping centre in Australia br Architects prototype to test ideas structurally aesthetically and technically Whether the prototype works or not is not the primary focus architectural prototyping is the revelatory process through which the architect gains insight br br br Metrology br In the science and practice of metrology a prototype is a human made object that is used as the standard of measurement of some physical quantity to base all measurement of that physical quantity against Sometimes this standard object is called an artifact In the International System of Units SI there remains no prototype standard since May Before that date the last prototype used was the international prototype of the kilogram a solid platinum iridium cylinder kept at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures International Bureau of Weights and Measures in S vres France a suburb of Paris that by definition was the mass of exactly one kilogram Copies of this prototype are fashioned and issued to many nations to represent the national standard of the kilogram and are periodically compared to the Paris prototype Now the kilogram is redefined in such a way that the Planck constant h is prescribed a value of exactly joule second J s br Until the meter was defined by a platinum iridium prototype bar with two marks on it that were by definition spaced apart by one meter the international prototype of the metre and in the meter was redefined to be the distance in free space covered by light in of a second thus defining the speed of light to be meters per second br br br Natural sciences br In many sciences from pathology to taxonomy prototype refers to a disease species etc which sets a good example for the whole category In biology prototype is the ancestral or primitive form of a species or other group an archetype For example the Senegal bichir is regarded as the prototypes of its genus Polypterus br br br See also br
