Icon design the process of designing a graphic symbol that represents some real fantasy or abstract motive entity or action In the context of software applications an icon often represents a program a function data or a collection of data on a computer system br br br Style and usage br Icon designs can be simple with flat two dimensional drawing or a black silhouette or complex presenting a combination of graphic design elements such as one or more linear and radial color gradients projected shadows contour shades and three dimensional perspective effects br br br Sizing br As computer icons can be used in different sizes icon design involves creating master artwork usually for the biggest size used and producing smaller sizes from it It is desirable to comply with overall style of the icon set using the same color palette perspective and renderings for all icons Special attention is given to eliminating unnecessary details and aligning strokes and objects to pixels in small icon sizes to avoid messy and blurred images br Many modern icons have a maximum size of by pixels or greater The challenge of icon design is to create an image that is communicative beautiful and understandable at every size from this maximum resolution down to the minimum resolution of by pixels Many icon formats allow one icon to include hinting to ensure visual clarity at smaller resolutions or even completely different subsidiary images for smaller sizes for instance a keyboard at larger sizes and a single keycap at smaller ones br br br Usage br The most common and important examples are application icons used to represent an app on Mac Windows Linux or mobile platforms These icons rely on unique and memorable metaphors as a form of product branding Other common uses include favicons toolbar icons and icons for buttons or controls br br br Process br br The process of icon design can be divided into two parts defining the pictogram and creating final design or illustration br br br Defining pictograms br There are three main approaches in defining pictograms br br The first and the most desirable in icon design practice is using conventional images br If there is no conventional pictogram for the particular icon a designer can use a literal image including an image that is shared by the main concept for example printer is shared image for printing concept or metaphorical image br After the pictogram is defined it is necessary to check it for possible conflicts for example the snail image is a good metaphor for slow motion but if used as a road sign it will conflict with literal and partially conventional meaning snails on the road br Defining the pictogram can be different for the toolbar and other functional icons in the interface and for the icons representing independent software applications or websites which are closer to logotype or mascot design br br br Notable icon designers br br Susan Kare one of the early professional icon designers designed many of the icons contained within the Classic Mac OS br Jon Hicks created the icon for the Firefox Browser and the emoticons for Skype He s also the author of the Icon Handbook br br br See also br Icon computing Icon creation br Skeuomorph br Iconfinder br The Noun Project br br br br br br External links br iOS Human Interface Guidelines App Icon br macOS Human Interface Guidelines Designing App Icons br Microsoft Design Language Icons br Microsoft Icon guidelines for UWP apps br Microsoft guidelines on designing Windows Aero Icons br Microsoft guidelines on designing Windows XP icons br Android guidelines on icon design br Icons at Curlie
