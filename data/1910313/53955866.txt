title: Intellectual property protection of video games
id: 53955866
The protection of intellectual property IP of video games through copyright patents and trademarks shares similar issues with the copyrightability of software as a relatively new area of IP law The video game industry itself is built on the nature of reusing game concepts from prior games to create new gameplay styles but bounded by illegally direct cloning of existing games and has made defining intellectual property protections difficult since it is not a fixed medium br br br Issues related to intellectual property protection in video games br br br Game creation br There are multiple aspects about video game creation that have led to different components of the software being copyrighted separately some cannot be copyrighted at all because of their existence in the public domain or Creative Commons br Jia Wang deputy director of the Technology Service Center at Tencent s office in Palo Alto California USA recently told WIPO Magazine that a game is both a creative and a technical product and IP protects both aspects There s a lot of IP involved in the games we develop from the technical mechanisms that enable and enrich the user s experience to the storyline and the heroes we create br br br Common assets br There is a plethora of websites which allow creators to borrow assets to implement in game The model of granting access and permission to use these assets differs across websites and may range from an upfront payment to a portion of profits if the assets are used commercially This is not an issue with large video game publishers such as EA Activision or Sony but when these self contained companies create large and detailed worlds most of the assets they create end up being used only once This limits the public pool of resources assets Assets will often have to be recreated in order to create a new game or sequel by another company or creator which is a common complaint of game developers as it usually costs large amounts of money to create commercially viable assets and makes it difficult for smaller developers to produce games br br br Game engines br A game engine is a framework which a developer can use to create games They consist of a software suite with a multitude of components such as a rendering engine audio engine physics engine and artificial intelligence Companies create these engines for the purpose of allowing developers with or without charge to create games However because of limitations or certain peculiarities of an engine some designs or passive background tasks may occur in a particular way for every game made using that engine This particular feature regardless of how central it may be to a game is essentially the same in all games created with that engine which takes it outside the scope of copyright This reasoning would also apply to games made with the same engine which share source code this would not constitute copying because the games similarity is inherent to the tools Large video game houses publishers can sidestep this limitation by developing in house engines br br br Producers developers relation br Classically publishers had the role of securing or providing funding for a game as well as bearing the losses and in many cases marketing the game These expenses were generally large and could run as high as tens of millions of dollars for AAA titles But with the advent of the Internet and the rise of indie culture a new wave of financing and distribution technologies has emerged Sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow for interested consumers to directly contribute towards game development by purchasing the game in advance Digital distributors like Steam and GOG com removed the costly need for the manufacture and distribution of physical game discs These innovations have allowed the industry to move away from the standard of intellectual property rights resting with the publisher instead of the developers as the IP rights that typically vested with publishers may now be shared with a publisher or owned by a developer or an investment vehicle br br br Music creators voice actors and other contributors br Contributions that do not add directly to the code of the game would not be protected by copyrights for literary works but these components could be covered if an audiovisual copyright is taken out As for authorship rights most contributors are employees and hence their work would be considered work for hire belonging not to them but to their employer Music is generally not created in house by game developers since third parties are hired this may not result in a work for hire See U S court case CCNV v Reid on the principle work for hire br br br Gameplay br br br Hardware limitations br Some copyrightable elements of a game may be created due to hardware limitations For example the classic game Space Invaders as originally played as an arcade game got faster as the player killed more of the onscreen aliens which freed up system resources br br br User input br User input is an essential component of video games which are interactive media Though this may not change the intellectual property rights in the base code of the game some developers publishers may restrict the rights of players to broadcast their playthrough of the game The arguments from the other side are that the output of a game is coming in a particular way due to user input and this can reasonably give a player some restricted rights in his her play through also known as a Let s Play br br br Copyright br Copyright is a protection of intellectual property that give exclusive right to the author s of a creative work A video game may be protected as a creative work Whether or not a work is copyrighted and the duration of the copyright may differ between countries and may also be limited by country specific exceptions like the fair use doctrine in the United States br br br International standard br The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works The Berne Convention of is the international treaty which provides the scope for copyright protection of video games This protection can be drawn from the wide definition of Literary and Artistic Work in Article of the Convention which reads br br The expression literary and artistic works shall include every production in the literary scientific and artistic domain whatever may be the mode or form of its expression such as books pamphlets and other writings lectures addresses sermons and other works of the same nature dramatic or dramatico musical works choreographic works and entertainments in dumb show musical compositions with or without words cinematographic works to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography works of drawing painting architecture sculpture engraving and lithography photographic works to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography works of applied art illustrations maps plans sketches and three dimensional works relative to geography topography architecture or science br This standard treats the whole game as a singular component but does not define what would be covered by such a protection and what would be excluded The World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO had recognized the complexity inherent in copyrighting video games saying Although Article of the Berne Convention provides a solid basis for eligibility for protection of video games by copyright they are in fact complex works of authorship potentially composed of multiple copyrighted works WIPO has also stated in one of its reports that there is no clear classification of video games and their protection will vary depending on each particular game and the elements that are part of it In this sense video games can be treated as computer programs and thus are classified as works of authorship in that case the source code for a video game is classified as a literary work If pictorial or graphic authorship predominates a video game may be classified as a visual arts work Similarly if motion picture or audiovisual authorship predominates a video game may be classified as a motion picture audiovisual work br br br National standards br WIPO has written the following about copyright protection in different countries and jurisdictions For some countries video games are predominantly computer programs due to the specific nature of the works and their dependency on software Whereas in other jurisdictions the complexity of video games implies that they are given a distributive classification Finally few countries consider that video games are essentially audiovisual works br br br United States br The Copyright Act of codified at U S C enumerates the requirements of a copyright in the US but does not use the term For a work to be copyrightable under the Copyright Act it must meet the threshold of originality be fixed in a medium whether analog or digital and the work must be perceivable and reproducible Regarding copyrights for video games the US Copyright office has stated that a single registration may be made for a computer program and its screen displays and when answering the Type of work being registered question on the application form the copyright holder shall choose the type most appropriate to the predominant authorship br In other words US law does not specify a certain protection to be given to a game The individual s registering the game or their attorneys must ascertain which category best protect the interests of the author assignee br br br In the United States the underlying source code and the game s artistic elements including art music and dialog can be protected by copyright law However gameplay elements of a video game are generally ineligible for copyright gameplay concepts fall into the idea expression distinction that had been codified in the Copyright Act of in that copyright cannot be used to protect ideas but only the expression of those ideas The United States Copyright Office specifically notes Copyright does not protect the idea for a game its name or title or the method or methods for playing it Nor does copyright protect any idea system method device or trademark material involved in developing merchandising or playing a game Once a game has been made public nothing in the copyright law prevents others from developing another game based on similar principles Courts also consider sc nes faire French for scenes that must be done for a particular genre as uncopyrightable games involving vampires for example would be expected to have elements of the vampire drinking blood and driving a stake through the vampire s heart to kill him It is generally recognized in the video game industry that borrowing mechanics from other games is common practice and often a boon for creating new games and their widespread use would make them ineligible for legal copyright or patent protection br The United States passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA in as part of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty Broadly the DMCA prohibits hardware and software anti circumvention tools such as reading an encrypted optical disc For both video game hardware manufacturers and for software developers and publishers this helps to protect their work from being copied disassembled and reincorporated into a clone However the DMCA has been problematic for those in video game preservation that wish to store older games on more permanent and modern systems As part of the DMCA the Library of Congress adds various exemptions which have included the use of anti circumvention for museum archival purposes for example br In present day case law driven by decisions in the United States legal system video game copyrights come from two forms The first is by its source code or equivalent as determined by the decision in Apple Computer Inc v Franklin Computer Corp that software code can be considered a literary work and thus subject to copyright protection The second form is as an audiovisual work as determined in the case Stern Electronics Inc v Kaufman while video games present images and sound that are not in a fixed form the repetitive use of these in a systematic response to player s actions was sufficient for copyright protections as audiovisual works In the case of the earlier hardware before programmable computer chips copyright was also recognized by the impression of software based on the circuit board patterns and features that made games work as a form of fixation as established by both Stern and the case Midway Mfg Co v Dirkschneide in which Midway successfully sued a company that was reselling repackaged versions of their arcade games Pac Man Galaxian and Rally X br Up until U S courts were reluctant to find for copyright infringement of clones Driving case law in the United States was principally through the case Atari Inc v Amusement World Inc F Supp Atari had sued Amusement World claiming that its video game Meteors violated their copyright on Asteroids The court did find twenty two similarities between the two games but ruled against Atari s claims citing these elements as sc nes faire for games about shooting at asteroids The case established that look and feel of a game could not easily be protected Attorney Stephen C McArthur writing for Gamasutra said that during this period courts opted to take a more lax view to balance innovation in the industry and prevent overzealous copyright protection that could have one company claim copyright on an entire genre of games At best copyright holders could challenge clones by threatening cease and desist letters or on other intellectual property rights such as trademarks br br br Shifts since br A shift in legal options for developers to challenge clones arose from the federal New Jersey district court decision in Tetris Holding LLC v Xio Interactive Inc that ruled in favor of The Tetris Company the licensees of the Tetris copyright over the clone Mino developed by Xio Interactive which used the same gameplay as Tetris but with different art assets The developers for Mino has cited in their defense that they only used the uncopyrightable gameplay elements of Tetris in Mino The court ruled that copyright law was in favor of the Tetris Company s claim as the gameplay was copied without changes and while the art assets were new the look and feel of Mino could be easily confused for that of Tetris The court also recognized that since the time Tetris had been released and when Mino was published there was enough new technology in graphics that Mino could have added new forms of expression to the base gameplay to better distinguish from the idea of Tetris such as how to display the tetraminos or the animation of how they fell but instead copied very closely what Tetris had done thus making it more likely a copyright violation While only a district court decision and not binding outside of New Jersey this served as case law for other developers to fend off look and feel clones br The same reasoning was found in a similar case Spry Fox LLC v Lolapps Inc that was occurring nearly simultaneously with the Tetris decision in which Spry Fox the developers of the mobile game Triple Town successfully defended their game from a clone Yeti Town developed by Waves through court settlement after the judge gave initially rulings in favor of Spry Fox These rulings suggested that there was copyright protection on the gameplay mechanics despite drastic differences in the games art assets though other factors such as prior agreements between Spry Fox and Waves may have also been involved br Both the Tetris and Triple Town cases have established new but limited case law on look and feel that can be used to challenge video game clones in court br br br Idea expression distinction br There is a long established Copyright principle called the idea expression distinction where Copyright is meant to protect a creator s unique expression without giving anyone a monopoly on a broader idea The US Copyright Office specifically states that Copyright does not protect the idea for a game its name or title or the method or methods for playing it Nor does copyright protect any idea system method device or trademark material involved in developing merchandising or playing a game br The idea expression distinction is related to other Copyright principles and doctrines One is the merger doctrine where an idea can only be expressed in one way The courts will not recognize Copyright protection in any expression that is inseparable from a larger idea since it would effectively grant a monopoly over that idea Another related concept is sc nes faire French for scenes to be made where certain generic elements are considered essential to a fictional setting and should not eligible for Copyright protection For example the necessity of a baseball in a baseball game would be uncopyrightable as a sc nes faire br Courts have applied the idea expression distinction to numerous copyright disputes starting with the case Atari v Amusement World Despite finding that Meteors copied the idea for Atari s Asteroids game the court ruled that none of the similarities were protected by copyright since these elements were unavoidable in making a game about a spaceship combatting space rocks Atari v Philips was another early ruling where courts granted a preliminary injunction to stop sales of K C Munchkin due to its similarities with Pac Man Later courts have ruled that many game elements cannot be protected by copyright In both Data East USA Inc v Epyx Inc and Capcom U S A Inc v Data East Corp the courts did not recognize copyright protection in many game mechanics and character designs that were seen as essential to creating a martial arts themed fighting game In later cases such as Tetris Holding LLC v Xio Interactive Inc and Spry Fox LLC v Lolapps Inc courts have recognized copyright infringement where there is evidence that one game copied another s unique expression more than just imitating the general idea br br br Substantial similarity test br In Atari v Philips the th Circuit wrote that no plagiarist can excuse the wrong by showing how much of his work he did not pirate This was said in the context of the fact that while a game is not protectable by copyright as such this kind of work of authorship is protectable at least to a limited extent as long as the particular form in which it is expressed provides something new or additional over the idea and that while two works may not be the same in many regards if parts components of the second work are wholly or substantially copied or like the first work it is copyright infringement br br br Subtractive approach test br Nichols v Universal Pictures laid out the following test for copyrighted material which contains both copyrightable and public domain material The case lays down steps to be followed to ascertain copying br br The allegedly infringed work is analyzed to determine the parts that are protected br The unprotected parts are subtracted and br The fact finder examines significant similarities between what remains of the allegedly infringed work and the allegedly infringing work br This subtractive approach is the preferred test by courts in the US except for the th Circuit br br br Abstraction filtration comparison test br This test developed in Computer Associates International Inc v Altai Inc was specifically aimed at software infringement and hence is a better fit for what a court is likely to apply with regards video games The test like the subtractive test before it lays down three steps br br Abstraction Ascertain each level of abstraction br Filtration Identify factors at each level that are not deserving of protection ideas processes those dictated by efficiency or required for external compatibility those taken from the public domain etc and subtract them from consideration br Comparison Compare the remaining components for infringement br The Abstraction filtration comparison test was notably used in identify copyright violations in video games in Tetris Holding LLC v Xio Interactive Inc which was used to find against a clone of Tetris due to substantial similarly in the broad look and feel of the game br br br Authorship br In the U S corporations can be the author of an audiovisual work which tends to be the most commonly used classification for a video game In this case the hiring corporation rather than employees or other contributors would be considered the author Unlike European law which has very strong Moral Right Protections moral rights in American law are limited to works of visual arts as defined by Section of the U S Copyright Act Act Archived at the Wayback Machine This definition excludes motion pictures or other audiovisual works or any works made for hire br There are developments in this field due to the advancement of technology as well Services like Steam Workshop allows for players to use tools provided by the game developer to add to the game in some manner Usually since these players are not employees copyright of their works usually resides with them br br br India br The Indian Copyright Act of does not address video games specifically Unlike the US India has not publicly listed under what categorization video game makers should seek protection under India follows the Anglo American tradition of allowing corporate persons to hold copyrights br The Indian law has an exhaustive definition of the phrase Artistic Work under Chapter Section c of the Copyrights Act which states that Artistic Work is i a painting a sculpture a drawing an engraving or a photograph whether or not any such work possesses artistic quality ii a work of architecture and iii any other work of artistic craftsmanship br Due to the specificity of the statute the law on video games in India has developed more on the basis of business practice This has led to developers and publishers seeking protection as cinematograph works Under Section of the act a cinematograph film means any work of visual recording on any medium produced through a process from which a moving image may be produced by any means and includes a sound recording accompanying such visual recording and cinematograph shall be construed as including any work produced by any process analogous to cinematography including video films The phrase process analogous to cinematography has a non exhaustive list attached meaning that part of the definition is open ended enough to allow for video games to be covered but there is no jurisprudence on this issue The law in India does clearly state that a literary work includes computer programs and hence by extension the source code of video games can be protected as software or literary work br Unlike the US in India different aspects of a game like the art code gameplay mechanics etc are copyrightable independently This understanding is furthered by Section of the Indian Copyright Act which states that the person arranging for all components of a work to come together into a cohesive whole would be the one to hold the copyright in the work only if all works are created under a contract of service as stated in Section c br br In the case of a work made in the course of the author s employment under a contract of service or apprenticeship the employer shall in the absence of any agreement to the contrary be the first owner of the copyright therein br br Under this rule the authorship of creative contributions to a game that are made by individuals outside of the developers publishers employment reside with the original creator unless the rights are signed over to the developer br Contributors like musicians and lyricists having once consented to have their works in a cinematograph work can no longer restrict or object to the enjoyment of the performer s rights by the producer but the original author creator shall retain the right to receive royalties on public commercial use of his her work as per Section A of the Indian Copyright Act It is unclear whether this new provision will affect video game authors due to the lack of qualification of this kind of work of authorship this amendment to the Indian Copyright Act must therefore be further interpreted in this context it must be interpreted by Indian courts in order to determine if it will apply to video game contributors and whether they shall have the right to receive royalties for the exploitation of their works br The landmark case for deciding on infringement cases in India is R G Anand which laid out the following test if the viewer after having read or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original then the copyright has been infringed br br br United Kingdom br Copyright law in the United Kingdom is set by the Copyright Designs and Patents Act but this does not specifically account for video games under any of the works eligible for copyright Instead video games are considered protected by copyright in their parts The computer code or other fixed medium is considered copyrightable and the game s presentation can be copyrighted as a literary work or dramatic work while elements like character design art and sound and music can also be copyrighted Other facets like the look and feel or game mechanics are not considered eligible for copyrightable br br br European Union br The European Union EU as a body of member nations sets policies for copyright and other intellectual property protections that are then to be supported by laws passed at the national levels allowing individual nations to include additional restrictions within the EU directives Multiple EU directives have been issued related to copyright that affect video games but at the core the Computer Programs Directive of provide for copyright protection of video games in their source code and all its constituent parts in its fixed format such as on an optical disc or printed circuit The audio visual and other creative elements of a game themselves are not directly covered by any EU directive but have been enshrined in national laws as a result of the Berne Convention of which the EU and its member states are part of with video games either expressly called out as cinematographic works or more broadly under audiovisual works At least one case at the European Court of Justice has ruled similarly to the United States that ideas like gameplay concepts cannot be copyrighted but it is their form of expression that can merit copyrightability br Patents on software and video games cannot be easily obtained in the European Union unless it can be demonstrated that there is a significant technical effect beyond the interaction of the hardware and the software br br br Japan br Japan s copyright laws are similar to the United States in that a form of artistic expression in a fixed medium is sufficient for copyright protection Japan is also a member of the Berne convention Video games and computer code in general are considered to fall under copyright as they are a work of authorship as a production in which thoughts or emotions are expressed in a creative way and which falls in the literary scientific artistic or musical domain Video games being eligible for copyrights in the same manner as cinematic works were established through three cases related to video game clones from to in which Japan s courted ruled collectively that the act of storing data into a computer s read only memory ROM constitutes copying and thus unauthorized copies can be violations of copyright that similarly hardware circuitry can carry software information and is also copyrightable and that video games can contain artistic expression that is protected by copyright These cases gave video games stronger protections for copyright than before as Japan s courts typically put more onus on plaintiffs in copyright infringement cases to demonstrate similarity and the fair use allowances tended to be more lax br As part of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty Japan amended its copyright laws in to prohibit hardware and software anti circumvention devices basing its language on the United States own DMCA br One issue that has affected the rerelease of older games in Japan are harsh copyright laws that would come into play if there was any possible dispute over possible copyright ownership To republish a work the publisher must have an agreement with the copyright owner which for these older games may involve individuals that have died or moved to different fields and are difficult to track down A new proposed law in would create a central repository for copyright management for such works across all media where the copyright owner is unclear and take responsibility for managing future rights issues This would allow affected games to be republished without having to contact their original creators if they cannot be found br br br China br China s legal framework to copyright does recognize individual elements video games as an eligible work for copyrightability with individual creative assets as being copyrightable but does not have similar provisions as most other nations to recognize the fixed form of publication as also having copyright nor the work as a whole having copyright like a cinematographic work These last elements have in part enabled widespread copyright theft within the country not just of video games but other works The relatively lax copyright rules enables clones based on reskinning an existing game replacing the art assets with new ones but otherwise not changing the game s code China s copyright code also makes it difficult to take action on modification of copyrighted characters as these are not explicitly written into Chinese law which has allowed widespread unlicensed use of others intellectual property in Chinese games Though the government has introduced more stringent copyright laws in recent years and harsher penalties for violations video game clones still persist in China br One of the first major copyright cases over a video game in China was filed in by Nexon against Tencent asserting that Tencent s QQ Tang had copied their Pop Tag The court s decision in favor of Tencent fixed two concepts that remained part of case law access to the original game and whether there was substantial similarity in the claimed elements that violated copyright The case also established that in considering copyrights of the individual elements there must be a threshold of originality to be copyrightable A second key case in occurred when Woniu Technology the creators of Taiji Panda sued Tianxiang Company over their mobile game Hua Qian Gu as a reskinned clone of Taija Panda While Tianxiang attempted to argue that the overall game could not be copyrighted the court established precedence that a video game fell into the category of cinematographic works and that the expression of gameplay can be copyrighted establishing this principle in case law br br br Patents br br Patents are frequently used to protect hardware consoles from cloning Though patents do not cover elements like the form and shape of a console they can be used to protect the internal hardware and electronic components as Magnavox had used at the onset of the arcade game and home console clones Notably many of the patents for the Famicom and NES expired in and respectively leading to additional grey market hardware clones within a short time However Nintendo had built other intellectual property protection into their system specifically the NES lock out system covered by copyright law that would allow only authorized games to be played on their hardware br Less frequently patents have been used to protect video game software elements Notably Sega had filed a United States patent for the gameplay concepts in Crazy Taxi The company subsequently sued Fox Interactive for patent infringement over their title The Simpsons Road Rage citing that the latter game was developed to deliberately copy and imitate the Crazy Taxi game The case was ultimately settled out of court Other known examples of gameplay patents include those for minigames on loading screens filed by Namco the dialog choice wheel used in Mass Effect games by Bioware the katamari of the Katamari Damacy games from Bandai Namco and the Nemesis system from Middle earth Shadow of Mordor by Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment br br br Trademarks br Another approach some companies have used to prevent clones is via trademarks as to prevent clones and knockoffs Notably King have gotten a United States trademark on the word Candy in the area of video games to protect clones and player confusion for their game Candy Crush Saga They have also sought to block the use of the word Saga in the trademark filing of The Banner Saga for similar reasons despite the games having no common elements Within the European Union one can register for a European Union trade mark that includes multimedia elements which would allow a developer or publisher to trademark a specific gameplay element that is novel from past games providing a different route for them to protect their work from cloning For example Rebellion Developments filed to register its Kill Cam mechanic as a trademark from its series Sniper Elite in October though as of February the application is still being reviewed br PUSH TOWARDS REALISM br As technology progresses creator capabilities and consumer expectations trend toward more realistic demands for video games More realistic gaming can increase the user experience enhancing immersion and increasing emotional engagement A problem can arise when games become too similar to the real world imitating or copying real life objects or scenarios In a New York district court ruled that Activision did not violate trademark law by including a Humvee in its Call of Duty game The court said the United States First Amendment protected Activision s use of the Humvee Further the court relying on Rogers v Grimaldi rejected the trademark infringement claim saying that because the trademark was used for artistic purposes and did not mislead customers Activision was not infringing on the mark br In a similar vein the case Saber Interactive Inc v Oovee Ltd also highlighted the tension between trademark protection and artistic expression in video games In this instance Saber Interactive held exclusive rights to depict the K tractor in its game Mudrunner yet Oovee used the same vehicle in its competing game Spintires The court found that video games are expressive works deserving of First Amendment protection and that Oovee s use of the K did not infringe on Saber s trademarks Applying the Rogers test the court determined that Oovee s depiction of the K had no artistic relevance to Saber s and did not explicitly mislead consumers These cases demonstrate that while realism is a valued aspect of immersive gaming courts carefully consider the balance between artistic expression and trademark rights often favoring the former when it serves a genuine creative purpose without misleading the public br br br Licensing br A related aspect of video games and intellectual property is the licensing of other properties for use within the video game This can come in many potential forms br br Some games are developed as tie ins to the release of another property as to help with that property s marketing and promotion such as Superman which was used as a tie in to Superman The Animated Series In other cases games may simply used the licensed setting outside of the tie in function such as in the case of Batman Arkham Asylum br Many games incorporate existing contemporary music from famous bands and musicians each which must be licensed individuals This is common for most rhythm games like Guitar Hero as well as a common feature in Grand Theft Auto and various GTA clones for music played on an in game car radio station br Various crossover games bring in characters settings and other elements from other video games commonly outside of the publisher s IP realm such as in the case of the Super Smash Bros series br This type of licensing tends to pose an issue for the retention and preservation of video games particular on digital download services Publisher can sometimes secure perpetual rights to a licensed property such as in the case of Ubisoft with the name Tom Clancy Otherwise with limited time licenses publishers are generally required to remove the game from sale at the end of that term though existing owners of the game often still have rights to redownload and use the game as necessary For example the Forza Motorsport series includes realistic models of numerous existing car models which are licensed from the car manufacturers These licensing terms are limited requiring publisher Microsoft to pull the game from sale roughly four years after release Microsoft has generally established a development model where as the last iteration of Forza is about to be pulled the next version with a fresh start on the car licenses was released In one predominate example Grand Theft Auto IV had to update the game for all digital owners to remove songs on the soundtrack which their ten year license had expired br br br Publicity Rights br The right of publicity is a relatively modern intellectual property right that safeguards an individual s ability to commercially profit from their name image or likeness Issues of publicity rights in video games can arise in sports titles where developers use the names and likenesses of hundreds or even thousands of individuals to enhance a game s authenticity and appeal br Publicity rights pose a particular concern when the athletes in question are amateurs Electronic Arts NCAA Football and NCAA Basketball series titles each used the names images and likenesses of collegiate athletes from hundreds of different universities in the United States Because then current National Collegiate Athletic Association amateurism bylaws prohibited student athletes from receiving any monetary or in kind benefit from the use of their publicity rights EA included athletes names images and likenesses without providing any sort of compensation to the athletes br This tension between the NCAA s amateurism rules and student athletes right of publicity claims resulted in several lawsuits against EA beginning with the cases Hart v Electronic Arts F d and In re NCAA Student Athlete Name and Likeness Licensing Litigation F d In Hart the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the lower court s award of summary judgment in favor of EA The appellate court held that applying the transformative use test EA failed to demonstrate that its First Amendment rights superseded former Rutgers University football player Ryan Hart s right of publicity Similarly the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in In re NCAA Student Athlete Name and Likeness Licensing Litigation held that under the transformative use test EA s use does not qualify for First Amendment protection as a matter of law because it literally recreates Keller in the very setting in which he has achieved renown br The Plaintiffs in Hart In re NCAA and the later case O Bannon v NCAA later settled with EA to resolve their disputes In response to litigation costs and uncertainty caused by the lawsuits EA announced it would cancel future releases of NCAA Football and NCAA Basketball titles This continued until when changes to NCAA name image and likeness policies allowed student athletes to personally license and profit from their publicity rights br br br See also br Digital rights management br Mod video games br Video
