A brand is a name term design symbol or any other feature that distinguishes one seller s good or service from those of other sellers Brands are used in business marketing and advertising for recognition and importantly to create and store value as brand equity for the object identified to the benefit of the brand s customers its owners and shareholders Brand names are sometimes distinguished from generic or store brands br The practice of branding in the original literal sense of marking by burning is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians who are known to have engaged in livestock branding and branded slaves as early as BCE Branding was used to differentiate one person s cattle from another s by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal s skin with a hot branding iron If a person stole any of the cattle anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner The term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company so that brand now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into Over time the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil wine cosmetics and fish sauce and in the st century extends even further into services such as legal financial and medical political parties and people s stage names br In the modern era the concept of branding has expanded to include deployment by a manager of the marketing and communication techniques and tools that help to distinguish a company or products from competitors aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of customers The key components that form a brand s toolbox include a brand s identity personality product design brand communication such as by logos and trademarks brand awareness brand loyalty and various branding brand management strategies Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the st century hence branding is among a few remaining forms of product differentiation br Brand equity is the measurable totality of a brand s worth and is validated by observing the effectiveness of these branding components When a customer is familiar with a brand or favors it incomparably to its competitors a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value Brand valuation is a management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand br br br Etymology br The word brand originally meaning a burning piece of wood comes from Middle English brand meaning torch from Old English brand It became to also mean the mark from burning with a branding iron br br br History br br Branding and labeling have an ancient history Branding probably began with the practice of branding livestock to deter theft Images of the branding of cattle occur in ancient Egyptian tombs dating to around BCE Over time purchasers realized that the brand provided information about origin as well as about ownership and could serve as a guide to quality Branding was adapted by farmers potters and traders for use on other types of goods such as pottery and ceramics Forms of branding or proto branding emerged spontaneously and independently throughout Africa Asia and Europe at different times depending on local conditions Seals which acted as quasi brands have been found on early Chinese products of the Qin dynasty BCE large numbers of seals survive from the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley BCE where the local community depended heavily on trade cylinder seals came into use in Ur in Mesopotamia in around BCE and facilitated the labelling of goods and property and the use of maker s marks on pottery was commonplace in both ancient Greece and Rome Identity marks such as stamps on ceramics were also used in ancient Egypt br Diana Twede has argued that the consumer packaging functions of protection utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions She has shown that amphorae used in Mediterranean trade between and BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings which consumers used to glean information about the type of goods and the quality The systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century BCE In largely pre literate society the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality David Wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient Mesopotamia in the th century BCE when large scale economies started mass producing commodities such as alcoholic drinks cosmetics and textiles These ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which over time gave way to clay seals bearing impressed images often associated with the producer s personal identity thus giving the product a personality Not all historians agree that these markings are comparable with modern brands or labels with some suggesting that the early pictorial brands or simple thumbprints used in pottery should be termed proto brands while other historians argue that the presence of these simple markings does not imply that mature brand management practices operated br br Scholarly studies have found evidence of branding packaging and labeling in antiquity Archaeological evidence of potters stamps has been found across the breadth of the Roman Empire and in ancient Greece Stamps were used on bricks pottery and storage containers as well as on fine ceramics Pottery marking had become commonplace in ancient Greece by the th century BCE A vase manufactured around BCE bears the inscription Sophilos painted me indicating that the object was both fabricated and painted by a single potter Branding may have been necessary to support the extensive trade in such pots For example rd century Gaulish pots bearing the names of well known potters and the place of manufacture such as Attianus of Lezoux Tetturo of Lezoux and Cinnamus of Vichy have been found as far away as Essex and Hadrian s Wall in England English potters based at Colchester and Chichester used stamps on their ceramic wares by the st century CE The use of hallmarks a type of brand on precious metals dates to around the th century CE A series of five marks occurs on Byzantine silver dating from this period br br Some of the earliest use of maker s marks dating to about BCE have been found in India The oldest generic brand in continuous use known in India since the Vedic period c BCE to BCE is the herbal paste known as chyawanprash consumed for its purported health benefits and attributed to a revered rishi or seer named Chyawan One well documented early example of a highly developed brand is that of White Rabbit sewing needles dating from China s Song dynasty to CE A copper printing plate used to print posters contained a message which roughly translates as Jinan Liu s Fine Needle Shop We buy high quality steel rods and make fine quality needles to be ready for use at home in no time The plate also includes a trademark in the form of a White Rabbit which signified good luck and was particularly relevant to women who were the primary purchasers Details in the image show a white rabbit crushing herbs and text includes advice to shoppers to look for the stone white rabbit in front of the maker s shop br br In ancient Rome a commercial brand or inscription applied to objects offered for sale was known as a titulus pictus The inscription typically specified information such as place of origin destination type of product and occasionally quality claims or the name of the manufacturer Roman marks or inscriptions were applied to a very wide variety of goods including pots ceramics amphorae storage shipping containers and on factory produced oil lamps Carbonized loaves of bread found at Herculaneum indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producer s name Roman glassmakers branded their works with the name of Ennion appearing most prominently br br One merchant that made good use of the titulus pictus was Umbricius Scaurus a manufacturer of fish sauce also known as garum in Pompeii c CE Mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house feature images of amphorae bearing his personal brand and quality claims The mosaic depicts four different amphora one at each corner of the atrium and bearing labels as follows br br G ari F los SCO m SCAURI EX OFFI ci NA SCAU RI translated as The flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of Scaurus from the shop of Scaurus br LIQU minis FLOS translated as The flower of Liquamen br G ari F los SCOM bri SCAURI translated as The flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of Scaurus br LIQUAMEN OPTIMUM EX OFFICI n A SCAURI translated as The best liquamen from the shop of Scaurus br Scaurus fish sauce was known by people across the Mediterranean to be of very high quality and its reputation traveled as far away as modern France In both Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum archaeological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labeling in relatively common use across a broad range of goods Wine jars for example were stamped with names such as Lassius and L Eumachius probably references to the name of the producer br br The use of identity marks on products declined following the fall of the Roman Empire In the European Middle Ages heraldry developed a language of visual symbolism which would feed into the evolution of branding br and with the rise of the merchant guilds the use of marks resurfaced and was applied to specific types of goods By the th century the use of maker s marks had become evident on a broad range of goods In makers marks on bread became compulsory in England The Italians used brands in the form of watermarks on paper in the th century Blind stamps hallmarks and silver makers marks all types of brand became widely used across Europe during this period Hallmarks although known from the th century especially in Byzantium only came into general use during the Medieval period British silversmiths introduced hallmarks for silver in br br Some brands still in existence as of date from the th th and th centuries period of mass production Bass Brewery the British brewery founded in became a pioneer in international brand marketing Many years before Bass applied a red triangle to casks of its pale ale In its red triangle brand became the first registered trademark issued by the British government Guinness World Records recognizes Tate Lyle of Lyle s Golden Syrup as Britain s and the world s oldest branding and packaging with its green and gold packaging having remained almost unchanged since Twinings tea has used the same logo capitalized font beneath a lion crest since making it the world s oldest in continuous use br br A characteristic feature of th century mass marketing was the widespread use of branding originating with the advent of packaged goods Industrialization moved the production of many household items such as soap from local communities to centralized factories When shipping their items the factories would literally brand their logo or company insignia on the barrels used effectively using a corporate trademark as a quasi brand br Factories established following the Industrial Revolution introduced mass produced goods and needed to sell their products to a wider market that is to customers previously familiar only with locally produced goods It became apparent that a generic package of soap had difficulty competing with familiar local products Packaged goods manufacturers needed to convince the market that the public could place just as much trust in the non local product Gradually manufacturers began using personal identifiers to differentiate their goods from generic products on the market Marketers generally began to realize that brands to which personalities were attached outsold rival brands By the s large manufacturers had learned to imbue their brands identity with personality traits such as youthfulness fun sex appeal luxury or the cool factor This began the modern practice now known as branding where the consumers buy the brand instead of the product and rely on the brand name instead of a retailer s recommendation br The process of giving a brand human characteristics represented at least in part a response to consumer concerns about mass produced goods The Quaker Oats Company began using the image of the Quaker Man in place of a trademark from the late s with great success Pears soap Campbell s soup Coca Cola Juicy Fruit chewing gum and Aunt Jemima pancake mix were also among the first products to be branded in an effort to increase the consumer s familiarity with the product s merits Other brands which date from that era such as Ben s Original rice and Kellogg s breakfast cereal furnish illustrations of the trend br br By the early s trade press publications advertising agencies and advertising experts began producing books and pamphlets exhorting manufacturers to bypass retailers and to advertise directly to consumers with strongly branded messages Around advertising guru James Walter Thompson published a housing advertisement explaining trademark advertising This was an early commercial explanation of what scholars now recognize as modern branding and the beginnings of brand management This trend continued to the s and as of is quantified by marketers in concepts such as brand value and brand equity Naomi Klein has described this development as brand equity mania In for example Philip Morris Companies purchased Kraft Foods Inc for six times what the company was worth on paper Business analysts reported that what they really purchased was the brand name br With the rise of mass media in the early th century companies adopted techniques that allowed their messages to stand out Slogans mascots and jingles began to appear on radio in the s and in early television in the s Soap manufacturers sponsored many of the earliest radio drama series and the genre became known as soap opera br By the s manufacturers began to recognize the way in which consumers had started to develop relationships with their brands in a social psychological anthropological sense Advertisers began to use motivational research and consumer research to gather insights into consumer purchasing Strong branded campaigns for Chrysler and Exxon Esso using insights drawn from research into psychology and cultural anthropology led to some of the most enduring campaigns of the th century Brand advertisers began to imbue goods and services with a personality based on the insight that consumers searched for brands with personalities that matched their own br br br Concepts br Effective branding attached to strong brand values can result in higher sales of not only one product but of other products associated with that brand If a customer loves Pillsbury biscuits and trusts the brand he or she is more likely to try other products offered by the company such as chocolate chip cookies for example Brand development often performed by a design team takes time to produce br br br Brand names and trademarks br br A brand name is the part of a brand that can be spoken or written and identifies a product service or company and sets it apart from other comparable products within a category A brand name may include words phrases signs symbols designs or any combination of these elements For consumers a brand name is a memory heuristic a convenient way to remember preferred product choices A brand name is not to be confused with a trademark which refers to the brand name or part of a brand that is legally protected For example Coca Cola not only protects the brand name Coca Cola but also protects the distinctive Spencerian script and the contoured shape of the bottle br br br Corporate brand identity br Brand identity is a collection of individual components such as a name a design a set of images a slogan a vision writing style a particular font or a symbol etc which sets the brand aside from others br For a company to exude a strong sense of brand identity it must have an in depth understanding of its target market competitors and the surrounding business environment Brand identity includes both the core identity and the extended identity The core identity reflects consistent long term associations with the brand whereas the extended identity involves the intricate details of the brand that help generate a constant motif br According to Kotler et al a brand s identity may deliver four levels of meaning br br attributes br benefits br values br personality br A brand s attributes are a set of labels with which the corporation wishes to be associated For example a brand may showcase its primary attribute as environmental friendliness However a brand s attributes alone are not enough to persuade a customer into purchasing the product These attributes must be communicated through benefits which are more emotional translations If a brand s attribute is being environmentally friendly customers will receive the benefit of feeling that they are helping the environment by associating with the brand Aside from attributes and benefits a brand s identity may also involve branding to focus on representing its core set of values If a company is seen to symbolize specific values it will in turn attract customers who also believe in these values For example Nike s brand represents the value of a just do it attitude Thus this form of brand identification attracts customers who also share this same value Even more extensive than its perceived values is a brand s personality Quite literally one can easily describe a successful brand identity as if it were a person This form of brand identity has proven to be the most advantageous in maintaining long lasting relationships with consumers as it gives them a sense of personal interaction with the brand Collectively all four forms of brand identification help to deliver a powerful meaning behind what a corporation hopes to accomplish and to explain why customers should choose one brand over its competitors br br br Brand personality br Brand personality refers to the set of human personality traits that are both applicable to and relevant for brands Marketers and consumer researchers often argue that brands can be imbued with human like characteristics which resonate with potential consumers Such personality traits can assist marketers to create unique brands that are differentiated from rival brands Aaker conceptualized brand personality as consisting of five broad dimensions namely sincerity down to earth honest wholesome and cheerful excitement daring spirited imaginative and up to date competence reliable intelligent and successful sophistication glamorous upper class charming and ruggedness outdoorsy and tough Subsequent research studies have suggested that Aaker s dimensions of brand personality are relatively stable across different industries market segments and over time Much of the literature on branding suggests that consumers prefer brands with personalities that are congruent with their own br Consumers may distinguish the psychological aspect brand associations like thoughts feelings perceptions images experiences beliefs attitudes and so on that become linked to the brand of a brand from the experiential aspect The experiential aspect consists of the sum of all points of contact with the brand and is termed the consumer s brand experience The brand is often intended to create an emotional response and recognition leading to potential loyalty and repeat purchases The brand experience is a brand s action perceived by a person The psychological aspect sometimes referred to as the brand image is a symbolic construct created within the minds of people consisting of all the information and expectations associated with a product with a service or with the companies providing them br Marketers or product managers that responsible for branding seek to develop or align the expectations behind the brand experience creating the impression that a brand associated with a product or service has certain qualities or characteristics which make it special or unique A brand can therefore become one of the most valuable elements in an advertising theme as it demonstrates what the brand owner is able to offer in the marketplace This means that building a strong brand helps to distinguish a product from similar ones and differentiate it from competitors The art of creating and maintaining a brand is called brand management The orientation of an entire organization towards its brand is called brand orientation Brand orientation develops in response to market intelligence br Careful brand management seeks to make products or services relevant and meaningful to a target audience Marketers tend to treat brands as more than the difference between the actual cost of a product and its selling price rather brands represent the sum of all valuable qualities of a product to the consumer and are often treated as the total investment in brand building activities including marketing communications br Consumers may look on branding as an aspect of products or services as it often serves to denote a certain attractive quality or characteristic see also brand promise From the perspective of brand owners branded products or services can command higher prices Where two products resemble each other but one of the products has no associated branding such as a generic store branded product potential purchasers may often select the more expensive branded product on the basis of the perceived quality of the brand or on the basis of the reputation of the brand owner br br br Brand awareness br br Brand awareness involves a customer s ability to recall and or recognize brands logos and branded advertising Brands help customers to understand which brands or products belong to which product or service category Brands assist customers to understand the constellation of benefits offered by individual brands and how a given brand within a category is differentiated from its competing brands and thus the brand helps customers potential customers understand which brand satisfies their needs Thus the brand offers the customer a short cut to understanding the different product or service offerings that make up a particular category br Brand awareness is a key step in the customer s purchase decision process since some kind of awareness is a precondition to purchasing That is customers will not consider a brand if they are not aware of it Brand awareness is a key component in understanding the effectiveness both of a brand s identity and of its communication methods Successful brands are those that consistently generate a high level of brand awareness as this can be the pivotal factor in securing customer transactions Various forms of brand awareness can be identified Each form reflects a different stage in a customer s cognitive ability to address the brand in a given circumstance br Marketers typically identify two distinct types of brand awareness namely brand recall also known as unaided recall or occasionally spontaneous recall and brand recognition also known as aided brand recall These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising br br Most companies aim for Top of Mind which occurs when a brand pops into a consumer s mind when asked to name brands in a product category For example when someone is asked to name a type of facial tissue the common answer Kleenex will represent a top of mind brand Top of mind awareness is a special case of brand recall br Brand recall also known as unaided brand awareness or spontaneous awareness refers to the brand or set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when prompted with a product category br Brand recognition also known as aided brand awareness occurs when consumers see or read a list of brands and express familiarity with a particular brand only after they hear or see it as a type of memory aide br Strategic awareness occurs when a brand is not only top of mind to consumers but also has distinctive qualities which consumers perceive as making it better than other brands in the particular market The distinction s that set a product apart from the competition is are also known as the unique selling point or USP br br br Brand recognition br Brand recognition is one of the initial phases of brand awareness and validates whether or not a customer remembers being pre exposed to the brand Brand recognition also known as aided brand recall refers to consumers ability to correctly differentiate a brand when they come into contact with it This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify or recall the brand name When customers experience brand recognition they are triggered by either a visual or verbal cue For example when looking to satisfy a category need such as a toilet paper the customer would firstly be presented with multiple brands to choose from Once the customer is visually or verbally faced with a brand he she may remember being introduced to the brand before When given some type of cue consumers who are able to retrieve the particular memory node that referred to the brand they exhibit brand recognition Often this form of brand awareness assists customers in choosing one brand over another when faced with a low involvement purchasing decision br Brand recognition is often the mode of brand awareness that operates in retail shopping environments When presented with a product at the point of sale or after viewing its visual packaging consumers are able to recognize the brand and may be able to associate it with attributes or meanings acquired through exposure to promotion or word of mouth referrals In contrast to brand recall where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category when prompted with a brand name a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognize it br Brand recognition is most successful when people can elicit recognition without being explicitly exposed to the company s name but rather through visual signifiers like logos slogans and colors For example Disney successfully branded its particular script font originally created for Walt Disney s signature logo which it used in the logo for go com br br br Brand recall br Unlike brand recognition brand recall also known as unaided brand recall or spontaneous brand recall is the ability of the customer retrieving the brand correctly from memory Rather than being given a choice of multiple brands to satisfy a need consumers are faced with a need first and then must recall a brand from their memory to satisfy that need This level of brand awareness is stronger than brand recognition as the brand must be firmly cemented in the consumer s memory to enable unassisted remembrance This gives the company huge advantage over its competitors because the customer is already willing to buy or at least know the company offering available in the market Thus brand recall is a confirmation that previous branding touchpoints have successfully fermented in the minds of its consumers br Marketing mix modeling can help marketing leaders optimize how they spend marketing budgets to maximize the impact on brand awareness or on sales Managing brands for value creation will often involve applying marketing mix modeling techniques in conjunction with brand valuation br br br Brand elements br Brands typically comprise various elements such as br br name the word or words used to identify a company product service or concept br logo the visual trademark that identifies a brand br tagline or catchphrase a short phrase always used in the product s advertising and closely associated with the brand br graphics the dynamic ribbon is a trademarked part of Coca Cola s brand br shapes the distinctive shapes of the Coca Cola bottle and of the Volkswagen Beetle are trademarked elements of those brands br colors the instant recognition consumers have when they see Tiffany Co s robin s egg blue Pantone No Tiffany Co s trademarked the color in br sounds a unique tune or set of notes can denote a brand NBC s chimes provide a famous example br scents the rose jasmine musk scent of Chanel No is trademarked br tastes Kentucky Fried Chicken has trademarked its special recipe of eleven herbs and spices for fried chicken br movements Lamborghini has trademarked the upward motion of its car doors br br br Brand communication br br Although brand identity is a fundamental asset to a brand s equity the worth of a brand s identity would become obsolete without ongoing brand communication Integrated marketing communications IMC relates to how a brand transmits a clear consistent message to its stakeholders Five key components comprise IMC br br Advertising br Sales promotions br Direct marketing br Personal selling br Public relations br The effectiveness of a brand s communication is determined by how accurately the customer perceives the brand s intended message through its IMC Although IMC is a broad strategic concept the most crucial brand communication elements are pinpointed to how the brand sends a message and what touch points the brand uses to connect with its customers Chitty br One can analyze the traditional communication model into several consecutive steps br br Firstly a source sender wishes to convey a message to a receiver This source must encode the intended message in a way that the receiver will potentially understand br After the encoding stage the forming of the message is complete and is portrayed through a selected channel In IMC channels may include media elements such as advertising public relations sales promotions etc br It is at this point where the message can often deter from its original purpose as the message must go through the process of being decoded which can often lead to unintended misinterpretation br Finally the receiver retrieves the message and attempts to understand what the sender was aiming to render Often a message may be incorrectly received due to noise in the market which is caused by unplanned static or distortion during the communication process br The final stage of this process is when the receiver responds to the message which is received by the original sender as feedback br When a brand communicates a brand identity to a receiver it runs the risk of the receiver incorrectly interpreting the message Therefore a brand should use appropriate communication channels to positively affect how the psychological and physical aspects of a brand are perceived br In order for brands to effectively communicate to customers marketers must consider all touch point s or sources of contact that a customer has with the brand Touch points represent the channel stage in the traditional communication model where a message travels from the sender to the receiver Any point where a customer has an interaction with the brand whether watching a television advertisement hearing about a brand through word of mouth or even noticing a branded license plate defines a touchpoint According to Dahlen et al every touchpoint has the potential to add positive or suppress negative associations to the brand s equity Thus a brand s IMC should cohesively deliver positive messages through appropriate touch points associated with its target market One methodology involves using sensory stimuli touch points to activate customer emotion For example if a brand consistently uses a pleasant smell as a primary touchpoint the brand has a much higher chance of creating a positive lasting effect on its customers senses as well as memory Another way a brand can ensure that it is utilizing the best communication channel is by focusing on touchpoints that suit particular areas associated with customer experience As suggested Figure certain touch points link with a specific stage in customer brand involvement For example a brand may recognize that advertising touchpoints are most effective during the pre purchase experience stage therefore they may target their advertisements to new customers rather than to existing customers Overall a brand has the ability to strengthen brand equity by using IMC branding communications through touchpoints br Brand communication is important in ensuring brand success in the business world and refers to how businesses transmit their brand messages characteristics and attributes to their consumers One method of brand communication that companies can exploit involves electronic word of mouth eWOM eWOM is a relatively new approach Phelps et al identified to communicate with consumers One popular method of eWOM involves social networking sites SNSs such as Twitter A study found that consumers classed their relationship with a brand as closer if that brand was active on a specific social media site Twitter Research further found that the more consumers retweeted and communicated with a brand the more they trusted the brand This suggests that a company could look to employ a social media campaign to gain consumer trust and loyalty as well as in the pursuit of communicating brand messages br McKee also looked into brand communication and states that when communicating a brand a company should look to simplify its message as this will lead to more value being portrayed as well as an increased chance of target consumers recalling and recognizing the brand br In Riefler stated that if the company communicating a brand is a global organization or has future global aims that company should look to employ a method of communication that is globally appealing to their consumers and subsequently choose a method of communication with will be internationally understood One way a company can do this involves choosing a product or service s brand name as this name will need to be suitable for the marketplace that it aims to enter br It is important that if a company wishes to develop a global market the company name will also need to be suitable in different cultures and not cause offense or be misunderstood When communicating a brand a company needs to be aware that they must not just visually communicate their brand message and should take advantage of portraying their message through multi sensory information One article suggests that other senses apart from vision need to be targeted when trying to communicate a brand with consumers For example a jingle or background music can have a positive effect on brand recognition purchasing behaviour and brand recall br Therefore when looking to communicate a brand with chosen consumers companies should investigate a channel of communication that is most suitable for their short term and long term aims and should choose a method of communication that is most likely to reach their target consumers The match up between the product the consumer lifestyle and the endorser is important for the effectiveness of brand communication br br br Global brand variables br br br Brand name br br The term brand name is quite often used interchangeably with brand although it is more correctly used to specifically denote written or spoken linguistic elements of any product In this context a brand name constitutes a type of trademark if the brand name exclusively identifies the brand owner as the commercial source of products or services A brand owner may seek to protect proprietary rights in relation to a brand name through trademark registration such trademarks are called Registered Trademarks Advertising spokespersons have also become part of some brands for example Mr Whipple of Charmin toilet tissue and Tony the Tiger of Kellogg s Frosted Flakes Putting a value on a brand by brand valuation or using marketing mix modeling techniques is distinct to valuing a trademark br br br Types of brand names br Brand names come in many styles br A few include br br initialism a name made of initials such as UPS or IBM br descriptive names that describe a product benefit or function such as Whole Foods or Toys R Us br alliteration and rhyme names that are fun to say and which stick in the mind such as Reese s Pieces or Dunkin Donuts br evocative names that can evoke a vivid image such as Amazon or Crest br neologisms completely made up words such as Wii or H agen Dazs br foreign word adoption of a word from another language such as Volvo br founders names using the names of real people especially a founder s surname such as Hewlett Packard Dell Disney Stussy or Mars br geography naming for regions and landmarks such as Cisco or Fuji Film br personification taking names from myths such as Nike or from the minds of ad execs such as Betty Crocker br punny some brands create their name by using a silly pun such as Lord of the Fries Wok on Water or Eggs Eggscetera br portmanteau combining multiple words together to create one such as Microsoft microcomputer and software Comcast communications and broadcast Evernote forever and note Vodafone voice data telephone br The act of associating a product or service with a brand has become part of pop culture Most products have some kind of brand identity from common table salt to designer jeans A brandnomer is a brand name that has colloquially become a generic term for a product or service such as Band Aid Nylon or Kleenex which are often used to describe any brand of adhesive bandage any type of hosiery or any brand of facial tissue respectively Xerox for example has become synonymous with the word copy br br br Brand line br A brand line allows the introduction of various subtypes of a product under a common ideally already established brand name Examples would be the individual Kinder chocolates by Ferrero SpA the subtypes of Coca Cola or special editions of popular brands See also brand extension br Open Knowledge Foundation created in December the BSIN Brand Standard Identification Number BSIN is universal and is used by the Open Product Data Working Group of the Open Knowledge Foundation to assign a brand to a product The OKFN Brand repository is critical for the Open Data movement br br br Brand identity br The expression of a brand including its name trademark communications and visual appearance is brand identity Because the identity is assembled by the brand owner it reflects how the owner wants the consumer to perceive the brand and by extension the branded company organization product or service This is in contrast to the brand image which is a customer s mental picture of a brand The brand owner will seek to bridge the gap between the brand image and the brand identity Brand identity is fundamental to consumer recognition and symbolizes the brand s differentiation from competitors Brand identity is distinct from brand image br Brand identity is what the owner wants to communicate to its potential consumers However over time a product s brand identity may acquire evolve gaining new attributes from consumer perspective but not necessarily from the marketing communications an owner percolates to targeted consumers Therefore businesses research consumer s brand associations br The brand identity works as a guideline as the frame in which a brand will evolve and define itself or in the words of David Aaker a unique set of brand associations that the brand strategist aspires to create or maintain br br According to Kapferer there are six facets to a brand s identity br br Physique The physical characteristics and iconography of your brand such as the Nike swoosh or the orange pantone of easyJet br Personality The persona how a brand communicates with their audience which is expressed through its tone of voice design assets and then integrates this into communication touchpoints in a coherent way br Culture The values the principles on which a brand bases its behaviour For example Google flexible office hours and fun environment so the employees feel happy and creative at work br Reflection The stereotypical user of the brand A brand is likely to be purchased by several buyer s profiles but they will have a go to person that they use in their campaigns For example Lou Yetu and the Parisian chic profile br Relationship The bond between a brand and its customers and the customer expectations of the brand the experience beyond the tangible product Such as warranties or services during and after purchase help maintain a sustainable relationship and keep the consumer trust br Self image How one brand customer portrays their ideal self how they want to look and behave what they aspire to brands can target their messaging accordingly and make the brand s aspirations reflect theirs br br br Brand image br br br Visual brand identity br br Color is a particularly important element of visual brand identity and color mapping provides an effective way of ensuring color contributes to differentiation in a visually cluttered marketplace br br br Brand trust br Brand trust is the intrinsic believability that any entity evokes In the commercial world the intangible aspect of brand trust impacts the behavior and performance of its business stakeholders in many intriguing ways It creates the foundation of a strong brand connect with all stakeholders converting simple awareness to strong commitment br br br Brand parity br Brand parity is the perception of customers that some brands are equivalent This means that shoppers will purchase within a group of accepted brands rather than choosing one specific brand Cranfield management professor Christopher Martin has referred to research confirming that consumers choose from a portfolio of brands and that factors such as availability will be a major determinant of actual choice br When brand parity operates quality is often not a major concern because consumers believe that only minor quality differences exist Instead it is important to have brand equity which is the perception that a good or service with a given brand name is different better and can be trusted according to Kenneth E Clow br br br Expanding role of brands br The original aim of branding was to simplify the process of identifying and differentiating products Over time manufacturers began to use branded messages to give the brand a unique personality Brands came to embrace a performance or benefit promise for the product certainly but eventually also for the company behind the brand br Today brands play a much bigger role The power of brands to communicate a complex message quickly with emotional impact and with the ability of brands to attract media attention makes them ideal tools in the hands of activists Cultural conflict over a brand s meaning has also influences the diffusion of an innovation br During the COVID pandemic of US customers tried different stores websites or brands and of those expect to integrate new brands or stores into their post pandemic lives If brands can find ways to help people feel empowered and regain a sense of control in uncertain times they can help people reconnect and heal and be appreciated for it br br br Branding strategies br br br Company name br Often especially in the industrial sector brand engineers will promote a company s name Exactly how the company name relates to product and services names forms part of a brand architecture Decisions about company names and product names and their relationship depend on more than a dozen strategic considerations br In this case a strong brand name or company name becomes the vehicle for marketing a range of products for example Mercedes Benz or Black Decker or a range of subsidiary brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Cadbury Flake or Cadbury Fingers in the UK br Corporate name changes offer particularly stark examples of branding related decisions br A name change may signal different ownership or new product directions br Thus the name Unisys originated in when Burroughs bought and incorporated UNIVAC and the newly named International Business Machines represented a broadening of scope in from its original name the Computing Tabulating Recording Company A change in corporate naming may also have a role in seeking to shed an undesirable image for example Werner Erhard and Associates re branded its activities as Landmark Education in at a time when publicity in a Minutes investigative report broadcast

Marketers associate separate products or lines with separate brand names such as Seven Up Kool Aid or Nivea Sun Beiersdorf which may compete against other brands from the same company for example Unilever owns Persil Omo Surf and Lynx br br br Challenger brands br br A challenger brand is a brand in an industry where it is neither the market leader nor a niche brand Challenger brands are categorized by a mindset that sees them have business ambitions beyond conventional resources and an intent to bring change to an industry br br br Multiproduct branding strategy br Multiproduct branding strategy is when a company uses one name across all its products in a product class When the company s trade name is used multiproduct branding is also known as corporate branding family branding or umbrella branding Examples of companies that use corporate branding are Microsoft Samsung Apple and Sony as the company s brand name is identical to their trade name br Other examples of multiproduct branding strategy include Virgin and Church Dwight Virgin a multination conglomerate uses the punk inspired handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines hot air balloons telecommunication to healthcare Church Dwight a manufacturer of household products displays the Arm Hammer family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient A multiproduct branding strategy has many advantages It capitalizes on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name Consequently the multiproduct branding strategy makes product line extension possible br br br Product line extension br br A product line extension is the procedure of entering a new market segment in its product class by means of using a current brand name An example of this is the Campbell Soup Company primarily a producer of canned soups They utilize a multiproduct branding strategy by way of soup line extensions They have over soup flavours putting forward varieties such as regular Campbell soup condensed chunky fresh brewed organic and soup on the go This approach is seen as favourable as it can result in lower promotion costs and advertising due to the same name being used on all products therefore increasing the level of brand awareness Although line extension has potential negative outcomes with one being that other items in the company s line may be disadvantaged because of the sale of the extension Line extensions work at their best when they deliver an increase in company revenue by enticing new buyers or by removing sales from competitors br br br Subbranding br Subbranding is used by certain multiproduct branding companies Subbranding merges a corporate family or umbrella brand with the introduction of a new brand in order to differentiate part of a product line from others in the whole brand system Subbranding assists to articulate and construct offerings It can alter a brand s identity as subbranding can modify associations of the parent brand Examples of successful subbranding can be seen through Gatorade and Porsche Gatorade a manufacturer of sport themed food and beverages effectively introduced Gatorade G a low calorie line of Gatorade drinks Likewise Porsche a specialized automobile manufacturer successfully markets its lower end line Porsche Boxster and higher end line Porsche Carrera br br br Brand extension and brand dilution br br Brand extension is the system of employing a current brand name to enter a different product class Having a strong brand equity allows for brand extension for example many fashion and designer companies extended brands into fragrances shoes and accessories home textile home decor luggage sun glasses furniture hotels etc Nevertheless brand extension has its disadvantages There is a risk that too many uses for one brand name can oversaturate the market resulting in a blurred and weak brand for consumers Examples of brand extension can be seen through Kimberly Clark and Honda Kimberly Clark is a corporation that produces personal and health care products being able to extend the Huggies brand name across a full line of toiletries for toddlers and babies The success of this brand extension strategy is apparent in the million in annual sales generated globally Similarly Honda using their reputable name for automobiles has spread to other products such as motorcycles power equipment engines robots aircraft and bikes Mars extended its brand to ice cream Caterpillar to shoes and watches Michelin to a restaurant guide Adidas and Puma to personal hygiene Dunlop extended its brand from tires to other rubber products such as shoes golf balls tennis racquets and adhesives Frequently the product is no different from what else is on the market except a brand name marking Brand is product identity br There is a difference between brand extension and line extension A line extension is when a current brand name is used to enter a new market segment in the existing product class with new varieties or flavors or sizes br When Coca Cola launched Diet Coke and Cherry Coke they stayed within the originating product category non alcoholic carbonated beverages Procter Gamble did likewise extending its strong lines such as Fairy Soap into neighboring products Fairy Liquid and Fairy Automatic within the same category dish washing detergents br The risk of over extension is brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment product area or quality price or cachet br br br Brand Collaborations br Brand collaborations refer to the participation of multiple firms in a branding initiative One of the most well known is co branding a strategy in which two firms combine their brands into a single product Most recently brands have engaged in unconventional brand collaborations defined as unexpected partnerships between well established brands and an unconventional partner seemingly at the opposite end of the design spectrum For example in Louis Vuitton partnered with the skateboarding brand Supreme br br br Multibranding strategy br Multibranding strategy is when a company gives each product a distinct name Multibranding is best used as an approach when each brand in intended for a different market segment Multibranding is used in an assortment of ways with selected companies grouping their brands based on price quality segments Individual brand names naturally allow greater flexibility by permitting a variety of different products of differing quality to be sold without confusing the consumer s perception of what br business the company is in or diluting higher quality products Procter Gamble a multinational consumer goods company that offers over brands each suited for different consumer needs For instance Head Shoulders that helps consumers relieve dandruff in the form of a shampoo Oral B which offers inter dental products Vicks which offers cough and cold products and Downy which offers dryer sheets and fabric softeners Other examples include Coca Cola Nestl Kellogg s and Mars br This approach usually results in higher promotion costs and advertising This is due to the company being required to generate awareness among consumers and retailers for each new brand name without the benefit of any previous impressions Multibranding strategy has many advantages There is no risk that a product failure will affect other products in the line as each brand is unique to each market segment Although certain large multiband companies have come across that the cost and difficulty of implementing a multibranding strategy can overshadow the benefits For example Unilever the world s third largest multination consumer goods company recently streamlined its brands from over brands to center their attention onto brands with sales of over billion euros Unilever accomplished this through product deletion and sales to other companies Other multibrand companies introduce new product brands as a protective measure to respond to competition called fighting brands or fighter brands br Cannibalization is a particular challenge with a multi brand strategy approach in which the new brand takes business away from an established one which the organization also owns This may be acceptable indeed to be expected if there is a net gain overall Alternatively it may be the price the organization is willing to pay for shifting its position in the market the new product being one stage in this process br br br Fighting brands br br The main purpose of fighting brands is to challenge competitor brands For example Qantas Australia s largest flag carrier airline introduced Jetstar to go head to head against the low cost carrier Virgin Australia formerly known as Virgin Blue Jetstar is an Australian low cost airline for budget conscious travellers but it receives many negative reviews due to this The launching of Jetstar allowed Qantas to rival Virgin Australia without the criticism being affiliated with Qantas because of the distinct brand name br br br Private branding strategy br br Private branding also known as reseller branding private labelling store brands or own brands have increased in popularity Private branding is when a company manufactures products but it is sold under the brand name of a wholesaler or retailer Private branding is popular because it typically produces high profits for manufacturers and resellers The pricing of private brand product are usually cheaper compared to competing name brands Consumers are commonly deterred by these prices in good economic circumstances as it sets a perception of lower quality and standard but this view shifts in less ideal economic circumstances br In Australia their leading supermarket chains both Woolworths and Coles are saturated with store brands or private labels For example in the United States Paragon Trade Brands Ralcorp Holdings and Rayovac are major suppliers of diapers grocery products and private label alkaline batteries correspondingly Costco Walmart RadioShack Sears and Kroger are large retailers that have their own brand names Similarly Macy s a mid range chain of department stores offers a wide catalogue of private brands exclusive to their stores from brands such as First Impressions which supply newborn and infant clothing Hotel Collection which supply luxury linens and mattresses and Tasso Elba which supply European inspired menswear They use private branding strategy to specifically target consumer markets br br br Mixed branding strategy br Mixed branding strategy is where a firm markets products under its own name s and that of a reseller because the segment attracted to the reseller is different from its own market br For example Elizabeth Arden Inc a major American cosmetics and fragrance company uses mixed branding strategy The company sells its Elizabeth Arden brand through department stores and line of skin care products at Walmart with the skin simple brand name Companies such as Whirlpool Del Monte and Dial produce private brands of home appliances pet foods and soap correspondingly Other examples of mixed branding strategy include Michelin Epson Microsoft Gillette and Toyota Michelin one of the largest tire manufacturers allowed Sears an American retail chain to place their brand name on the tires Microsoft a multinational technology company is seriously regarded as a corporate technology brand but it sells its versatile home entertainment hub under the brand Xbox to better align with the new and crazy identity Gillette catered to females with Gillette for Women which has now become known as Venus The launch of Venus was conducted in order to fulfil the feminine market of the previously dominating masculine razor industry Similarly Toyota an automobile manufacturer used mixed branding In the U S Toyota was regarded as a valuable car brand being economical family orientated and known as a vehicle that rarely broke down But Toyota sought out to fulfil a higher end expensive market segment thus they created Lexus the luxury vehicle division of premium cars br br br Attitude branding and iconic brands br Attitude branding is the choice to represent a larger feeling which is not necessarily connected with the product or consumption of the product at all Marketing labeled as attitude branding include that of Nike Starbucks The Body Shop Safeway and Apple In the book No Logo Naomi Klein describes attitude branding as a fetish strategy Schaefer and Kuehlwein analyzed brands such as Apple Ben Jerry s or Chanel describing them as Ueber Brands brands that are able to gain and retain meaning beyond the material br br A great brand raises the bar it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience whether it s the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you re drinking really matters Howard Schultz President CEO and Chairman of Starbucks br br Iconic brands are defined as having aspects that contribute to consumer s self expression and personal identity Brands whose value to consumers comes primarily from having identity value are said to be identity brands Some of these brands have such a strong identity that they become more or less cultural icons which makes them iconic brands Examples are Apple Nike and Harley Davidson Many iconic brands include almost ritual like behaviour in purchasing or consuming the products br There are four key elements to creating iconic brands Holt br br Necessary conditions The performance of the product must at least be acceptable preferably with a reputation of having good quality br Myth making A meaningful storytelling fabricated by cultural insiders These must be seen as legitimate and respected by consumers for stories to be accepted br Cultural contradictions Some kind of mismatch between prevailing ideology and emergent undercurrents in society In other words a difference with the way consumers are and how they wish they were br The cultural brand management process Actively engaging in the myth making process in making sure the brand maintains its position as an icon br Schaefer and Kuehlwein propose the following Ueber Branding principles They derived them from studying successful modern Prestige brands and what elevates them above mass competitors and beyond considerations of performance and price alone in the minds of consumers br br Mission Incomparable Having a differentiated and meaningful brand purpose beyond making money Setting rules that follow this purpose even when it violates the mass marketing mantra of Consumer is always Boss right br Longing versus Belonging Playing with the opposing desires of people for Inclusion on the one hand and Exclusivity on the other br Un Selling First and foremost seeking to seduce through pride and provocation rather than to sell through arguments br From Myth To Meaning Leveraging the power of myth Ueber Stories that have fascinated and guided humans forever br Behold Making products and associated brand rituals reflect the essence of the brand mission and myth Making it the center of attention while keeping it fresh br Living the Dream Living the brand mission as an organization and through its actions Thus radiating the brand myth from the inside out consistently and through all brand manifestations For Nothing is as volatile than a dream br Growth without End Avoiding to be perceived as an omnipresent diluting brand appeal Instead growing with gravitas by leveraging scarcity high prices sideways expansion and other means br br br No brand branding br Recently a number of companies have successfully pursued no brand strategies by creating packaging that imitates generic brand simplicity Examples include the Japanese company Muji which means No label in English from Mujirushi Ryohin literally No brand quality goods and the Florida company No Ad Sunscreen Although there is a distinct Muji brand Muji products are not branded This no brand strategy means that little is spent on advertisement or classical marketing and Muji s success is attributed to the word of mouth simple shopping experience and the anti brand movement br No brand branding may be construed as a type of branding as the product is made conspicuous through the absence of a brand name br Tapa Amarilla or Yellow Cap in Venezuela during the s is another good example of no brand strategy It was simply recognized by the color of the cap of this cleaning products company br br br Derived brands br br In this case the supplier of a key component used by a number of suppliers of the end product may wish to guarantee its own position by promoting that component as a brand in its own right The most frequently quoted example is Intel which positions itself in the PC market with the slogan and sticker Intel Inside br br br Social media brands br In The Better Mousetrap Brand Invention in a Media Democracy author and brand strategist Simon Pont posits that social media brands may be the most evolved version of the brand form because they focus not on themselves but on their users In so doing social media brands are arguably more charismatic in that consumers are compelled to spend time with them because the time spent is in the meeting of fundamental human drivers related to belonging and individualism We wear our physical brands like badges to help define us but we use our digital brands to help express who we are They allow us to be to hold a mirror up to ourselves and it is clear We like what we see br br br Private labels br br Private label brands also called own brands or store brands have become popular Where the retailer has a particularly strong identity such as Marks Spencer in the UK clothing sector this own brand may be able to compete against even the strongest brand leaders and may outperform those products that are not otherwise strongly branded br Designer Private Labels br A relatively recent innovation in retailing is the introduction of designer private labels Designer private labels involve a collaborative contract between a well known fashion designer and a retailer Both retailer and designer collaborate to design goods with popular appeal pitched at price points that fit the consumer s budget For retail outlets these types of collaborations give them greater control over the design process as well as access to exclusive store brands that can potentially drive store traffic br In Australia for example the department store Myer now offers a range of exclusive designer private labels including Jayson Brundson Karen Walker Leona Edmiston Wayne Cooper Fleur Wood and L for Lisa Ho Another up market department store David Jones currently offers Collette for leading Australian designer Collette Dinnigan and has recently announced its intention to extend the number of exclusive designer brands Target Australia has teamed up with Dannii Minogue to produce her Petites range Specsavers has joined up with Sydney designer Alex Perry to create an exclusive range of spectacle frames while Big W stocks frame designed by Peter Morrissey br br br Individual and organizational brands br With the development of the brand Branding is no longer limited to a product or service There are kinds of branding that treat individuals and organizations as the products to be branded Most NGOs and non profit organizations carry their brand as a fundraising tool The purpose of most NGOs is to leave a social impact so their brand becomes associated with specific social life matters Amnesty International Habitat for Humanity World Wildlife Fund and AIESEC are among the most recognized brands around the world NGOs and non profit organizations moved beyond using their brands for fundraising to express their internal identity and to clarify their social goals and long term aims Organizational brands have well determined brand guidelines and logo variables br br br Personal branding br br br Employer branding br br br Crowd sourced branding br These are brands that are created by the public for the business which is opposite to the traditional method where the business creates a brand br br br Personalized branding br Many businesses have started to use elements of personalization in their branding strategies offering the client or consumer the ability to choose from various brand options or have direct control over the brand Examples of this include the ShareACoke campaign by Coca Cola which printed people s names and place names on their bottles encouraging people AirBNB has created the facility for users to create their own symbol for the software to replace the brand s mark known as The B lo br br br Nation branding place branding and public diplomacy br br Nation branding is a field of theory and practice which aims to measure build and manage the reputation of countries closely related to place branding Some approaches applied such as an increasing importance on the symbolic value of products have led countries to emphasize their distinctive characteristics The branding and image of a nation state and the successful transference of this image to its exports is just as important as what they actually produce and sell br br br Destination branding br Destination branding is the work of cities states and other localities to promote the location to tourists and drive additional revenues into a tax base These activities are often undertaken by governments but can also result from the work of community associations The Destination Marketing Association International is the industry leading organization br br br Brand protection br br Intellectual property infringements in particular counterfeiting can affect consumer trust and ultimately damage brand equity Brand protection is the set of preventive monitoring and reactive measures taken by brand owners to eliminate reduce or mitigate these infringements and their effect br br br Doppelg nger brand image DBI br br A doppelg nger brand image or DBI is a disparaging image or story about a brand that it circulated in popular culture DBI targets tend to be widely known and recognizable brands The purpose of DBIs is to undermine the positive brand meanings the brand owners are trying to instill through their marketing activities br The term stems from the combination of the German words doppel double and g nger walker br Doppelg nger brands are typically created by individuals or groups to express criticism of a brand and its perceived values through a form of parody and are typically unflattering in nature br Due to the ability of doppelg nger brands to rapidly propagate virally through digital media channels they can represent a real threat to the equity of the target brand Sometimes the target organization is forced to address the root concern or to re position the brand in a way that defuses the criticism br Examples include br br Joe Chemo campaign organized to criticize the marketing of tobacco products to children and their harmful effects br Parody of the Pepsi logo as an obese man to highlight the relationship between soft drink consumption and obesity br The FUH campaign protesting the Hummer SUV as a symbol of corporate and public irresponsibility toward public safety and the environment br In the article Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelg nger Brand Image Thompson Rindfleisch and Arsel suggest that a doppelg nger brand image can be a
