Instructional design ID also known as instructional systems design and originally known as instructional systems development ISD is the practice of systematically designing developing and delivering instructional materials and experiences both digital and physical in a consistent and reliable fashion toward an efficient effective appealing engaging and inspiring acquisition of knowledge The process consists broadly of determining the state and needs of the learner defining the end goal of instruction and creating some intervention to assist in the transition The outcome of this instruction may be directly observable and scientifically measured or completely hidden and assumed There are many instructional design models but many are based on the ADDIE model with the five phases analysis design development implementation and evaluation br Robert M Gagn is considered one of the founders of ISD due to the great influence his work The Conditions of Learning has had on the discipline br br br History br br br Origins br As a field instructional design is historically and traditionally rooted in cognitive and behavioral psychology though recently constructivism has influenced thinking in the field This can be attributed to the way it emerged during a period when the behaviorist paradigm was dominating American psychology There are also those who cite that aside from behaviorist psychology the origin of the concept could be traced back to systems engineering While the impact of each of these fields is difficult to quantify it is argued that the language and the look and feel of the early forms of instructional design and their progeny were derived from this engineering discipline Specifically they were linked to the training development model used by the U S military which were based on systems approach and was explained as the idea of viewing a problem or situation in its entirety with all its ramifications with all its interior interactions with all its exterior connections and with full cognizance of its place in its context br The role of systems engineering in the early development of instructional design was demonstrated during World War II when a considerable amount of training materials for the military were developed based on the principles of instruction learning and human behavior Tests for assessing a learner s abilities were used to screen candidates for the training programs After the success of military training psychologists began to view training as a system and developed various analysis design and evaluation procedures In Edgar Dale outlined a hierarchy of instructional methods organized intuitively by their concreteness The framework first migrated to the industrial sector to train workers before it finally found its way to the education field br br br s br br B F Skinner s article The Science of Learning and the Art of Teaching suggested that effective instructional materials called programmed instructional materials should include small steps frequent questions and immediate feedback and should allow self pacing Robert F Mager popularized the use of learning objectives with his article Preparing Objectives for Programmed Instruction The article describes how to write objectives including desired behavior learning condition and assessment br In a committee led by Benjamin Bloom published an influential taxonomy with three domains of learning cognitive what one knows or thinks psychomotor what one does physically and affective what one feels or what attitudes one has These taxonomies still influence the design of instruction br br br s br Robert Glaser introduced criterion referenced measures in In contrast to norm referenced tests in which an individual s performance is compared to group performance a criterion referenced test is designed to test an individual s behavior in relation to an objective standard It can be used to assess the learners entry level behavior and to what extent learners have developed mastery through an instructional program br In Robert Gagn see below for more information described three domains of learning outcomes cognitive affective psychomotor five learning outcomes Verbal Information Intellectual Skills Cognitive Strategy Attitude Motor Skills and nine events of instruction in The Conditions of Learning which remain foundations of instructional design practices Gagne s work in learning hierarchies and hierarchical analysis led to an important notion in instruction to ensure that learners acquire prerequisite skills before attempting superordinate ones br In after analyzing the failure of training material Michael Scriven suggested the need for formative assessment e g to try out instructional materials with learners and revise accordingly before declaring them finalized br br br s br During the s the number of instructional design models greatly increased and prospered in different sectors in military academia and industry Many instructional design theorists began to adopt an information processing based approach to the design of instruction David Merrill for instance developed Component Display Theory CDT which concentrates on the means of presenting instructional materials presentation techniques br br br s br Although interest in instructional design continued to be strong in business and the military there was little evolution of ID in schools or higher education br However educators and researchers began to consider how the personal computer could be used in a learning environment or a learning space PLATO Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operation is one example of how computers began to be integrated into instruction Many of the first uses of computers in the classroom were for drill and skill exercises There was a growing interest in how cognitive psychology could be applied to instructional design br br br s br The influence of constructivist theory on instructional design became more prominent in the s as a counterpoint to the more traditional cognitive learning theory Constructivists believe that learning experiences should be authentic and produce real world learning environments that allow learners to construct their own knowledge This emphasis on the learner was a significant departure away from traditional forms of instructional design br Performance improvement was also seen as an important outcome of learning that needed to be considered during the design process The World Wide Web emerged as an online learning tool with hypertext and hypermedia being recognized as good tools for learning As technology advanced and constructivist theory gained popularity technology s use in the classroom began to evolve from mostly drill and skill exercises to more interactive activities that required more complex thinking on the part of the learner Rapid prototyping was first seen during the s In this process an instructional design project is prototyped quickly and then vetted through a series of try and revise cycles This is a big departure from traditional methods of instructional design that took far longer to complete br br br br Online learning became common Technology advances permitted sophisticated simulations with authentic and realistic learning experiences br In the Association for Educational Communications and Technology AECT changed the definition of Educational Technology to the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources br br br br Academic degrees focused on integrating technology internet and human computer interaction with education gained momentum with the introduction of Learning Design and Technology LDT majors Universities such as Bowling Green State University Pennsylvania State University Purdue San Diego State University Stanford Harvard University of Georgia California State University Fullerton and Carnegie Mellon University have established undergraduate and graduate degrees in technology centered methods of designing and delivering education br Informal learning became an area of growing importance in instructional design particularly in the workplace A study showed that formal training makes up only percent of the hours per year an average employee spends learning It also found that the learning output of informal learning is equal to that of formal training As a result of this and other research more emphasis was placed on creating knowledge bases and other supports for self directed learning br br br Instructional Design history br br br Robert Gagn br br Robert Gagn s work is widely used and cited in the design of instruction as exemplified by more than citations in prominent journals in the field during the period from through Synthesizing ideas from behaviorism and cognitivism he provided a clear template which is easy to follow for designing instructional events Instructional designers who follow Gagn s theory will likely have tightly focused efficient instruction br br br Taxonomy br Robert Gagn classified the types of learning outcomes by asking how learning might be demonstrated His domains and outcomes of learning correspond to standard verbs br br Cognitive Domain br Verbal information is stated state recite tell declare br Intellectual skills label or classify the concepts br Intellectual skills apply the rules and principles br Intellectual skills problem solve by generating solutions or procedures br Discrimination discriminate distinguish differentiate br Concrete Concept identify name specify label br Defined Concept classify categorize type sort by definition br Rule demonstrate show solve using one rule br Higher order rule generate develop solve using two or more rules br Cognitive strategies are used for learning adopt create originate br Affective Domain br Attitudes are demonstrated by preferring options choose prefer elect favor br Psychomotor Domain br Motor skills enable physical performance execute perform carry out br br br Nine events br According to Gagn learning occurs in a series of nine learning events each of which is a condition for learning which must be accomplished before moving to the next in order Similarly instructional events should mirror the learning events br br Gaining attention To ensure reception of coming instruction the teacher gives the learners a stimulus Before the learners can start to process any new information the instructor must gain the attention of the learners This might entail using abrupt changes in the instruction br Informing learners of objectives The teacher tells the learner what they will be able to do because of the instruction The teacher communicates the desired outcome to the group br Stimulating recall of prior learning The teacher asks for recall of existing relevant knowledge br Presenting the stimulus The teacher gives emphasis to distinctive features br Providing learning guidance The teacher helps the students in understanding semantic encoding by providing organization and relevance br Eliciting performance The teacher asks the learners to respond demonstrating learning br Providing feedback The teacher gives informative feedback on the learners performance br Assessing performance The teacher requires more learner performance and gives feedback to reinforce learning br Enhancing retention and transfer The teacher provides varied practice to generalize the capability br Some educators believe that Gagn s taxonomy of learning outcomes and events of instruction oversimplify the learning process by over prescribing However using them as part of a complete instructional package can assist many educators in becoming more organized and staying focused on the instructional goals br br br Influence br Robert Gagn s work has been the foundation of instructional design since the beginning of the s when he conducted research and developed training materials for the military Among the first to coin the term instructional design Gagn developed some of the earliest instructional design models and ideas These models have laid the groundwork for more present day instructional design models from theorists like Dick Carey and Carey The Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model Jerold Kemp s Instructional Design Model and David Merrill Merrill s First Principle of Instruction Each of these models are based on a core set of learning phases that include activation of prior experience demonstration of skills application of skills and integration or these skills into real world activities br Gagn s main focus for instructional design was how instruction and learning could be systematically connected to the design of instruction He emphasized the design principles and procedures that need to take place for effective teaching and learning His initial ideas along with the ideas of other early instructional designers were outlined in Psychological Principles in Systematic Development written by Roberts B Miller and edited by Gagn Gagn believed in internal learning and motivation which paved the way for theorists like Merrill Li and Jones who designed the Instructional Transaction Theory Reigeluth and Stein s Elaboration Theory and most notably Keller s ARCS Model of Motivation and Design br Prior to Robert Gagn learning was often thought of as a single uniform process There was little or no distinction made between learning to load a rifle and learning to solve a complex mathematical problem Gagn offered an alternative view which developed the idea that different learners required different learning strategies Understanding and designing instruction based on a learning style defined by the individual brought about new theories and approaches to teaching br Gagn s understanding and theories of human learning added significantly to understanding the stages in cognitive processing and instructions For example Gagn argued that instructional designers must understand the characteristics and functions of short term and long term memory to facilitate meaningful learning This idea encouraged instructional designers to include cognitive needs as a top down instructional approach br Gagn defines curriculum as a sequence of content units arranged in such a way that the learning of each unit may be accomplished as a single act provided the capabilities described by specified prior units in the sequence have already been mastered by the learner br His definition of curriculum has been the basis of many important initiatives in schools and other educational environments In the late s and early s Gagn had expressed and established an interest in applying theory to practice with particular interest in applications for teaching training and learning Increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of practice was of particular concern His ongoing attention to practice while developing theory continues to influence education and training br Gagn s work has had a significant influence on American education and military and industrial training Gagn was one of the early developers of the concept of instructional systems design which suggests the components of a lesson can be analyzed and should be designed to operate together as an integrated plan for instruction In Educational Technology and the Learning Process Educational Researcher Gagn defined instruction as the set of planned external events which influence the process of learning and thus promote learning br br br Learning design br The concept of learning design arrived in the literature of technology for education in the late s and early s with the idea that designers and instructors need to choose for themselves the best mixture of behaviourist and constructivist learning experiences for their online courses But the concept of learning design is probably as old as the concept of teaching Learning design might be defined as the description of the teaching learning process that takes place in a unit of learning e g a course a lesson or any other designed learning event br As summarized by Britain learning design may be associated with br br The concept of learning design br The implementation of the concept made by learning design specifications like PALO IMS Learning Design LDL SLD etc br The technical realisations around the implementation of the concept like TELOS RELOAD LD Author etc br br br Models br br br ADDIE process br Perhaps the most common model used for creating instructional materials is the ADDIE Model This acronym stands for the phases contained in the model Analyze Design Develop Implement and Evaluate br Brief History of ADDIE s Development The ADDIE model was initially developed by Florida State University to explain the processes involved in the formulation of an instructional systems development ISD program for military interservice training that will adequately train individuals to do a particular job and which can also be applied to any interservice curriculum development activity The model originally contained several steps under its five original phases Analyze Design Develop Implement and Evaluation and Control whose completion was expected before movement to the next phase could occur Over the years the steps were revised and eventually the model itself became more dynamic and interactive than its original hierarchical rendition until its most popular version appeared in the mid s as we understand it today br The five phases are listed and explained below br br Analyze The first phase of content development is Analysis Analysis refers to the gathering of information about one s audience the tasks to be completed how the learners will view the content and the project s overall goals The instructional designer then classifies the information to make the content more applicable and successful br Design The second phase is the Design phase In this phase instructional designers begin to create their project Information gathered from the analysis phase in conjunction with the theories and models of instructional design is meant to explain how the learning will be acquired For example the design phase begins with writing a learning objective Tasks are then identified and broken down to be more manageable for the designer The final step determines the kind of activities required for the audience in order to meet the goals identified in the Analyze phase br Develop The third phase Development involves the creation of the activities that will be implemented It is in this stage that the blueprints of the design phase are assembled br Implement After the content is developed it is then Implemented This stage allows the instructional designer to test all materials to determine if they are functional and appropriate for the intended audience br Evaluate The final phase Evaluate ensures the materials achieved the desired goals The evaluation phase consists of two parts formative and summative assessment The ADDIE model is an iterative process of instructional design which means that at each stage the designer can assess the project s elements and revise them if necessary This process incorporates formative assessment while the summative assessments contain tests or evaluations created for the content being implemented This final phase is vital for the instructional design team because it provides data used to alter and enhance the design br Connecting all phases of the model are external and reciprocal revision opportunities As in the internal Evaluation phase revisions should and can be made throughout the entire process br Most of the current instructional design models are variations of the ADDIE model br br br Rapid prototyping br An adaptation of the ADDIE model which is used sometimes is a practice known as rapid prototyping br Proponents suggest that through an iterative process the verification of the design documents saves time and money by catching problems while they are still easy to fix This approach is not novel to the design of instruction but appears in many design related domains including software design architecture transportation planning product development message design user experience design etc In fact some proponents of design prototyping assert that a sophisticated understanding of a problem is incomplete without creating and evaluating some type of prototype regardless of the analysis rigor that may have been applied up front In other words up front analysis is rarely sufficient to allow one to confidently select an instructional model For this reason many traditional methods of instructional design are beginning to be seen as incomplete naive and even counter productive br However some consider rapid prototyping to be a somewhat simplistic type of model As this argument goes at the heart of Instructional Design is the analysis phase After you thoroughly conduct the analysis you can then choose a model based on your findings That is the area where most people get snagged they simply do not do a thorough enough analysis Part of Article By Chris Bressi on LinkedIn br br br Dick and Carey br Another well known instructional design model is the Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model The model was originally published in by Walter Dick and Lou Carey in their book entitled The Systematic Design of Instruction br br Dick and Carey made a significant contribution to the instructional design field by championing a systems view of instruction in contrast to defining instruction as the sum of isolated parts The model addresses instruction as an entire system focusing on the interrelationship between context content learning and instruction According to Dick and Carey Components such as the instructor learners materials instructional activities delivery system and learning and performance environments interact with each other and work together to bring about the desired student learning outcomes The components of the Systems Approach Model also known as the Dick and Carey Model are as follows br br Identify Instructional Goal s A goal statement describes a skill knowledge or attitude SKA that a learner will be expected to acquire br Conduct Instructional Analysis Identify what a learner must recall and identify what learner must be able to do to perform particular task br Analyze Learners and Contexts Identify general characteristics of the target audience including prior skills prior experience and basic demographics identify characteristics directly related to the skill to be taught and perform analysis of the performance and learning settings br Write Performance Objectives Objectives consists of a description of the behavior the condition and criteria The component of an objective that describes the criteria will be used to judge the learner s performance br Develop Assessment Instruments Purpose of entry behavior testing purpose of pretesting purpose of post testing purpose of practice items practice problems br Develop Instructional Strategy Pre instructional activities content presentation Learner participation assessment br Develop and Select Instructional Materials br Design and Conduct Formative Evaluation of Instruction Designers try to identify areas of the instructional materials that need improvement br Revise Instruction To identify poor test items and to identify poor instruction br Design and Conduct Summative Evaluation br With this model components are executed iteratively and in parallel rather than linearly br br br Guaranteed Learning br The instructional design model Guaranteed Learning was formerly known as the Instructional Development Learning System IDLS The model was originally published in by Peter J Esseff PhD and Mary Sullivan Esseff PhD in their book entitled IDLS Pro Trainer How to Design Develop and Validate Instructional Materials br Peter Mary Esseff both received their doctorates in Educational Technology from the Catholic University of America under the mentorship of Gabriel Ofiesh a founding father of the Military Model mentioned above Esseff and Esseff synthesized existing theories to develop their approach to systematic design Guaranteed Learning aka Instructional Development Learning System IDLS In the Drs Esseffs created an eLearning course to enable participants to take the GL course online under the direction of Esseff br The components of the Guaranteed Learning Model are the following br br Design a task analysis br Develop criterion tests and performance measures br Develop interactive instructional materials br Validate the interactive instructional materials br Create simulations or performance activities Case Studies Role Plays and Demonstrations br br br Other br Other useful instructional design models include the Smith Ragan Model the Morrison Ross Kemp Model and the OAR Model of instructional design in higher education as well as Wiggins theory of backward design br Learning theories also play an important role in the design of instructional materials Theories such as behaviorism constructivism social learning and cognitivism help shape and define the outcome of instructional materials br Also see Managing Learning in High Performance Organizations by Ruth Stiehl and Barbara Bessey from The Learning Organization Corvallis Oregon ISBN br br br Motivational design br Motivation is defined as an internal drive that activates behavior and gives it direction The term motivation theory is concerned with the process that describes why and how human behavior is activated and directed br br br Motivation concepts br Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation br br Intrinsic defined as the doing of an activity for its inherent satisfactions rather than for some separable consequence When intrinsically motivated a person is moved to act for the fun or challenge entailed rather than because of external rewards Intrinsic motivation reflects the desire to do something because it is enjoyable If we are intrinsically motivated we would not be worried about external rewards such as praise br Examples Writing short stories because you enjoy writing them reading a book because you are curious about the topic and playing chess because you enjoy effortful thinking br Extrinsic reflects the desire to do something because of external rewards such as awards money and praise People who are extrinsically motivated may not enjoy certain activities They may only wish to engage in certain activities because they wish to receive some external reward br Examples The writer who only writes poems to be submitted to poetry contests a person who dislikes sales but accepts a sales position because he she desires to earn an above average salary and a person selecting a major in college based on salary and prestige rather than personal interest br John Keller br has devoted his career to researching and understanding motivation in instructional systems These decades of work constitute a major contribution to the instructional design field First by applying motivation theories systematically to design theory Second in developing a unique problem solving process he calls the ARCS Motivation br br br ARCS MODEL br The ARCS Model of Motivational Design was created by John Keller while he was researching ways to supplement the learning process with motivation The model is based on Tolman s and Lewin s expectancy value theory which presumes that people are motivated to learn if there is value in the knowledge presented i e it fulfills personal needs and if there is an optimistic expectation for success The model consists of four main areas Attention Relevance Confidence and Satisfaction br Attention and relevance according to John Keller s ARCS motivational theory are essential to learning The first of key components for motivating learners attention and relevance can be considered the backbone of the ARCS theory the latter components relying upon the former br br br Components br br br Attention br The attention mentioned in this theory refers to the interest displayed by learners in taking in the concepts ideas being taught This component is split into three categories perceptual arousal which uses surprise or uncertain situations inquiry arousal which offers challenging questions and or problems to answer solve and variability which uses a variety of resources and methods of teaching Within each of these categories John Keller has provided further sub divisions of types of stimuli to grab attention Grabbing attention is the most important part of the model because it initiates the motivation for the learners Once learners are interested in a topic they are willing to invest their time pay attention and find out more br br br Relevance br Relevance according to Keller must be established by using language and examples that the learners are familiar with The three major strategies Keller presents are goal oriented motive matching and familiarity Like the Attention category Keller divided the three major strategies into subcategories which provide examples of how to make a lesson plan relevant to the learner Learners will throw concepts to the wayside if their attention cannot be grabbed and sustained and if relevance is not conveyed br br br Confidence br The confidence aspect of the ARCS model focuses on establishing positive expectations for achieving success among learners The confidence level of learners is often correlated with motivation and the amount of effort put forth in reaching a performance objective For this reason it s important that learning design provides students with a method for estimating their probability of success This can be achieved in the form of a syllabus and grading policy rubrics or a time estimate to complete tasks Additionally confidence is built when positive reinforcement for personal achievements is given through timely relevant feedback br br br Satisfaction br Finally learners must obtain some type of satisfaction or reward from a learning experience This satisfaction can be from a sense of achievement praise from a higher up or mere entertainment Feedback and reinforcement are important elements and when learners appreciate the results they will be motivated to learn Satisfaction is based upon motivation which can be intrinsic or extrinsic To keep learners satisfied instruction should be designed to allow them to use their newly learned skills as soon as possible in as authentic a setting as possible br br br Motivational Design Process br Along with the motivational components Attention Relevance Confidence and Satisfaction the ARCS model provides a process that can address motivational problems This process has phases Analysis Design Development and Evaluation with steps within the phases br br Step Obtain course information br Includes reviewing the description of the course the instructor and way of delivery the information br Step Obtain audience information br Includes collecting the current skill level attitudes towards the course attitudes towards the teacher attitudes towards the school br Step Analyze audience br This should help identify the motivational problem that needs to be addressed br Step Analyze existing materials br Identifying positives of the current instructional material as well as any problems br Step List objectives and assessments br This allows the creation of assessment tools that align with the objectives br Step List potential tactics br Brainstorming possible tactics that could fill in the motivational gaps br Step Select and design tactics br Integrates enhances and sustains tactics from the list that fit the situation br Step Integrate with instruction br Integrate the tactic that was chosen from the list into the instruction br Step Select and develop materials br Select materials modify to fit the situation and develop new materials br Step Evaluate and revise br Obtain reactions from the learner and determine satisfaction level br br br Motivating opportunities br Although Keller s ARCS model currently dominates instructional design with respect to learner motivation in Hardr and Miller proposed a need for a new design model that includes current research in human motivation a comprehensive treatment of motivation integrates various fields of psychology and provides designers the flexibility to be applied to a myriad of situations br Hardr proposes an alternate model for designers called the Motivating Opportunities Model or MOM Hardr s model incorporates cognitive needs and affective theories as well as social elements of learning to address learner motivation MOM has seven key
