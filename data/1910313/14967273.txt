id: 14967273
Regenerative design is an approach to designing systems or solutions that aims to work with or mimic natural ecosystem processes for returning energy from less usable to more usable forms Regenerative design uses whole systems thinking to create resilient and equitable systems that integrate the needs of society with the integrity of nature Regenerative design is an active topic of discussion in engineering landscape design food systems and community development br The regenerative design paradigm encourages designers to use systems thinking applied permaculture design principles and community development processes to design human and ecological systems The development of regenerative design has been influenced by approaches found in biomimicry biophilic design net positive design ecological economics circular economics as well as social movements such as permaculture transition and the new economy Regenerative design can also refer to the process of designing systems such as restorative justice rewilding and regenerative agriculture In other words regenerative refers to advances in Sustainable design since the s and the terms sustainable and regenerative are largely used interchangeably br br Regenerative design is increasingly being applied in such sectors as agriculture architecture community planning cities enterprises economics and ecosystem regeneration These designers are using green design principles observed in systems ecology and recognize that ecosystems are resilient largely because they operate in closed loop systems Using this model regenerative design seeks feedback at every stage of the design process Feedback loops are an integral to regenerative systems as understood by processes used in restorative practice and community development br Regenerative design is interconnected with the approaches of systems thinking and with New Economy movement The new economy considers that the current economic system needs to be restructured The theory is based on the assumption that people and the planet should come first and that it is human well being not economic growth which should be prioritized br Whereas the weak definition of sustainable development was to satisfy fundamental human needs today without compromising the possibility of future generations to satisfy theirs the goal of sustainable design was to develop restorative systems that are beneficial for humans and other species Sustainable design is participatory iterative and individual to the community and environment it is applied to It intends to revitalize communities human and natural resources and society as a whole br In recent years regenerative design is made possible on a larger scale using open source socio technical platforms and technological systems as used in SMART cities It includes community and city development processes like gathering feedback participatory governance sortition and participatory budgeting br br br History br br br Permaculture br The term permaculture was developed and coined by David Holmgren then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education s Department of Environmental Design and Bill Mollison senior lecturer in environmental psychology at University of Tasmania in The word permaculture originally referred to permanent agriculture but was expanded to stand also for permanent culture as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by Masanobu Fukuoka s natural farming philosophy Regenerative design is integral to permaculture design br In David Holmgren and Bill Mollison first started working together to develop the theory and practice of permaculture They met when Mollison spoke at a seminar at the Department of Environmental Design and began to work together During their first three years together Mollison worked at applying their ideas and Holmgren wrote the manuscript for what would become Permaculture One a perennial agricultural system for human settlements as he completed his environmental design studies and submitted it as the major reference for his thesis He then handed the manuscript to Mollison for editing and additions before it was published in br br br Regenerative organic agriculture br Robert Rodale son of American organic pioneer and Rodale Institute founder J I Rodale coined the term regenerative organic agriculture The term distinguished a kind of farming that goes beyond simply sustainable yield Regenerative organic agriculture takes advantage of the natural tendencies of ecosystems to regenerate when disturbed In that primary sense it is distinguished from other types of agriculture that either oppose or ignore the value of those natural tendencies This type of farming is marked by tendencies towards closed nutrient loops greater diversity in the biological community fewer annuals and more perennials and greater reliance on internal rather than external resources br John T Lyle a landscape architecture professor saw the connection between concepts developed by Bob Rodale for regenerative agriculture and the opportunity to develop regenerative systems for all other aspects of the world While regenerative agriculture focused solely on agriculture Lyle expanded its concepts and use to all systems Lyle understood that when developing for other types of systems more complicated ideas such as entropy and emergy must be taken into consideration br br br In the built environment br In Lyle challenged his landscape architecture graduate students at California State Polytechnic University Pomona to envision a community in which daily activities were based on the value of living within the limits of available renewable resources without environmental degradation Over the next few decades an eclectic group of students professors and experts from around the world and crossing many disciplines developed designs for an institute to be built at Cal Poly Pomona In the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies opened after two years of construction In that same year Lyle s book Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development was published by Wiley In Lyle worked with William McDonough at Oberlin College on the design of the Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies completed in In McDonough s book the more popular and successful Cradle to Cradle Remaking the Way We Make Things was published reiterating the concepts developed by Lyle Swiss architect Walter R Stahel developed approaches entirely similar to Lyle s also in the late s but instead coined the term cradle to cradle design made popular by McDonough and Michael Braungart br Sim Van Der Ryn is an architect author and educator with more than years of experience integrating ecological principles into the built environment Author of eight publications one of his most influential books titled Ecological Design published in provides a framework for integrating human design with living systems The book challenges designers to push beyond green building to create buildings infrastructure and landscapes that truly restore and regenerative of the surrounding ecosystems br The Living Building Challenge LBC is recognized as the most progressive green building standard that can be applied to any building type around the world The goal is to create Living Buildings that incorporate regenerative design solutions that actually improve the local environment rather than simply reducing harm LBC was created by Jason F McLennan and administered by the non profit International Living Future Institute ILFI a global network dedicated to creating a healthy future for all In addition to the Living Building Challenge ILFI runs the Living Community Challenge Living Product Challenge Net Zero Energy Certification the Cascadia Green Building Council Ecotone Publishing Declare JUST and other leading edge programs br What if every single act of design and construction made the world a better place The Living Building Challenge LBC br br br Regenerative Cultures br Regenerative design advocate and author Daniel Christian Wahl argues that regenerative design is about sustaining the underlying pattern of health resilience and adaptability that maintain this planet in a condition where life as a whole can flourish In his book Designing Regenerative Cultures he argues that regeneration is not simply a technical economic ecological or social shift but has to go hand in hand with an underlying shift in the way we think about ourselves our relationships with each other and with life as a whole br br br Green vs sustainable vs regenerative vs net positive br There is an important distinction that should be made between the words green sustainable and regenerative and how they influence design br br br Green design br In the article Transitioning from green to regenerative design Raymond J Cole explores the concept of regenerative design and what it means in relation to green and sustainable design Cole identifies eight key attributes of green buildings br br Reduces damage to natural or sensitive sites br Reduces the need for new infrastructure br Reduces the impacts on natural feature and site ecology during construction br Reduces the potential environmental damage from emissions and outflows br Reduces the contributions to global environmental damage br Reduces resource use energy water materials br Minimizes the discomfort of building occupants br Minimizes harmful substances and irritants within building interiors br By these eight key attributes green design is accomplished by reducing the harmful damaging and negative impacts to both the environment and humans that result from the construction of the built environment Another characteristic that separates green design is that it is aimed at broad market transformation and therefore green building assessment frameworks and tools are typically generic in nature br br br Sustainable design br br Sustainable and green are for the most part used interchangeably however there is a slight distinction between them Green design is centralized around specifically decreasing environmental impacts from human development whereas sustainability can be viewed through an environmental economic or social lens The implication is that sustainability can be incorporated into all three aspects of the Triple Bottom Line people planet profit br The definition of sustainable or sustainability has been widely accepted as the ability to meet the needs of the current generation without depleting the resources needed to meet the needs of future generations It promotes a bio centric view that places the human presence within a larger natural context and focuses on constraints and on fundamental values and behavioral change David Orr defines two approaches to sustainability in his book Ecological Literacy technological sustainability and ecological sustainability Technological sustainability emphasizes the anthropocentric view by focusing on making technological and engineering processes more efficient whereas ecological sustainability emphasizes the bio centric view and focuses on enabling and maintaining the essential and natural functions of ecosystems br The sustainability movement has gained momentum over the last two decades with interest from all sectors increasing rapidly each year In the book Regenerative Development and Design A Framework for Evolving Sustainability the Regenesis Group asserts that the sustainability debate is shifting from whether we should work on sustainability to how we re going to get it done Sustainability was first viewed as a steady state of equilibrium in which there was a balance between inputs and outputs with the idea that sustainable practices meant future resources were not compromised by current processes As this idea of sustainability and sustainable building has become more widely accepted and adopted the idea of net zero and even net positive have become topics of interest These relatively newer concepts focus on positively impacting the surrounding environment of a building rather than simply reducing the negative impacts br br br Regenerative design br J T Gibberd argued a building is an element set within wider human endeavors and is necessarily dependent on this context Thus a building can support sustainable patterns of living but in and of itself cannot be sustainable Regenerative design goes a step further than sustainable design In a regenerative system feedback loops allow for adaptability dynamism and emergence to create and develop resilient and flourishing eco systems Cole highlights a key distinction of regenerative design is the recognition and emphasis of the co evolutionary partnered relationship between human and natural systems and thus importance of project location and place Bruno Duarte Dias asserts that regenerative design goes beyond the traditional weighing and measuring of various environmental social and economic impacts of sustainable design and instead focuses on mapping relationships Dias is in agreement with Cole stating three fundamental aspects of regenerative design which include understanding place and its unique patterns designing for harmony within place and co evolution br Net positive design br Positive Development PD theory and net positive design emerged from as a critique of sustainable and regenerative design It argued that buildings landscapes and infrastructure that restore the damage they do over their lifecycle are in reality negative in the context of the overshoot of planetary boundaries The thesis was that buildings could in fact have net positive global outcomes that reverse ecocide and environmental injustices However as the textbook Positive Development explained current institutions of governance planning and decision making as well as design must be redesigned and retrofitted on radically different premises br A subsequent textbook Net Positive Design detailed the theory and explained the STARfish net positive design app a free online resource which guides synergistic adaptable and multi functional net positive design The app is also used for building assessment The STARfish inverts three dozen fundamental flaws with both quantitative and qualitative green building certification or rating tools In Positive Development a building is not sustainable if it merely has more good than bad impacts It must increase natural and social life support systems in absolute global terms sufficient to reverse its share of the cumulative and remote impacts of human expansion and consumption br br br Fundamental aspects br br br Co evolution of humans and nature br Regenerative design is built on the idea that humans and the built environment exist within natural systems and thus the built environment should be designed to co evolve with the surrounding natural environment Dias asserts that a building should serve as a catalyst for positive change The project does not end with the completion of construction and certificate of occupancy instead the building serves to enhance the relationships between people the built environment and the surrounding natural systems over a long period of time br br br Designing in context of place br Understanding the location of the project the unique dynamics of the site and the relationship of the project to the living natural systems is a fundamental concept in the regenerative design process In their article Designing from place a regenerative framework and methodology Pamela Mang and Bill Reed define place as a unique multilayered network of living systems within a geographic region that results from the complex interactions through time of the natural ecology climate mineral and other deposits soil vegetation water and wildlife etc and culture distinctive customs expressions of values economic activities forms of association ideas for education traditions etc A systems based approach to design in which the design team looks at the building within the larger system is crucial br br br Gardener analogy br Beatrice Benne and Pamela Mang emphasize the importance of the distinction between working with a place rather than working on a place within the regenerative design process They use an analogy of a gardener to re define the role of a designer in the building process A gardener does not make a garden Instead a skilled gardener is one who has developed an understanding of the key processes operating in the garden and thus the gardener makes judicious decisions on how and where to intervene to reestablish the flows of energy that are vital to the health of the garden In the same way a designer does not create a thriving ecosystem rather they make decisions that indirectly influence whether the ecosystem degrades or flourishes over time This requires designers to push beyond the prescriptive and narrow way of thinking they have been taught and use complex systems thinking that will be ambiguous and overwhelming at times This includes accepting that the solutions do not exclusively lie in technological advancements and are instead a combination of sustainable technologies and an understanding of the natural flow of resources and underlying ecological processes Benne and Mang identify these challenges and state the most difficult of these will be shifting from a mechanistic to an ecological worldview The tendency is to view building as the physical processes of the structure rather than the complex network of relationships the building has with the surrounding environment including the natural systems and the human community br br br Conservation vs preservation br Regenerative design places more importance on conservation and biodiversity rather than on preservation It is recognized in regenerative design that humans are a part of natural ecosystems To exclude people is to create dense areas that destroy pockets of existing ecosystems while preserving pockets of ecosystems without allowing them to change naturally over time br br br Regenerative design frameworks br There are a few regenerative design frameworks that have been developed in recent years Unlike many green building rating systems these frameworks are not prescriptive checklists Instead they are conceptual and meant to guide dialogue throughout the design process They should not be used exclusively rather in conjunction with existing green building rating systems such as LEED BREEAM or Living Building Challenge br br br REGEN br The regenerative design framework REGEN was proposed by Berkebile Nelson Immenschuh McDowell BNIM a US architectural firm for the US Green Building Council USGBC The tool was intended to be a web based data rich framework to guide dialogue between professionals in the design and development process as well as address the gap in information and integration of information The framework has three components br br Framework the framework encourages systems thinking and collaboration as well as linking individual strategies to the goals of the project as a whole br Resources the framework includes place based data and information for project teams to use br Projects the framework includes examples of successful projects that have incorporated regenerative ideas into the design as models for project teams br br br LENSES br Living Environments in Natural Social and Economic Systems LENSES was created by Colorado State University s Institute for the Built Environment The framework is intended to be process based rather than product based The goals of the framework include br br to direct the development of eco regional guiding principles for living built environments br to illustrate connections and relationships between sustainability issues br to guide collaborative dialogue br to present complex concepts quickly and effectively to development teams and decision makers br The framework consists of three lenses Foundational Lens Aspects of Place Lens and Flows Lens The lenses work together to guide the design process emphasizing the guiding principles and core values understanding the delicate relationship between building and place and how elements flow through the natural and human systems br br br Case study VanDusen Botanical Garden br The Visitor Centre at the VanDusen Botanical Garden in Vancouver British Columbia was designed in parallel with the regenerative design framework developed by Perkins Will The site of the new visitor center was m and the building itself m A four stage process was identified and included education and project aspirations goal setting strategies and synergies and whole systems approaches Each stage raises important questions that require the design team to define place and look at the project in a much larger context identify key resources flows and understand the complex holistic systems determine synergistic relationships and identify approaches that provoke the coevolution of both humans and ecological systems The visitor centre was the first project that Perkins Will worked on in collaboration with an ecologist Incorporating an ecologist on the project team allowed the team to focus on the project from a larger scale and understand how the building and its specific design would interact with the surrounding ecosystem through its energy water and environmental performance br br br For retrofitting existing buildings br br br Importance and implications br It is said that the majority of buildings estimated to exist in the year have already been built Additionally current buildings account for roughly percent of the total energy consumption within the United States This means that in order to meet climate change goals such as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions existing buildings need to be updated to reflect sustainable and regenerative design strategies br br br Strategies br Craft et al attempted to create a regenerative design model that could be applied to retrofitting existing buildings This model was prompted by the large number of currently existing buildings projected to be present in The model presented in this article for building retrofits follows a Levels of Work framework consisting of four levels that are said to be pertinent in increasing the vitality viability and capacity for evolution which require a deep understanding of place and how the building interacts with the natural systems These four levels are classified as either proactive or reactive and include regenerate improve maintain and operate br br br Case study br br br University of New South Wales br Craft et al present a case study in which the chemical science building at the University of New South Wales was retrofitted to incorporate these regenerative design principles The strategy uses biophilia to improve occupants health and wellbeing by strengthening their connection to nature The facade acts as a vertical ecosystem by providing habitats for indigenous wildlife to increase biodiversity This included the addition of balconies to increase the connection between humans and nature br br br Regenerative agriculture br Regenerative farming or regenerative agriculture calls for the creation of demand on agricultural systems to produce food in a way that is beneficial to the production and the ecology of the environment It uses the science of systems ecology and the design and application through permaculture As understanding of its benefits to human biology and ecological systems that sustain us is increased as has the demand for organic food Organic food grown using regenerative and permaculture design increases the biodiversity and is used to develop business models that regenerate communities Whereas some foods are organic some are not strictly regenerative because it is not clearly seeking to maximize biodiversity and the resilience of the environment and the workforce Regenerative agriculture grows organic produce through ethical supply chains zero waste policies fair wages staff development and wellbeing and in some cases cooperative and social enterprise models It seeks to benefit the staff along the supply chain customers and ecosystems with the outcome of human and ecological restoration and regeneration br br br Size of regenerative systems br The size of the regenerative system affects the complexity of the design process The smaller a system is designed the more likely it is to be resilient and regenerative Multiple small regenerative systems that are put together to create larger regenerative systems help to create supplies for multiple human inclusive ecological systems br br br See also br br br br br br External links br Design for Human
