Defensive design is the practice of planning for contingencies in the design stage of a project or undertaking Essentially it is the practice of anticipating all possible ways that an end user could misuse a device and designing the device so as to make such misuse impossible or to minimize the negative consequences For example if it is important that a plug is inserted into a socket in a particular orientation the socket and plug should be designed so that it is physically impossible to insert the plug incorrectly Power sockets are often keyed in such a manner to prevent the transposition of live and neutral They are also recessed in the wall in a way that makes it impossible to touch connectors once they become live br Defensive design in software engineering is called defensive programming Murphy s law is a well known statement of the need for defensive design and also of its ultimate limitations br br br Applications br br br Computer software br Implementation decisions and software design approaches can make software safer and catch user errors br br Data entry screens can sanitize inputs e g numeric fields contain only digits signs and a single decimal point if appropriate br Inputs can be checked for legitimate values e g for counts of workplace injuries or number of people injured the number can be but can t be negative and must be a whole number for number of hours worked in one week the amount for any specified employee can be can be fractional but can t be negative and can t be greater than nor more than times the number of days they were in attendance br A word processor requested to load a saved document should scan it to ensure it is in good form and not corrupted If it is corrupted the program should say so then either accept the partial document that was valid or refuse the entire document In either case it should remain running and not quit br br br Electronics br Many electrical connectors apply this principle by being asymmetric br br br See also br Defensible space theory br Fail safe br Idiot proof br Inherent safety br Poka yoke br Usability testing br br br
