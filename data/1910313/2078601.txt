Spacecraft design is a process where systems engineering principles are systemically applied in order to construct complex vehicles for missions involving travel operation or exploration in outer space This design process produces the detailed design specifications schematics and plans for the spacecraft system including comprehensive documentation outlining the spacecraft s architecture subsystems components interfaces and operational requirements and potentially some prototype models or simulations all of which taken together serve as the blueprint for manufacturing assembly integration and testing of the spacecraft to ensure that it meets mission objectives and performance criteria br Spacecraft design is conducted in several phases Initially a conceptual design is made to determine the feasibility and desirability of a new spacecraft system showing that a credible design exists to carry out the mission The conceptual design review ensures that the design meets the mission statement without any technical flaws while being internally consistent Next a preliminary design is carried out where the focus is on functional performance requirements definition and interface definition at both subsystem and system levels The preliminary design review evaluates the adequacy of the preliminary design In the following phase detailed design is drawn and coded for the system as a whole and all the subsystems and a critical design review is performed where it is evaluated whether the design is sufficiently detailed to fabricate integrate and test the system br Throughout spacecraft design potential risks are rigorously identified assessed and mitigated systems components are properly integrated and comprehensively tested The entire lifecycle including launch mission operations and end of mission disposal is taken into account An iterative process of reviews and testing is continuously employed to refine optimize and enhance the design s effectiveness and reliability In particular the spacecraft s mass power thermal control propulsion altitude control telecommunication command and data and structural aspects are taken into consideration Choosing the right launch vehicle and adapting the design to the chosen launch vehicle is also important Regulatory compliance adherence to International standards designing for a sustainable debris free space environment are some other considerations that have become important in recent times br Spacecraft design includes the design of both robotic spacecrafts satellites and planetary probes and spacecrafts for human spaceflight spaceships and space stations Human carrying spacecrafts require additional life support systems crew accommodations and safety measures to support human occupants as well as human factors engineering considerations such as ergonomics crew comfort and psychological well being Robotic spacecraftS require autonomy reliability and remote operation capabilities without human presence The distinctive nature and the unique needs and constraints related to each of them significantly impact spacecraft design considerations br Recent developments in spacecraft design include electric propulsion systems e g ion thrusters and Hall effect thrusters for high specific impulse propulsion solar sails using solar radiation pressure for continuous thrust without the need for traditional rockets additive manufacturing D printing and advanced materials e g advanced composites nanomaterials and smart materials for rapid prototyping and production of lightweight and durable components artificial intelligence and machine learning assisted autonomous systems for spacecraft autonomy and improved operational efficiency in long and faraway missions in situ resource utilization ISRU technologies for extraction and utilization of local resources on celestial bodies and CubeSats and other standardized miniature satellites for cost effective space missions around Earth br Spacecraft design involves experts from various fields such as engineering physics mathematics computer science etc who come together to collaborate and participate in interdisciplinary teamwork Furthermore international collaboration and partnerships between space agencies organizations and countries help share expertise resources and capabilities for the mutual benefit of all parties The challenges of spacecraft design drive technological innovation and engineering breakthroughs in professional and industrial sectors The complexity of spacecraft design engages students in STEM subjects science technology engineering and mathematics fosters scientific literacy and inspire the next generation of scientists engineers and innovators br br br Origin br br Spacecraft design was born as a discipline in the s and s with the advent of American and Soviet space exploration programs Since then it has progressed although typically less than comparable terrestrial technologies This is for a large part due to the challenging space environment but also to the lack of basic R D and other cultural factors within the design community On the other hand another reason for slow space travel application design is the high energy cost and low efficiency for achieving orbit This cost might be seen as too high a start up cost br br br Areas of engineering involved br Spacecraft design brings together aspects of various disciplines namely br br Astronautics for mission design and derivation of the design requirements br Systems engineering for maintaining the design baseline and derivation of subsystem requirements br Communications engineering for the design of the subsystems that communicate with the ground e g telemetry and perform ranging br Computer engineering for the design of the on board computers and computer buses This subsystem is mainly based on terrestrial technologies but unlike most of them it must cope with the space environment be highly autonomous and provide higher fault tolerance br It may incorporate space qualified radiation hardened components br Software engineering for the on board software which runs all the on board applications as well as low level control software This subsystem is very similar to terrestrial real time and embedded software designs br Electrical engineering for the design of the power subsystem which generates stores and distributes the electrical power to all the on board equipment br Control theory for the design of the attitude and orbit control subsystem which points the spacecraft correctly and maintains or changes the orbit according to the mission profile the hardware used for actuation and sensing in space is usually very specific to spacecraft br Thermal engineering for the design of the thermal control subsystem including radiators iinsulation ad heaters which maintains environmental conditions compatible with operations of the spacecraft equipment This subsystem has very space specific technologies since in space radiation and conduction usually dominate as thermal effects by opposition with Earth where convection is typically the main one br Propulsion engineering for the design of the propulsion subsystem which provides a means of transporting the spacecraft from one orbit to another br Mechanical engineering for the design of the spacecraft structures and mechanisms as well as the selection of materials for use in vacuum These include beams panels and deployable appendages or separation devices to separate from the launch vehicle br br br Spacecraft Subsystems br br br Structure br br The spacecraft bus carries the payload Its subsystems support the payload and help in pointing the payload correctly It puts the payload in the right orbit and keeps it there It provides housekeeping functions It also provides orbit and attitude maintenance electric power command telemetry and data handling structure and rigidity temperature control data storage and communication if required The payload and spacecraft bus may be different units or it may be a combined one The booster adapter provides the load carrying interface with the vehicle payload and spacecraft bus together br The spacecraft may also have a propellant load which is used to drive or push the vehicle upwards and a propulsion kick stage The propellant commonly used is a compressed gas like nitrogen a quid a such as monopropellant hydrazine or solid fuel which is used for velocity corrections and attitude control In a kick stage also called apogee boost motor propulsion module or integral propulsion stage a separate rocket motor is used to send the spacecraft into its mission orbit br While designing a spacecraft the orbit which is going to be used should be considered into thnt as it affects attitude control thermal design and the electric power subsystem But these effects are secondary as compared to the effect caused on the payload due to the orbit Thus while designing the mission the designer selects such an orbit which increases the payload performance The designer even calculates the required spacecraft performance characteristics such as pointing thermal control power quantity and duty cycle The spacecraft is then made which satisfies all the requirements br br br Attitude Determination and Control br br The attitude determination and control subsystem ADCS is used to change the attitude orientation of the spacecraft There are some external torques acting on the spacecraft along the axis passing through its center of gravity which can reorient the spacecraft in any direction or can give it a spin The ADCS nullifies these torques by applying equal and opposite torques using the proion and navigation Moment of inertia of the body is to be calculated to determine the external torques which also requires determination of vehicle s absolute attitude using sensors The property called gyroscopic stiffness is used to reduce the spinning effect br The simplest spacecraft achieve control by spinning or interacting with the Earth s magnetic or gravity fields Sometimes they are uncontrolled Spacecraft may have several bodies or they are attached to important parts such as solar arrays or communication antennas which need individual attitude pointing For controlling the appendage s attitude actuators are often used with separate sensors and controllers br The various types of control techniques used are br br Passive Control Techniques br Spin Control Techniques br Three axis Control Techniques br br br Telemetry tracking and command br br Telemetry tracking and command TT C is used for communication between spacecraft and the ground systems The subsystem functions are br br Controlling of spacecraft by the operator on Earth br Receive the uplink commands process and send them to other subsystems for implication br Receive the downlink commands from subsystems process and transmit them to Earth br Inform constantly about the spacecraft position br br br Communication br The process of sending information towards the spacecraft is called uplink or forward link and the opposite process is called downlink or return link Uplink consists of commands and ranging tones where as downlink consists of status telemetry ranging tones and even may include payload data Receiver transmitter and a wide angle hemispheric or omnidirectional antenna are the main components of a basic communication subsystem Systems with high data rates may even use a directional antenna if required The subsystem can provide us with the coherence between uplink and downlink signals with the help of which we can measure range rate Doppler shifts The communication subsystem is sized by data rate allowable error rate communication path length and RF frequency br The vast majority of spacecraft communicate using radio antennas satellite communication br A few spacecraft communicate using lasers either directly to the ground as with LADEE or between satellites as with OICETS Artemis Alphabus and the European Data Relay System br br br Power br The electrical power subsystem EPS consists of subunits br br Power Source Battery solar cell fuelcells thermoelectric couple br Storage unit No of batteries in series br Power Distribution Cabling switching shock protection br Power Regulation and Control To prevent battery overcharging and overheating br br br Thermal br br Thermal control subsystem TCS is used to maintain the temperature of all spacecraft components within certain limits Both upper and lower limits are defined for each component There are two limits namely operational in working conditions and survival in non working conditions Temperature is controlled by using insulators radiators heaters louvers and by giving proper surface finish to components br br br Propulsion br br The main function of the propulsion subsystem is to provide thrust so as to change the spacecraft s translational velocity or to apply torques to change its angular momentum There is no requirement of thrust and hence even no requirement of propulsion equipment in a simplest spacecraft But many of them need a controlled thrust in their system so their design includes some form of metered propulsion a propulsion system that can be turned on and off in small increments br Thrusting is used for the following purposes for changing the orbital parameters to control attitude during thrusting correct velocity errors maneuver counter disturbance forces e g drag and control and correct angular momentum The propulsion subsystem includes a propellant tankage distribution system pressurant and propellant controls It also includes thrusters or engines br br br Space mission architecture br Spacecraft design is always informed by the particular mission architecture of the spaceflight under consideration Typically a variety of mission architectures can be envisioned that would achieve the overall objective of the flight whether those objectives be to gather scientific data or merely transport cargo across the space environment to serve any variety of purposes governmental or economic br Spaceflight mission architectures will specify whether a spacecraft is to be autonomous or telerobotic or even be crewed so as to deal with particular exigencies or goals of the mission Other considerations include fast or slow trajectories payload makeup and capacity length of the mission or the level of system redundancy so that the flight can achieve various degrees of fault tolerance br br br br br Solar sails fly from science fiction into reality Popular Mechanics br br br External links br Media related
