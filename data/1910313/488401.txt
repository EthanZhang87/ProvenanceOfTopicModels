id: 488401
Sound design is the art and practice of creating soundtracks for a variety of needs It involves specifying acquiring or creating auditory elements using audio production techniques and tools It is employed in a variety of disciplines including filmmaking television production video game development theatre sound recording and reproduction live performance sound art post production radio new media and musical instrument development Sound design commonly involves performing see e g Foley and editing of previously composed or recorded audio such as sound effects and dialogue for the purposes of the medium but it can also involve creating sounds from scratch through synthesizers A sound designer is one who practices sound design br br br History br br The use of sound to evoke emotion reflect mood and underscore actions in plays and dances began in prehistoric times when it was used in religious practices for healing or recreation In ancient Japan theatrical events called kagura were performed in Shinto shrines with music and dance br br Plays were performed in medieval times in a form of theatre called Commedia dell arte which used music and sound effects to enhance performances The use of music and sound in the Elizabethan Theatre followed in which music and sound effects were produced off stage using devices such as bells whistles and horns Cues would be written in the script for music and sound effects to be played at the appropriate time br Italian composer Luigi Russolo built mechanical sound making devices called intonarumori for futurist theatrical and music performances starting around These devices were meant to simulate natural and man made sounds such as trains or bombs Russolo s treatise The Art of Noises is one of the earliest written documents on the use of abstract noise in the theatre After his death his intonarumori were used in more conventional theatre performances to create realistic sound effects br br br Recorded sound br Possibly the first use of recorded sound in the theatre was a phonograph playing a baby s cry in a London theatre in Sixteen years later Herbert Beerbohm Tree used recordings in his London production of Stephen Phillips tragedy NERO The event is marked in the Theatre Magazine with two photographs one showing a musician blowing a bugle into a large horn attached to a disc recorder the other with an actor recording the agonizing shrieks and groans of the tortured martyrs The article states these sounds are all realistically reproduced by the gramophone As cited by Bertolt Brecht there was a play about Rasputin written in by Alexej Tolstoi and directed by Erwin Piscator that included a recording of Lenin s voice Whilst the term sound designer was not yet in use some stage managers specialised as effects men creating and performing offstage sound effects using a mix of vocal mimicry mechanical and electrical contraptions and gramophone records A great deal of care and attention was paid to the construction and performance of these effects both naturalistic and abstract Over the twentieth century recorded sound effects began to replace live sound effects though often it was the stage manager s duty to find the sound effects and an electrician played the recordings during performances br Between and Charlie Richmond USITT s first Sound Design Commissioner oversaw efforts of their Sound Design Commission to define the duties responsibilities standards and procedures expected of a theatre sound designer in North America He summarized his conclusions in a document which although somewhat dated provides a succinct record of what was then expected It was subsequently provided to the ADC and David Goodman at the Florida USA local when they both planned to represent sound designers in the s br br br Digital technology br br MIDI and digital audio technology have contributed to the evolution of sound production techniques in the s and s Digital audio workstations DAW and a variety of digital signal processing algorithms applied in them allow more complicated soundtracks with more tracks and auditory effects to be realized Features such as unlimited undo and sample level editing allows fine control over the soundtracks br In theatre sound features of computerized theatre sound design systems have also been recognized as being essential for live show control systems at Walt Disney World and as a result Disney utilized systems of that type to control many facilities at their Disney MGM Studios theme park which opened in These features were incorporated into the MIDI Show Control MSC specification an open communications protocol for interacting with diverse devices The first show to fully utilize the MSC specification was the Magic Kingdom Parade at Walt Disney World s Magic Kingdom in September br The rise of interest in game audio has also brought more advanced interactive audio tools that are also accessible without a background in computer programming Some of such software tools termed implementation tools or audio engines feature a workflow that s similar to that in more conventional DAW programs and can also allow the sound production personnel to undertake some of the more creative interactive sound tasks that are considered to be part of sound design for computer applications that previously would have required a computer programmer Interactive applications have also given rise to many techniques in dynamic audio which loosely means sound that s parametrically adjusted during the program s run time This allows for a broader expression in sounds more similar to that in films because this way the sound designer can e g create footstep sounds that vary in a believable and non repeating way and that also corresponds to what s seen in the picture The digital audio workstation cannot directly communicate with game engines because the game s events often occur in an unpredictable order whereas traditional digital audio workstations as well as so called linear media TV film etc have everything occur in the same order every time the production is run Especially games have also brought in dynamic or adaptive mixing br The World Wide Web has greatly enhanced the ability of sound designers to acquire source material quickly easily and cheaply Nowadays a designer can preview and download crisper more believable sounds as opposed to toiling through time and budget draining shot in the dark searches through record stores libraries and the grapevine for often inferior recordings In addition software innovation has enabled sound designers to take more of a DIY or do it yourself approach From the comfort of their home and at any hour they can simply use a computer speakers and headphones rather than renting or buying costly equipment or studio space and time for editing and mixing This provides for faster creation and negotiation with the director br br br Applications br br br Film br br In motion picture production a Sound Editor Designer is a member of a film crew responsible for the entirety or some specific parts of a film s soundtrack In the American film industry the title Sound Designer is not controlled by any professional organization unlike titles such as Director or Screenwriter br The terms sound design and sound designer began to be used in the motion picture industry in At that time The title of Sound Designer was first granted to Walter Murch by Francis Ford Coppola in recognition for Murch s contributions to the film The Rain People The original meaning of the title Sound Designer as established by Coppola and Murch was an individual ultimately responsible for all aspects of a film s audio track from the dialogue and sound effects recording to the re recording mix of the final track The term sound designer has replaced monikers like supervising sound editor or re recording mixer for the same position the head designer of the final sound track Editors and mixers like Murray Spivack King Kong George Groves The Jazz Singer James G Stewart Citizen Kane and Carl Faulkner Journey to the Center of the Earth served in this capacity during Hollywood s studio era and are generally considered to be sound designers by a different name br The advantage of calling oneself a sound designer beginning in later decades was two fold It strategically allowed for a single person to work as both an editor and mixer on a film without running into issues pertaining to the jurisdictions of editors and mixers as outlined by their respective unions Additionally it was a rhetorical move that legitimised the field of post production sound at a time when studios were downsizing their sound departments and when producers were routinely skimping on budgets and salaries for sound editors and mixers In so doing it allowed those who called themselves sound designers to compete for contract work and to negotiate higher salaries The position of Sound Designer therefore emerged in a manner similar to that of Production Designer which was created in the s when William Cameron Menzies made revolutionary contributions to the craft of art direction in the making of Gone with the Wind br The audio production team is a principal member of the production staff with creative output comparable to that of the film editor and director of photography Several factors have led to the promotion of audio production to this level when previously it was considered subordinate to other parts of film br br Cinema sound systems became capable of high fidelity reproduction particularly after the adoption of Dolby Stereo Before stereo soundtracks film sound was of such low fidelity that only the dialogue and occasional sound effects were practical These sound systems were originally devised as gimmicks to increase theater attendance but their widespread implementation created a content vacuum that had to be filled by competent professionals Dolby s immersive Dolby Atmos format introduced in provides the sound team with tracks of audio that can be assigned to a bed that utilizes two overhead channels leaving tracks for audio objects that can be positioned around the theater independent of the sound bed Object positions are informed by metadata that places them based on X Y Z coordinates and the number of speakers available in the room This immersive sound format expands creative opportunities for the use of sound beyond what was achievable with older and surround sound systems The greater dynamic range of the new systems coupled with the ability to produce sounds at the sides behind or above the audience provided the audio post production team new opportunities for creative expression in film sound br Some directors were interested in realizing the new potential of the medium A new generation of filmmakers the so called Easy Riders and Raging Bulls Martin Scorsese Steven Spielberg George Lucas and others were aware of the creative potential of sound and wanted to use it br Filmmakers were inspired by the popular music of the era Concept albums of groups such as Pink Floyd and The Beatles suggested new modes of storytelling and creative techniques that could be adapted to motion pictures br New filmmakers made their early films outside the Hollywood establishment away from the influence of film labor unions and the then rapidly dissipating studio system br The contemporary title of sound designer can be compared with the more traditional title of supervising sound editor many sound designers use both titles interchangeably The role of supervising sound editor or sound supervisor developed in parallel with the role of sound designer The demand for more sophisticated soundtracks was felt both inside and outside Hollywood and the supervising sound editor became the head of the large sound department with a staff of dozens of sound editors that was required to realize a complete sound job with a fast turnaround br br br Theatre br br Sound design as a distinct discipline is one of the youngest fields in stagecraft second only to the use of projection and other multimedia displays although the ideas and techniques of sound design have been around almost since theatre started Dan Dugan working with three stereo tape decks routed to ten loudspeaker zones during the season of American Conservatory Theater ACT in San Francisco was the first person to be called a sound designer br A theatre sound designer is responsible for everything the audience hears in the performance space including music sound effects sonic textures and soundscapes These elements are created by the sound designer or sourced from other sound professionals such as a composer in the case of music Pre recorded music must be licensed from a legal entity that represents the artist s work This can be the artist themselves a publisher record label performing rights organization or music licensing company The theatre sound designer is also in charge of choosing and installing the sound system speakers sound desks interfaces and convertors playout cueing software microphones radio mics foldback cables computers and outboard equipment like FX units and dynamics processors br Modern audio technology has enabled theatre sound designers to produce flexible complex and inexpensive designs that can be easily integrated into live performance The influence of film and television on playwriting is seeing plays being written increasingly with shorter scenes which is difficult to achieve with scenery but easily conveyed with sound The development of film sound design is giving writers and directors higher expectations and knowledge of sound design Consequently theatre sound design is widespread and accomplished sound designers commonly establish long term collaborations with directors br br br Musicals br Sound design for musicals often focuses on the design and implementation of a sound reinforcement system that will fulfill the needs of the production If a sound system is already installed in the performance venue it is the sound designer s job to tune the system for the best use for a particular production Sound system tuning employs various methods including equalization delay volume speaker and microphone placement and in some cases the addition of new equipment In conjunction with the director and musical director if any the sound reinforcement designer determines the use and placement of microphones for actors and musicians The sound reinforcement designer ensures that the performance can be heard and understood by everyone in the audience regardless of the shape size or acoustics of the venue and that performers can hear everything needed to enable them to do their jobs While sound design for a musical largely focuses on the artistic merits of sound reinforcement many musicals such as Into the Woods also require significant sound scores see Sound Design for Plays Sound Reinforcement Design was recognized by the American Theatre Wing s Tony Awards with the Tony Award for Best Sound Design of a Musical until the season later reinstating in the season br br br Plays br Sound design for plays often involves the selection of music and sounds sound score for a production based on intimate familiarity with the play and the design installation calibration and utilization of the sound system that reproduces the sound score The sound designer for a play and the production s director work together to decide the themes and emotions to be explored Based on this the sound designer for plays in collaboration with the director and possibly the composer decides upon the sounds that will be used to create the desired moods In some productions the sound designer might also be hired to compose music for the play The sound designer and the director usually work together to spot the cues in the play i e decide when and where sound will be used in the play Some productions might use music only during scene changes whilst others might use sound effects Likewise a scene might be underscored with music sound effects or abstract sounds that exist somewhere between the two Some sound designers are accomplished composers writing and producing music for productions as well as designing sound Many sound designs for plays also require significant sound reinforcement see Sound Design for Musicals Sound Design for plays was recognized by the American Theatre Wing s Tony Awards with the Tony Award for Best Sound Design of a Play until the season later reinstating the award in the season br br br Professional organizations br Theatrical Sound Designers and Composers Association TSDCA br The Association of Sound Designers is a trade association representing theatre sound designers in the UK br United Scenic Artists USA Local USA which is integrated within IATSE represents theatrical sound designers in the United States br Theatrical Sound Designers in English Canada are represented by the Associated Designers of Canada ADC and in Qu bec by l Association des professionnels des arts du Qu bec APASQ br br br Music br In the contemporary music business especially in the production of rock music ambient music progressive rock and similar genres the record producer and recording engineer play important roles in the creation of the overall sound or soundscape of a recording and less often of a live performance A record producer is responsible for extracting the best performance possible from the musicians and for making both musical and technical decisions about the instrumental timbres arrangements etc On some particularly more electronic music projects artists and producers in more conventional genres have sometimes sourced additional help from artists often credited as sound designers to contribute specific auditory effects ambiences etc to the production These people are usually more versed in e g electronic music composition and synthesizers than the other musicians on board br In the application of electroacoustic techniques e g binaural sound and sound synthesis for contemporary music or film music a sound designer often also an electronic musician sometimes refers to an artist who works alongside a composer to realize the more electronic aspects of a musical production This is because sometimes there exists a difference in interests between composers and electronic musicians or sound designers The latter specialises in electronic music techniques such as sequencing and synthesizers but the former is more experienced in writing music in a variety of genres Since electronic music itself is quite broad in techniques and often separate from techniques applied in other genres this kind of collaboration can be seen as natural and beneficial br Notable examples of recognized sound design in music are the contributions of Michael Brook to the U album The Joshua Tree George Massenburg to the Jennifer Warnes album Famous Blue Raincoat Chris Thomas to the Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon and Brian Eno to the Paul Simon album Surprise br In Suzanne Ciani started her own production company Ciani Musica Inc which became the sound design music house in New York br br br Fashion br In fashion shows the sound designer often works with the artistic director to create an atmosphere fitting the theme of a collection commercial campaign or event br br br Computer applications and other applications br Sound is widely used in a variety of human computer interfaces in computer games and video games There are a few extra requirements for sound production for computer applications including re usability interactivity and low memory and CPU usage For example most computational resources are usually devoted to graphics Audio production should account for computational limits for sound playback with audio compression or voice allocating systems br Sound design for video games requires proficient knowledge of audio recording and editing using a digital audio workstation and an understanding of game audio integration using audio engine software audio authoring tools or middleware to integrate audio into the game engine Audio middleware is a third party toolset that sits between the game engine and the audio hardware br Interactivity with computer sound can involve using a variety of playback systems or logic using tools that allow the production of interactive sound e g Max MSP Wwise Implementation might require software or electrical engineering of the systems that modify sound or process user input In interactive applications a sound designer often collaborates with an engineer e g a sound programmer who s concerned with designing the playback systems and their efficiency br br br Awards br Sound designers have been recognized by awards organizations for some time and new awards have emerged more recently in response to advances in sound design technology and quality The Motion Picture Sound Editors and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognizes the finest or most aesthetic sound design for a film with the Golden Reel Awards for Sound Editing in the film broadcast and game industries and the Academy Award for Best Sound respectively In the rd Academy Awards merged Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing into one general Best Sound category In the Tony Award for Best Sound Design was created to honor the best sound design in American theatre on Broadway br North American theatrical award organizations that recognize sound designers include these br br Dora Mavor Moore Awards br Drama Desk Awards br Helen Hayes Awards br Obie Awards br Joseph Jefferson Awards br Major British award organizations include the Olivier Awards The Tony Awards retired the awards for Sound Design as of the season then reinstated the categories in
