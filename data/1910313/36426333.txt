Video game development has typically been funded by large publishing companies or are alternatively paid for mostly by the developers themselves as independent titles Other funding may come from government incentives or from private funding br Crowdfunding where the players of the video games pay to back the development efforts of a game has become a popular means of finding alternate investment routes As a way of game monetization the use of crowdfunding in video games has had a history for several years prior to but was not seen as viable and limited to small scale games The crowdfunding mechanism for video games received significant attention in February due to the success of Double Fine Adventure later renamed as Broken Age a point and click adventure game which raised more than million through the Kickstarter service greatly exceeding the initial request and becoming the highest funded project through Kickstarter at that time A further boost to the model was seen in July when the Ouya a low cost video game console to be built on the open Android system and designed to take advantage of the mobile video game trend surpassed million in funding By mid more than million has been pledged to video game related projects through Kickstarter alone br Less than half of video game crowd funded projects successfully raise their target funds br br br Crowdfunding br Crowdfunding is a means to raise money for a project by eliciting funds from potential users of the completed project While no third party is required for crowdfunding to occur web sites like Kickstarter have been created to act as an intermediate in the process they create space for project creators to share their project provide ways for users to pledge their funds and then supply the pledged funds to the creators for those projects that are successfully funded br Projects using the Kickstarter model generally create multiple tiers of support A minimum pledge assures that the funder will get the product in some form but higher pledges will include additional benefits In the case of video game related works this commonly can include being credited in the final work receiving promotional items like T shirts obtaining early access to the game or meeting the developers in person br br br History br The earliest game to have utilized crowdfunding may have been Mount Blade As the developers had trouble finding backing from traditional publishers they instead chose to ask for funding directly from interested individuals Mount Blade was funded developed and released before the popularization of purpose built online crowdfunding platforms br Prior to small independent video game developers had used Kickstarter and other crowdfunding services to generate capital for developing games However most of these were funded at small levels typically no more than the largest prior to was Brandon Boyer s Venus Patrol in October which gained over in funds Shortly before

Productions a film documentary company approached the studio Double Fine Productions with the prospect of making a film covering the development of a game within the studio At the time the studio s other development projects were backed from publisher funding which would likely have put restrictions on what could be documented Instead the developers opted to create a new game from scratch deciding to use Kickstarter to obtain funding for both the game and the documentary The studio opted to create an adventure game a game genre that has been languishing for more than a decade though one that Double Fine s president Tim Schafer has had an influential history in The project was tentatively titled Double Fine Adventure though has since been officially named Broken Age Schafer has noted that he has tried to convince publishers to fund adventure games since the decline of the genre but was always turned away br The two groups set a goal of for the combined effort considering for the video game development and the rest for the documentary Within the day of its announcement the project surpassed the goal and by the end of the month long effort had raised more than million Schafer noted that this amount surpassed the total budgets that his previous titles at LucasArts had been developed for With the additional funds Double Fine committed to developing the game for a wider range of platforms localizations and creating fully voiced dialog for the English version br The success of the Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter is said to be attributable to several factors First Schafer and Double Fine have an established reputation with video games players specifically through Schafer s reputation for humorous adventure games and Double Fine s previous fan favorite title Psychonauts br br br Expansion br br Following on the success of the Double Fine Adventure several other small developers saw the potential of Kickstarter to launch new projects Prior to Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter had reported about new video game related projects started each month a number that more than doubled after February further dollars pledged to these projects went from

commitment from investors and use the crowd funding mechanism to demonstrate the potential demand for the video game Such examples include Bloodstained Ritual of the Night which successfully sought at least in crowd funding to secure of the development funds from investors and Shenmue III which also obtained the required funding through Kickstarter to gain financial and development help from Sony

over figures In March Kickstarter announced it had achieved over billion in pledges with more than million of that dedicated for video gaming and tabletop gaming projects By mid Kickstarter reported over million in video game related pledges with over million for all game related projects br br br Backer motivations br A survey conducted by a research team at the University of Cologne examined the motivations of Kickstarter backers who pledged for video game projects in It found that the prime motive of a vast majority of respondents was to encourage creation of games in genres the backers perceived as under supplied and warned game developers against following the bandwagon by trying to fill the niches that have already been saturated by earlier crowdfunded projects Beyond that the study grouped backers into three categories based on other motivations they displayed from most to least numerous br br Supporters were driven by the desire to help a particular video game developer produce games without external constraints br Buyers were mainly interested in receiving finished games br Influencers saw crowdfunding as a way to affect change within the video game industry as a whole br Both supporters and influencers perceived video game developers as being strangled by the established conventions of the industry and the mainstream market such as video game publishers and while most backers wanted to be kept up to date about the development and features of the games they backed few were interested in directly influencing them The researchers concluded that backers are first and foremost consumers and the main effect of reward based crowdfunding is that it closes the information gap between the developer and the customer br The study also examined what influenced a backer s decision to pledge more or less money to a particular project and found that supporters generally tend to pledge smaller amounts of money to fewer projects than both buyers and influencers It identified three factors that influenced the pledged amount br br Overlap between the backer s perception of a particular project and their personal investment preference If the backer believed that backing a project was in line with their general investment motivation reflected by one of three categories above they would pledge more money to it br Trust between the developer and their backers The survey responders did not differentiate between competence based trust whether the developer can produce a high quality game and trust in the developer s integrity whether they will put all the resources they received into making it Furthermore trust was only a factor if the deviations between the project and the backer s investment preferences see above were minimal otherwise it was irrelevant br The funding goal The study found a correlation between higher project goals and higher pledges but abstained from making any conclusions about it citing unaccounted for external factors to be examined in later studies br Crowd funding also allow supporters get more valuable open source games with public domain GPL MIT or Apache license they can reuse for make new games and remixes modifications hacks Since crowd pay for development no need hide source code or have copyright against supporters br br br Crowdfunding risks br There are risks of such crowd funded games including the inability to complete the funding successfully In one example the development of the game Alpha Colony fell short of its goal by rendering the project unfunded as per Kickstarter s regulations In other cases the delivery of the product after a successful fundraising campaign may be left unfulfilled A notable case is that of Code Hero which had secured during its Kickstarter in early had initially expected to be shown at the August PAX convention but failed to materialize Further lack of updates through December led some of the Kickstarter backers to investigate the state of the project finding that Primer Labs had apparently used up the funding and had yet to finish the game Primer Labs Alex Peake had stated that they are looking for more investments to continue developing the game and still commits to releasing the game in the future However due to lack of communication and failure to provide any of the claimed rewards backers are looking towards legal options to recover their funding though are limited by some of the terms of agreements set in place by Kickstarter An update in early February included a message from Peake breaking down the use of the Kickstarter funds and promise to provide refunds and back pay to his developers once the game was released and took responsibility for the failure to meet the stated goals The game hasn t been released br Another example of such risks is Godus a god game developed by cans with the genre s pioneer Peter Molyneux at the lead The game was successfully funded in a Kickstarter campaign for about and the team delivered a mobile version for iOS systems and a Windows version that was developed through Steam s Early Access program However in early many supporters began to doubt if cans was going to finish the title and complete the additional Kickstarter stretch goals such as a Linux version as Molyneux had begun talking about the next game his studio would produce In response Molyneux stated that they were moving on from Godus and turned over most of the development to one of the campaign s backers while Molyneux and cans will still provide overarching guidance Supporters expressed concern in that they had bought into the Kickstarter based on Molyneux s creditials towards the god game genre and as such the final game may not reflect the product they actually had expected br br
