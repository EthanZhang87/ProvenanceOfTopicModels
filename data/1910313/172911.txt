Nuclear weapon designs are physical chemical and engineering arrangements that cause the physics package of a nuclear weapon to detonate There are three existing basic design types br br pure fission weapons are the simplest least technically demanding were the first nuclear weapons built and so far the only type ever used in warfare by the United States on Japan in World War II br boosted fission weapons increase yield beyond that of the implosion design by using small quantities of fusion fuel to enhance the fission chain reaction Boosting can more than double the weapon s fission energy yield br staged thermonuclear weapons are arrangements of two or more stages most usually two The first stage is normally a boosted fission weapon as above except for the earliest thermonuclear weapons which used a pure fission weapon instead Its detonation causes it to shine intensely with x radiation which illuminates and implodes the second stage filled with a large quantity of fusion fuel This sets in motion a sequence of events which results in a thermonuclear or fusion burn This process affords potential yields up to hundreds of times those of fission weapons br Pure fission weapons have been the first type to be built by new nuclear powers Large industrial states with well developed nuclear arsenals have two stage thermonuclear weapons which are the most compact scalable and cost effective option once the necessary technical base and industrial infrastructure are built br Most known innovations in nuclear weapon design originated in the United States though some were later developed independently by other states br In early news accounts pure fission weapons were called atomic bombs or A bombs and weapons involving fusion were called hydrogen bombs or H bombs Practitioners of nuclear policy however favor the terms nuclear and thermonuclear respectively br br br Nuclear reactions br Nuclear fission separates or splits heavier atoms to form lighter atoms Nuclear fusion combines lighter atoms to form heavier atoms Both reactions generate roughly a million times more energy than comparable chemical reactions making nuclear bombs a million times more powerful than non nuclear bombs which a French patent claimed in May br In some ways fission and fusion are opposite and complementary reactions but the particulars are unique for each To understand how nuclear weapons are designed it is useful to know the important similarities and differences between fission and fusion The following explanation uses rounded numbers and approximations br br br Fission br br When a free neutron hits the nucleus of a fissile atom like uranium U the uranium nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei called fission fragments plus more neutrons for U three about as often as two an average of just under per fission The fission chain reaction in a supercritical mass of fuel can be self sustaining because it produces enough surplus neutrons to offset losses of neutrons escaping the supercritical assembly Most of these have the speed kinetic energy required to cause new fissions in neighboring uranium nuclei br The uranium nucleus can split in many ways provided the charge numbers add up to and the mass numbers add up to uranium plus the neutron that caused the split The following equation shows one possible split namely into strontium Sr xenon Xe and two neutrons n plus energy br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br U br br br br n br br br br br br br br br br br br S br r br br br br br br br br br br br br X br e br br br br br br n br br br br br br M br e br V br br br br displaystyle mathrm U mathrm n longrightarrow mathrm Sr mathrm Xe mathrm n mathrm MeV br br br The immediate energy release per atom is about million electron volts MeV i e TJ kg Only of this is gamma radiation and kinetic energy of fission neutrons The remaining is kinetic energy or energy of motion of the charged fission fragments flying away from each other mutually repelled by the positive charge of their protons for strontium for xenon This initial kinetic energy is TJ kg imparting an initial speed of about kilometers per second The charged fragments high electric charge causes many inelastic coulomb collisions with nearby nuclei and these fragments remain trapped inside the bomb s fissile pit and tamper until their motion is converted into heat Given the speed of the fragments and the mean free path between nuclei in the compressed fuel assembly for the implosion design this takes about a millionth of a second a microsecond by which time the core and tamper of the bomb have expanded to plasma several meters in diameter with a temperature of tens of millions of degrees Celsius br This is hot enough to emit black body radiation in the X ray spectrum These X rays are absorbed by the surrounding air producing the fireball and blast of a nuclear explosion br Most fission products have too many neutrons to be stable so they are radioactive by beta decay converting neutrons into protons by throwing off beta particles electrons and gamma rays Their half lives range from milliseconds to about years Many decay into isotopes that are themselves radioactive so from to average decays may be required to reach stability In reactors the radioactive products are the nuclear waste in spent fuel In bombs they become radioactive fallout both local and global br Meanwhile inside the exploding bomb the free neutrons released by fission carry away about of the initial fission energy Neutron kinetic energy adds to the blast energy of a bomb but not as effectively as the energy from charged fragments since neutrons do not give up their kinetic energy as quickly in collisions with charged nuclei or electrons The dominant contribution of fission neutrons to the bomb s power is the initiation of subsequent fissions Over half of the neutrons escape the bomb core but the rest strike U nuclei causing them to fission in an exponentially growing chain reaction etc Starting from one atom the number of fissions can theoretically double a hundred times in a microsecond which could consume all uranium or plutonium up to hundreds of tons by the hundredth link in the chain Typically in a modern weapon the weapon s pit contains to kilograms to lb of plutonium and at detonation produces approximately to kilotonnes of TNT to TJ yield representing the fissioning of approximately kilograms lb of plutonium br Materials which can sustain a chain reaction are called fissile The two fissile materials used in nuclear weapons are U also known as highly enriched uranium HEU oralloy meaning Oak Ridge alloy or a combination of the last digit of the atomic number of uranium which is and the last digit of its mass number which is and Pu also known as plutonium or from and br Uranium s most common isotope U is fissionable but not fissile meaning that it cannot sustain a chain reaction because its daughter fission neutrons are not on average energetic enough to cause follow on U fissions However the neutrons released by fusion of the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium will fission U This U fission reaction in the outer jacket of the secondary assembly of a two stage thermonuclear bomb produces by far the greatest fraction of the bomb s energy yield as well as most of its radioactive debris br For national powers engaged in a nuclear arms race this fact of U s ability to fast fission from thermonuclear neutron bombardment is of central importance The plenitude and cheapness of both bulk dry fusion fuel lithium deuteride and U a byproduct of uranium enrichment permit the economical production of very large nuclear arsenals in comparison to pure fission weapons requiring the expensive U or Pu fuels br br br Fusion br br Fusion produces neutrons which dissipate energy from the reaction In weapons the most important fusion reaction is called the D T reaction Using the heat and pressure of fission hydrogen or deuterium D fuses with hydrogen or tritium T to form helium He plus one neutron n and energy br br br br br br br br br br br br br br D br br br br br br br br br br br br T br br br br br br br br br br br br H br e br br br n br br br br br M br e br V br br br br displaystyle mathrm D mathrm T longrightarrow mathrm He n mathrm MeV br br br The total energy output MeV is one tenth of that with fission but the ingredients are only one fiftieth as massive so the energy output per unit mass is approximately five times as great In this fusion reaction of the MeV of the energy released in the reaction shows up as the kinetic energy of the neutron which having no electric charge and being almost as massive as the hydrogen nuclei that created it can escape the scene without leaving its energy behind to help sustain the reaction or to generate x rays for blast and fire br The only practical way to capture most of the fusion energy is to trap the neutrons inside a massive bottle of heavy material such as lead uranium or plutonium If the MeV neutron is captured by uranium of either isotope MeV is high enough to fission both U and U or plutonium the result is fission and the release of MeV of fission energy multiplying the energy output tenfold br For weapon use fission is necessary to start fusion helps to sustain fusion and captures and multiplies the energy carried by the fusion neutrons In the case of a neutron bomb see below the last mentioned factor does not apply since the objective is to facilitate the escape of neutrons rather than to use them to increase the weapon s raw power br br br Tritium production br An essential nuclear reaction is the one that creates tritium or hydrogen Tritium is employed in two ways First pure tritium gas is produced for placement inside the cores of boosted fission devices in order to increase their energy yields This is especially so for the fission primaries of thermonuclear weapons The second way is indirect and takes advantage of the fact that the neutrons emitted by a supercritical fission spark plug in the secondary assembly of a two stage thermonuclear bomb will produce tritium in situ when these neutrons collide with the lithium nuclei in the bomb s lithium deuteride fuel supply br Elemental gaseous tritium for fission primaries is also made by bombarding lithium Li with neutrons n only in a nuclear reactor This neutron bombardment will cause the lithium nucleus to split producing an alpha particle or helium He plus a triton T and energy br br br br br br br br br br

mathrm T mathrm MeV br br br The neutrons are supplied by the nuclear reactor in a way similar to production of plutonium Pu from U feedstock target rods of the Li feedstock are arranged around a uranium fueled core and are removed for processing once it has been calculated that most of the lithium nuclei have been transmuted to tritium br Of the four basic types of nuclear weapon the first pure fission uses the first of the three nuclear reactions above The second fusion boosted fission uses the first two The third two stage thermonuclear uses all three br br br Pure fission weapons br br The first task of a nuclear weapon design is to rapidly assemble a supercritical mass of fissile weapon grade uranium or plutonium A supercritical mass is one in which the percentage of fission produced neutrons captured by other neighboring fissile nuclei is large enough that each fission event on average causes more than one follow on fission event Neutrons released by the first fission events induce subsequent fission events at an exponentially accelerating rate Each follow on fissioning continues a sequence of these reactions that works its way throughout the supercritical mass of fuel nuclei This process is conceived and described colloquially as the nuclear chain reaction br To start the chain reaction in a supercritical assembly at least one free neutron must be injected and collide with a fissile fuel nucleus The neutron joins with the nucleus technically a fusion event and destabilizes the nucleus which explodes into two middleweight nuclear fragments from the severing of the strong nuclear force holding the mutually repulsive protons together plus two or three free neutrons These race away and collide with neighboring fuel nuclei This process repeats over and over until the fuel assembly goes subcritical from thermal expansion after which the chain reaction shuts down because the daughter neutrons can no longer find new fuel nuclei to hit before escaping the less dense fuel mass Each following fission event in the chain approximately doubles the neutron population net after losses due to some neutrons escaping the fuel mass and others that collide with any non fuel impurity nuclei present br For the gun assembly method see below of supercritical mass formation the fuel itself can be relied upon to initiate the chain reaction This is because even the best weapon grade uranium contains a significant number of U nuclei These are susceptible to spontaneous fission events which occur randomly it is a quantum mechanical phenomenon Because the fissile material in a gun assembled critical mass is not compressed the design need only ensure the two subcritical masses remain close enough to each other long enough that a U spontaneous fission will occur while the weapon is in the vicinity of the target This is not difficult to arrange as it takes but a second or two in a typical size fuel mass for this to occur Still many such bombs meant for delivery by air gravity bomb artillery shell or rocket use injected neutrons to gain finer control over the exact detonation altitude important for the destructive effectiveness of airbursts br This condition of spontaneous fission highlights the necessity to assemble the supercritical mass of fuel very rapidly The time required to accomplish this is called the weapon s critical insertion time If spontaneous fission were to occur when the supercritical mass was only partially assembled the chain reaction would begin prematurely Neutron losses through the void between the two subcritical masses gun assembly or the voids between not fully compressed fuel nuclei implosion assembly would sap the bomb of the number of fission events needed to attain the full design yield Additionally heat resulting from the fissions that do occur would work against the continued assembly of the supercritical mass from thermal expansion of the fuel This failure is called predetonation The resulting explosion would be called a fizzle by bomb engineers and weapon users Plutonium s high rate of spontaneous fission makes uranium fuel a necessity for gun assembled bombs with their much greater insertion time and much greater mass of fuel required because of the lack of fuel compression br There is another source of free neutrons that can spoil a fission explosion All uranium and plutonium nuclei have a decay mode that results in energetic alpha particles If the fuel mass contains impurity elements of low atomic number Z these charged alphas can penetrate the coulomb barrier of these impurity nuclei and undergo a reaction that yields a free neutron The rate of alpha emission of fissile nuclei is one to two million times that of spontaneous fission so weapon engineers are careful to use fuel of high purity br Fission weapons used in the vicinity of other nuclear explosions must be protected from the intrusion of free neutrons from outside Such shielding material will almost always be penetrated however if the outside neutron flux is intense enough When a weapon misfires or fizzles because of the effects of other nuclear detonations it is called nuclear fratricide br For the implosion assembled design once the critical mass is assembled to maximum density a burst of neutrons must be supplied to start the chain reaction Early weapons used a modulated neutron generator codenamed Urchin inside the pit containing polonium and beryllium separated by a thin barrier Implosion of the pit crushes the neutron generator mixing the two metals thereby allowing alpha particles from the polonium to interact with beryllium to produce free neutrons In modern weapons the neutron generator is a high voltage vacuum tube containing a particle accelerator which bombards a deuterium tritium metal hydride target with deuterium and tritium ions The resulting small scale fusion produces neutrons at a protected location outside the physics package from which they penetrate the pit This method allows better timing of the first fission events in the chain reaction which optimally should occur at the point of maximum compression supercriticality Timing of the neutron injection is a more important parameter than the number of neutrons injected the first generations of the chain reaction are vastly more effective due to the exponential function by which neutron multiplication evolves br The critical mass of an uncompressed sphere of bare metal is kg lb for uranium and kg lb for delta phase plutonium In practical applications the amount of material required for criticality is modified by shape purity density and the proximity to neutron reflecting material all of which affect the escape or capture of neutrons br To avoid a premature chain reaction during handling the fissile material in the weapon must be kept subcritical It may consist of one or more components containing less than one uncompressed critical mass each A thin hollow shell can have more than the bare sphere critical mass as can a cylinder which can be arbitrarily long without ever reaching criticality Another method of reducing criticality risk is to incorporate material with a large cross section for neutron capture such as boron specifically B comprising of natural boron Naturally this neutron absorber must be removed before the weapon is detonated This is easy for a gun assembled bomb the projectile mass simply shoves the absorber out of the void between the two subcritical masses by the force of its motion br The use of plutonium affects weapon design due to its high rate of alpha emission This results in Pu metal spontaneously producing significant heat a kilogram mass produces watts of thermal power Such a piece would feel warm to the touch which is no problem if that heat is dissipated promptly and not allowed to build up the temperature But this is a problem inside a nuclear bomb For this reason bombs using Pu fuel use aluminum parts to wick away the excess heat and this complicates bomb design because Al plays no active role in the explosion processes br A tamper is an optional layer of dense material surrounding the fissile material Due to its inertia it delays the thermal expansion of the fissioning fuel mass keeping it supercritical for longer Often the same layer serves both as tamper and as neutron reflector br br br Gun type assembly br br Little Boy the Hiroshima bomb used kg lb of uranium with an average enrichment of around or kg lb of uranium just about the bare metal critical mass see Little Boy article for a detailed drawing When assembled inside its tamper reflector of tungsten carbide the kg lb was more than twice critical mass Before the detonation the uranium was formed into two sub critical pieces one of which was later fired down a gun barrel to join the other starting the nuclear explosion Analysis shows that less than of the uranium mass underwent fission the remainder representing most of the entire wartime output of the giant Y factories at Oak Ridge scattered uselessly br The inefficiency was caused by the speed with which the uncompressed fissioning uranium expanded and became sub critical by virtue of decreased density Despite its inefficiency this design because of its shape was adapted for use in small diameter cylindrical artillery shells a gun type warhead fired from the barrel of a much larger gun Such warheads were deployed by the United States until accounting for a significant fraction of the U in the arsenal and were some of the first weapons dismantled to comply with treaties limiting warhead numbers The rationale for this decision was undoubtedly a combination of the lower yield and grave safety issues associated with the gun type design br br br Implosion type br br For both the Trinity device and the Fat Man Nagasaki bomb nearly identical plutonium fission through implosion designs were used The Fat Man device specifically used kg lb about ml or US fl oz in volume of Pu which is only of bare sphere critical mass see Fat Man article for a detailed drawing Surrounded by a U reflector tamper the Fat Man s pit was brought close to critical mass by the neutron reflecting properties of the U During detonation criticality was achieved by implosion The plutonium pit was squeezed to increase its density by simultaneous detonation as with the Trinity test detonation three weeks earlier of the conventional explosives placed uniformly around the pit The explosives were detonated by multiple exploding bridgewire detonators It is estimated that only about of the plutonium underwent fission the rest about kg lb was scattered br br An implosion shock wave might be of such short duration that only part of the pit is compressed at any instant as the wave passes through it To prevent this a pusher shell may be needed The pusher is located between the explosive lens and the tamper It works by reflecting some of the shock wave backward thereby having the effect of lengthening its duration It is made out of a low density metal such as aluminium beryllium or an alloy of the two metals aluminium is easier and safer to shape and is two orders of magnitude cheaper beryllium has high neutron reflective capability Fat Man used an aluminium pusher br The series of RaLa Experiment tests of implosion type fission weapon design concepts carried out from July through February at the Los Alamos Laboratory and a remote site km mi east of it in Bayo Canyon proved the practicality of the implosion design for a fission device with the February tests positively determining its usability for the final Trinity Fat Man plutonium implosion design br The key to Fat Man s greater efficiency was the inward momentum of the massive U tamper The natural uranium tamper did not undergo fission from thermal neutrons but did contribute perhaps of the total yield from fission by fast neutrons After the chain reaction started in the plutonium it continued until the explosion reversed the momentum of the implosion and expanded enough to stop the chain reaction By holding everything together for a few hundred nanoseconds more the tamper increased the efficiency br br br Plutonium pit br br The core of an implosion weapon the fissile material and any reflector or tamper bonded to it is known as the pit Some weapons tested during the s used pits made with U alone or in composite with plutonium but all plutonium pits are the smallest in diameter and have been the standard since the early s br Casting and then machining plutonium is difficult not only because of its toxicity but also because plutonium has many different metallic phases As plutonium cools changes in phase result in distortion and cracking This distortion is normally overcome by alloying it with mMol by weight gallium forming a plutonium gallium alloy which causes it to take up its delta phase over a wide temperature range When cooling from molten it then has only a single phase change from epsilon to delta instead of the four changes it would otherwise pass through Other trivalent metals would also work but gallium has a small neutron absorption cross section and helps protect the plutonium against corrosion A drawback is that gallium compounds are corrosive and so if the plutonium is recovered from dismantled weapons for conversion to plutonium dioxide for power reactors there is the difficulty of removing the gallium br Because plutonium is chemically reactive it is common to plate the completed pit with a thin layer of inert metal which also reduces the toxic hazard The gadget used galvanic silver plating afterward nickel deposited from nickel tetracarbonyl vapors was used but thereafter and since gold became the preferred material Recent designs improve safety by plating pits with vanadium to make the pits more fire resistant br br br Levitated pit implosion br br The first improvement on the Fat Man design was to put an air space between the tamper and the pit to create a hammer on nail impact The pit supported on a hollow cone inside the tamper cavity was said to be levitated The three tests of Operation Sandstone in used Fat Man designs with levitated pits The largest yield was kilotons more than twice the yield of the unlevitated Fat Man br It was immediately clear that implosion was the best design for a fission weapon Its only drawback seemed to be its diameter Fat Man was metres ft wide vs centimetres ft for Little Boy br The Pu pit of Fat Man was only centimetres in in diameter the size of a softball The bulk of Fat Man s girth was the implosion mechanism namely concentric layers of U aluminium and high explosives The key to reducing that girth was the two point implosion design br br br Two point linear implosion br br In the two point linear implosion the nuclear fuel is cast into a solid shape and placed within the center of a cylinder of high explosive Detonators are placed at either end of the explosive cylinder and a plate like insert or shaper is placed in the explosive just inside the detonators When the detonators are fired the initial detonation is trapped between the shaper and the end of the cylinder causing it to travel out to the edges of the shaper where it is diffracted around the edges into the main mass of explosive This causes the detonation to form into a ring that proceeds inward from the shaper br Due to the lack of a tamper or lenses to shape the progression the detonation does not reach the pit in a spherical shape To produce the desired spherical implosion the fissile material itself is shaped to produce the same effect Due to the physics of the shock wave propagation within the explosive mass this requires the pit to be a prolate spheroid that is roughly egg shaped The shock wave first reaches the pit at its tips driving them inward and causing the mass to become spherical The shock may also change plutonium from delta to alpha phase increasing its density by but without the inward momentum of a true implosion br The lack of compression makes such designs inefficient but the simplicity and small diameter make it suitable for use in artillery shells and atomic demolition munitions ADMs also known as backpack or suitcase nukes an example is the W artillery shell the smallest nuclear weapon ever built or deployed All such low yield battlefield weapons whether gun type U designs or linear implosion Pu designs pay a high price in fissile material in order to achieve diameters between six and ten inches and cm br br br Hollow pit implosion br br A more efficient implosion system uses a hollow pit br A hollow plutonium pit was the original plan for the Fat Man bomb but there was not enough time to develop and test the implosion system for it A simpler solid pit design was considered more reliable given the time constraints but it required a heavy U tamper a thick aluminium pusher and three tons of high explosives br After the war interest in the hollow pit design was revived Its obvious advantage is that a hollow shell of plutonium shock deformed and driven inward toward its empty center would carry momentum into its violent assembly as a solid sphere It would be self tamping requiring a smaller U tamper no aluminium pusher and less high explosive br br br Fusion boosted fission br br The next step in miniaturization was to speed up the fissioning of the pit to reduce the minimum inertial confinement time This would allow the efficient fission of the fuel with less mass in the form of tamper or the fuel itself The key to achieving faster fission would be to introduce more neutrons and among the many ways to do this adding a fusion reaction was relatively easy in the case of a hollow pit br The easiest fusion reaction to achieve is found in a mixture of tritium and deuterium For fusion power experiments this mixture must be held at high temperatures for relatively lengthy times in order to have an efficient reaction For explosive use however the goal is not to produce efficient fusion but simply provide extra neutrons early in the process Since a nuclear explosion is supercritical any extra neutrons will be multiplied by the chain reaction so even tiny quantities introduced early can have a large effect on the outcome For this reason even the relatively low compression pressures and times in fusion terms found in the center of a hollow pit warhead are enough to create the desired effect br In the boosted design the fusion fuel in gas form is pumped into the pit during arming This will fuse into helium and release free neutrons soon after fission begins The neutrons will start a large number of new chain reactions while the pit is still critical or nearly critical Once the hollow pit is perfected there is little reason not to boost deuterium and tritium are easily produced in the small quantities needed and the technical aspects are trivial br The concept of fusion boosted fission was first tested on May in the Item shot of Operation Greenhouse Eniwetok yield kilotons br Boosting reduces diameter in three ways all the result of faster fission br br Since the compressed pit does not need to be held together as long the massive U tamper can be replaced by a light weight beryllium shell to reflect escaping neutrons back into the pit The diameter is reduced br The mass of the pit can be reduced by half without reducing yield Diameter is reduced again br Since the mass of the metal being imploded tamper plus pit is reduced a smaller charge of high explosive is needed reducing diameter even further br br The first device whose dimensions suggest employment of all these features two point hollow pit fusion boosted implosion was the Swan device It had a cylindrical shape with a diameter of in cm and a length of in cm br It was first tested standalone and then as the primary of a two stage thermonuclear device during Operation Redwing It was weaponized as the Robin primary and became the first off the shelf multi use primary and the prototype for all that followed br br After the success of Swan or inches or cm seemed to become the standard diameter of boosted single stage devices tested during the s Length was usually twice the diameter but one such device which became the W warhead was closer to a sphere only inches cm long br One of the applications of the W was the Davy Crockett XM recoilless rifle projectile It had a dimension of just inches cm and is shown here in comparison to its Fat Man predecessor inches cm br Another benefit of boosting in addition to making weapons smaller lighter and with less fissile material for a given yield is that it renders weapons immune to predetonation It was discovered in the mid s that plutonium pits would be particularly susceptible to partial predetonation if exposed to the intense radiation of a nearby nuclear explosion electronics might also be damaged but this was a separate problem RI was a particular problem before effective early warning radar systems because a first strike attack might make retaliatory weapons useless Boosting reduces the amount of plutonium needed in a weapon to below the quantity which would be vulnerable to this effect br br br Two stage thermonuclear br br Pure fission or fusion boosted fission weapons can be made to yield hundreds of kilotons at great expense in fissile material and tritium but by far the most efficient way to increase nuclear weapon yield beyond ten or so kilotons is to add a second independent stage called a secondary br In the s bomb designers at Los Alamos thought the secondary would be a canister of deuterium in liquefied or hydride form The fusion reaction would be D D harder to achieve than D T but more affordable A fission bomb at one end would shock compress and heat the near end and fusion would propagate through the canister to the far end Mathematical simulations showed it would not work even with large amounts of expensive tritium added br The entire fusion fuel canister would need to be enveloped by fission energy to both compress and heat it as with the booster charge in a boosted primary The design breakthrough came in January when Edward Teller and Stanislaw Ulam invented radiation implosion for nearly three decades known publicly only as the Teller Ulam H bomb secret br The concept of radiation implosion was first tested on May in the George shot of Operation Greenhouse Eniwetok yield kilotons The first full test was on November the Mike shot of Operation Ivy Eniwetok yield megatons br In radiation implosion the burst of X ray energy coming from an exploding primary is captured and contained within an opaque walled radiation channel which surrounds the nuclear energy components of the secondary The radiation quickly turns the plastic foam that had been filling the channel into a plasma which is mostly transparent to X rays and the radiation is absorbed in the outermost layers of the pusher tamper surrounding the secondary which ablates and applies a massive force much like an inside out rocket engine causing the fusion fuel capsule to implode much like the pit of the primary As the secondary implodes a fissile spark plug at its center ignites and provides neutrons and heat which enable the lithium deuteride fusion fuel to produce tritium and ignite as well The fission and fusion chain reactions exchange neutrons with each other and boost the efficiency of both reactions The greater implosive force enhanced efficiency of the fissile spark plug due to boosting via fusion neutrons and the fusion explosion itself provide significantly greater explosive yield from the secondary despite often not being much larger than the primary br br For example for the Redwing Mohawk test on July a secondary called the Flute was attached to the Swan primary The Flute was inches cm in diameter and inches cm long about the size of the Swan But it weighed ten times as much and yielded times as much energy kilotons vs kilotons br Equally important the active ingredients in the Flute probably cost no more than those in the Swan Most of the fission came from cheap U and the tritium was manufactured in place during the explosion Only the spark plug at the axis of the secondary needed to be fissile br A spherical secondary can achieve higher implosion densities than a cylindrical secondary because spherical implosion pushes in from all directions toward the same spot However in warheads yielding more than one megaton the diameter of a spherical secondary would be too large for most applications A cylindrical secondary is necessary in such cases The small cone shaped re entry vehicles in multiple warhead ballistic missiles after tended to have warheads with spherical secondaries and yields of a few hundred kilotons br As with boosting the advantages of the two stage thermonuclear design are so great that there is little incentive not to use it once a nation has mastered the technology br In engineering terms radiation implosion allows for the exploitation of several known features of nuclear bomb materials which heretofore had eluded practical application For example br br The optimal way to store deuterium in a reasonably dense state is to chemically bond it with lithium as lithium deuteride But the lithium isotope is also the raw material for tritium production and an exploding bomb is a nuclear reactor Radiation implosion will hold everything together long enough to permit the complete conversion of lithium into tritium while the bomb explodes So the bonding agent for deuterium permits use of the D T fusion reaction without any pre manufactured tritium being stored in the secondary The tritium production constraint disappears br For the secondary to be imploded by the hot radiation induced plasma surrounding it it must remain cool for the first microsecond i e it must be encased in a massive radiation heat shield The shield s massiveness allows it to double as a tamper adding momentum and duration to the implosion No material is better suited for both of these jobs than ordinary cheap uranium which also happens to undergo fission when struck by the neutrons produced by D T fusion This casing called the pusher thus has three jobs to keep the secondary cool to hold it inertially in a highly compressed state and finally to serve as the chief energy source for the entire bomb The consumable pusher makes the bomb more a uranium fission bomb than a hydrogen fusion bomb Insiders never used the term hydrogen bomb br Finally the heat for fusion ignition comes not from the primary but from a second fission bomb called the spark plug embedded in the heart of the secondary The implosion of the secondary implodes this spark plug detonating it and igniting fusion in the material around it but the spark plug then continues to fission in the neutron rich environment until it is fully consumed adding significantly to the yield br In the ensuing fifty years no one has come up with a more efficient way to build a thermonuclear bomb It is the design of choice for the United States Russia the United Kingdom China and France the five thermonuclear powers On September North Korea carried out what it reported as its first two stage thermo nuclear weapon test According to Dr Theodore Taylor after reviewing leaked photographs of disassembled weapons components taken before Israel possessed boosted weapons and would require supercomputers of that era to advance further toward full two stage weapons in the megaton range without nuclear test detonations The other nuclear armed nations India and Pakistan probably have single stage weapons possibly boosted br br br Interstage br In a two stage thermonuclear weapon the energy from the primary impacts the secondary An essential energy transfer modulator called the interstage between the primary and the secondary protects the secondary s fusion fuel from heating too quickly which could cause it to explode in a conventional and small heat explosion before the fusion and fission reactions get a chance to start br There is very little information in the open literature about the mechanism of the interstage Its first mention in a U S government document formally released to the public appears to be a caption in a graphic promoting the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program in If built this new design would replace toxic brittle material and expensive special material in the interstage This statement suggests the interstage may contain beryllium to moderate the flux of neutrons from the primary and perhaps something to absorb and re radiate the x rays in a particular manner There is also some speculation that this interstage material which may be code named Fogbank might be an aerogel possibly doped with beryllium and or other substances br The interstage and the secondary are encased together inside a stainless steel membrane to form the canned subassembly CSA an arrangement which has never been depicted in any open source drawing The most detailed illustration of an interstage shows a British thermonuclear weapon with a cluster of items between its primary and a cylindrical secondary They are labeled end cap and neutron focus lens reflector neutron gun carriage and reflector wrap The origin of the drawing posted on the internet by Greenpeace is uncertain and there is no accompanying explanation br br br Specific designs br While every nuclear weapon design falls into one of the above categories specific designs have occasionally become the subject of news accounts and public discussion often with incorrect descriptions about how they work and what they do Examples br br br Alarm Clock Sloika br br The first effort to exploit the symbiotic relationship between fission and fusion was a s design that mixed fission and fusion fuel in alternating thin layers As a single stage device it would have been a cumbersome application of boosted fission It first became practical when incorporated into the secondary of a two stage thermonuclear weapon br The U S name Alarm Clock came from Teller he called it that because it might wake up the world to the possibility of the potential of the Super The Russian name for the same design was more descriptive Sloika Russian a layered pastry cake A single stage Soviet Sloika was tested on August No single stage U S version was tested but the code named Castle Union shot of Operation Castle April was a two stage thermonuclear device code named Alarm Clock Its yield at Bikini was megatons br Because the Soviet Sloika test used dry lithium deuteride eight months before the first U S test to use it Castle Bravo March it was sometimes claimed that the USSR won the H bomb race even though the United States tested and developed the first hydrogen bomb the Ivy Mike H bomb test The U S Ivy Mike test used cryogenically cooled liquid deuterium as the fusion fuel in the secondary and employed the D D fusion reaction However the first Soviet test to use a radiation imploded secondary the essential feature of a true H bomb was on November three years after Ivy Mike In fact real work on the implosion scheme in the Soviet Union only commenced in the very early part of several months after the successful testing of Sloika br br br Clean bombs br br On March the largest ever U S nuclear test explosion the megaton Castle Bravo shot of Operation Castle at Bikini Atoll delivered a promptly lethal dose of fission product fallout to more than square miles km of Pacific Ocean surface Radiation injuries to Marshall Islanders and Japanese fishermen made that fact public and revealed the role of fission in hydrogen bombs br In response to the public alarm over fallout an effort was made to design a clean multi megaton weapon relying almost entirely on fusion The energy produced by the fissioning of unenriched natural uranium when used as the tamper material in the secondary and subsequent stages in the Teller Ulam design can far exceed the energy released by fusion as was the case in the Castle Bravo test Replacing the fissionable material in the tamper with another material is essential to producing a clean bomb In such a device the tamper no longer contributes energy so for any given weight a clean bomb will have less yield The earliest known incidence of a three stage device being tested with the third stage called the tertiary being ignited by the secondary was May in the Bassoon device This device was tested in the Zuni shot of Operation Redwing This shot used non fissionable tampers an inert substitute material such as tungsten or lead was used Its yield was megatons fusion and only fission br The Ripple concept which used ablation to achieve fusion using very little fission was and still is by far the cleanest design Unlike previous clean bombs which were clean simply by replacing fission fuel with inert substance Ripple was by design clean Ripple was also extremely efficient plans for a kt kg were made during Operation Dominic Shot Androscoggin shot featured a proof of concept Ripple design resulting in a kiloton fizzle significantly lower than the predicted megatons It was repeated in shot Housatonic which featured a megaton explosion that was reportedly fusion br The public records for devices that produced the highest proportion of their yield via fusion reactions are the peaceful nuclear explosions of the s Others include the megaton Dominic Housatonic at over fusion megaton Tsar Bomba at fusion the megaton Hardtack Poplar test at and the megaton Redwing Navajo test at fusion br The most ambitious peaceful application of nuclear explosions was pursued by the USSR with the aim of creating a km long canal between the Pechora river basin and the Kama river basin about half of which was to be constructed through a series of underground nuclear explosions It was reported that about nuclear devices might be used to get the final goal The Taiga test was to demonstrate the feasibility of the project Three of these clean devices of kiloton yield each were placed in separate boreholes spaced about m apart at depths of m They were simultaneously detonated on March catapulting radioactive plume into the air that was carried eastward by wind The resulting trench was around m long and m wide with an unimpressive depth of just m Despite their clean nature the area still exhibits a noticeably higher albeit mostly harmless concentration of fission products the intense neutron bombardment of the soil the device itself and the support structures also activated their stable elements to create a significant amount of man made radioactive elements like Co The overall danger posed by the concentration of radioactive elements present at the site created by these three devices is still negligible but a larger scale project as was envisioned would have had significant consequences both from the fallout of radioactive plume and the radioactive elements created by the neutron bombardment br On July AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss said that the Redwing Zuni shot clean bomb test produced much of importance from a humanitarian aspect However less than two days after this announcement the dirty version of Bassoon called Bassoon Prime with a uranium tamper in place was tested on a barge off the coast of Bikini Atoll as the Redwing Tewa shot The Bassoon Prime produced a megaton yield of which came from fission Data obtained from this test and others culminated in the eventual deployment of the highest yielding US nuclear weapon known and the highest yield to weight weapon ever made a three stage thermonuclear weapon with a maximum dirty yield of megatons designated as the B nuclear bomb which was to be carried by U S Air Force bombers until it was decommissioned this weapon was never fully tested br br br Third generation br First and second generation nuclear weapons release energy as omnidirectional blasts Third generation nuclear weapons are experimental special effect warheads and devices that can release energy in a directed manner some of which were tested during the Cold War but were never deployed These include br br Project Prometheus also known as Nuclear Shotgun which would have used a nuclear explosion to accelerate kinetic penetrators against ICBMs br Project Excalibur a nuclear pumped X ray laser to destroy ballistic missiles br Nuclear shaped charges that focus their energy in particular directions br Project Orion explored the use of nuclear explosives for rocket propulsion br br br Fourth generation br The idea of th generation nuclear weapons has been proposed as a possible successor to the examples of weapons designs listed above These methods tend to revolve around using non nuclear primaries to set off further fission or fusion reactions For example if antimatter were usable and controllable in macroscopic quantities a reaction between a small amount of antimatter and an equivalent amount of matter could release energy comparable to a small fission weapon and could in turn be used as the first stage of a very compact thermonuclear weapon Extremely powerful lasers could also potentially be used this way if they could be made powerful enough and compact enough to be viable as a weapon Most of these ideas are versions of pure fusion weapons and share the common property that they involve hitherto unrealized technologies as their primary stages br While many nations have invested significantly in inertial confinement fusion research programs since the s it has not been considered promising for direct weapons use but rather as a tool for weapons and energy related research that can be used in the absence of full scale nuclear testing Whether any nations are aggressively pursuing th generation weapons is not clear In many case as with antimatter the underlying technology is presently thought to be very far from being viable and if it was viable would be a powerful weapon in and of itself outside of a nuclear weapons context and without providing any significant advantages above existing nuclear weapons designs br br br Pure fusion weapons br br Since the s the United States and Soviet Union investigated the possibility of releasing significant amounts of nuclear fusion energy without the use of a fission primary Such pure fusion weapons were primarily imagined as low yield tactical nuclear weapons whose advantage would be their ability to be used without producing fallout on the scale of weapons that release fission products In the United States Department of Energy declassified the following br br Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion weapon br That the U S does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon and br br That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment br Red mercury a likely hoax substance has been hyped as a catalyst for a pure fusion weapon br br br Cobalt bombs br br A doomsday bomb made popular by Nevil Shute s novel and subsequent movie On the Beach the cobalt bomb is a hydrogen bomb with a jacket of cobalt The neutron activated cobalt would have maximized the environmental damage from radioactive fallout These bombs were popularized in the film Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb the material added to the bombs is referred to in the film as cobalt thorium G br Such salted weapons were investigated by U S Department of Defense Fission products are as deadly as neutron activated cobalt br Initially gamma radiation from the fission products of an equivalent size fission fusion fission bomb are much more intense than Cobalt Co times more intense at hour times more intense at week times more intense at month and about equal at months Thereafter fission drops off rapidly so that Co fallout is times more intense than fission at year and times more intense at years The very long lived isotopes produced by fission would overtake the Co again after about years br The triple taiga nuclear salvo test as part of the preliminary March Pechora Kama Canal project produced a small amount of fission products and therefore a comparatively large amount of case material activated products are responsible for most of the residual activity at the site today namely Co As of fusion generated neutron activation was responsible for about half of the gamma dose at the test site That dose is too small to cause deleterious effects and normal green vegetation exists all around the lake that was formed br br br Arbitrarily large multi staged devices br The idea of a device which has an arbitrarily large number of Teller Ulam stages with each driving a larger radiation driven implosion than the preceding stage is frequently suggested but technically disputed There are well known sketches and some reasonable looking calculations in the open literature about two stage weapons but no similarly accurate descriptions of true three stage concepts br During the mid s through early s scientists working in the weapons laboratories of the United States investigated weapons concepts as large as megatons and Edward Teller reported work on a megaton weapon code named SUNDIAL at a meeting of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission Much of the information about these efforts remains classified but the weapons ideas do not appear to have made it beyond theoretical investigations While both the US and Soviet Union investigated and in the case of the Soviets tested very high yield e g megaton weapons designs in the s and early s these appear to represent the upper limit of Cold War weapon yields pursued seriously Cold War warhead development trends from the mid s onward and especially after the Limited Test Ban Treaty instead resulted in lower yield highly compact warheads that gave greater options for deliverability br Following the concern caused by the estimated gigaton scale of the Comet Shoemaker Levy impacts on the planet Jupiter in a meeting at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory LLNL Edward Teller proposed to a collective of U S and Russian ex Cold War weapons designers that they collaborate on designing a megaton nuclear explosive device for diverting extinction class asteroids km in diameter which would be employed in the event that one of these asteroids were on an impact trajectory with Earth br br br Neutron bombs br br A neutron bomb technically referred to as an enhanced radiation weapon ERW is a type of tactical nuclear weapon designed specifically to release a large portion of its energy as energetic neutron radiation This contrasts with standard thermonuclear weapons which are designed to capture this intense neutron radiation to increase its overall explosive yield In terms of yield ERWs typically produce about one tenth that of a fission type atomic weapon Even with their significantly lower explosive power ERWs are still capable of much greater destruction than any conventional bomb Meanwhile relative to other nuclear weapons damage is more focused on biological material than on material infrastructure though extreme blast and heat effects are not eliminated br ERWs are more accurately described as suppressed yield weapons When the yield of a nuclear weapon is less than one kiloton its lethal radius from blast m ft is less than that from its neutron radiation However the blast is more than potent enough to destroy most structures which are less resistant to blast effects than even unprotected human beings Blast pressures of upwards of PSI are survivable whereas most buildings will collapse with a pressure of only PSI br Commonly misconceived as a weapon designed to kill populations and leave infrastructure intact these bombs as mentioned above are still very capable of leveling buildings over a large radius The intent of their design was to kill tank crews tanks giving excellent protection against blast and heat surviving relatively very close to a detonation Given the Soviets vast tank forces during the Cold War this was the perfect weapon to counter them The neutron radiation could instantly incapacitate a tank crew out to roughly the same distance that the heat and blast would incapacitate an unprotected human depending on design The tank chassis would also be rendered highly radioactive temporarily preventing its re use by a fresh crew br Neutron weapons were also intended for use in other applications however For example they are effective in anti nuclear defenses the neutron flux being capable of neutralising an incoming warhead at a greater range than heat or blast Nuclear warheads are very resistant to physical damage but are very difficult to harden against extreme neutron flux br br ERWs were two stage thermonuclears with all non essential uranium removed to minimize fission yield Fusion provided the neutrons Developed in the s they were first deployed in the s by U S forces in Europe The last ones were retired in the s br A neutron bomb is only feasible if the yield is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible and if the yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of kilotons with fission proportion varying from at kiloton to at kilotons all of which comes from the primary stage The neutron output per kiloton is then times greater than for a pure fission implosion weapon or for a strategic warhead like a W or W br br br Weapon design laboratories br All the nuclear weapon design innovations discussed in this article originated from the following three labs in the manner described Other nuclear weapon design labs in other countries duplicated those design innovations independently reverse engineered them from fallout analysis or acquired them by espionage br br br Lawrence Berkeley br br The first systematic exploration of nuclear weapon design concepts took place in mid at the University of California Berkeley Important early discoveries had been made at the adjacent Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory such as the cyclotron made production and isolation of plutonium A Berkeley professor J Robert Oppenheimer had just been hired to run the nation s secret bomb design effort His first act was to convene the summer conference br By the time he moved his operation to the new secret town of Los Alamos New Mexico in the spring of the accumulated wisdom on nuclear weapon design consisted of five lectures by Berkeley professor Robert Serber transcribed and distributed as the classified but now fully declassified and widely available online as a PDF Los Alamos Primer The Primer addressed fission energy neutron production and capture nuclear chain reactions critical mass tampers predetonation and three methods of assembling a bomb gun assembly implosion and autocatalytic methods the one approach that turned out to be a dead end br br br Los Alamos br br At Los Alamos it was found in April by Emilio Segr that the proposed Thin Man Gun assembly type bomb would not work for plutonium because of predetonation problems caused by Pu impurities So Fat Man the implosion type bomb was given high priority as the only option for plutonium The Berkeley discussions had generated theoretical estimates of critical mass but nothing precise The main wartime job at Los Alamos was the experimental determination of critical mass which had to wait until sufficient amounts of fissile material arrived from the production plants uranium from Oak Ridge Tennessee and plutonium from the Hanford Site in Washington br In using the results of critical mass experiments Los Alamos technicians fabricated and assembled components for four bombs the Trinity Gadget Little Boy Fat Man and an unused spare Fat Man After the war those who could including Oppenheimer returned to university teaching positions Those who remained worked on levitated and hollow pits and conducted weapon effects tests such as Crossroads Able and Baker at Bikini Atoll in br All of the essential ideas for incorporating fusion into nuclear weapons originated at Los Alamos between and After the Teller Ulam radiation implosion breakthrough of the technical implications and possibilities were fully explored but ideas not directly relevant to making the largest possible bombs for long range Air Force bombers were shelved br Because of Oppenheimer s initial position in the H bomb debate in opposition to large thermonuclear weapons and the assumption that he still had influence over Los Alamos despite his departure political allies of Edward Teller decided he needed his own laboratory in order to pursue H bombs By the time it was opened in in Livermore California Los Alamos had finished the job Livermore was designed to do br br br Lawrence Livermore br br With its original mission no longer available the Livermore lab tried radical new designs that failed Its first three nuclear tests were fizzles in two single stage fission devices with uranium hydride pits and in a two stage thermonuclear device in which the secondary heated up prematurely too fast for radiation implosion to work properly br Shifting gears Livermore settled for taking ideas Los Alamos had shelved and developing them for the Army and Navy This led Livermore to specialize in small diameter tactical weapons particularly ones using two point implosion systems such as the Swan Small diameter tactical weapons became primaries for small diameter secondaries Around when the superpower arms race became a ballistic missile race Livermore warheads were more useful than the large heavy Los Alamos warheads Los Alamos warheads were used on the first intermediate range ballistic missiles IRBMs but smaller Livermore warheads were used on the first intercontinental ballistic missiles ICBMs and submarine launched ballistic missiles SLBMs as well as on the first multiple warhead systems on such missiles br In and both labs built and tested as many designs as possible in anticipation that a planned test ban might become permanent By the time testing resumed in the two labs had become duplicates of each other and design jobs were assigned more on workload considerations than lab specialty Some designs were horse traded For example the W warhead for the Titan I missile started out as a Livermore project was given to Los Alamos when it became the Atlas missile warhead and in was given back to Livermore in trade for the W Davy Crockett warhead which went from Livermore to Los Alamos br Warhead designs after took on the character of model changes with every new missile getting a new warhead for marketing reasons The chief substantive change involved packing more fissile uranium into the secondary as it became available with continued uranium enrichment and the dismantlement of the large high yield bombs br Starting with the Nova facility at Livermore in the mid s nuclear design activity pertaining to radiation driven implosion was informed by research with indirect drive laser fusion This work was part of the effort to investigate Inertial Confinement Fusion Similar work continues at the more powerful National Ignition Facility The Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program also benefited from research performed at NIF br br br Explosive testing br Nuclear weapons are in large part designed by trial and error The trial often involves test explosion of a prototype br In a nuclear explosion a large number of discrete events with various probabilities aggregate into short lived chaotic energy flows inside the device casing Complex mathematical models are required to approximate the processes and in the s there were no computers powerful enough to run them properly Even today s computers and simulation software are not adequate br It was easy enough to design reliable weapons for the stockpile If the prototype worked it could be weaponized and mass produced br It was much more difficult to understand how it worked or why it failed Designers gathered as much data as possible during the explosion before the device destroyed itself and used the data to calibrate their models often by inserting fudge factors into equations to make the simulations match experimental results They also analyzed the weapon debris in fallout to see how much of a potential nuclear reaction had taken place br br br Light pipes br An important tool for test analysis was the diagnostic light pipe A probe inside a test device could transmit information by heating a plate of metal to incandescence an event that could be recorded by instruments located at the far end of a long very straight pipe br The picture below shows the Shrimp device detonated on March at Bikini as the Castle Bravo test Its megaton explosion was the largest ever by the United States The silhouette of a man is shown for scale The device is supported from below at the ends The pipes going into the shot cab ceiling which appear to be supports are actually diagnostic light pipes The eight pipes at the right end sent information about the detonation of the primary Two in the middle marked the time when X rays from the primary reached the radiation channel around the secondary The last two pipes noted the time radiation reached the far end of the radiation channel the difference between and being the radiation transit time for the channel br br From the shot cab the pipes turned horizontally and traveled ft km along a causeway built on the Bikini reef to a remote controlled data collection bunker on Namu Island br While x rays would normally travel at the speed of light through a low density material like the plastic foam channel filler between and the intensity of radiation from the exploding primary creates a relatively opaque radiation front in the channel filler which acts like a slow moving logjam to retard the passage of radiant energy While the secondary is being compressed via radiation induced ablation neutrons from the primary catch up with the x rays penetrate into the secondary and start breeding tritium via the third reaction noted in the first section above This Li n reaction is exothermic producing MeV per event The spark plug has not yet been compressed and thus remains subcritical so no significant fission or fusion takes place as a result If enough neutrons arrive before implosion of the secondary is complete though the crucial temperature differential between the outer and inner parts of the secondary can be degraded potentially causing the secondary to fail to ignite The first Livermore designed thermonuclear weapon the Morgenstern device failed in this manner when it was tested as Castle Koon on April The primary ignited but the secondary preheated by the primary s neutron wave suffered what was termed as an inefficient detonation thus a weapon with a predicted one megaton yield produced only kilotons of which merely kt were attributed to fusion br These timing effects and any problems they cause are measured by light pipe data The mathematical simulations which they calibrate are called radiation flow hydrodynamics codes or channel codes They are used to predict the effect of future design modifications br It is not clear from the public record how successful the Shrimp light pipes were The unmanned data bunker was far enough back to remain outside the mile wide crater but the megaton blast two and a half times as powerful as expected breached the bunker by blowing its ton door off the hinges and across the inside of the bunker The nearest people were miles km farther away in a bunker that survived intact br br br Fallout analysis br br The most interesting data from Castle Bravo came from radio chemical analysis of weapon debris in fallout Because of a shortage of enriched lithium of the lithium in the Shrimp secondary was ordinary lithium which doesn t breed tritium as easily as lithium does But it does breed lithium as the product of an n n reaction one neutron in two neutrons out a known fact but with unknown probability The probability turned out to be high br Fallout analysis revealed to designers that with the n n reaction the Shrimp secondary effectively had two and half times as much lithium as expected The tritium the fusion yield the neutrons and the fission yield were all increased accordingly br As noted above Bravo s fallout analysis also told the outside world for the first time that thermonuclear bombs are more fission devices than fusion devices A Japanese fishing boat Daigo Fukury Maru sailed home with enough fallout on her decks to allow scientists in Japan and elsewhere to determine and announce that most of the fallout had come from the fission of U by fusion produced MeV neutrons br br br Underground testing br br The global alarm over radioactive fallout which began with the Castle Bravo event eventually drove nuclear testing literally underground The last U S above ground test took place at Johnston Island on November During the next three decades until September the United States conducted an average of underground nuclear explosions per month all but a few at the Nevada Test Site NTS northwest of Las Vegas br The Yucca Flat section of the NTS is covered with subsidence craters resulting from the collapse of terrain over radioactive caverns created by nuclear explosions see photo br After the Threshold Test Ban Treaty TTBT which limited underground explosions to kilotons or less warheads like the half megaton W had to be tested at less than full yield Since the primary must be detonated at full yield in order to generate data about the implosion of the secondary the reduction in yield had to come from the secondary Replacing much of the lithium deuteride fusion fuel with lithium hydride limited the tritium available for fusion and thus the overall yield without changing the dynamics of the implosion The functioning of the device could be evaluated using light pipes other sensing devices and analysis of trapped weapon debris The full yield of the stockpiled weapon could be calculated by extrapolation br br br Production facilities br br When two stage weapons became standard in the early s weapon design determined the layout of the new widely dispersed U S production facilities and vice versa br Because primaries tend to be bulky especially in diameter plutonium is the fissile material of choice for pits with beryllium reflectors It has a smaller critical mass than uranium The Rocky Flats plant near Boulder Colorado was built in for pit production and consequently became the plutonium and beryllium fabrication facility br The Y plant in Oak Ridge Tennessee where mass spectrometers called calutrons had enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project was redesigned to make secondaries Fissile U makes the best spark plugs because its critical mass is larger especially in the cylindrical shape of early thermonuclear secondaries Early experiments used the two fissile materials in combination as composite Pu Oy pits and spark plugs but for mass production it was easier to let the factories specialize plutonium pits in primaries uranium spark plugs and pushers in secondaries br Y made lithium deuteride fusion fuel and U parts the other two ingredients of secondaries br The Hanford Site near Richland WA operated Plutonium production nuclear reactors and separations facilities during World War and the Cold War Nine Plutonium production reactors were built and operated there The first being the B Reactor which began operations in September and the last being the N Reactor which ceased operations in January br The Savannah River Site in Aiken South Carolina also built in operated nuclear reactors which converted U into Pu for pits and converted lithium produced at Y into tritium for booster gas Since its reactors were moderated with heavy water deuterium oxide it also made deuterium for booster gas and for Y to use in making lithium deuteride br br br Warhead design safety br Because even low yield nuclear warheads have astounding destructive power weapon designers have always recognised the need to incorporate mechanisms and associated procedures intended to prevent accidental detonation br br br Gun type br It is inherently dangerous to have a weapon containing a quantity and shape of fissile material which can form a critical mass through a relatively simple accident Because of this danger the propellant in Little Boy four bags of cordite was inserted into the bomb in flight shortly after takeoff on August This was the first time a gun type nuclear weapon had ever been fully assembled br If the weapon falls into water the moderating effect of the water can also cause a criticality accident even without the weapon being physically damaged Similarly a fire caused by an aircraft crashing could easily ignite the propellant with catastrophic results Gun type weapons have always been inherently unsafe br br br In flight pit insertion br Neither of these effects is likely with implosion weapons since there is normally insufficient fissile material to form a critical mass without the correct detonation of the lenses However the earliest implosion weapons had pits so close to criticality that accidental detonation with some nuclear yield was a concern br On August Fat Man was loaded onto its airplane fully assembled but later when levitated pits made a space between the pit and the tamper it was feasible to use in flight pit insertion The bomber would take off with no fissile material in the bomb Some older implosion type weapons such as the US Mark and Mark used this system br In flight pit insertion will not work with a hollow pit in contact with its tamper br br br Steel ball safety method br As shown in the diagram above one method used to decrease the likelihood of accidental detonation employed metal balls The balls were emptied into the pit this prevented detonation by increasing the density of the hollow pit thereby preventing symmetrical implosion in the event of an accident This design was used in the Green Grass weapon also known as the Interim Megaton Weapon which was used in the Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk bombs br br br Chain safety method br Alternatively the pit can be safed by having its normally hollow core filled with an inert material such as a fine metal chain possibly made of cadmium to absorb neutrons While the chain is in the center of the pit the pit cannot be compressed into an appropriate shape to fission when the weapon is to be armed the chain is removed Similarly although a serious fire could detonate the explosives destroying the pit and spreading plutonium to contaminate the surroundings as has happened in several weapons accidents it could not cause a nuclear explosion br br br One point safety br While the firing of one detonator out of many will not cause a hollow pit to go critical especially a low mass hollow pit that requires boosting the introduction of two point implosion systems made that possibility a real concern br In a two point system if one detonator fires one entire hemisphere of the pit will implode as designed The high explosive charge surrounding the other hemisphere will explode progressively from the equator toward the opposite pole Ideally this will pinch the equator and squeeze the second hemisphere away from the first like toothpaste in a tube By the time the explosion envelops it its implosion will be separated both in time and space from the implosion of the first hemisphere The resulting dumbbell shape with each end reaching maximum density at a different time may not become critical br It is not possible to tell on the drawing board how this will play out Nor is it possible using a dummy pit of U and high speed x ray cameras although such tests are helpful For final determination a test needs to be made with real fissile material Consequently starting in a year after Swan both labs began one point safety tests br Out of one point safety tests conducted in and seven had zero or slight nuclear yield success three had high yields of t to t severe failure and the rest had unacceptable yields between those extremes br Of particular concern was Livermore s W which generated unacceptably high yields in one point testing To prevent an accidental detonation Livermore decided to use mechanical safing on the W The wire safety scheme described below was the result br When testing resumed in and continued for three decades there was sufficient time to make all warhead designs inherently one point safe without need for mechanical safing br br br Wire safety method br In the last test before the moratorium the W warhead for the Polaris SLBM was found to not be one point safe producing an unacceptably high nuclear yield of kg lb of TNT equivalent Hardtack II Titania With the test moratorium in force there was no way to refine the design and make it inherently one point safe A solution was devised consisting of a boron coated wire inserted into the weapon s hollow pit at manufacture The warhead was armed by withdrawing the wire onto a spool driven by an electric motor Once withdrawn the wire could not be re inserted The wire had a tendency to become brittle during storage and break or get stuck during arming preventing complete removal and rendering the warhead a dud It was estimated that of warheads would fail This required a complete rebuild of all W primaries The oil used for lubricating the wire also promoted corrosion of the pit br br br Strong link weak link br br Under the strong link weak link system weak links are constructed between critical nuclear weapon components the hard links In the event of an accident the weak links are designed to fail first in a manner that precludes energy transfer between them Then if a hard link fails in a manner that transfers or releases energy energy can t be transferred into other weapon systems potentially starting a nuclear detonation Hard links are usually critical weapon components that have been hardened to survive extreme environments while weak links can be both components deliberately inserted into the system to act as a weak link and critical nuclear components that can fail predictably br An example of a weak link would be an electrical connector that contains electrical wires made from a low melting point alloy During a fire those wires would melt breaking any electrical connection br br br Permissive action link br br A permissive action link is an access control device designed to prevent unauthorised use of nuclear weapons Early PALs were simple electromechanical switches and have evolved into complex arming systems that include integrated yield
