Environmental design is the process of addressing surrounding environmental parameters when devising plans programs policies buildings or products It seeks to create spaces that will enhance the natural social cultural and physical environment of particular areas Classical prudent design may have always considered environmental factors however the environmental movement beginning in the s has made the concept more explicit br Environmental design can also refer to the applied arts and sciences dealing with creating the human designed environment These fields include architecture geography urban planning landscape architecture and interior design Environmental design can also encompass interdisciplinary areas such as historical preservation and lighting design In terms of a larger scope environmental design has implications for the industrial design of products innovative automobiles wind power generators solar powered equipment and other kinds of equipment could serve as examples Currently the term has expanded to apply to ecological and sustainability issues br br br Core Principals br Sustainability Minimizing the environmental impact of human activities through the use of renewable resources energy efficient technologies and eco friendly materials br Functionality Designing spaces that are practical accessible and tailored to the needs and behaviors of the people who will use them br Aesthetics Incorporating elements of visual appeal sensory experience and emotional connection into the design br Holistic Approach Considering the interconnected social economic and ecological factors that shape the environment br br br Modern Uses br Today environmental design is applied across a wide range of scales from small scale residential projects to large scale urban planning initiatives Key areas of focus include br Sustainable architecture and green building br Landscape architecture and urban planning br Transportation design and infrastructure br Industrial design and product development br Interior design and space planning br Environmental designers often collaborate with experts from disciplines such as engineering ecology sociology and public policy to create holistic solutions that address the complex challenges of modern environments br br br History br br The first traceable concepts of environmental designs focused primarily on solar heating which began in Ancient Greece around BCE At the time most of Greece had exhausted its supply of wood for fuel leading architects to design houses that would capture the solar energy of the sun The Greeks understood that the position of the sun varies throughout the year For a latitude of degrees in summer the sun is high in the south at an angle of degrees at the zenith while in winter the sun travels a lower trajectory with a zenith of degrees Greek houses were built with south facing fa ades which received little to no sun in the summer but would receive full sun in the winter warming the house Additionally the southern orientation also protected the house from the colder northern winds This clever arrangement of buildings influenced the use of the grid pattern of ancient cities With the north south orientation of the houses the streets of Greek cities mainly ran east west br The practice of solar architecture continued with the Romans who similarly had deforested much of their native Italian Peninsula by the first century BCE The Roman heliocaminus literally solar furnace functioned with the same aspects of the earlier Greek houses The numerous public baths were oriented to the south Roman architects added glass to windows to allow for the passage of light and to conserve interior heat as it could not escape The Romans also used greenhouses to grow crops all year long and to cultivate the exotic plants coming from the far corners of the Empire Pliny the Elder wrote of greenhouses that supplied the kitchen of the Emperor Tiberius during the year br Along with the solar orientation of buildings and the use of glass as a solar heat collector the ancients knew other ways of harnessing solar energy The Greeks Romans and Chinese developed curved mirrors that could concentrate the sun s rays on an object with enough intensity to make it burn in seconds The solar reflectors were often made of polished silver copper or brass br Early roots of modern environmental design began in the late th century with writer designer William Morris who rejected the use of industrialized materials and processes in wallpaper fabrics and books his studio produced He and others such as John Ruskin felt that the industrial revolution would lead to harm done to nature and workers br The narrative of Brian Danitz and Chris Zelov s documentary film Ecological Design Inventing the Future asserts that in the decades after World War II The world was forced to confront the dark shadow of science and industry From the middle of the twentieth century thinkers like Buckminster Fuller have acted as catalysts for a broadening and deepening of the concerns of environmental designers Nowadays energy efficiency appropriate technology organic horticulture and agriculture land restoration New Urbanism and ecologically sustainable energy and waste systems are recognized considerations or options and may each find application br By integrating renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic solar thermal and even geothermal energy into structures it is possible to create zero emission buildings where energy consumption is self generating and non polluting It is also possible to construct energy plus buildings which generate more energy than they consume and the excess could then be sold to the grid In the United States the LEED Green Building Rating System rates structures on their environmental sustainability br br br Environmental design and planning br Environmental design and planning is the moniker used by several Ph D programs that take a multidisciplinary approach to the built environment Typically environmental design and planning programs address architectural history or design interior or exterior city or regional planning landscape architecture history or design environmental planning construction science cultural geography or historic preservation Social science methods are frequently employed aspects of sociology or psychology can be part of a research program br The concept of environmental in these programs is quite broad and can encompass aspects of the natural built work or social environments br br br Areas of research br br br Academic programs br The following universities offer a Ph D in environmental design and planning br br Clemson University College of Architecture Arts and Humanities Now called Planning Design and the Built Environment br Arizona State University College of Design br Kansas State University br University of Calgary Archived at the Wayback Machine technically the Ph D is in environmental design but encompasses the same scope as the other programs br Virginia Tech until recently offered the degree program but has since replaced it with programs in architecture and design research and planning governance and globalization br Fanshawe College in London Ontario Canada offers an honours bachelor s degree called Environmental Design and planning br br br Related programs br University of Missouri Columbia Ph D in Human Environmental Sciences PDF file with emphasis in Architectural Studies br Texas A M University offers a Ph D in architecture Archived at the Wayback Machine that emphasizes environmental design br br br Examples br Examples of the environmental design process include use of roadway noise computer models in design of noise barriers and use of roadway air dispersion models in analyzing and designing urban highways br Designers consciously working within this more recent framework of philosophy and practice seek a blending of nature and technology regarding ecology as the basis for design Some believe that strategies of conservation stewardship and regeneration can be applied at all levels of scale from the individual building to the community with benefit to the human individual and local and planetary ecosystems br Specific examples of large scale environmental design projects include br br Boston Transportation Planning Review
