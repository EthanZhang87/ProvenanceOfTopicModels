Strategic design is the application of future oriented design principles in order to increase an organization s innovative and competitive qualities Its foundations lie in the analysis of external and internal trends and data which enables design decisions to be made on the basis of facts rather than aesthetics or intuition The discipline is mostly practiced by design agencies or by internal development departments br br br Definition br Traditional definitions of design often focus on creating discrete solutions be it a product a building or a service Strategic design is about applying some of the principles of traditional design to big picture systemic challenges like business growth health care education and climate change It redefines how problems are approached identifies opportunities for action and helps deliver more complete and resilient solutions The traditional concept of design is mainly associated with artistic work The addition of the term strategic expands such conception so that creativity is linked with innovation allowing ideas to become practical and profitable applications that can be managed effectively acquired used and or consumed by target audiences Strategic design draws from the body of literature that emerged in recent years which outline strategic design principles that provide insights and new methods in the areas of merchandising consuming and ownership There are at least four factors that demonstrate the value of strategic design and these are br br it affects consumer behavior through motivation by creating a perceptual value br it offers a way for firms to differentiate their products and services from the competition br it creates meaning by effectively making the customer understand the product and its value and br it can be used to manage risks by providing a structure that offers opportunities for collaboration innovation and the creation of a mechanism to meaningfully address problems br br br Applications br Businesses are the main consumers of strategic design but the public political and not for profit sectors are also making increasing use of the discipline Its applications are varied yet often aim to strengthen one of the following product branding product development corporate identity corporate branding operating and business models and service delivery br Strategic design has become increasingly crucial in recent years as businesses and organisations compete for a share of today s global and fast paced marketplace br To survive in today s rapidly changing world products and services must not only anticipate change but drive it Businesses that don t will lose market share to those that do There have been many examples of strategic design breakthroughs over the years and in an increasingly competitive global market with rapid product cycles strategic design is becoming more important br Examples br Strategic design can play a role in helping to resolve the following common problems br br Identifying the most important questions that a company s products and services should address Example John Rheinfrank of Fitch Design showed Kodak that its disposable cameras were not intended to replace traditional cameras but instead to meet specific needs like weddings underwater photography and others br Translating insights into actionable solutions Example Jump Associates helped Target turn an understanding of college students into a dorm room line designed by Todd Oldham br Prioritizing the order in which a portfolio of products and services should be launched Example Apple Inc laid out the iPod iTunes ecosystem slowly over time rather than launching all of its pieces at once br Connecting design efforts to an organization s business strategy Example Hewlett Packard s global design division is focused most intently on designs that simplify technology experiences This leads to lower manufacturing costs at a time when CEO Mark Hurd is pushing for cost cutting Mark Hurd discussed HP s design strategy for determining environmental footprint of their supply chain br Integrating design as a fundamental aspect of strategic brand intent Example Tom Hardy Design Strategist developed the core brand design principle Balance of Reason Feeling for Samsung Electronics together with rational and emotional attributes to guide design language within a comprehensive brand design program that inspired differentiation and elevated the company s global image br br br See also br Experience design br Design management br Design methods br Design thinking br Industrial design br Instructional design br Product design br Service design br U S Army Strategist br User centered design br br br br br br External links br Strategic design as described by Tim Brown CEO of IDEO br Definition of strategic design by INDEX br Strategic Design MA course description SRH Berlin University of Applied Science former Design Akademie Berlin
