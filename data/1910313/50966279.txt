title: Map seed
id: 50966279
In video games using procedural world generation the map seed is a relatively short number or text string which is used to procedurally create the game world map This means that while the seed unique generated map may be many megabytes in size often generated incrementally and virtually unlimited in potential size it is possible to reset to the unmodified map or the unmodified map can be exchanged between players just by specifying the map seed Map seeds are a type of random seeds br br Games which use procedural generation and include support for setting the map seed include Ark Survival Evolved Minecraft Factorio SCP Containment Breach and the desktop version of Terraria For Minecraft especially there are websites and articles dedicated to sharing seeds which have been found to generate interesting maps Some of the best seeds for Minecraft generate your player near cool or interesting structures Players use seeds to help them decide what type of world they want br br The map seed only has meaning in the context of the algorithm used to generate the map that algorithm is often based on Perlin noise So if the map generation algorithm changes the map generated by a given seed will also change Such changes are particularly obvious in Minecraft where they are handled or rather not handled by simply generating any newly explored chunks of an existing map using the new algorithm leading to obvious and jarring discontinuities after upgrading br Favorable seeds can be used when speedrunning video games by specifying the map seed manually br br br
