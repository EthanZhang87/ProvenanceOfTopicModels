Design education is the teaching of theory and application in the design of products services and environments and focuses on the development of both particular and general skills for designing It is primarily orientated to preparing higher education students for professional design practice and based around project work and studio or atelier teaching methods while general education uses design methods to improve materials for teachers and students br br br History br Design education s origins can be seen as far back as the th century despite not being referred to as such until the s Despite the contrast between the Arts and Sciences the use of design principles to scientific matters would theoretically allow for scientific and mathematical subjects to be approach practically without taking away from the subject matter itself Research into the usage of design methodology in various fields would see its incorporation into general education as methods for teaching and a subject to be taught br br br Early implementations br Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi was regarded as the father of manual training in regards to his beliefs that manual work and general education would provide a better foundation than just a one sided education Pestalozzi also believed in adherence to the structure of the senses and their usage in obtaining and processing knowledge which he believed children should do to gain a well rounded sense of the world br Friedrich Fr bel would implement Pestalozzi s ideals in a known vocational way as he would go on to found the Kindergarten as an educational institution His approach to Pestalozzi s methodology would be from his own religious and practical point of view where he sought to assist in the development of early age children who believed to be inherently create and best express themselves through action Fr bel s concept Kindergarten persists as both an institution and a set of ideals br Uno Cygnaeus would develop the Sloyd Pedagogy in response to research done on the principles of Fr bel and Pestalozzi The system would regard each student as an individual that would be taught woodcraft in relation their general education Otto Salomon and Aksel Mikkelsen would implement these systems in Sweden and Denmark respectively with Mikkelsen and Salomon training teachers from various nations to teach Sloyd in their home countries br br br Modern implementation br L Bruce Archer was a researcher and professor at the Royal College of Art who would become recognized for his designs Archer s utilization of systematic methods in regards to industrial design would coincide with his belief that design is a third pillar education His tenure at the Royal College of Art would see him and his team being converted into the Department of Design Research where they were able to take contract work researching developing and implementing designs In the Department would pivot from strictly research to formally educating postgraduate students in design research Archer s advocacy to the Department for Education and Science for the inclusion of design education principles would see it added throughout the school s curriculum Use of design in education at the higher level would eventually lead to the curriculum being adopted across the United Kingdom In his lifetime Arthur would commit to his belief that a designerly way of approaching scholarly and scientific subjects exists that is both unique and as powerful when compared to current academia br There are also broader forms of higher education in design studies and design thinking and design also features as a part of general education for example within Design and Technology and Engineering Technology br br br Research br For more information see Design research br Various methods of design education would be up to debate and discussion International Conference on Design and Technology Research IDATER was one forum for this purpose which ran from to The purpose of these conferences was to create a standard for studying and analyzing the curriculum for design and technology that was beginning to emerge in England with the onset of the s br br br Institutions br Institutions for design education date back to the nineteenth century The Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry was founded in followed by the United Kingdom s Government School of Design Konstfack in Sweden and Rhode Island School of Design in the United States The German art and design school Bauhaus founded in greatly influenced modern design education br In in Japan South Korea and Singapore there were no design schools However as of the early s there are more than design schools within the three Asia countries br br br See also br
