Frankenstein the infamous mad scientist with whom he does not want to be associated and insists that his surname is pronounced Fronkensteen When a solicitor informs him that he has inherited his family s estate in Transylvania after the death of his great grandfather the Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein Frederick travels to Europe to inspect the property br At the Transylvania train station Frederick is met by a hunchbacked bug eyed servant named Igor whose own grandfather worked for Victor and a beautiful young female assistant named Inga Hearing that the professor pronounces his name Fronkensteen Igor insists that his name is pronounced Eyegor rather than the traditional Eegor br Arriving at the estate Frederick meets Frau Bl cher the intimidating housekeeper After discovering the secret entrance to Victor s laboratory and reading his private journals he decides to resume his grandfather s experiments in re animating the dead br Frederick and Igor steal the corpse of a recently executed criminal and he sets to work experimenting on the large corpse He sends Igor to steal the brain of a deceased scientist and saint named Hans Delbr ck Startled by his own reflection and the sound of thunder Igor drops and ruins Delbr ck s brain Taking a second brain labeled Abnormal he returns with it and Frederick transplants it into the corpse thinking he has transplanted Delbr ck s brain br Frederick brings the Monster to life by electrical charges during a lightning storm It takes its first steps but frightened by Igor lighting a match he attacks Frederick and nearly strangles him before he is sedated br Unaware of the Monster s existence the townspeople gather to discuss their unease at Frederick continuing his grandfather s work Inspector Kemp a one eyed police inspector with a prosthetic arm whose German accent is so thick that even his own countrymen cannot understand him proposes to visit the doctor whereupon he demands assurance that Frankenstein will not create another Monster br Returning to the lab Frederick discovers Bl cher setting the creature free She reveals the Monster s love of violin music and her own romantic relationship with Frederick s grandfather The Monster is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch and escapes the castle br While roaming the countryside the monster has encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit Frederick recaptures the monster and locks himself in a room with him He calms the Monster s homicidal tendencies with flattery and a promise to guide him to success embracing his heritage as a Frankenstein br At a theater full of illustrious guests Frederick shows The Creature following simple commands The demonstration continues with Frederick and the Monster both in top hats and tuxedos performing the musical number Puttin On the Ritz A stage light suddenly explodes and frightens the Monster interrupting the performance The audience boo and throw vegetables at the Monster who becomes enraged and

takes the mob members back to his place for a little sponge cake and a little wine while taking a detour to the lumber mill br Sometime later Frederick and Inga are married With Elizabeth s hair in a new style she marries the now erudite and sophisticated Monster While in bed with Frederick Inga asks what her new husband got in return during the transfer procedure Frederick growls wordlessly like the monster and embraces Inga who as Elizabeth did when abducted by the monster begins singing the refrain Ah Sweet Mystery of Life as Igor plays music from atop the castle br br In a interview with Los Angeles Times Mel Brooks discussed how the film came about br br I was in the middle of shooting the last few weeks of Blazing Saddles somewhere in the Antelope Valley and Gene Wilder and I were having a cup of coffee and he said I have this idea that there could be another Frankenstein I said Not another We ve had the son of the cousin of the brother in law We don t need another Frankenstein His idea was very simple What if the grandson of Dr Frankenstein wanted nothing to do with the family whatsoever He was ashamed of those wackos I said That s funny br In one of the scenes of a village assembly one of the authority figures says that he already knows what Frankenstein is up to based on five previous experiences This is a reference to the first five Universal films In a Gene Wilder DVD interview he says the film is based on Frankenstein The Bride of Frankenstein Son of Frankenstein and The Ghost of Frankenstein br In a interview with Creative Screenwriting Brooks elaborated on the writing process He recalled br br Little by little every night Gene and I met at his bungalow at the Bel Air Hotel We ordered a pot of Earl Grey tea coupled with a container of cream and a small kettle of brown sugar cubes To go with it we had a pack of British digestive biscuits And step by step ever so cautiously we proceeded on a dark narrow twisting path to the eventual screenplay in which good sense and caution are thrown out the window and madness ensues br Brooks and Wilder disagreed over the sequence where Frankenstein and his creation perform Puttin on the Ritz Brooks felt it was too silly to have the monster sing and dance but eventually yielded to Wilder s arguments br Unlike in many of his other films Brooks does not appear onscreen in a significant role in Young Frankenstein though he recorded several voice parts and portrays a German villager in one short scene In Brooks explained why br br I wasn t allowed to be in it That was the deal Gene Wilder had He said If you re not in it I ll do it Laughs He said You have a way of breaking the fourth wall whether you want to or not I just want to keep it I don t want too much to be you know a wink at the audience I love the script He wrote the script with me That was the deal So I wasn t in it and he did it br Brooks and producer Michael Gruskoff originally agreed a deal with Columbia Pictures but Columbia would not agree to a budget of more than million whereas Brooks wanted at least million Columbia also was not happy making it in black and white so Brooks and Gruskoff instead went to th Century Fox for distribution when they agreed to a higher budget br Principal photography began on February and wrapped on May To recreate the visual style of the original Universal horror films Brooks shot in black and white employed vintage style opening credits used wipes and irises for scene transitions and even used the original Kenneth Strickfaden lab equipment from the Frankenstein br Marty Feldman added a comic twist to his character by deliberately swapping which side the hump on his back was located when Doctor Frankenstein asks him about it Igor replies simply What hump Wilder wrote the role specially for Feldman br br Young Frankenstein was a box office success upon release The film grossed million on a million budget br Young Frankenstein received acclaim from critics and currently holds a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews with an average rating of The consensus reads Made with obvious affection for the original Young Frankenstein is a riotously silly spoof featuring a fantastic performance by Gene Wilder br Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film Mel Brooks funniest most cohesive comedy to date adding It would be misleading to describe Young Frankenstein written by Mr Wilder and Mr Brooks as astoundingly witty but it s a great deal of low fun of the sort that Mr Brooks specializes in Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars calling it Brooks most disciplined and visually inventive film it also happens to be very funny Gene Siskel gave the film three stars out of four and wrote Part homage and part send up Young Frankenstein is very funny in its best moments but they re all too infrequent Variety declared The screen needs one outrageously funny Mel Brooks film each year and Young Frankenstein is an excellent followup for the enormous audiences that howled for much of at Blazing Saddles br Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times praised the film as a likable unpredictable blending of slapstick and sentiment Gary Arnold of The Washington Post who disliked Blazing Saddles reported being equally untickled with Young Frankenstein and wrote that Wilder and Brooks haven t dreamed up a funny plot They simply rely on the old movie plots to get them through a rambling collection of scene parodies and a more or less constant stream of puns double entendres and other verbal rib pokers and thigh slappers Tom Milne of the UK s The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote in a mixed review that all too often Brooks resorts to the most clich d sort of Carry On smut and criticized Marty Feldman s grotesquely unfunny mugging but praised a couple of sequences the flower throwing scene and the Monster s encounter with the blind man as very close to brilliance and called Peter Boyle as the Monster one of the undiluted pleasures of the film and the only actor ever to suggest that he might play the part as well as Karloff br In his book Comedy Horror Films A Chronological History Bruce G Hallenbeck lauded many of Young Frankenstein s scenes as classic comedy moments and also praised the attention to detail the film shows in paying heartfelt homage to the classic horror films it references He summed up that Young Frankenstein is a movie for film buffs but written directed and performed in such a way that average Joes and Josephines can enjoy it just as much for its outrageous and wacky humor br br Igor s line Walk this way in the film inspired the song of the same name by Aerosmith According to Gene Wilder the joke was added while shooting the scene by Mel Brooks inspired by the old talcum powder joke A partially contradictory account appears in eyE Marty Feldman s posthumously published autobiography Feldman recalls spontaneously doing the walk this way shtick to make his colleagues laugh with Brooks then insisting despite Wilder s and Feldman s reservations that it stay in the film br br Young Frankenstein became available on DVD on November The film was then released on DVD for the second time on September The film was then released on DVD for the third time on September as a th anniversary edition along with a Blu ray release br br Brooks adapted the film into a musical of the same name which premiered in Seattle at the Paramount Theatre and ran from August to September The musical opened on Broadway at the Lyric Theatre then the Hilton Theatre on November and closed on
