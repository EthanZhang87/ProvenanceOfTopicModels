to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes other remake Friday the th where the writers took the best elements from each of the films in the original series and created a single storyline with them Eventually they decided to use Craven s original storyline but tried to create a scarier film To that end they decided to remove the one line quipping Freddy who had become less scary and more comical over the years and bring back his darker nature The writers developed the character to be a child molester something that Craven wanted to do originally in but changed to a child killer instead Freddy s physical appearance was changed with the use of computer generated imagery to be closer to that of a burn victim br Because of the positive experiences Platinum Dunes producers had in the area A Nightmare on Elm Street was filmed primarily in Illinois Craven expressed his displeasure when he was not consulted on the project Robert Englund who portrayed Freddy in the previous eight films voiced his support of the remake and the casting of Haley in the role of Freddy br A Nightmare on Elm Street had its world premiere at Hollywood on April and was theatrically released in North America

production company began the process of rebooting the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise with a remake of the original film Producer Brad Fuller explained that they would follow the same tactic from their Friday the th remake and would abandon the things that had made the series less scary the film s antagonist Freddy Krueger and would not be cracking jokes as had become a staple of his character The focus was to make a horrifying movie Fuller said that the film is a remake of the film but clarified that they would borrow character deaths and dream sequences from the entire series br In February Samuel Bayer was hired to direct the film According to New Line production chief Toby Emmerich Michael Bay advocated heavily for Bayer because he had the ability to capture the kind of seductive and unsettling imagery that would make Nightmare feel like a fresh visually arresting moviegoing experience Bayer declined Platinum Dunes offer twice but finally accepted after Bay emailed him and explained the kind of business opportunity it would be br br In June interview Craven who directed the original movie and was not consulted for the remake expressed displeasure with the new film In contrast Robert Englund who portrayed Freddy throughout the film series felt it was time for A Nightmare on Elm Street to be remade Englund liked the idea of being able to exploit the dreamscape with computer generated imagery and other technologies that did not exist when Craven made the original in Bayer believes that his film paid homage to what Craven did in but did not replicate it entirely Bayer recognized that Craven attempted to put more meaning into his films and that the character of Freddy Krueger affected the lives of a generation of people For Bayer remaking A Nightmare on Elm Street was about bringing that feeling to a new generation with a new spin on the character and story br Fuller and Form likened the new film to their remake of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre but instead of a remake they saw it as more of a reimagining The pair also explained that A Nightmare on Elm Street would have a different tone than their Friday the th remake Form states I think a Friday the th movie like we made was really fun You know sex drugs and rock and roll and I think a Nightmare movie is not that br When asked why New Line was rebooting the Nightmare on Elm Street film series Emmerich explained The Nightmare films are profoundly disturbing on a deep human level because they re about our dreams It s why we thought that we could reach an especially broad audience with a new film since the feeling of having your dreams being invaded was something that would translate to any country and any culture Overall Bayer wanted to create a film in a darker world that made the audience ask What makes a monster is it a monster because of its physical appearance someone with a scarred face and a clawed glove or is it a monster because of something deeper within the man himself br br Wesley Strick was initially hired to pen a script for a new A Nightmare on Elm Street because he had impressed Emmerich with a prequel script he wrote for the film Seven Eric Heisserer was subsequently hired to provide a rewrite of Strick s script before the film moved into production When Bayer came on board he received a script that reflected the combined efforts of Strick and Heisserer and which still needed to be tinkered with Bayer explained that the script goes deeper into Freddy as a person and how he became the thing he was Bayer expressed that unlike the Friday the th remake that picked the best parts from the first four films the Nightmare on Elm Street remake was coming straight from the first film br For the remake Freddy was brought back to his darker roots and away from the comical character he had become in later A Nightmare on Elm Street sequels Fuller pointed out that this Freddy did have one liners but they come from a darker sense of humor and were not intended to be as campy as in previous films Craven s original characterization of Freddy as a child molester was used because if Freddy killed children as in the original it would have been easy for the teenage characters to figure out using the Internet what had happened In an effort to keep the story fresh Heisserer developed the concept of micro naps because the dream reality sequences could become repetitive The micro nap allowed them to blur reality and the dream world and get some great scares br In March Heisserer had expressed his dislike for the finished product and spoke of the film s production On my first day on set a crew member told me In this intro scene for the two leads we decided there wasn t enough dialogue for them at this party so we took some dialogue from page and put it here In a follow up tweet Heisserer wrote In case you were wondering this is NOT how it works br br Robert Englund didn t reprise the role of Freddy Krueger for the remake despite having performed the role for the eight previous films Jackie Earle Haley was cast to take over Englund s most well known role in April Initially the studio wanted to cast an unknown for the role of Freddy Krueger but it was Haley s performance in Little Children that impressed Emmerich enough to cast the actor against the original intentions Emmerich explained Freddy is this incredible stew of malevolence and anger but he also has a hint of vulnerability and Jackie really has all of that and more He just seemed completely right for the part Bayer stated that he and producers Form and Fuller managed to acquire the screen test Haley gave as Rorschach for Watchmen after viewing it Bayer said it blew his mind and that he knew Haley would be able to go deep and create a believable character who was a psychopath with a burned face and a claw br Haley said the first time he heard his name mentioned in conjunction with the character was from people on the Internet who suggested he be cast Later he learned that his agents were already in talks with Brad Fuller Haley also said that he was apprehensive about taking on the role of a character with such a dark past that of a child murderer for about a minute and a half Knowing the Freddy Krueger in the remake would be even darker Haley came quickly to the realization that he was doing a horror film and this was just a fictional character Haley said that once he embraced the idea of Freddy as a mythical boogeyman it became very freeing for him as an actor Haley s opinion of the original movie however was not a positive one Jay Bauman a stand in for Kyle Gallner during the production recalls Haley saying during the filming I hadn t seen the original since it was first in theatres so I watched it in my hotel the other night and it was just the worst movie I have ever seen br br Haley was contracted for three films which includes the remake and two sequels Englund agreed with the casting of Haley and that he felt Haley s physical size worked in this role Haley stated that he did not intend to have Englund s original performances influence his own and that he used the frustration of having to sit in the make up chair for three and a half hours as his motivation to get into character br Rooney Mara plays the role of Nancy Holbrook Mara was also contracted for a sequel Bayer describes Nancy as the loneliest girl in the world Mara stated that her Nancy is different from the role of Nancy Thompson performed by Heather Langenkamp and described her character as socially awkward and timid and really doesn t know how to connect with people Kyle Gallner was cast as Quentin who forms a connection with Nancy Gallner described his character as a mess more jittery and more out there than Nancy is Gallner pointed out that his character is like this because of the amount of pharmaceuticals he ingests to stay awake Producer Brad Fuller commented that Gallner brought a sense of humanity and relatability to the role with his compassion and intellect Other cast members include Katie Cassidy Thomas Dekker and Kellan Lutz Cassidy performed the role of Kris According to Cassidy Kris becomes an emotional wreck throughout the film Cassidy described her character s ordeal She is literally dragged through hell having to crawl through dark claustrophobic tunnels She s always crying and freaking out as her nightmares of Freddy bleed into her everyday life Kris suspects there s something that connects her with the others she even confronts her mother about it but no one s talking br Dekker portrays Jesse Kris s ex boyfriend According to Dekker Jesse kind of knows what s going on but refuses to believe it Dekker explained that Jesse spends so much time trying to convince himself that Freddy is not real that by the time he does meet Freddy face to face he s just a mess There s no bravado about it His terror is very real Lutz plays Dean Kris s current boyfriend and a well liked well off high school jock Connie Britton Clancy Brown and Elvis Jasso Mar n also star Gallner and Mara explained that the teenagers in the remake are a little more aware of Freddy and their situation whereas in the original Nancy and her friends were more mellow and nonchalant until they were finally killed br br Form and Fuller explained that Freddy s physical appearance would more accurately resemble a burn victim Form later clarified that there was a fine line they did not want to cross when it came to making Freddy look like a burn victim According to the producer the crew had many reference photos of burn victims which detailed how white the skin would appear after healing Form did not want the audience to turn away in disgust every time Freddy was on the screen so they opted to hold back on some of the realism Fuller noted how horrific the images were and how difficult they were to look at The special effects crew that worked on The Dark Knight and created the computer generated images CGI for Two Face were brought in to work on the CGI for Freddy s face The CGI is used in conjunction with the special effects make up that Haley wears The prosthetic appliances used to create Freddy s physical look were designed by Andrew Clement Haley described the experience of wearing the prosthetic devices and make up as pretty encumbering br When production started Clement and his crew would spend six hours applying Haley s make up eventually the crew was able to streamline the process According to Haley the make up crew would glue individual prosthetic devices from his head all the way down his back The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes each day in the make up chair to apply the appliances on occasion it would take almost four and a half hours when the crew also needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap Haley did not need to worry about the skull cap most days because he was able to wear the fedora on top of his head Haley also had to wear contact lenses one bloody one cloudy The cloudy contact lens made it difficult for the actor to see Haley also had to work on developing Freddy s voice for the film According to Haley the process of coming up with the perfect voice for Freddy was this organic process of embodying the character and not about just sitting around the table and going Let me try this voice and this voice Haley and Bayer admitted that some of the voice would be digitally enhanced to give it a supernatural quality and differentiate it from the voice Haley used as Rorschach in Watchmen br br With a budget of million principal photography began on May and officially wrapped on July the same year Because of the positive experiences Platinum Dunes producers had in the area when producing The Amityville Horror and The Unborn they chose to film in Illinois Platinum Dunes also received a thirty percent tax break for filming in the state The producers looked for locations that were old and decaying to mirror the look of Krueger They settled on the Ryerson Steel warehouse on the west side of Chicago to film most of the scenes in which the townspeople burn Krueger alive br New Line contracted with two high schools in Illinois Elk Grove High School and John Hersey High School to shoot scenes for the remake According to Nancy Holman principal of Elk Grove High the studio contacted schools across the nation looking for one that had a swimming pool Although filming took place at both schools neither was identified by name The studio cast extras for various school scenes including one in the pool but required that all students who auditioned be at least years old Lenore Gonzales Bragaw school board president was initially apprehensive about the deal as she disliked the idea of the studio filming scenes of violence at the schools Bragaw agreed once she was assured that no one would be killed during the pool scenes br On May the Nightmare on Elm Street film crew went on location to the city of Gary Indiana to film scenes at a Methodist church The studio had negotiated with the city for months before finally settling on a deal According to Ben Clement the executive director of the Gary Office of Film and Television the studio was looking for an architectural style that would fit the story line of the film The film crew returned to the streets of Gary first in June to film a dream sequence that takes place on Elm Street and later in December to shoot some scenes in a diner br According to Fuller and Form Warner Bros suggested A Nightmare on Elm Street be released in D because of the increased box office revenue of recent D films It was the opinion of the Platinum Dunes producers that if a film was not initially conceived as D then it should not be converted to D Fuller and Form fought the studio to keep the remake D Warner Bros and Platinum Dunes came to agree that a D movie would not be the best version of the movie br br The score to A Nightmare on Elm Street was composed by Steve Jablonsky and recorded by a piece string ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony The movie

age and under br Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave it a B and concluded that I did jump a few times and I liked Haley s dour malevolence but overall the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by the numbers bad dream that plays a little too much like a corporately ordered rerun One two Freddy s coming for you Three four we ve been there before Xan Brooks of The Guardian gave the film stars writing Debut director Samuel Bayer was not hired to dismantle the franchise but to shoot it afresh Richard Corliss of Time wrote I liked the new Nightmare but I know that any new version of a revered

of Krueger saying Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory there s just no replacing Englund Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film one star out of four because he stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy So
