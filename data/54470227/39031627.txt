like a throwback br Del Toro wanted the film to honor the grand dames of the haunted house genre namely Robert Wise s The Haunting and Jack Clayton s The Innocents The director intended to make a

called the film gorgeous and just fucking terrifying and said it electrified him like Sam Raimi s The Evil Dead whose distribution he helped secure with a rave review in King s son writer Joe Hill called Crimson Peak del Toro s blood soaked Age of Innocence a gloriously sick waltz through Daphne du Maurier territory IGN reviewer Scott Collura gave the film an out of score saying Featuring memorable performances amazing production design and a hard edge that is too often lacking in horror films these days it nonetheless also manages to subvert some long standing tropes about the gothic romance genre which inspired it Writing on Roger Ebert s official website and giving the movie four stars out of four Sheila O Malley said Watching del Toro s films is a pleasure because his vision is evident in every frame Best of all though is his belief that what terrifies him will terrify others He s right Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Its sombre sincerity and hypnotic treasure box beauty make Crimson Peak feel like a film out of time but Del Toro his cast and his crew carry it off without a single postmodern prod or smirk The film wears its heart on its sleeve along with its soul and most of its intestines The Guardian lead film critic Peter Bradshaw gave the film four stars out of five wrote that Guillermo del Toro s gothic fantasy romance Crimson Peak is outrageously sumptuous gruesomely violent and designed to within an inch of its life Observer critic Mark Kermode considered it the director s best film since Pan s Labyrinth and noted the various gothic and horror influences including Sheridan Le Fanu Robert Stevenson s Jane Eyre and Hitchcock s Rebecca on one of the year s most handsomely mounted productions br Dan Jolin of Empire wrote that It may be a little overwrought for some tastes borderline camp at points but if you re partial to a bit of Victorian romance with Hammer horror gloop and big frilly night gowns GDT delivers an uncommon treat Bilge Ebiri of Vulture wrote that It doesn t always seem to know what it wants to be But it s still full of marvels Sara Stewart of the New York Post wrote that Chastain and Wasikowska take center stage while Hiddleston flutters around like one of Allerdale s huge black moths Watching the women square off within del Toro s eye popping painterly palette is a feast for the eyes if not particularly substantial fare for the mind A O Scott of The New York Times wrote that The film is too busy and in some ways too gross to sustain an effective atmosphere of dread It tumbles into pastiche just when it should be swooning and sighing with earnest emotion Michael O Sullivan of The Washington Post wrote that The film by the stylish fantasist Guillermo del Toro looks marvelous but has a vein of narrative muck at its core Tom Huddleston of Time Out London wrote that All three actors work hard and when the melodrama hits fever pitch Crimson Peak lurches into life But overall this lacks weight and intensity a Bront esque bauble smeared in twenty first century slickness Peter Debruge of Variety wrote that Aflame with color and awash in symbolism this undeniably ravishing yet ultimately disappointing haunted house meller is all surface and no substance sinking under the weight of its own self importance into the sanguine muck below Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Crimson Peak is a cobwebs and candelabras chamber piece that s so preoccupied with being visually stunning it forgets to be scary br br br Accolades br br br br br br External links br
