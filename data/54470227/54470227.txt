Evelyn father Lee deaf daughter Regan and sons Marcus and Beau live on their isolated farm in the middle of a forest in upstate New York and have survived by taking precautions such as laying sand paths to avoid stepping on crunching leaves and using American Sign Language when communicating br When the family goes into the nearby town for supplies Beau finds a toy space shuttle but Lee makes him leave it behind due to the noise it would make if powered on As they are getting ready to leave Regan secretly gives him back the toy but without its batteries When they leave Beau takes back the batteries without anyone noticing While walking back home Beau turns on the space shuttle which starts making noise Almost immediately Beau is killed by a nearby creature before Lee can reach him Regan suffers terrible guilt thereafter which she hides from her parents although Marcus is aware of it br Over a year after Beau s death the family has seemingly gone back to normal with Evelyn several months pregnant Marcus reluctantly goes fishing with Lee while Regan upset that she cannot go visits Beau s grave While the rest of the family is gone Evelyn goes into labor While heading to the basement she accidentally steps on an upright nail and drops a photo frame alerting a nearby creature which enters the house Struggling to stay silent amidst the pain Evelyn flips a switch in the basement turning the surrounding lights around the house red The creature enters the basement soon after but Evelyn distracts it with the loud clicks of an egg timer and escapes upstairs Upon returning to the farm and seeing the red lights Marcus and Lee lure the creature out of the house by lighting off fireworks allowing Evelyn to safely give birth to her baby br Regan seeing the fireworks runs back to the house Lee enters the house armed with a shotgun and finds the baby and Evelyn then brings them into a hiding spot under the floor in the barn outside The baby cries alerting a creature into the barn The creature fails to find the source but breaks some water pipes Evelyn wakes up in the flooded hideout with the creature still inside and hides behind the falling water to mask her and the baby s sound br Marcus and Regan climb to the top of a corn silo and light a signal fire to other distant farms but Marcus falls into the silo and almost becomes sucked into the corn Hearing this the creature which is hunting for Evelyn br runs towards the silo and attacks Regan and Marcus The creature s disruptive effect on electronics causes Regan s cochlear implant to emit a high pitched noise which causes the creature to reel in pain and retreat breaking a hole in the silo which frees the children Lee finds Regan and Marcus directing them to his truck and is wounded when a creature attacks him Marcus cannot stifle a scream and the monster attacks the truck Lee signs to Regan that he has always loved her and proceeds to yell to draw the creature s attention sacrificing himself to the creature in order to allow Marcus and Regan to coast the truck back to the house safely br Reuniting with a grieving Evelyn and hearing the sounds of a nearby creature they make their way back into the house and enter the basement into which the creature follows them Regan remembering the reaction the creature had to the high pitched noise from her implant places the implant on a microphone which amplifies the noise The creature screeches in pain and exposes the vulnerable tissue beneath the armor plating on its head allowing Evelyn to kill it with Lee s shotgun Armed with a new weapon the family prepares to defend themselves from an approaching group of creatures that heard the shot br br Emily Blunt as Evelyn Abbott wife of Lee and the mother to their four children Regan Marcus Beau and baby Abbott Krasinski said her character wanted to ensure that their children be fully formed fully thinking people br John Krasinski as Lee Abbott an engineer who is Evelyn s husband and the father of Regan Marcus Beau and newborn baby Abbott Krasinski described his character as a survivalist focused on getting his family through each day br Krasinski also provided the motion capture for the extraterrestrial creatures br Noah Jupe as Marcus Abbott the second child and eldest son of Lee and Evelyn and Regan s and Beau s brother Krasinski noticed Jupe in the miniseries The Night Manager and watched an early screening of the film Suburbicon to evaluate Jupe s performance br Millicent Simmonds as Regan Abbott Lee and Evelyn s teenage deaf daughter and Marcus and Beau s older sister Krasinski said he sought a deaf actress for many reasons I didn t want a non deaf actress pretending to be deaf a deaf actress would help my knowledge and my understanding of the situations tenfold I wanted someone who lives it and who could teach me about it on set br Cade Woodward as Beau Abbott Lee and Evelyn s four year old son br Leon Russom as a man in the woods br br Scott Beck and Bryan Woods began writing A Quiet Place in January based on a concept they conceived in college When they first spoke with Platinum Dunes about the project the two said they wanted Blunt for the role of the mother Platinum Dunes Michael Bay had a first look deal with Paramount Pictures and showed their script to the studio During the writing stage Beck and Woods spoke to a Paramount executive who suggested that the film could be a crossover with the Cloverfield franchise When they took their final script to Paramount the studio embraced it as a distinct stand alone story Paramount bought the script from the duo Platinum Dunes producers Andrew Form and Brad Fuller sent the script to Krasinski to play the role of the father which he read in July The concept of parents protecting their children appealed to him especially as his second child with Blunt had recently been born br After reading Beck and Wood s script Krasinski pitched his vision of the story to Blunt who suggested he direct the film In a meeting with the producers Krasinski expressed his desire to co write and direct it and pitched them his vision When he co wrote the script he had Blunt in mind for the role however he did not ask her to do it as she had just had a child was working on another film and he was concerned that if he asked she would either decline it or accept it to support him I just thought if she does this she has to come to it on her own Blunt initially did not want to be cast but after reading Krasinski s script on a plane flight she felt she needed to do it as the story represented some of my deepest fears of not being able to protect my children br Beck and Woods said that Krasinski taking over the film as director wasn t about reshaping it in any massive way and that he really protected our vision of the script Krasinski said that their script differed from his in a bunch of little ways but the heart was all theirs They really had this thing that I wanted to be a part of He focused on the idea of family being the core of the story so every scare has to be because you love this family every detail has to become a detail that says something about this family not just to be cool not just to be scary His contributions to the screenplay included the use of sign language sand paths the lights and the walk to the forest and the pharmacy Krasinski was initially anxious about having very little dialogue to work with as he was concerned with how to keep people interested He then realized that minimal dialogue became the film s superpower The use of sign language came about when prior to filming Simmonds showed Krasinski the American Sign Language translation for a scene s dialogue and he found her gestures to be so much more cinematic than saying the words would ve been Blunt contributed to the pre production stage of the film Most of the directing Krasinski did with her role was off screen from the moment she accepted the project The two worked through the script and discussed the shots for the film before it went into production and by the time they got on set they had done all the collaborating all the hard work Blunt offered up the greatest ideas for the film he stated crediting her for raising the game for him as a filmmaker br In March Krasinski was announced as director and co writer of the film co starring with Blunt The film is his third directorial credit and his first for a major studio The film was produced on a budget of million br br The film was shot in days Production took place from May to November in Dutchess and Ulster counties in upstate New York Filmmakers spent their budget locally including a purchase of tons of corn which they hired local farmers to grow Some filming took place on a soundstage in the town of Pawling in Dutchess County as well as on location in the county s city of Beacon Filming also took place on the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail in New Paltz of Ulster County using the Springtown Truss Bridge Outside Dutchess and Ulster counties filming took place on Main Street in Little Falls in Herkimer County New York br br During filming the crew avoided making noise so diegetic synchronized sounds e g the sound of rolling dice on a game board could be recorded the sounds were amplified in post production A musical score was added which Krasinski justified in wanting audiences to have a cinematic experience and some familiarity with a traditional film component instead of feeling like they re part of a silence experiment Some music was cut from the film which Krasinski found more impactful than having the score dominate scenes br Supervising sound editors Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn worked on A Quiet Place For scenes from the perspective of the deaf daughter sound was removed to put greater focus on the visual They also advised on organizing shots to reflect the creatures perspective like showing them noticing a sound then showing what was causing the sound Composer Marco Beltrami provided the sound editors music to work with in a way that would not interfere with the sound design throughout the film br In the film creatures are blind and communicate through clicking sounds Aadahl and Van der Ryn said they were inspired by animal echolocation such as that employed by bats The sound of feedback normally avoided by sound editors was woven into the story at a loudness level that would not bother audiences too much br For moments in the movie that depict Regan s point of view Simmonds worked with sound designers to convey what the cochlear implants in the movie would have sounded like and what she was able to hear without the implants br br The characters communicate in American Sign Language ASL to avoid making sound so the filmmakers hired deaf mentor Douglas Ridloff to teach ASL to the actors and to be available to make corrections They also hired an ASL interpreter for deaf actress Simmonds so that spoken and signed language could be interpreted back and forth on set Simmonds grew up with ASL and she helped teach her fellow actors to sign She said In the movie we ve been signing together for years and years So it should look fluent She observed that each character s use of sign language reflected their motivations the father had short and brief signs which showed his survival mentality while the mother had more expressive signs as part of wanting her children to experience more than survival Krasinski said that Simmonds s character used signing that s very defiant it s very teenage defiant br Simmonds said that she suggested for the daughter to rebel rather than cower during a sign language fight with her father She also said that the script originally had the father sign I love you to his daughter at the end of the film but she suggested for him to follow with I ve always loved you to make up for their arguing earlier in the film br Producers Andrew Form and Bradley Fuller said that they initially planned not to provide on screen subtitles for sign language dialogue while providing only context clues but they realized that subtitles were necessary for the scene in which the deaf daughter and her hearing father argue about the modified hearing aid They subsequently added subtitles for all sign language dialogue in the film br br Production designer Jeffrey Beecroft headed the creature design and Industrial Light Magic created the creatures led by visual effects supervisor Scott Farrar The director wanted the creatures to look like they had evolved to no longer need eyes and to be somewhat humanoid in nature Farrar said the initial creature design showed them with rhinoceros like horns out of their faces but later redesigns omitted this because it was not scary enough Creature designers referenced prehistoric fish black snakes and bats particularly their movement patterns Inspiration was also drawn from bog people cadavers that have been mummified in peat turning the skin black and giving it a sagging leathery look Krasinski provided motion capture for the creatures br br Paramount Pictures released the first trailer for A Quiet Place in November It aired a second commercial for the film during the US football championship Super Bowl LII on February Of the seven trailers that aired during the playoff A Quiet Place and Red Sparrow were shown during the pregame and had the lowest views and social conversations A Quiet Place had views on YouTube views on Facebook and social conversations On February Krasinski appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an overall positive score and a definite recommend br Writing for Rolling Stone Peter Travers gave the film out of praising the movie s exploration of themes about parenthood and saying This new horror classic will fry your nerves to a frazzle br Variety s Owen Gleiberman said A Quiet Place is a tautly original genre bending exercise technically sleek and accomplished with some vivid scary moments though it s a little too in love with the stoned logic of its own premise Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film out of and said My favorite moment an encounter between Regan and one of the monsters in a cornfield plays with sound and image and tension creatively Other bits are more shameless I don t know if I d call A Quiet Place enjoyable it s more grueling than cathartic br Author Stephen King praised the film in a tweet saying A QUIET PLACE is an extraordinary piece of work Terrific acting but the main thing is the SILENCE and how it makes the camera s eye open wide in a way few movies manage Nick Allen of RogerEbert com called A Quiet Place Krasinski s breakthrough as a triple threat entertainer but it s been a long time coming By no accident he s tackled the horror genre while relying on the unique strength that can be seen throughout his acting work and one that has made him relatable as an everyman across TV and film expressive silence br Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian says In its simplicity and punch this is a film that feels as if it could have been made decades ago in the classic age of Planet of the Apes or The Omega Man It is a cracking back to basics thriller that does not depend too much on what these creatures look like br Matthew Monagle of Film School Rejects said A Quiet Place seemed to be the early frontrunner for the sparsely intellectual horror movie of the year like previous films The Babadook and The Witch Monagle said Krasinski who had directed two previous films was making an unusual pivot into a genre typically reserved for newcomers and considered it to be part of a movement toward horror films layered in storytelling with character beats not typically found in a horror movie Tatiana Tenreyro writing for Bustle said while A Quiet Place was not a silent film It is the first of its kind within the modern horror genre for how little spoken dialogue it actually has She said the rare moments of spoken dialogue give depth to this horror movie showing how the narrative defies the genre s traditional films even further br br Krasinski identified the primary theme of the film as a dramatization of fears associated with modern parenthood Krasinski who had recently become a father said in a conference interview that he was already in a state of terror about whether or not he was a good enough father and added that the meaning of parenthood had been elevated for him by imagining being a father in a nightmare world struggling to simply keep his children alive Krasinski has told CBS News that the scares were secondary to how powerful this could be as an allegory or metaphor for parenthood For me this is all about parenthood br Travers Rolling Stone review argued that the question Krasinski tackles is what defines a family and what s needed to preserve it Who are we asks Mom if we can t protect our children The answers are worked out with satisfying complexity and genuine feeling proving indeed that home is where family is The Hollywood Reporter s John DeFore described the film as a terrifying thriller with a surprisingly warm heart and said you might have to go back to Jeff Nichols Take Shelter to find a film that has used the fantastic this well to convey the combination of fear and responsibility a good parent feels br br Speaking of the political and social commentary the film encouraged Krasinski said That s not what I was going for but the best compliment you can get on any movie is that it starts a conversation The fact that people are leaving and talking about anything is really fun but certainly about deep stuff like that is awesome Krasinski who did not grow up with horror films said that prior films of the genre such as Don t Breathe and Get Out that had societal commentary were part of his research In addition to considering his film a metaphor for parenthood he compared the premise to US politics in I think in our political situation that s what s going on now You can close your eyes and stick your head in the sand or you can try to participate in whatever s going on He cited Jaws as an influence with how the protagonist police officer moved from New York to an island to avoid frightening situations and was forced to encounter one in his new location with shark attacks br Roman Catholic Bishop Robert Barron was surprised by what he saw as strikingly religious themes in the film He likened the family s primitive agrarian life of silence to monasticism and commends their self giving love Barron suggested pro life themes especially in the choices of the parents as Mrs Abbott risks everything to give birth to a child and her husband lays down his own life so that the children can live what Barron sees as the ultimate expression of parental love Sonny Bunch of The Washington Post also commented and expanded on a pro life message br Richard Brody writing for The New Yorker criticized A Quiet Place for what he perceived to be the inclusion of conservative and pro gun themes in the film He described it as the antithesis of Get Out and both apparently unconscious and conspicuously regressive and opined that it brings to the fore the idealistic elements of gun culture while dramatizing the tragic implications that inevitably shadow that idealism Krasinski addressed Brody s criticism in a subsequent interview with Esquire stating that he did not write the film with an intentional political message Krasinski said I never saw it that way or ever thought of it until it was presented to me in that way The film wasn t about being you know silent and political my whole metaphor was solely about parenthood br br A Quiet Place was released on Digital HD on June and on Ultra HD Blu ray Blu ray and DVD on July Paramount Pictures released a K Steelbook Blu Ray Digital version of the film on February br br A sequel to A Quiet Place titled A Quiet Place Part II was written and directed by Krasinski and stars Blunt Simmonds Jupe Cillian Murphy and Djimon Hounsou
