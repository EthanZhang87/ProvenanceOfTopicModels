and time travel in film Rian Johnson said br br Even though it s a time travel movie the pleasure of it doesn t come from the mass of time travel It s not a film like Primer for instance where the big part of the enjoyment is kind of working out all the intricacies of it For Looper I very much wanted it to be a more character based movie that is more about how these characters dealt with the situation time travel has brought about So the biggest challenge was figuring out how to not spend the whole movie explaining the rules and figure out how to put it out there in a way that made sense on some intuitive level for the audience then get past it and deal with the real meat of the story br Other influences cited by Rian Johnson include The Terminator Witness Akira Domu A Child s Dream Monkeys Timecrimes and Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World br br Looper premiered on September at the opening night of the Toronto International Film Festival The film was then released theatrically in the United States on September by FilmDistrict who obtained the domestic rights from production company Endgame Entertainment at the Cannes Film Festival In turn FilmDistrict chose to release the film with Sony Pictures over their genre label TriStar Pictures br The Chinese release of the film reintegrates a substantial number of scenes set in Shanghai The move was requested by Chinese production company DMG Entertainment in order to further appeal to Chinese audiences Several of these scenes were shortened or cut for the American release br Johnson released a free audio commentary on SoundCloud which was heavily requested after making one for The Brothers Bloom to be downloaded and listened to during the film with the warning Needless to say this is NOT to be listened to on a first viewing or before you ve seen the film br br The film was released on Blu ray and DVD in North America on December The film was also released on January in online UK stores with

earning million domestically and million internationally for a total of million against its million production budget br br On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The website s critics consensus reads As thought provoking as it is thrilling Looper delivers an uncommonly smart bravely original blend of futuristic sci fi and good old fashioned action On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating universal acclaim Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br James Mottram of Total Film gave Looper stars out of concluding that it was the best sci fi movie since Moon The best time travel yarn since Monkeys And one of the best films of br Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review calling it an engaging neatly worked out time travel sci fi thriller but also criticizing the effects involved in making Gordon Levitt resemble Willis At first the effect is a bit odd and you can t quite put your finger on what s off then it feels downright weird to be looking at a version of Gordon Levitt who is no longer the actor you ve known for a few years now br Peter Debruge of Variety also gave the film a positive review writing that writer director Johnson s grandly conceived impressively mounted third feature shows a giddy geeky interest in science fiction then forces it into the back seat and lets the multidimensional characters drive In a genre infamous for loose ends this thinking man s thriller marshals action romance and a dose of very dark comedy toward a stunning payoff br Kim Newman of Empire magazine gave Looper stars out of writing Intelligent science fiction sometimes seems an endangered species too much physics and there s a risk of creating something cold and remote too many explosions and get lost in the multiplex Looper isn t perfect but it pulls off the full Wizard Of Oz it has a brain courage and a heart Noel Murray of The A V Club gave the film an A grade writing Looper is a remarkable feat of imagination and execution entertaining from start to finish even as it asks the audience to contemplate how and why humanity keeps making the same rotten mistakes Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review writing Looper is way inventive but it wears its creativity lightly like it s no big deal This is a highflying super stylish science fiction thriller that brings a fresh approach to mind bending genre material We re not always sure where this time travel film is going but we wouldn t dream of abandoning the ride br Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film stars out of writing Looper s heady blend of time travel gritty action and a jot of romance is such a thrilling and cerebral mind bender that it will likely have moviegoers gathering outside the theater afterward to hash out details of its intricately constructed universe Not that that s a bad thing Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film stars out of praising the performances of Willis and Gordon Levitt and concluding Lacing tremendously exciting action with touching gravity Looper hits you like a shot in the heart Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times also gave the film stars out of praising its screenplay stating Looper a smart and tricky sci fi story sidesteps the paradoxes of time travel by embracing them Most time travel movies run into trouble in the final scenes when impossibilities pile up one upon another This film leads to a startling conclusion that wipes out the story s paradoxes so neatly it s as if it never happened br Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B grade writing The time swivels in Looper evoke some of Inception s fancy temporal tricks some of which of course also involved Gordon Levitt straddling multiple time zones at once But it s the glimpses of Children of Men like societal dystopia that give the movie its real weight Keith Staskiewicz also writing for Entertainment Weekly reviewing the DVD and also giving a B said The film s premise is markedly inventive and writer director Rian Johnson spends a lot of time making his universe seem lived in and believable but he s not just concerned with whiz bang what ifs The showdown of selves illuminates just how little Gordon Levitt s character has changed over the intervening years stuck as he is in a feedback loop of drug use and violence despite his pipe dream of moving to Europe The retro trench coats and firearms also suggest a sort of eternal recurrence and as Looper s plot gets more complex its central question simplifies If we can t fix our mistakes can we at least make sure we don t repeat the same ones over and over again br Richard Corliss of Time magazine gave the film a positive review calling Looper a hybrid mashing Quentin Tarantino and Philip K Dick into a species of pulp science fiction and also writing A fanciful film with the patina of hyper realism Looper is well served by actors who behave not as if they were dropped carelessly into the future but spent their whole desperate lives there Dana Stevens of Slate gave the film a mixed review writing Looper felt to me like a maddening near miss It posits an impossible but fascinating to imagine relationship a face to face encounter between one s present and future self in which each self must account for its betrayal of the other and then throws away nearly all the dramatic potential that relationship offers br br The film was included in
