television news anchor who is being stalked by serial killer Eddie Quist In cooperation with the police she takes part in a scheme to capture Eddie by agreeing to meet him in a sleazy porn theater Eddie forces Karen to watch a video of a young woman being bound and raped and when Karen turns around to see Eddie she screams The police enter and shoot Eddie and although Karen is safe she suffers amnesia Her therapist Doc George Waggner decides to send her and her husband Bill Neill to the Colony a secluded resort in the countryside where he sends patients for treatment br The Colony is filled with strange characters and one a sultry nymphomaniac named Marsha tries to seduce Bill When he resists her unsubtle sexual overtures he is attacked and scratched on the arm by a werewolf while returning to his cabin After Bill s attack Karen summons her friend Terry Fisher to the Colony and Terry connects the resort to Eddie through a sketch he left behind having previously discovered that Eddie s body disappeared from the morgue Karen begins to suspect that Bill is hiding a secret far more threatening than marital infidelity Later that night Bill meets Marsha at a campfire in the woods While having sex in the moonlight they undergo a frightening transformation into werewolves br While investigating the next morning Terry is attacked by a werewolf in a cabin though she escapes after cutting the monster s hand off with an axe She runs to Doc s office and places a phone call to her boyfriend Chris Halloran who has been alerted about the Colony s true nature While on the phone with Chris Terry looks for files on Eddie Quist When she finally finds the file in the filing cabinet she is attacked by Eddie in werewolf form and is killed when she is bitten on the jugular vein Chris hears this on the other end and sets off for the Colony armed with silver bullets br Karen is confronted by the resurrected Eddie Quist once again and Eddie transforms himself into a werewolf in front of her In response Karen splashes Eddie in the face with corrosive acid and flees Later as Chris arrives at the Colony he is confronted by the horribly disfigured Eddie who is fatally shot by Chris with a silver bullet when he attempts to transform However it turns out all the people in the Colony are werewolves and can shapeshift at will without the need of a full moon to do so Karen and Chris survive their attacks and burn the Colony to the ground As they drive away however one werewolf breaks into their car and bites Karen before being shot by Chris turning back into Bill as he dies br Karen resolves to warn the entire world about the existence of werewolves and begins a special worldwide broadcast announcement to the people around the world Then to prove her story she herself transforms into a werewolf She is shot at by Chris in front of a live viewing audience although the people watching the transformation from their television sets around the world are amused believing it to be just a stunt done with special effects Marsha who escaped the Colony herself completely unscathed sits at a bar with a man who while watching the special broadcast announcement orders a pepper steak for himself and a rare hamburger for Marsha after Karen s display cuts to a commercial break br br br Cast br br br Production br Theater chain owner turned producer Steven Lane had long been wanting to get into film production and was an avid horror reader particularly of Stephen King br A blurb from King on the cover of the book The Howling by Gary Brandner drew Lane s interest and eventually he looked into the prospect of buying the rights to make a film adaptation After tracking down the rights to Warner Bros who d done nothing with them in the two years since acquiring them he discovered they had resold the rights to director Jack Conrad Lane partnered with Conrad on The Howling with the two getting the film set up at Avco Embassy Pictures br After drafts by Jack Conrad who left the project early after disputes with the studio and Terence H Winkless proved unsatisfactory director Joe Dante hired John Sayles to completely rewrite the script The two had collaborated before on Dante s film Piranha Sayles rewrote the script with the same self aware satirical tone that he gave Piranha and his finished draft bears only a vague resemblance to Brandner s book However Winkless still received a co writer s credit along with Sayles for his work on the screenplay br The cast featured a number of recognizable character actors such as Kevin McCarthy John Carradine Kenneth Tobey and Slim Pickens many of whom appeared in genre films themselves Additionally the film was full of in joke references Roger Corman makes a cameo appearance as a man standing outside a phone booth as does John Sayles appearing as a morgue attendant and James Murtaugh as one of the members of the Colony Forrest J Ackerman appears in a brief cameo in an occult bookstore clutching a copy of an issue of his magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland br The Howling was also notable for its special effects which were state of the art at the time The transformation scenes were created by Rob Bottin who had also worked with Dante on Piranha Rick Baker was the original effects artist for the film but left the production to work on An American Werewolf in London which released the same year as The Howling handing over the effects work to Bottin Bottin s most celebrated effect was the on screen transformation of Eddie Quist which involved air bladders under latex facial applications to give the illusion of transformation Variety claimed that The Howling s biggest flaw is that the impact of this initial transformation is never topped during the climax of the film The film also features stop motion animation by David W Allen and puppetry intended to give the werewolves an even more non human look Despite most of the special effects at the time the silhouette of Bill and Marsha having sex as werewolves is obviously a cartoon animation Dante attributed this to budgetary reasons br Due to their work in The Howling Dante and producer Michael Finnell received the opportunity to make the film Gremlins for Steven Spielberg That film references The Howling with a smiley face image on a refrigerator door Eddie Quist leaves yellow smiley face stickers as his calling card in several places throughout The Howling Also Jim McKrell s character as news reporter Lew Landers appears in both The Howling and Gremlins br The film s screenwriter and future director John Sayles Dante s former producer Roger Corman and science fiction and horror film personality Forrest J Ackerman all have cameos br br br Music br Pino Donaggio composed the score which featured

werewolves by incorporating graphic practical effects and explicit sexuality while interweaving references to the film s context it also loosely referenced the Jonestown incident as the lead character Karen retreated to a forest community known as The Colony br According to The New York Times The Howling introduces themes of indulgence of primal animalistic desires particularly focusing on the sexual aspects of werewolves It also offers a satirical commentary on television and the media with its sensationalistic approach focusing on personalities like Dr George Waggner The film also
