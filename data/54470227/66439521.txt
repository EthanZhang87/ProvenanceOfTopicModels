longer had a set release date br br br Production br br br A Quiet Place br br Scott Beck and Bryan Woods wrote A Quiet Place based on a concept they conceived in college When they first spoke with Platinum Dunes about the project the two said they wanted Blunt for the role of the mother Platinum Dunes Michael Bay had a first look deal with Paramount Pictures and showed their script to the studio which bought it Platinum Dunes producers Andrew Form and Brad Fuller sent the script to Krasinski to play the role of the father The concept of parents protecting their children appealed to Kransinski After reading the script he pitched his vision of the story to Blunt who suggested he direct the film When he co wrote the script he had Blunt in mind for the role but did not ask her to do it as she had just had a child was working on another film and he was concerned that she would either decline it or accept it to support him I just thought if she does this she has to come to it on her own Blunt initially did not want to be cast but after reading Krasinski s script on a plane flight she felt she needed to do it as the story represented some of my deepest fears of not being able to protect my children After finishing his script Krasinski pitched to Paramount his vision for the film br Beck and Woods said that Krasinski taking over the film as director wasn t about reshaping it in any massive way and that he really protected our vision of the script Krasinski said that their script differed from his in a bunch of little ways but the heart was all theirs They really had this thing that I wanted to be a part of He focused on the idea of family being the core of the story so every scare has to be because you love this family every detail has to become a detail that says something about this family not just to be cool not just to be scary His contributions to the screenplay included the use of sign language sand paths the lights and the walk to the forest and the pharmacy The idea for sign language came about when prior to filming deaf actress Simmonds showed Krasinski the American Sign Language ASL translation for a scene s dialogue and he found her gestures to be so much more cinematic than saying the words would ve been Blunt contributed to the pre production stage of the film Most of the directing Krasinski did with her role was off screen from the moment she accepted the project Blunt offered ideas and the two worked through the script and discussed the shots for the film before it went into production By the time they got on set they had done all the collaborating all the hard work br The film was produced on a budget of million and shot in days Production took place from May to November in Dutchess and Ulster counties in upstate New York During filming the crew avoided making noise so diegetic sounds e g the sound of rolling dice on a game board could be recorded the sounds were amplified in post production The musical score was used with the intention of not dominating the film but providing a more familiar cinematic experience to audiences so they did not feel like they were part of a silence experiment For the creatures behavior Aadahl and Van der Ryn said they were inspired by animal echolocation such as that employed by bats The sound of feedback normally avoided by sound editors was woven into the story at a loudness level that would not bother audiences too much br The filmmakers hired deaf mentor Douglas Ridloff to teach ASL to the actors and to be available to make corrections They also hired an ASL interpreter for Simmonds so that spoken and signed language could be interpreted back and forth on set Simmonds also helped teach her fellow actors to sign Producers Andrew Form and Bradley Fuller said that they initially planned not to provide on screen subtitles for sign language dialogue while providing only context clues but they realized that subtitles were necessary for the scene in which the deaf daughter and her hearing father argue about the modified hearing aid They subsequently added subtitles for all sign language dialogue in the film br br br A Quiet Place Part II br br In April Paramount chair and CEO Jim Gianopulos announced that a sequel was in development Krasinski said he had considered the first film a one off Uncertain of finding similar success in a sequel he initially told Paramount to seek another writer and director The first film s screenwriters Scott Beck and Bryan Woods did not return for the sequel Woods said they were not interested in a franchise approach and that they would rather try to create original ideas and use their writing credits as an opportunity to push several projects Beck said Instead of focusing on sequels per se it s about investing back into the ecosystem of original ideas in a massive marketplace br According to Krasinski Paramount rejected pitches from other writers and directors that were considered too franchise oriented He said I had this small idea which was to make Millie Simmonds the lead of the movie her character opens the door to all the themes I was dealing with in the first movie The studio invited him to write a script based on his idea Krasinski decided to write and direct the film Actors Emily Blunt Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe reprised their roles from the first film and Cillian Murphy
