cheap TV movie and that it displays all that makes these movies a failed experiment in blockbuster exploitation Reviewing for The A V Club Anya Stanley gave the film a D grade and said In The Forever Purge we re told a story that a battered nation has heard a lot a sermon of immigration and class warfare that s too heavy handed to say anything its prospective audience hasn t been told on countless social media feeds over the last few years Rick Bentley s review in Tribune News Service complained of a thinly veiled attempt to capitalize on the tensions currently gripping this country The film s deep dive into racism comes across as manipulative trite and uninspired Dustin Chase wrote in The Galveston Daily News The Forever Purge comes to Texas to try to redefine stale franchise Johnny Oleksinski s review in The New York Post stated That idea was fun once maybe even twice but by the fifth outing the formula has given way to preachiness and predictability br Writing in The Detroit News Adam Gram stated The fifth Purge talks a big game employing all sorts of charged political words and theories but doesn t do anything interesting with them Peter Vonder Haar s review in The Houston Press analyzed The biggest problem with The Forever Purge is how it abandons the central conceit of the series Previous movies focused on the protagonists struggle to survive until the end of the Purge while simultaneously giving us wider looks at the phenomenon itself Here with the murderousness extending indefinitely the characters situation is indistinguishable from any of a thousand other shoot em ups Candace McMillan wrote in Seattle Refined that the film is ultimately just a tiresome rehash of an overused adage It s making an obvious statement about the callous attitude we as Americans take with those less fortunate without accounting for the many complications and intricacies within our nation as well But shock awe and letdown is all that s left of a franchise that s been bled dry br Matthew Mongale s review for The Austin Chronicle dismissed the film as pretty much by the numbers while Nick Rogers in The Midwest Film Journal called the film The creative exhaustion of a once engaging franchise Ian Freer in Empire wrote The fifth Purge outing goes for broke and comes out wanting working neither as political commentary nor horror action thriller br br br Sequel br Although The Forever Purge was intended to be the final installment of the franchise producer Jason Blum stated in June that he intends to make additional Purge films and that he is working on convincing James DeMonaco to continue the story In July DeMonaco confirmed his concept for a sixth film to focus on Frank Grillo s character Leo Barnes from Anarchy and Election Year and to incorporate a worldwide Purge a concept developed for a potential third season of The Purge television series which was scrapped br br br br br br External links br Official website br The Forever
