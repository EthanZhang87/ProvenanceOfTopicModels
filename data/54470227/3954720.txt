Elizabeth br br br Cast br br br Analysis br Burnt Offerings was part of a trend in s horror films focused on the supernatural such as The Omen Carrie Audrey Rose and The Amityville Horror It also was one of many horror films in the s and early s such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist presenting the negative impacts of middle class life such as empty headed consumerism in the film the family is destroyed by a house they otherwise dreamed of generic looking in the middle of nowhere and meant for leisure Writer Paul Meehan notes in his book The Haunted House on Film An Historical Analysis that it is the first film to depict the psychological destruction of a family facilitated by supernatural forces in their home br In the book An Introduction to American Movies Steven C Earley cited Ben s fall onto a car window as an example of the high presence of violence in films of the s Retrospective reviews viewed the story as a criticism on obsession on property ownership and the destruction of the nuclear family br Literary critic John Kenneth Muir suggests that the film s depiction of Marian s supernaturally driven obsession with the home and its physical state can be interpreted as a commentary on materialism and the concern of physical matter over human and familial relationships br br br Production br br br Development br In a Variety piece published on December it was announced a project named Burnt Offerings would be directed by Bob Fosse from a screenplay by Robert Marasco Turman Films and Cinema Center Films would be producers and Lawrence Turman executive producer Although it never materialized a novel of the same name by Marasco was published in The American Film Institute inductively reasoned the book may have been written based on the un produced screenplay The title of the film and source novel derives from the Bible referring to a sacrifice by fire and a gift offered to God br Burnt Offerings was directed by Dan Curtis best known for television horror works such as the TV series Dark Shadows and made for TV films like The Night Stalker Not counting House of Dark Shadows and Night of Dark Shadows theatrically released feature film adaptations of the TV series it was the only original theatrical feature he ever directed When offered the project he found the novel uninteresting in particular what he called its nothing ending and joked to himself I bet some idiot who doesn t know what he s doing will come along and make this br William F Nolan removed the first third of the book where the family was in New York City and the chauffeur was conceived by him and unique to the film br br br Filming br br Filming took place in August at the historic Dunsmuir House in Oakland California Burnt Offerings was the first film to be shot at the Dunsmuir House which appeared as a main location in the horror film Phantasm several years later br Bette Davis reportedly had conflicts with Karen Black during the shoot feeling that Black did not extend to her an appropriate degree of respect and that her behavior on the film set was unprofessional Davis also expressed disdain for Reed whom she later referred to as possibly one of the most loathesome human beings I have ever had the misfortune of meeting br br br Release br br br Box office br Burnt Offerings was given a limited theatrical release through United Artists on August opening in Los Angeles and Buffalo New York It premiered in New York City the following month on September The release expanded on October with the film ranking at number one at the United States box office this weekend The film went on to gross million br br br Critical response br Arizona Republic critic Mike Petryni was frightened by the film particularly the smiling chauffeur but felt it was ruined by an emphasis on constant thrills over subtle horror He also was confused about several concepts such as why Marian was depicted as frequently handling Mrs Allardyce s trays George Anderson of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette criticized the film as dependent on typical horror tropes such as shocks and loud music hits he also described the tension as a lot of sinister huffing and puffing to little effect noting how most of the runtime is spent on mystery of which characters are the antagonists or protagonists Ron Cowan of the Statesman Journal described the film as a less than Grand Guignol venture with a stellar cast concluding The house is a real charmer especially when it sheds its shingles and siding and neatly disposes of troublesome people By then though the movie s pace may have disposed of some of the audience br While calling Meredith and Heckart the best performers in the film Richard Dyer of The Boston Globe argued the material gave the actors little to work with he called Black particularly inconsistent Reed looking like an eggplant and stated Davis tries to create a Bette Davis character without any Bette Davis lines to work with so all she can do is puff and snort a lot Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times gave the film an unfavorable review writing that it is too trite too drawn out and repetitious too poorly motivated and finally too vague in the nature of its supernatural evil to make it br Film critic Roger Ebert called the film a mystery all right concluding Burnt Offerings just persists until it occurs to us that the characters are the only ones in the theater who don t know what s going to happen next Variety stated The horror is expressed through sudden murderous impulses felt by Black and Reed a premise which might have been interesting if director Dan Curtis hadn t relied strictly on formula treatment br br br Retrospective reviews br Donald Guarisco of Movie Guide called the film worthy of rediscovery by the horror fans who missed it the first time concluding In the end Burnt Offerings is probably a bit too methodical in its pacing for viewers accustomed to slam bang approach of post s horror fare but seasoned horror fans will find plenty to enjoy In addition to the slow build Starburst s Robert Martin spotlighted its cast particularly the chemistry between Reed and Montgomery Black s loving and murderous combination and Davis uncomfortable heart attack scene However he also felt the overall product was held back by its TV film look particularly its flat cinematography and visuals that were more clever than scary br On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes of critics reviews are positive with an average rating of br br br Accolades br br br Home media br On August MGM Home Entertainment released a region DVD of Burnt Offerings The original video shape is in wide screen and also features an audio commentary with Dan Curtis Karen Black and William F Nolan The DVD was poorly received Reviewers criticized the video quality which appeared to have been shot with soft focus and the Dolby Digital Mono audio that made the voices muddy and indistinct br A Blu ray edition of the film was
