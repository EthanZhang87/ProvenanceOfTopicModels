holds a Certified Fresh score on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on critics with an average rating of The website s critics consensus reads The Night Manager s smart writing and riveting story are elevated all the more by Hugh Laurie and Tom Hiddleston s captivating performances Metacritic which uses a weighted average gives the series a score of based on critics indicating universal acclaim br Adam Sisman le Carr s biographer wrote in the UK The Daily Telegraph It is more than years since the novel was published and in that time two film companies have tried and failed to adapt it concluding that it was impossible to compress into two hours But this six hour television adaptation is long enough to give the novel its due He added And though Hugh Laurie may seem a surprising choice to play the worst man in the world he dominates the screen as a horribly convincing villain Alert viewers may spot a familiar face in the background of one scene in a restaurant John le Carr himself makes a cameo as he did in the films of A Most Wanted Man and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy But he is on screen only for an instant blink and you ll miss him br Reviewing the first episode for The Guardian Archie Bland began by noting The Night Manager is as sexed up as television drama comes In Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie it has bona fide international stars in John le Carr s source novel it has a pedigree of untouchable grandeur The palette is as sumptuous as one of our hero Jonathan Pine s beautiful hotels He added It s Laurie s vulpine performance that gives The Night Manager its force once the smell of money has worn off But we barely see him for the first minutes a delayed gratification trick that s always worked like magic on me ever since we spent the whole first episode of The West Wing waiting impatiently to meet Josiah Bartlet Turning to Hiddleston s performance Bland wrote And as the embodiment of the show s atmosphere of paralysed establishment glamour Hiddleston is the business When the noble beast beneath that accommodating English exterior begins to make itself known I find the righteous revenge he s intent on wreaking on Roper compelling br IGN reviewer Jesse Schedeen gave the serial out of saying The Night Manager proves that television is the ideal format to bring le Carr s novels to life This miniseries is tightly paced suspenseful and boasts strong performances from the likes of Hiddleston Laurie Colman and Hollander With any luck this series will open the doors for more of le Carr s classic spy tales to make their way to the small screen br The New Yorker reviewer Emily Nussbaum was unimpressed calling the miniseries elegant but ultimately empty with overwrought sequences of doomed love just an old recipe made with artisanal ingredients She praised the actors but found the characterisation of Roper less Dr No and more Mr Magoo However Brian Tallerico called it a brilliant adaptation on RogerEbert com with praise for the performances of Hiddleston and Laurie and for Susanne Bier s direction Bier brings a cinematic language to The Night Manager and a deeper understanding of character than we often get in projects that hinge on espionage She understands that it s not about the twists and turns of the spy game but the impact it has on those who are playing it br br br Accolades br br br Notes br br br br br br
