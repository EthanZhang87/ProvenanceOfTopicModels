talked about music first and then James had mentioned that he might want me to play one of the entities in this After reading the script it turned out it was Bathsheba said Bishara Because of his

Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter said With its minimal use of digital effects its strong sympathetic performances and ace design work the pic harks back in themes and methods to The Exorcist and The Amityville Horror not quite attaining the poignancy and depth of the former but far exceeding the latter in sheer cinematic beauty Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review calling
