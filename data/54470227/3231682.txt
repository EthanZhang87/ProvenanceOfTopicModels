Production br br br Development br On December Creature Corner com reported that Michael Bay s newly created company Platinum Dunes which was created in order to produce low budget films had set its focus on remaking The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Early announcements on the site indicated that the story would be told in flashback with actress Marilyn Burns who starred in the original film reprising her role as an aged Sally Hardesty recounting the events in the film It was later announced that the filmmakers had already purchased the rights to the original film br Early in the film s production the original filmmakers Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel would be writing a script for the film but it was unknown at the time whether or not their script would be used In June it was announced that Marcus Nispel would direct the film in his directorial debut Nispel said that he was initially against the idea of remaking the film calling it blasphemy to his longtime director of photography Daniel Pearl who had shot the original film Pearl however encouraged Nispel to join the project as he wanted to bookend his career with Chainsaw films br It was later announced that Scott Kosar signed on as the film s screenwriter br As in the original version it is loosely inspired by the real life crimes of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein Gein s crimes had also inspired novels such as Psycho and The Silence of the Lambs both of which were later adapted into subsequent films br br br Writing br The screenplay was written by Scott Kosar who went on to write the screenplays for The Machinist and Platinum Dunes remake of The Amityville Horror br The film was Kosar s first professional job as a screenwriter and later recalled feeling both thrilled and honored at the prospect of writing the screenplay for the remake Kosar also realized early on that he was dealing with one of the seminal works of the genre and one that could not be bettered When discussing with the film s producers Kosar felt that the new film shouldn t try to compete with the original film as he felt that it was made under different circumstances br In earlier drafts Erin the film s main character was revealed to be nine months pregnant throughout the film but was removed from later drafts at producer Michael Bay s insistence br br br Casting br Jessica Biel who previously starred in the television series th Heaven was cast as the main character Erin br Actor Andrew Bryniarski who starred in Bay s Pearl Harbor and stayed friends with him afterwards personally met with producer Bay and asked him for the role of Leatherface Another actor named Brett Wagner was cast for the role before Bryniarski but on the first day the actor was hospitalized and fired for lying about his physical abilities Without an actor for the film s main antagonist the filmmakers called and asked if Bryniarski still wanted the role which he accepted To prepare for the role Bryniarski ate a diet of brisket and white bread in order to get his weight to nearly pounds Bryniarski would later reprise his role as Leatherface in the film s prequel br br br Filming br Nispel favored shooting the film in California but Bay suggested Texas where he had previously shot three times Principal photography began in Austin in July and lasted days Nispel intentionally shot the film in a different style using more traditionally narrative elements as he did not want to make a shot for shot remake replicating the original film s documentary like style Cinematographer Pearl explained from an on set interview People ask me Is it going to be as gritty and grainy as the last one I did No I did that There s no point in making the exact same film with the exact same look br The remake includes references to the previous film including John Larroquette who returns in his role as the film s narrator br The weather during filming was very hot and humid Bryniarski who portrays Leatherface in the film did all his own stunts and was forced to wear a fat suit which increased his near lbs to lbs The suit also heated up quickly so the actor had to ensure that he drank a lot of fluids before a shoot Leatherface s mask was also a problem the mask was made out of silicone and was difficult for the actor to breathe through The crew had many prop chainsaws for actor Bryniarski to use such as chainsaws that put out smoke and live chainsaws br br br Release and reception br br br Box office br br The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was released in North America on October in theaters It grossed on its opening day and concluded

original Metacritic another review aggregator calculates an average score of indicating generally unfavorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times praised the polish of Pearl s cinematography in contrast to his grittier work in the original though noted The remake moves faster and sounds louder but comes off as callous rather than creepy Robert K Elder of the Chicago Tribune gave it three out of four stars and called it an effectively scary slasher film despite its absurd premise William Thomas of Empire rated it three stars out of five and wrote You ll have to overcome resentment towards this unnecessary remake before you can be properly terrorised but on its own terms it plays well Roger Ebert gave the film a rare zero stars out of four calling it A contemptible film Vile ugly and brutal There is not a shred of reason to see it Those who defend it will have to dance through mental hoops of their own devising defining its meanness and despair as style or vision or a commentary on our world Variety gave the film an unfavorable review writing that the film was an initially promising but quickly disappointing retread of a hugely influential horror classic br Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded the film two stars out of four writing Director Marcus Nispel acclaimed for his ads and music videos has a sharp eye and the good sense to hire Daniel Pearl who shot the first Chainsaw But all the bad rehash mojo from Friday the th to The Blair Witch Project has infected Scott Kosar s script Hooper went for primitive Nispel goes for slick Hooper went easy on the gore Nispel pours it on and called the film soulless Dave Kehr from The New York Times gave the film an unfavorable review noting Rather than exhilaration this bilious film offers only entrapment and despair further commenting that the film was about as much fun as sitting in on an autopsy Leonard Maltin awarded the film stars out of four complimenting the film s intensity but criticized the lack of likable characters and the lack of humor which was present in the original stating Once it kicks into gear it s brutally unrelenting toward its unappealing characters and the audience br On SBS The Movie Show Australian critic Margaret Pomeranz said this was the first film she has walked out of giving it half an hour and declined it a rating while fellow host David Statton rated it one star I was in a cinema and there was about single men sitting around and I just thought I don t have to see this she says So yes I did walk out I choose to embrace movies but there is a lot of average movies out there You just have to try and look at the good things in them Certain genres are not to my taste prison dramas man s cruelty to other men or women I used to embrace violence in cinema in a lot of ways but I m reacting against that br The BBC s Jamie Russell gave the film some praise referring to it as a gory stylish and occasionally scary push button factory of shocks and shrieks remarkably better than anyone had the right to expect but goes on to lament if the filmmakers could churn out something this decent why didn t they shoot an original script or even a sequel to Hooper s classic instead of a remake The Guardian s Peter Bradshaw awarded the film two stars out of five referring to it as a bullish revival of the original adding The movie finds tastily grotesque Diane Arbus locals to freak out our poor heroes and heroines Everything is as unsubtle as you like and let s face it unsubtlety is the order of the day br br br Legacy br Due to the film s financial success it influenced a plethora of horror movie franchises to remake their original films across the span
