title: Silent film
id: 26956
A silent film is a film without synchronized recorded sound or more generally no audible dialogue Though silent films convey narrative and emotion visually various plot elements such as a setting or era or key lines of dialogue may when necessary be conveyed by the use of inter title cards br The term silent film is something of a misnomer as these films were almost always accompanied by live sounds During the silent era that existed from the mid s to the late s a pianist theater organist or even in larger cities an orchestra would play music to accompany the films Pianists and organists would play either from sheet music or improvisation Sometimes a person would even narrate the inter title cards for the audience Though at the time the technology to synchronize sound with the film did not exist music was seen as an essential part of the viewing experience Silent film is typically used as a historical term to describe an era of cinema prior to the invention of synchronized sound but it also applies to such sound era films as City Lights Modern Times and Silent Movie which are accompanied by a music only soundtrack in place of dialogue br The term silent film is a retronym a term created to retroactively distinguish something from later developments Early sound films starting with The Jazz Singer in were variously referred to as the talkies sound films or talking pictures The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is older than film it was suggested almost immediately after Edison introduced the phonograph in and some early experiments had the projectionist manually adjusting the frame rate to fit the sound but because of the technical challenges involved the introduction of synchronized dialogue became practical only in the late s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the advent of the Vitaphone system Within a decade the widespread production of silent films for popular entertainment had ceased and the industry had moved fully into the sound era in which movies were accompanied by synchronized sound recordings of spoken dialogue music and sound effects br Most early motion pictures are considered lost owing to their physical decay for the nitrate filmstock used in that era was extremely unstable and flammable Additionally many films were deliberately destroyed because they had negligible remaining immediate financial value in that era It has often been claimed that around percent of silent films produced in the US have been lost though these estimates are inaccurate due to a lack of numerical data br br br Elements and beginnings br br Film projection mostly evolved from magic lantern shows in which images from handpainted glass slides were projected onto a wall or screen After the advent of photography in the th century still photographs were sometimes used Narration of the showman was important in spectacular entertainment screenings and vital in the lecturing circuit br The principle of stroboscopic animation was well known since the introduction of the phenakistiscope in a popular optical toy but the development of cinematography was hampered by long exposure times for photographic emulsions until Eadweard Muybridge managed to record a chronophotographic sequence in After others had animated his pictures in zoetropes Muybridge started lecturing with his own zoopraxiscope animation projector in br The work of other pioneering chronophotographers including tienne Jules Marey and Ottomar Ansch tz furthered the development of motion picture cameras projectors and transparent celluloid film br Although Thomas Edison was keen to develop a film system that would be synchronised with his phonograph he eventually introduced the kinetoscope as a silent motion picture viewer in and later kinetophone versions remained unsuccessful br br br Silent film era br br The art of motion pictures grew into full maturity in the silent era in film in film The height of the silent era from the early s in film to the late s was a particularly fruitful period full of artistic innovation The film movements of Classical Hollywood as well as French Impressionism German Expressionism and Soviet Montage began in this period Silent filmmakers pioneered the art form to the extent that virtually every style and genre of film making of the th and st centuries has its artistic roots in the silent era The silent era was also a pioneering one from a technical point of view Three point lighting the close up long shot panning and continuity editing all became prevalent long before silent films were replaced by talking pictures or talkies in the late s Some scholars claim that the artistic quality of cinema decreased for several years during the early s until film directors actors and production staff adapted fully to the new talkies around the mid s br br The visual quality of silent movies especially those produced in the s was often high but there remains a widely held misconception that these films were primitive or are barely watchable by modern standards This misconception comes from the general public s unfamiliarity with the medium as well as from carelessness on the part of the industry Most silent films are poorly preserved leading to their deterioration and well preserved films are often played back at the wrong speed or suffer from censorship cuts and missing frames and scenes giving the appearance of poor editing Many silent films exist only in second or third generation copies often made from already damaged and neglected film stock Another widely held misconception is that silent films lacked color In fact color was far more prevalent in silent films than in the first few decades of sound films By the early s percent of movies could be seen in some sort of color usually in the form of film tinting or toning or even hand coloring but also with fairly natural two color processes such as Kinemacolor and Technicolor Traditional colorization processes ceased with the adoption of sound on film technology Traditional film colorization all of which involved the use of dyes in some form interfered with the high resolution required for built in recorded sound and were therefore abandoned The innovative three strip technicolor process introduced in the mid s was costly and fraught with limitations and color would not have the same prevalence in film as it did in the silents for nearly four decades br br br Inter titles br br As motion pictures gradually increased in running time a replacement was needed for the in house interpreter who would explain parts of the film to the audience Because silent films had no synchronized sound for dialogue onscreen inter titles were used to narrate story points present key dialogue and sometimes even comment on the action for the audience The title writer became a key professional in silent film and was often separate from the scenario writer who created the story Inter titles or titles as they were generally called at the time often were graphic elements themselves featuring illustrations or abstract decorations that commented on the action br br br Live music and other sound accompaniment br Showings of silent films almost always featured live music starting with the first public projection of movies by the Lumi re brothers on December in Paris This was furthered in by the first motion picture exhibition in the United States at Koster and Bial s Music Hall in New York City At this event Edison set the precedent that all exhibitions should be accompanied by an orchestra From the beginning music was recognized as essential contributing atmosphere and giving the audience vital emotional cues Musicians sometimes played on film sets during shooting for similar reasons However depending on the size of the exhibition site musical accompaniment could drastically change in scale Small town and neighborhood movie theatres usually had a pianist Beginning in the mid s large city theaters tended to have organists or ensembles of musicians Massive theatre organs which were designed to fill a gap between a simple piano soloist and a larger orchestra had a wide range of special effects Theatrical organs such as the famous Mighty Wurlitzer could simulate some orchestral sounds along with a number of percussion effects such as bass drums and cymbals and sound effects ranging from train and boat whistles to car horns and bird whistles some could even simulate pistol shots ringing phones the sound of surf horses hooves smashing pottery and thunder and rain br Musical scores for early silent films were either improvised or compiled of classical or theatrical repertory music Once full features became commonplace however music was compiled from photoplay music by the pianist organist orchestra conductor or the movie studio itself which included a cue sheet with the film These sheets were often lengthy with detailed notes about effects and moods to watch for Starting with the mostly original score composed by Joseph Carl Breil for D W Griffith s epic The Birth of a Nation it became relatively common for the biggest budgeted films to arrive at the exhibiting theater with original specially composed scores However the first designated full blown scores had in fact been composed in by Camille Saint Sa ns for The Assassination of the Duke of Guise and by Mikhail Ippolitov Ivanov for Stenka Razin br When organists or pianists used sheet music they still might add improvisational flourishes to heighten the drama on screen Even when special effects were not indicated in the score if an organist was playing a theater organ capable of an unusual sound effect such as galloping horses it would be used during scenes of dramatic horseback chases br At the height of the silent era movies were the single largest source of employment for instrumental musicians at least in the United States However the introduction of talkies coupled with the roughly simultaneous onset of the Great Depression was devastating to many musicians br A number of countries devised other ways of bringing sound to silent films The early cinema of Brazil for example featured fitas cantatas singing films filmed operettas with singers performing behind the screen In Japan films had not only live music but also the benshi a live narrator who provided commentary and character voices The benshi became a central element in Japanese film as well as providing translation for foreign mostly American movies The popularity of the benshi was one reason why silent films persisted well into the s in Japan Conversely as benshi narrated films often lacked intertitles modern day audiences may sometimes find it difficult to follow the plots without specialised subtitling or additional commentary br br br Score restorations from to the present br Few film scores survived intact from the silent period and musicologists are still confronted by questions when they attempt to precisely reconstruct those that remain Scores used in current reissues or screenings of silent films may be complete reconstructions of compositions newly composed for the occasion assembled from already existing music libraries or improvised on the spot in the manner of the silent era theater musician br Interest in the scoring of silent films fell somewhat out of fashion during the s and s There was a belief in many college film programs and repertory cinemas that audiences should experience silent film as a pure visual medium undistracted by music This belief may have been encouraged by the poor quality of the music tracks found on many silent film reprints of the time Since around there has been a revival of interest in presenting silent films with quality musical scores either reworkings of period scores or cue sheets or the composition of appropriate original scores An early effort of this kind was Kevin Brownlow s restoration of Abel Gance s Napol on featuring a score by Carl Davis A slightly re edited and sped up version of Brownlow s restoration was later distributed in the United States by Francis Ford Coppola with a live orchestral score composed by his father Carmine Coppola br In an edited restoration of Metropolis was released with a new rock music score by producer composer Giorgio Moroder Although the contemporary score which included pop songs by Freddie Mercury Pat Benatar and Jon Anderson of Yes was controversial the door had been opened for a new approach to the presentation of classic silent films br Today a large number of soloists music ensembles and orchestras perform traditional and contemporary scores for silent films internationally The legendary theater organist Gaylord Carter continued to perform and record his original silent film scores until shortly before his death in some of those scores are available on DVD reissues Other purveyors of the traditional approach include organists such as Dennis James and pianists such as Neil Brand G nter Buchwald Philip C Carli Ben Model and William P Perry Other contemporary pianists such as Stephen Horne and Gabriel Thibaudeau have often taken a more modern approach to scoring br Orchestral conductors such as Carl Davis and Robert Israel have written and compiled scores for numerous silent films many of these have been featured in showings on Turner Classic Movies or have been released on DVD Davis has composed new scores for classic silent dramas such as The Big Parade and Flesh and the Devil Israel has worked mainly in silent comedy scoring the films of Harold Lloyd Buster Keaton Charley Chase and others Timothy Brock has restored many of Charlie Chaplin s scores in addition to composing new scores br Contemporary music ensembles are helping to introduce classic silent films to a wider audience through a broad range of musical styles and approaches Some performers create new compositions using traditional musical instruments while others add electronic sounds modern harmonies rhythms improvisation and sound design elements to enhance the viewing experience Among the contemporary ensembles in this category are Un Drame Musical Instantan Alloy Orchestra Club Foot Orchestra Silent Orchestra Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra Minima and the Caspervek Trio RPM Orchestra Donald Sosin and his wife Joanna Seaton specialize in adding vocals to silent films particularly where there is onscreen singing that benefits from hearing the actual song being performed Films in this category include Griffith s Lady of the Pavements with Lupe V lez Edwin Carewe s Evangeline with Dolores del R o and Rupert Julian s The Phantom of the Opera with Mary Philbin and Virginia Pearson br The Silent Film Sound and Music Archive digitizes music and cue sheets written for silent films and makes them available for use by performers scholars and enthusiasts br br br Acting techniques br br Silent film actors emphasized body language and facial expression so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern day audiences as simplistic or campy The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience Vaudeville was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors The pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director Marshall Neilan in The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out the better for the pictures In other cases directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger than life expressions for emphasis As early as American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen br br Silent films became less vaudevillian in the mid s as the differences between stage and screen became apparent Due to the work of directors such as D W Griffith cinematography became less stage like and the development of the close up allowed for understated and realistic acting Lillian Gish has been called film s first true actress for her work in the period as she pioneered new film performing techniques recognizing the crucial differences between stage and screen acting Directors such as Albert Capellani and Maurice Tourneur began to insist on naturalism in their films By the mid s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic low key acting straight away as late as films featuring expressionistic acting styles such as Metropolis were still being released Greta Garbo whose first American film was released in would become known for her naturalistic acting br According to Anton Kaes a silent film scholar from the University of California Berkeley American silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between and influenced by techniques found in German silent film This is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the Weimar Republic including film directors producers cameramen lighting and stage technicians as well as actors and actresses br br br Projection speed br Until the standardization of the projection speed of frames per second fps for sound films between and silent films were shot at variable speeds or frame rates anywhere from to fps depending on the year and studio Standard silent film speed is often said to be fps as a result of the Lumi re brothers Cin matographe but industry practice varied considerably there was no actual standard William Kennedy Laury Dickson an Edison employee settled on the astonishingly fast frames per second Additionally cameramen of the era insisted that their cranking technique was exactly fps but modern examination of the films shows this to be in error and that they often cranked faster Unless carefully shown at their intended speeds silent films can appear unnaturally fast or slow However some scenes were intentionally undercranked during shooting to accelerate the action particularly for comedies and action films br br Slow projection of a cellulose nitrate base film carried a risk of fire as each frame was exposed for a longer time to the intense heat of the projection lamp but there were other reasons to project a film at a greater pace Often projectionists received general instructions from the distributors on the musical director s cue sheet as to how fast particular reels or scenes should be projected In rare instances usually for larger productions cue sheets produced specifically for the projectionist provided a detailed guide to presenting the film Theaters also to maximize profit sometimes varied projection speeds depending on the time of day or popularity of a film or to fit a film into a prescribed time slot br All motion picture film projectors require a moving shutter to block the light whilst the film is moving otherwise the image is smeared in the direction of the movement However this shutter causes the image to flicker and images with low rates of flicker are very unpleasant to watch Early studies by Thomas Edison for his Kinetoscope machine determined that any rate below images per second will strain the eye and this holds true for projected images under normal cinema conditions also The solution adopted for the Kinetoscope was to run the film at over frames sec but this was expensive for film However by using projectors with dual and triple blade shutters the flicker rate is multiplied two or three times higher than the number of film frames each frame being flashed two or three times on screen A three blade shutter projecting a fps film will slightly surpass Edison s figure giving the audience images per second During the silent era projectors were commonly fitted with bladed shutters Since the introduction of sound with its frame sec standard speed bladed shutters have become the norm for mm cinema projectors though three bladed shutters have remained standard on mm and mm projectors which are frequently used to project amateur footage shot at or frames sec A mm film frame rate of fps translates to a film speed of millimetres in per second One foot m reel requires minutes and seconds to be projected at fps while a fps projection of the same reel would take minutes and seconds or millimetres in per second br In the s many telecine conversions of silent films at grossly incorrect frame rates for broadcast television may have alienated viewers Film speed is often a vexed issue among scholars and film buffs in the presentation of silents today especially when it comes to DVD releases of restored films such as the case of the restoration of Metropolis br br br Tinting br br With the lack of natural color processing available films of the silent era were frequently dipped in dyestuffs and dyed various shades and hues to signal a mood or represent a time of day Hand tinting dates back to in the United States with Edison s release of selected hand tinted prints of Butterfly Dance Additionally experiments in color film started as early as in although it took a much longer time for color to be adopted by the industry and an effective process to be developed Blue represented night scenes yellow or amber meant day Red represented fire and green represented a mysterious atmosphere Similarly toning of film such as the common silent film generalization of sepia toning with special solutions replaced the silver particles in the film stock with salts or dyes of various colors A combination of tinting and toning could be used as an effect that could be striking br Some films were hand tinted such as Annabelle Serpentine Dance from Edison Studios In it Annabelle Whitford a young dancer from Broadway is dressed in white veils that appear to change colors as she dances This technique was designed to capture the effect of the live performances of Loie Fuller beginning in in which stage lights with colored gels turned her white flowing dresses and sleeves into artistic movement Hand coloring was often used in the early trick and fantasy films of Europe especially those by Georges M li s M li s began hand tinting his work as early as and the Cendrillion Cinderella and Jeanne d Arc Joan of Arc provide early examples of hand tinted films in which the color was a critical part of the scenography or mise en sc ne such precise tinting used the workshop of Elisabeth Thuillier in Paris with teams of female artists adding layers of color to each frame by hand rather than using a more common and less expensive process of stenciling A newly restored version of M li s A Trip to the Moon originally released in shows an exuberant use of color designed to add texture and interest to the image br Comments by an American distributor in a film supply catalog further underscore France s continuing dominance in the field of hand coloring films during the early silent era The distributor offers for sale at varying prices High Class motion pictures by Path Urban Eclipse Gaumont Kalem Itala Film Ambrosio Film and Selig Several of the longer more prestigious films in the catalog are offered in both standard black and white plain stock as well as in hand painted color A plain stock copy for example of the release Ben Hur is offered for USD today while a colored version of the same foot minute film costs including the extra coloring charge which amounted to cents more per foot Although the reasons for the cited extra charge were likely obvious to customers the distributor explains why his catalog s colored films command such significantly higher prices and require more time for delivery His explanation also provides insight into the general state of film coloring services in the United States by br br The coloring of moving picture films is a line of work which cannot be satisfactorily performed in the United States In view of the enormous amount of labor involved which calls for individual hand painting of every one of sixteen pictures to the foot or separate pictures for each feet of film very few American colorists will undertake the work at any price As film coloring has progressed much more rapidly in France than in any other country all of our coloring is done for us by the best coloring establishment in Paris and we have found that we obtain better quality cheaper prices and quicker deliveries even in coloring American made films than if the work were done elsewhere br By the beginning of the s with the onset of feature length films tinting was used as another mood setter just as commonplace as music The director D W Griffith displayed a constant interest and concern about color and used tinting as a special effect in many of his films His epic The Birth of a Nation used a number of colors including amber blue lavender and a striking red tint for scenes such as the burning of Atlanta and the ride of the Ku Klux Klan at the climax of the picture Griffith later invented a color system in which colored lights flashed on areas of the screen to achieve a color br With the development of sound on film technology and the industry s acceptance of it tinting was abandoned altogether because the dyes used in the tinting process interfered with the soundtracks present on film strips br br br Early studios br The early studios were located in the New York City area Edison Studios were first in West Orange New Jersey they were moved to the Bronx New York Fox and Biograph started in Manhattan with studios in St George Staten Island Other films were shot in Fort Lee New Jersey In December Edison led the formation of the Motion Picture Patents Company in an attempt to control the industry and shut out smaller producers The Edison Trust as it was nicknamed was made up of Edison Biograph Essanay Studios Kalem Company George Kleine Productions Lubin Studios Georges M li s Path Selig Studios and Vitagraph Studios and dominated distribution through the General Film Company This company dominated the industry as both a vertical and horizontal monopoly and is a contributing factor in studios migration to the West Coast The Motion Picture Patents Co and the General Film Co were found guilty of antitrust violation in October and were dissolved br The Thanhouser film studio was founded in New Rochelle New York in by American theatrical impresario Edwin Thanhouser The company produced and released films between and including the first film serial The Million Dollar Mystery released in The first westerns were filmed at Fred Scott s Movie Ranch in South Beach Staten Island Actors costumed as cowboys and Native Americans galloped across Scott s movie ranch set which had a frontier main street a wide selection of stagecoaches and a foot stockade The island provided a serviceable stand in for locations as varied as the Sahara desert and a British cricket pitch War scenes were shot on the plains of Grasmere Staten Island The Perils of Pauline and its even more popular sequel The Exploits of Elaine were filmed largely on the island So was the blockbuster Life of a Cowboy by Edwin S Porter Company and filming moved to the West Coast around br br br Top

distributor s share of the box office as opposed to exhibition gross br br br During the sound era br br br Transition br Although attempts to create sync sound motion pictures go back to the Edison lab in only from the early s were the basic technologies such as vacuum tube amplifiers and high quality loudspeakers available The next few years saw a race to design implement and market several rival sound on disc and sound on film sound formats such as Photokinema Phonofilm Vitaphone Fox Movietone and RCA Photophone br Warner Bros was the first studio to accept sound as an element in film production and utilize the Vitaphone a sound on disc technology to do so The studio then released The Jazz Singer in which marked the first commercially successful sound film but silent films were still the majority of features released in both and along with so called goat glanded films silents with a subsection of sound film inserted Thus the modern sound film era may be regarded as coming to dominance beginning in br For a listing of notable silent era films see List of years in film for the years between the beginning of film and The following list includes only films produced in the

of control br br br Preservation and lost films br br The vast majority of the silent films produced in the late th and early th centuries are considered lost According to a September report published by the United States Library of Congress some percent of American silent feature films fall into this category There are numerous reasons for this number being so high Some films have been lost unintentionally but most silent films were destroyed on purpose Between the end of the silent era and the rise of home video film studios would often discard large numbers of silent films out of a desire to free up storage in their archives assuming that they had lost the cultural relevance and economic value to justify the amount of space they occupied Additionally due to the fragile nature of the nitrate film stock which was used to shoot and distribute silent films many motion pictures have irretrievably deteriorated or have been lost in accidents including fires because nitrate is highly flammable and can spontaneously combust when stored improperly Examples of such incidents include the MGM vault fire and the Fox vault fire both of which caused catastrophic losses of films Many such films not completely destroyed survive only partially or in badly damaged prints Some lost films such as London After Midnight lost in the MGM fire have been the subject of considerable interest by film collectors and historians br Major silent films presumed lost include br br The Fairylogue and Radio Plays br Saved from the Titanic which featured survivors of the disaster br The Life of General Villa starring Pancho Villa himself br The Apostle the first animated feature film br Cleopatra br Kiss Me Again br Arirang br The Great Gatsby br London After Midnight br The Patriot the only lost Best Picture nominee only the trailer survives br Gentlemen Prefer Blondes br Though most lost silent films will never be recovered some have been discovered in film archives or private collections Discovered and preserved versions may be editions made for the home rental market of the s and s that are discovered in estate sales etc The degradation of old film stock can be slowed through proper archiving and films can be transferred to safety film stock or to digital media for preservation The preservation of silent films has been a high priority for historians and archivists br br br Dawson Film Find br br Dawson City in the Yukon territory of Canada was once the end of the distribution line for many films In a cache of more than reels of nitrate film was discovered during the excavation of a vacant lot formerly the site of the Dawson Amateur Athletic Association which had started showing films at its recreation center in Works by Pearl White Helen Holmes Grace Cunard Lois Weber Harold Lloyd Douglas Fairbanks and Lon Chaney among others were included as well as many newsreels The titles were stored at the local library until when the flammable nitrate was used as landfill in a condemned swimming pool Having spent years under the permafrost of the Yukon the reels turned out to be extremely well preserved Owing to its dangerous chemical volatility the historical find was moved by military transport to Library and Archives Canada and the US Library of Congress for storage and transfer to safety film A documentary about the find Dawson City Frozen
