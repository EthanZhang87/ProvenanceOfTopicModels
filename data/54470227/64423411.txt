meaningful story about pandemic lockdown At Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating generally unfavorable reviews br Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote It s not inherently misguided to use a current tragedy as the jumping off point of a genre movie but any filmmaker who decides to do so had better create something provocative or interesting or at least competent to justify it Writing for IndieWire David Ehrlich gave the film a D and said For all of its gimmicky appeal Songbird is bad enough that your entire neighborhood will be able to smell it streaming onto your TV and it gets worse faster than your nose can adjust to the stench Korey Coleman of Double Toasted found Peter Stormare s performance humorous but criticized the overall message of the film calling it irresponsible and noted the numerous plot holes imbued by the love story which overtook the entire premise br Rebecca Onion of Slate wrote Songbird isn t very good which you might expect for something thrown together so quickly But watching it in the midst of our slow motion disaster it looks not just bad but ridiculous Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert com gave the film stars and wrote The truth is that even if one sets aside all potential moral arguments about the very existence of Songbird it s still just really bad Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote Despite the high stakes drama there s nary a compelling moment throughout and some of the characterizations are so absurdly one note that it s hard not to think that the film is meant as parody br Kevin Maher of The Times was more positive in his review of the film giving four out of five stars and writing It s patchy admittedly in places but it s also audacious and the first mainstream film to address unapologetically in every scene in every frame of film our present situation Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars saying that it was an acceptably watchable thriller that s more notable for what it achieves technically than anything else Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph also gave the film three out of five stars saying that it was even more spectacularly crass and exploitative than you could have possibly hoped and concluded Songbird itself delivers an enjoyably tactless jolt of trash cinema bravado br br br br br br External links br
