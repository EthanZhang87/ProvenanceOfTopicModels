Charlize Theron Based on Andrew Neiderman s novel of the same name it is about a gifted young Florida lawyer invited to work for a major New York City law firm As his wife becomes haunted by frightening visions the lawyer slowly realizes the firm s owner John Milton is in fact the Devil br The name John Milton is one of several allusions to Paradise Lost as well as Dante Alighieri s Inferno and the legend of Faust An adaptation of Neiderman s novel went into a development hell during the s with Hackford gaining control of the production Filming took place around New York City and Florida br The Devil s Advocate received mixed reviews with critics crediting it for entertainment value and Pacino s performance It grossed million at the box office and won the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film It also became the subject of the copyright lawsuit Hart v Warner Bros Inc for its visual art br br Kevin Lomax is a Gainesville Florida defense attorney who has never lost a case While defending schoolteacher Lloyd Gettys against a charge of child molestation he realizes his client is guilty Nonetheless Kevin proceeds with his defense destroying the victim s credibility through a harsh cross examination and securing an acquital for Gettys br A New York City law firm asks Kevin to assist a jury selection After the jury delivers a not guilty verdict the head of the firm John Milton offers Kevin a job which Kevin accepts He and his wife Mary Ann move to Manhattan Kevin is soon working long hours neglecting Mary Ann Kevin s fundamentalist mother Alice who never had sex except to conceive Kevin urges the couple to move back to Florida after meeting Milton Kevin refuses br Kevin is assigned to represent billionaire Alex Cullen accused of murdering his wife his stepson and a maid As a result Kevin sees even less of Mary Ann and begins to fantasize about his co worker Christabella Meanwhile Mary Ann has visions of the partners wives becoming demonic and has a nightmare about a baby playing with her removed ovaries After a doctor declares her infertile she begs Kevin to return them to Gainesville but he refuses Milton suggests Kevin step down from the trial to care for Mary Ann but Kevin says he will resent her for costing him the case br Eddie Barzoon the firm s managing partner discovers Kevin s name on the firm s charter and believes Kevin covets his job Eddie threatens to inform the United States Attorney s office of the firm s dubious activities Kevin tells Milton Though Milton seems to dismiss Kevin s concerns Eddie is beaten to death in Central Park br Preparing Melissa Black Alex Cullen s secretary to testify Kevin realizes she is lying to give Cullen a false alibi He tells Milton he thinks Alex is guilty but Milton offers to back him regardless Kevin proceeds winning an acquittal with Melissa s perjured testimony Afterwards Kevin finds Mary Ann covered with a blanket in a nearby church She claims Milton raped her that day and shows Kevin her body covered with cuts and scratches Knowing Milton was in court with him Kevin believes she must have injured herself and commits her to a mental institution br U S Justice Department agent Mitch Weaver warns Kevin that Milton is corrupt and also reveals that Gettys whom Kevin got acquitted in Florida has now been arrested for killing a little girl Moments later Weaver is struck by a car and killed At the same time while attending Eddie s funeral service Milton sticks his finger into holy water which makes it boil br Kevin his mother Alice and his case manager Pam Garrety visit

admits to raping Mary Ann Kevin shoots Milton but the bullets do not harm him Milton reveals himself as Satan Kevin blames Milton for everything that happened but Milton points out that he merely set the stage It was Kevin who chose to neglect his wife and defend people he knew were guilty Kevin realizes he always wanted to win no matter the cost Christabella appears and Milton announces that he wants Kevin and Christabella Kevin s half sister to conceive the Antichrist Kevin initially appears to acquiesce but then abruptly shoots himself in the head Milton s demonic rage burns Christabella alive revealing his demonic form before turning into a winged angel who resembles Kevin br Suddenly Kevin finds himself back at the Gainesville courthouse during the recess of the Gettys trial The entire experience was a vision of the future Kevin returns to the courtroom and sees Mary Ann alive and well Once the trial resumes Kevin announces that he cannot represent his client despite the risk of disbarment Kevin s reporter friend Larry offers him a high profile interview promising to make him famous Encouraged by Mary Ann Kevin agrees After they leave Larry transforms into Milton who breaks the fourth wall and declares Vanity definitely my favorite sin br br The Devil character s name is a direct homage to John Milton who wrote Paradise Lost quoted by Lomax with the line Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heav n Despite this the thrust of Milton s epic was to rebuke the devil As a rebel against God complaining of being perpetually underestimated the Milton character like Paradise Lost s Satan is Heav n running from Heav n with a sense of injur d merit br Professor Eric C Brown judges the climax in which Milton attempts to persuade Lomax to have sex with his half sister to conceive the Antichrist to be the most Miltonic as the sculptures become animated in carnal activities evoking Paradise Lost s Downfall of the Rebel Angels The tirade Milton gives in this sequence is at times also reminiscent of Satan s lines in Paradise Lost Books I and II In U S literary education Milton s temptation of Lomax in the climax in which he rationalizes rebellion against God for a Look but don t touch model has been compared to Satan urging Eve to eat forbidden fruit in Paradise Lost Book IX lines br br If they all things who enclos d Knowledge of good and evil in this tree That whoso eats thereof forthwith attains Wisdom without their leave and wherein lies Th offence that Man should thus attain to know br In his DVD commentary Taylor Hackford did not name Paradise Lost as an inspiration instead citing the legend of Faust An underlying concept of the story is a Faustian bargain offered to a character with free will Philosopher Peter van Inwagen writes Milton referring to free will as a bitch when Lomax contemplates selling his soul moves away from a legalistic definition of free will as uncoerced into the philosophical realm of its definition br As with Goethe s Faust the Devil commonly depicted in cinema is associated with lust and temptation Milton shows Lomax many seductive women in order to induce his fall Sex or rape is usually also the means by which Satan creates the Antichrist as in Roman Polanski s film Rosemary s Baby In The Devil s Advocate someone other than Satan will have sex to conceive the Antichrist though Milton nevertheless brutally rapes Mary Ann Incest becomes a way of creating the Antichrist since the offspring of Satan s son and daughter will inherit much of Satan s genetic makeup br Dante Alighieri s Inferno raised visual potential that informed the film Dantean scholar Amilcare A Iannucci argues the plot follows the Divine Comedy model in beginning with selva oscura in Lomax losing his conscience defending a guilty man and then entering and exploring deeper circles of Hell Iannucci compares the office building structure to the circles listing fireplaces where flames are always present demonic visual phenomena and water outside Milton s office analogized to Dante s Satan s icy home albeit situated at the top of Hell as opposed to the bottom Free will is also a major theme in the Divine Comedy with the film s musings on the concept being similar to Dante s Purgatorio if the present world has gone astray in you is the cause in you it s to be sought br Other religious references are present In describing New York City as Babylon Alice Lomax invokes Revelation br br Babylon the great is fallen is fallen and has become a dwelling place of demons a prison for every foul spirit and a cage for every unclean and hated bird br Milton tempting Lomax is possibly also inspired by the Biblical Temptation of Christ Aside from Milton other character names have been commented on Author Kelly J Wyman matches Mary Ann the virginal figure who falls victim to Milton to the Virgin Mary and adds the literal translation of Christabella is Beautiful Christ and that the title refers to the Catholic Church s Devil s advocates and lawyers as advocates Eric C Brown finds Barzoon s name and character to be reminiscent of the demon prince Beelzebub Scholars Miguel A De La Torre and Albert Hern ndez observe the vision of Satan as CEO wearing expensive clothing and engaging in business had appeared in popular culture before including the novel The Screwtape Letters br br Andrew Neiderman wrote The Devil s Advocate as a novel and it was published in by Simon and Schuster Believing his story could be adapted into a film Neiderman approached Warner Bros and claimed to have led his successful sale with the synopsis It s about a law firm in New York that represents only guilty people and never loses br Various screenplay adaptations of The Devil s Advocate had been pitched to U S cinema studios with Joel Schumacher planned to direct it with Brad Pitt as the young lawyer Schumacher planned a sequence in which Pitt would descend into the New York subway system which would be modeled on the circles of hell in Dante s Divine Comedy With no actor to play Satan this project collapsed br The O J Simpson murder trial and its controversial outcome gave new impetus to relaunching the project with a million budget Warner hired Taylor Hackford to direct the new attempt The director embraced the legal drama aspect theorizing The courtroom has become the gladiator arena of the late twentieth century Following the progress of a sensational trial is a spectator sport br Tony Gilroy led much of the rewrite with supervision by Hackford who envisioned it as a modern day morality play and Faustian tale As the screenplay developed free will became a theme in which Milton does not actually cause events Hackford wanted suggestions that Milton does not kill Barzoon as he defied his muggers or United States Attorney Weaver who arrogantly did not watch for vehicles before stepping onto the road br The screenwriters added the plot element that Lomax was Milton s son and that Milton could produce the Antichrist neither of which are in the novel Hackford cited the films Rosemary s Baby and The Omen as influences and both had explored the Antichrist mythology Another change from the novel was converting the book s lesbian client to the pedophile Lloyd Gettys avoiding undertones of homophobia In an early version of the screenplay the Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven quotation is given to Milton rather than Lomax br br Al Pacino had previously been offered the Devil role in attempts at adapting Neiderman s novel but before final rewrites rejected it on three occasions for the clich d nature of the character Pacino suggested Robert Redford and Sean Connery for the role Keanu Reeves chose to star in Devil s Advocate over Speed despite a promised million for the sequel to his hit Speed according to Reeves staff the actor was averse to performing in two consecutive action films after Chain Reaction On Devil s Advocate Reeves agreed to a pay cut worth millions of dollars so that the producers could meet Pacino s salary demands To prepare for the role Pacino watched the film The Devil and Daniel Webster and observed tips from Walter Huston as Mr Scratch He also read Dante s Inferno and Paradise Lost br Connie Nielsen a Danish actress was selected by Hackford for Christabella who speaks several languages with Hackford saying Nielsen already spoke multiple languages Craig T Nelson known for his television work was cast against type in a villainous role br br Principal photography began in New York in but struggled by November Delays were caused by the dismissals of the original cinematographer and assistant directors while an anonymous source claimed Pacino found Hackford to be conceited and loud An executive alleged Pacino was typically late to work though producer Arnold Kopelson said this was not the case Hackford later said Pacino was professional even though his status meant he did not need to be br Production designer Bruno Rubeo was tasked to create Milton s apartment aiming for a very loose and very sexy appearance so you can t really tell where it goes Hackford said on this set he encouraged Reeves and Pacino to feel the room and develop some improvisation Pacino came up with the idea of dancing to It Happened in Monterey by Frank Sinatra and Hackford immediately adopted the idea br When Lomax leaves to meet Milton he walks through th Street in New York which is abnormally devoid of people or vehicles It was shot at the actual th Street with the filmmakers having it emptied at a m on a Sunday The offices were shot at the Continental Club in Manhattan and the Continental Plaza though the water outside Milton s office was added later by computer effects In constructing the firm sets Hackford and Rubeo consulted one architect from Japan and one from Italy to craft an ultra modern look to display Milton s taste Donald Trump s penthouse in Trump Tower Fifth Avenue was lent to the production for Alexander Cullen s residence br A number of churches and courts hosted production The interior of New York City s Church of the Heavenly Rest was used for the scene where Theron s character says Milton raped her The outside of Central Presbyterian Church was photographed for Barzoon s funeral while Pacino was inside the Manhattan Church of the Most Holy Redeemer for the holy water sequence For court scenes New Jersey s Bergen County Court House was employed for production as were historic courthouses in New York br After the completion of the New York shoot in March production moved to Florida in July In Jacksonville Florida the interior of the Mrs Howard s business in Riverside and Avondale was used for New York scenes Its co owner Jim Howard remodeled the store and appeared as an extra The Gainesville church scenes were shot at an actual Gainesville church after Hackford persuaded the pastor and his members to participate and that his story was about combating Satan br Theron had to briefly leave the United States while filming because she was working illegally br br At the end of the film John Milton morphs into Lucifer as a fallen angel The crew created the effect by combining life masks depicting Reeves Pacino in and Pacino as he appeared in the film The Godfather The Godfather make up artist Dick Smith supplied the life mask he made in the s to Devil s Advocate artist Rick Baker Smith s former prot g Additionally Baker created images for demonic faces seen on real actresses and actors with hands also appearing to move underneath Tamara Tunie s skin a digital creation with the contributions of Richard Greenberg and Stephanie Powell br Shots of ballerinas moving in water were used as a basis for Milton s animated sculpture Special effects producer Edward L Williams said he filmed the people for the statue effect and that they were naked and placed in a tank next to a blue screen It took three months to film the people and then add the computer effects at a cost of million or of the overall budget for special effects br James Newton Howard a past collaborator with Hackford was tasked to write the score Hackford dubbed over Pacino s performance of It Happened in Monterey with Sinatra s voice Paint It Black by The Rolling Stones is also used for the film s conclusion br br During early stages of photography Warner aspired to a release in August The film eventually had its release on October on the same day as another horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer To promote the release Warner s website included the warning on hell s gate from Dante s Inferno Canto III Abandon every hope ye who enter here with credits presented as circles of hell The television advertising and poster were upfront as to Milton being Satan though this is not explicitly revealed in the film itself until its later acts br Around copies of the VHS and DVD were produced by February but their release into the home video market was delayed pending the Hart v Warner Bros Inc lawsuit The film afterwards went into regular airings on TNT and TBS A Blu ray edition was released in Region A in as an Unrated Director s Cut in which the art in the climax previously subject to the lawsuit is digitally redone br br On its opening weekend in October The Devil s Advocate earned million finishing second in the U S box office to I Know What You Did Last Summer which made million The Devil s Advocate was largely competing against thriller films aimed at youth in the Halloween season By December it grossed million It ended its run on February with a gross of million in North America and million elsewhere br br Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes assigned the film an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The site s critics consensus states Though it is ultimately somewhat undone by its own lofty ambitions The Devil s Advocate is a mostly effective blend of supernatural thrills and character exploration Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br Roger Ebert wrote The movie never fully engaged me my mind raced ahead of the plot and the John Grisham stuff clashed with the Exorcist stuff In The New York Times Janet Maslin complimented the gratifyingly light touch of using John Milton s name and special effects with gimmicks well tethered to reality David Denby wrote in New York that Devil s Advocate was preposterously entertaining and predicted it would get viewers debating Entertainment Weekly gave it a B with Owen Gleiberman declaring it at once silly overwrought and almost embarrassingly entertaining and crediting Pacino for his performance Gleiberman later declared that Pacino had won the magazine s yearly award for Best Overacting Variety s Todd McCarthy declared it fairly entertaining displaying a nearly operatic sense of absurdity and excess Dave Kehr of New York Daily News also preferred Pacino over Reeves assessing The Devil s Advocate as Faust moved to Manhattan though disappointed that a witty undercurrent becomes an exaggerated moralism Critic James Berardinelli wrote that it is a highly enjoyable motion picture that s part character study part supernatural thriller and part morality play br In The New York Times Magazine Michiko Kakutani objected to trivializing Satan reducing Paradise Lost s vision of the War in Heaven to an extended lawyer joke The Christian Science Monitor s David Sterritt found it an unsurprising cinematic re imagining of Faust with Satan a lawyer but he recognized its message of the need for personal responsibility albeit with more lascivious sex and shocking violence than a traditional Faust rendition br In Yahoo named The Devil s Advocate as Pacino s Most Underrated Film claiming Pacino s hammy devil never got his due but there s something to be said for an actor who can pull off this level of theatrics In his Movie Guide Leonard Maltin gave it three stars finding Reeves credible and Pacino delicious Scott Mendelson wrote in Forbes in that I love this trashy vulgar unapologetically puritan melodrama more than I care to admit In The Huffington Post reported on an online debate over the possible symbolism in the costume design as Lomax appears in suits that are light in the beginning becoming increasingly darker as his morality slips away The counterpoint is that this merely reflects his increasing social status br br The film won the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film Pacino was also nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain br br The film was the subject of legal action in Hart v Warner Bros Inc in The claim was that the sculpture featuring human forms in John Milton s apartment closely resembled the Ex nihilo sculpture by Frederick Hart on the facade of the Episcopal National Cathedral in Washington D C and that a scene involving the sculpture infringed Hart s rights under copyright law in the United States Hart and the National Cathedral jointly initiated the action with an argument similar to architect Lebbeus Woods s successful lawsuit over imagery in the film Monkeys Defenses available to Warner were that the effect was designed without knowledge of Ex nihilo or fair use br After a federal judge ruled that the film s video release would be delayed until the case went to trial unless a settlement was reached Warner Bros agreed to edit the scene for future releases and to attach stickers to unedited videotapes to indicate there was no relation between the art in the film and Hart s work The settlement in February meant copies of the VHS and DVD could go into rental stores and businesses br br In
