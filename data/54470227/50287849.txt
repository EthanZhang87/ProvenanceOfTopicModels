br br br Main cast br Jaeden Lieberher as William Bill Denbrough br The leader of the group of kids known as the Losers Club who vows to get revenge on the monster with the help of his friends Denbrough losing his brother makes the battle against It a more personal crusade for him than any of the others That and his stutter is what binds him to the group and transforms him into Big Bill the leader On the character of Denbrough Muschietti stated Bill is like a ghost in his own home nobody sees him because his parents can t get over Georgie s death Ty Simpkins was considered for the role in Cary Fukunaga s production On the description of his character Lieberher remarked of Bill that He s very strong and never backs down He does what he thinks is right and would do anything for the people that he loves Lieberher spoke of influences such as YouTube and Colin Firth s performance in The King s Speech in assisting him to develop Bill s stutter while researching and getting used to stuttering on certain words certain syllables certain letters and sounds br Bill Skarsg rd as It Pennywise The Dancing Clown Robert Bob Gray br An ancient trans dimensional evil that awakens every twenty seven years Will Poulter was previously cast in the role but was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts with Poulter stating I was attached when Mr Fukunaga was directing but the circumstances at New Line are such that a new director s attached now Poulter continued I think with all due respect to him of course I was selected by Cary and subscribed to Cary s vision for the movie and so I haven t had a chance to connect with that new director Mark Rylance Ben Mendelsohn Kirk Acevedo Hugo Weaving and Tilda Swinton were considered for the role with Mendelsohn passing on the project as New Line wanted him to take a sizable pay cut On June The Independent officially reported after final negotiations took place that Muschietti had chosen actor Bill Skarsg rd to portray the character On portraying Pennywise Skarsg rd stated It s such an extreme character Inhumane It s beyond even a sociopath because he s not even human He s not even a clown I m playing just one of the beings It creates Skarsg rd described the character further saying It truly enjoys the shape of the clown Pennywise and enjoys the game and the hunt He also commented What s funny to this evil entity might not be funny to everyone else But he thinks it s funny On Pennywise s design Skarsg rd stated It s important that we do something fresh and original for this one It s purposely not going toward that weird greasy look He also commented on being compared to Tim Curry stating that Curry s performance was truly great but it s important for me to do something different because of that I ll never be able to make a Tim Curry performance as good as Tim Curry Skarsg rd also elaborated on his age stating There s a childishness to the character because he s so closely linked to the kids The clown is the manifestation of children s imaginations so there s something child like about that Producer Dan Lin spoke of Skarsg rd s physical attributes His build is really interesting He s really tall and lanky and feels a little clown like in his movement When he came in we had a lot of different actors read and when he came in he had a different spin on the character that got us really excited Lin concluded by comparing the character with that of Heath Ledger s Joker You ve had Ledger doing almost a clown joker you ve seen obviously Tim Curry as a clown We wanted someone who created a Pennywise character that would stand on its own and Bill came in and created this character that frankly freaked us out Muschietti spoke of Skarsg rd s Pennywise as one not to lurk in the shadows to which he remarked Pennywise shows up he s front and center and he does his show He has an act So it s weird all the time and every little thing implies a further threat Muschietti also spoke of wanting to make the sense of dread that grows in Derry part of the dread of Pennywise to which he stated He s not just a character that can shape shift his influence is all around The anticipation of him is almost scarier than the actual Pennywise scares On selecting Skarsg rd to portray Pennywise Muschietti wanted to stay true to the essence of the character and Skarsg rd caught his attention The character has a childish and sweet demeanor but there s something very off about him Skarsg rd has that balance in him He can be sweet and cute but he can be pretty disturbing Producer Barbara Muschietti referred to Skarsg rd s Pennywise as the ancestral clown shunning st century modern clown characteristics and instead hearkening back to th century aesthetics with upgrades br Jeremy Ray Taylor as Benjamin Ben Hanscom br A shy overweight boy with a crush on Beverly who relays the incidents of Derry s past to his friends On the character of Hanscom Muschietti spoke of him knowing a situation of despair on top of the terror of It and the fear of heights and added Ben is bullied at school br Sophia Lillis as Beverly Bev Marsh br A flame haired tomboy who fends off an abusive father at home while forming a strong bond with Ben Beverly s Losership wasn t defined by the fact she was abused but by her poverty On the character of Marsh Muschietti stated Beverly s case is of course the worst because it s about sexual abuse on a minor In an interview with Rolling Stone Lillis spoke of Muschietti not wanting herself and her co stars to spend too much time with Skarsg rd We actually weren t allowed to see him until our scenes because we wanted the horror to be real On the character of Marsh Lillis described her as Kind of a tough person She hides herself She tries to hide her emotions and hide her feelings She distances herself from everyone but once she has this friend group she doesn t want to let it go because this is the only friend group that she has and so she s a very strong character Working with Muschietti Lillis and he developed Marsh as rebelling against her father with Lillis having independence with the character while also stating We definitely talked about her mother who was never there she wasn t even in the movie but we talked about background for the character Lillis spoke of how Beverly is someone she aspires to be relating to her strength her way of facing her fears When I read about her I kind of got the sense that she was someone I could definitely look up to I would be happy if I had any similarity to her On her connection with her fellow co stars she noted that the closeness of the friendships formed allowed Lillis connect with her own character I relate to Beverly the way she deals with her emotions and the way she was around the Losers I felt that way around the actual actors br Finn Wolfhard as Richard Richie Tozier br The bespectacled best friend of Bill whose loud mouth and foul language often get him into trouble Wolfhard shared the first image of the Losers Club on his Instagram account with the photo captioned as The Losers Club take Toronto showing the cast of actors who will be playing the protagonists of the piece He auditioned for the part of Tozier for Fukunaga s It in before Fukunaga left with Wolfhard being the only actor cast in both Muschietti and Fukanaga s version On the character of Tozier Muschietti stated We don t know much about Richie s personality because he s the big mouth of the group But we suppose he s also neglected at home and he s the clown of the band because he needs attention Of his character s changes from the novel to the film Wolfhard stated Richie s always been the same There s some similarities to the book and there s other stuff they added because some of the stuff that we said in this movie you can t say in the s Wolfhard felt that there wasn t much research required in approaching Richie You just have to read the character breakdown and it helps a lot to see the difference between the characters in the book and the miniseries as well to get a raw take on it In an interview with GQ Wolfhard spoke of how all of The Losers bonded on set and that the friendship has carried over That friendship is for real for sure Every time I m in L A I stay with Wyatt who plays Stanley We hang out all the time in L A and wherever they are br Wyatt Oleff as Stanley Stan Uris br The pragmatic son of a rabbi whose bar mitzvah studies are haunted by a ghoulish woman from a painting On the character of Uris Muschietti stated Long story short there s all sorts of difficult situations and we had the chance to tell them in a movie that faces directly those conflicts the families of the young actors were very open minded so we could tell the about subjects that are normally very touchy Muschietti made Stanley the son of a rabbi which is a change from the novel to add a bit of that sense of responsibility while to show oppression from his father with the theme of oppression being a recurring force in the story of the adults of Derry Oleff recalled his first scene shot being a speech at his bar mitzvah I had a ton of lines to memorize and they even added a whole new paragraph while we were filming I was like Oh boy After a while it got a lot easier to say over and over gain sic it was like hours filming that scene On the character of Uris Oleff spoke by stating Stanley in the group is the last one to believe that It is actually real because he just doesn t want to It doesn t fit within his reality until something happens He relates to everyone but he s the one who tries to organize everything but he can t It s falling apart for him and his friends come to support him While Oleff stated Stanley as having OCD remarked He tries to lay everything out in his own mind pattern kinda thing And Pennywise comes along and just shatters everything He s definitely the most scared Uris suffers from an injury sustained at the end of Muschietti s It to which Oleff remarks He s been scarred I guess you can say but Stanley is scarred mentally and physically by these marks They re permanent so every time he would look in the mirror he d see it and be reminded about what happened Oleff spoke of his research into the s in which his parents helped him as They told me a lot about the s and what music I ve been listening to a lot of s music recently That s helped me get into character I made a playlist of what I think Stanley would listen to in the s Oleff also spoke of the fellowship between his co stars and himself where he states I think that translates on screen You could see the friendship we have on and off screen We ve been together for so long that you can see our connection in our characters but also it s us connecting as humans and friends Relating to sensitivity in emotions Oleff compared himself to Uris when stating Stanley tries to hide his emotions and sometimes I accidentally do that as well So I can definitely relate to him in that way One way to describe Stanley is like the voice of reason that no one listens to and that s also me in real life br Chosen Jacobs as Michael Mike Hanlon br A sweet softly spoken black boy living on the outskirts of Derry on his Grandfather s farm On the character of Hanlon Muschietti stated Long story short there s all sorts of difficult situations and we had the chance to tell them in a movie that faces directly those conflicts the families of the young actors were very open minded so we could tell the about subjects that are normally very touchy When describing Hanlon Jacobs stated that although Mike s more independent in characterization he s still an eighties character while elaborating by stating I mean he doesn t have any friends growing up isolated black in the eighties in a primarily Caucasian environment so I think he s just got a sweetness about him On the characterization of Hanlon Jacobs said Finding friends that accept him for who he is means a lot to him So he would never betray that friendship and I feel like I m kind of that way or at least I try to be Jacobs also mentioned I always say this because it s so true Mike is the best friend anyone could ask for just because he s been so isolated and he really appreciates friendships while stating that he was excited to portray Hanlon as I loved the depth of Mike because he s just kind of a sweet backbone type of guy He s the guy you bring back to moms I appreciated being able to play that character Jacobs felt that portraying Hanlon wasn t difficult as he just had to channel the best aspects of himself while suggesting they have many similarities and some differences He brought up the element of Hanlon being one of the only African Americans in Derry while stating that he and the other Losers all have similar isolationism He grew up the outsider because of racial tension which separated him that makes him really appreciate when someone says Hey I like you for who you are Jacobs highlighted the bond Mike shares with his Losers Club friends while also stating Pennywise is just a symbol for all the hard things that happen in life that bring people together Of course we changed We became more mature Some people break out of their shells some people retract into themselves because it s scary This horror film is more than just horror It s a coming of age movie On the experience of shooting Muschietti s film Jacobs spoke of it as my favorite summer of my long years on earth br Jack Dylan Grazer as Edward Eddie Kaspbrak br A sickly boy who only feels truly well when he is with his friends On the character of Kaspbrak Muschietti stated Long story short there s all sorts of difficult situations and we had the chance to tell them in a movie that faces directly those conflicts the families of the young actors were very open minded so we could tell the about subjects that are normally very touchy The off screen friendships began to influence the onscreen friendships with Grazer recalling a scene where they were able to draw on their genuine feelings for one another for a particularly emotional scene We re lifelong friends now in reality and in the movie We re shooting a scene now where Stanley or Wyatt is breaking down and we re all huddling around him crying and it s an amazing powerful scene Because of the friendships it s real He highlighted his enjoyment of the intense scenes he had with Skarsg rd stating I remember one scene after he was done choking me and stuff he goes Jack are you okay And I was like Yeah That was so much fun I love what you re doing with the character like let s do that again On his experiences with Muschietti Grazer mentioned his usage of storyboards for scenes while also stating But to break us into character I actually felt like I was pretty close to Eddie we d stick to our guns about a lot of things we really didn t back down on our opinions Grazer spoke of his appreciation of films such as Lethal Weapon and Batman that gave him insight on how he could improvise or reuse those things as references to the time period br Nicholas Hamilton as Henry Bowers br A young sociopath who leads the Bowers Gang and terrorizes the Losers Club On the character of Bowers Hamilton stated You see a lot of characters in movies who are just bullies and just there to be the antagonist and mess with the main character With Bowers he has so many different layers to him with his father being the way he is and him having to live up to that Hamilton prepared for the role by studying Jarred Blancard s portrayal of the character in It and in Hamilton s words watched all the bits of my original character for research Blancard spoke to Hamilton with Blancard giving him advice on how to handle some of the psychopathic ness and general meanness of Bowers Hamilton added through the character of Bowers that There s stuff that I have to do that is really creepy and the opportunity to help share my psychotic side has been really fun Additionally Hamilton spoke of a scene shared with Ray Taylor wherein he had to terrorize the hell out of him and get right in his face Hamilton highlighted the generic portrayal bullying and the bully in in any movie to which he stated Bowers and his gang are just so much different There s a story there s layers he s vulnerable at times he s not just the dick so I really like that There s definitely stuff to play around with br Jackson Robert Scott as Georgie Denbrough br The innocent energetic year old brother of Bill Denbrough whose death at the

Kajganich learned of Warner Bros plans to adapt King s novel he went after the job Knowing that Warner Bros was committed to adapting It as a single feature film Kajganich began to attempt to try to find a structure that would accommodate such a large number of characters in two different time periods around pages which was one of Warner Bros stipulations Kajganich worked with Lin Lee and Davison on The Invasion and he knew they would champion good storytelling and allow him the time to work out a solid first draft of the screenplay Kajganich spoke of the remake being set in the mid s and in the present mirroring the twenty odd year gap King uses in the book and with a great deal of care and attention paid to the backstories of all the characters br Kajganich also mentioned that Warner

wanting the adaptation as a single film On June the screenplay was being re written by Kajganich He said that his dream choice for Pennywise would be Buster Keaton if he were still alive and the

time as those same characters band together to continue the fight as adults Lin also stated that Fukunaga was only committed to directing the first film though was currently closing a deal to co write the second Lin concluded by mentioning King to which he remarked The most important thing is that King gave us his blessing We didn t want to make this unless he felt it was the right way to go and

compromise his artistic vision in the wake of budget cuts by New Line which greenlit the first film at million However Fukunaga maintained that wasn t the case with him stating he had bigger disagreements with New Line over the direction of the story I was trying to make an unconventional horror film It didn t fit into the algorithm of what they knew they could spend and make money back on based on not offending their standard genre audience He made mention that the budget was perfectly fine as well as his desire to make Pennywise more than just the clown Fukunaga concluded by stating We invested years and so much anecdotal storytelling in it Chase and I both put our childhood in that story So our biggest fear was they were going to take our script and bastardize it so I m actually thankful that they are going to rewrite the script I wouldn t want them to stealing our childhood memories and using that I was honoring King s spirit of it but I needed to update it King saw an earlier draft and liked it On Fukunaga s departure King wrote The remake of IT may be dead or undead but we ll always have Tim Curry He s still floating down in the sewers of Derry br br br Andy

locations on It while mentioning the beauty of Port Hope being one of the reasons as to why it was chosen while Muschietti added We were looking for an idyllic town one that would be a strong contrast to the story Port Hope is the kind of place we all wish we had grown up in long summers riding bicycles walks by the lake a lovely main street charming homes with green lawns warm people Muschietti also mentioned that extras from the area from adults to tiny kids had been involved br On August at The CW TCA presentation for the upcoming series Frequency producer Dan Lin spoke of the piece s comparison to Netflix s Stranger Things with Lee describing It being a homage to s movies while remarking I think a great analogy is actually Stranger Things and we re seeing it on Netflix right now It s very much an homage to s movies whether it s classic Stephen King or even Spielberg Think about Stand by Me as far as the bonding amongst the kids But there is a really scary element in Pennywise Lin continued speaking of how well the young cast has bonded in these first weeks of shooting Lin stated We clearly had a great dynamic amongst the kids Really great chemistry is always a challenging thing with a movie like It because you re casting kids who don t have a ton of experience but it ended up being really natural Each kid like a The Goonies or Stand by Me has a very specific personality and they re forming the loser s club obviously We ve spent a few months getting the kids to bond and now they re going to fight this evil scary clown br On February at the press day for The Lego Batman Movie Lin confirmed that It is going to be rated R by the MPAA to which he stated to Collider com s Steve Weintraub If you re going to make a Rated R movie you have to fully embrace what it is and you have to embrace the source material It is a scary clown that s trying to kill kids They do have a scary clown that s taken over the town of Derry so it s going to be rated R On March Muschietti at the SXSW festival spoke of an element of the pre production phase in his attempt to keep Skarsg rd separated from the film s child actors wherein the actor wasn t introduced to the young cast until Pennywise s first encounter with the children It was something that we agreed on and that s how it happened The day that he showed up on the stage they fucking freaked out Bill is like seven foot high and I can t describe how scary he looks in person He s a wiry man crouching making sounds snotting drooling speaking in Swedish sometimes Terrifying Muschietti stated that the story had been moved forward with the scenes with the young Losers Club shifting from the s to the s while also describing their plot as getting much wider with new material not in the novel or the miniseries However Muschietti said he hoped it would still strike the same emotional resonance that the book did for him when he first read it It s all about trying to hit the core and the heart br On July Muschietti in an interview with French magazine Mad Movies spoke of when developing the R rated film in which allowed him to go into very adult themes which was championed from the people at New Line Cinema He also stated that if you aimed for a PG movie you had nothing at the end So we were very lucky that the producers didn t try to stop us In fact it s more our own moral compass that sometimes showed us that some things lead us in places where we didn t want to go In the same interview on July producer Barbara Muschietti added that there was only one scene that was deemed to be too horrific to feature in the new adaptation in which she stated you won t find the scene where a kid has his back broken and is thrown in the toilets We thought that the visual translation of that scene had something that was really too much Muschietti concluded by emphasizing that nothing was removed from the original vision nor was the violence of any event watered down br On July in an interview with Variety s Brent Lang director Muschietti commented of the monstrous forms that It shall be taking as well as noting the fact that they ll be very different from the incarnations present in King s story in which he stated The story is the same but there are changes in the things the kids are scared of In the book they re children in the s so the incarnations of the monsters are mainly from movies so it s Wolf Man the Mummy Frankenstein and Dracula I had a different approach I wanted to bring out deeper fears based not only on movie monsters but on childhood traumas While on the topic of what being the key to a successful horror film Muschietti concluded by remarking that Stay true to what scares you If you don t respect that you can t scare anyone Muschietti explained how Skarsg rd caught his attention to embody Pennywise while pointing out that he didn t want the young cast to spend too much time with the actor when not shooting and encouraged the cast to maintain distance between them wherein Muschietti detailed We wanted to carry the impact of the encounters to when the cameras were rolling The first scene where Bill interacted with the children it was fun to see how the plan worked The kids were really really creeped out by Bill He s pretty intimidating because he s six four and has all this makeup br br br Filming br br Production designer Mara LePere Schloop went to Bangor Maine to scope out locations including the Thomas Hill Standpipe the land running alongside the Kenduskeag Stream that in It is called The Barrens it was confirmed on March and the Waterworks on the Penobscot River LePere Schloop said during her tour that they were hoping to shoot some scenes in the city and possibly get some aerial shots although currently the leading

It in the municipality of Port Hope Ontario with filming slated for various locations around the municipality from July up until July Principal photography was confirmed to have begun in Toronto with an original shooting schedule occurring from June to September br On July Port Hope had undergone a number of changes to transform it into Derry Port Hope Municipal hall is now Derry Public Library The Port Hope Tourism Centre is now a City of Derry office Ganaraska Financial is now Montgomery Financial Gould s Shoes store front on Walton Street changed to a butcher shop The Avanti Hair Design store front changed to Tony s Barber Shop an empty storefront at Walton Street changed to Reliance Cleaners Queen Street Tattoo store front changed to Derry Scoop a statue of Paul Bunyan was erected in Memorial Park US flags now hang in place of Canadian flags downtown and Port Hope Capitol Theatre had appeared to be showing Batman and Lethal Weapon thus confirming the film s setting of br On July preliminary shooting took place in Port Hope Town Hall Memorial Park cenotaph Queen Street between Walton and Robertson streets and the Capitol Theatre On July filming occurred between the intersection of Mill and Walton street Walton Street bridge and in front and behind Walton Street and Port Hope Town Hall Other shooting locations included Queen Street between Walton and Roberston street and Memorial Park on July It was also reported on July that filming had been set up on the alley between Gould s Shoe s and Avanti Hair Design and John and Hayward streets On July Cavan Street between Highland Drive and Ravine Drive and Victoria Street South between Trafalgar Street and Sullivan Street Filming moved to Cavan Street between Highland Drive and Ravine Drive and Victoria Street South between Trafalgar Street and Sullivan Street on July Filming in Port Hope ended on July at Watson s Guardian Drugs br Oshawa had been chosen by producers of It as the next filming location and on July filming notices were sent out to homes in the area of Eulalie Avenue and James Street near downtown Oshawa advising residents that filming of a new adaptation will commence shooting in the area from August up until August On July it was announced the crew had been busy on the formerly vacant lot at the dead end of James Street constructing the set in the form of a dilapidated old house It was also remarked that the structure is a facade built around scaffolding that will be used for exterior shots The set is composed of pre fabricated modules that are being trucked in and put into place by IATSE carpenters br On July production crews had arrived in Riverdale Toronto with filming beginning at Pape Ave which is home to a circa heritage designated building called Cranfield House up until August It was reported on September that filming had wrapped its shooting in Oshawa which included the haunted house location as well as on Court and Fisher streets Principal photography was confirmed to have ended in Toronto on September with an altered shooting schedule occurring from June to September and ultimately with post production initially beginning on September br br br Cinematography br It was photographed with Arri Alexa XT Plus and Alexa Mini in a distributed aspect ratio of by Chung Chung hoon For photographic lens Chung used Panavision G Series Anamorphic Prime Angenieux Optimo and Primo Prime in which Chung stated is used when Muschietti wants to use a wider lens or needs more frame space for visual effects The look of the lenses is nearly the same I mix them a lot and it works well Cinematographer Chung and director Muschietti s discussions on the lighting of It were of temperature with Muschietti wanting a hot summer with everyone sweating all the time while admiring characters with shine on their faces Both also discussed the balance of making something realistic but with an element of intrigue that something is not right Chung mulled over the notion of a period look for It but ultimately felt the s feel was conveyed through Claude Par s sets and the work of Janie Bryant in which Chung stated Trying to make a movie set in the s look like the s can be dangerous Initially he had thought of photographing with s lighting rules and gear though later feeling it to be superfluous as Muschietti and he were trying to capture a natural look br Muschietti himself found mainstream s lighting too artificial thus preferred to through windows and bounce off the floor allowing him to convey a feeling of intimacy with the characters while admiring the approach of unsettling backlights and soft lights Chung spoke of his experience on Stoker which taught him how to light quickly using one source I feel lucky because some directors will always say Can you make more light But this movie is very naturalistic My responsibility is to the audience and to tell the story and if you want this movie to scare people a natural look is best br br br Editing br br Film editor Jason Ballantine spoke of the difference in pacing and rhythm that comes with horror in It in which a story like this was broken up into individual encounters with Pennywise for each of the characters thus requiring a particular approach Each segment had to have the appropriate rhythm and setup for the inevitable jump scare to which he explained We were definitely conscious of trying to mix the rhythms up Each encounter became somewhat more elaborate for the jump scare in terms of what was shot The first assembly was massively long So it did mean that screen time had to be dropped either through the tightening of existing sequences or even scene deletions Ballantine also spoke of the key factors when cutting It which included King s novel and Tommy Lee Wallace s miniseries br In approaching a scene for It Ballantine mapped out his day to day workflow from getting his dailies to sitting down with Muschietti looking through what he s pieced together Upon receiving the dailies Ballantine looked through the footage to see if he needs any pickups or reshoots to report back to set resulting in Pearce Roemer Elliott Traeger Ferran Banchs and Daniel Miller to ensure all the footage had been copied over before returning the footage for formatting From there Ballantine asks his assistants to arrange the selects in script order so that he can have a better understanding of the structure as well as work at a faster pace without worrying about getting lost in the footage Once Ballantine has a good chunk of the selects in the order he wants the finished product from that batch will be about a third of the original length br br br Design br br br Costume design br br On August in an interview with Entertainment Weekly costume designer Janie Bryant spoke of crafting Pennywise s form fitting suit and the inspirations to which it drew upon involving a number of bygone times among them the Medieval Renaissance Elizabethan and Victorian eras Bryant explained that the costume incorporates all these otherworldly past lives while highlighting the point that Pennywise is a clown from a different time In designing Pennywise s costume Bryant included a Fortuny pleating which gives the costume an almost a crepe like effect to which Bryant remarked It s a different technique than what the Elizabethans would do It s more organic it s more sheer It has a whimsical floppy quality to it It s not a direct translation of a ruff or a whisk which were two of the collars popular during the Elizabethan period br Bryant played with multiple eras as a way of reflecting Pennywise s immortality and added a doll like quality to the costume She furthered this by stating The pants being short the high waistline of the jacket and the fit of the costume is a very important element It gives the character a child like quality Bryant spoke of the two puffs off the shoulder sleeves and again on the bloomers with her desire to create an organic gourd or pumpkin kind of effect which includes the peplum at the waist the flared skirt like fabric blossoming from below his doublet She explains It helps exaggerate certain parts of the body The costume is very nipped in the waist and with the peplum and bloomers it has an expansive silhouette The main color of his costume is a dusky gray but with a few splashes of color She concludes the interview by stating The pompoms are orange and then with the trim around the cuffs and the ankles it s basically a ball fringe that s a combination of orange red and cinnamon It s almost like Pennywise fades into his environment But there are accents to pull out the definition of the gray silk br Bryant explained that she wished for Pennywise to have an organic element about himself with herself paying attention to King s description of Pennywise as being in a silvery gray For Pennywise Bryant s manufacturer built different clown costumes to accommodate the action in the film Muschietti spoke of the fact that the entity of Pennywise has been around for thousands of years thus from an esthetic standpoint wished to depart from the th century clown framework in which he stated I think it looks cheap and it s too related to social events and stuff and circus and stuff Circus is fine but I m more aesthetically attracted to the old time like the th century clown And given that this guy has been around for centuries I wondered myself why why not having an upgrade that was s br br br Production design br br Production designer Claude Par commented that apart from Neibolt Street that the other main component of Muschietti s It were both the sewers and the cistern to which Muschietti and himself worked every morning for roughly three months observing looking at the plans and attempting to figure out what was the best pattern for themselves on stages they had access to a rather precise stage though having to make profit as much as they could of what they had Par discussed about knowing that Muschietti and himself had to have a culvert entrance in The Barrens somewhere in or around Toronto br The construction of Neibolt Street was one of the great challenges of the production with Par later explaining he wanted the haunted house of the film to be visually strong and in line with the decor of the great films of the horror genre such as the Bates house from Psycho or the Overlook Hotel of The Shining Par worked extensively with Muschietti to imagine a haunted house that unleashes a presence that is discovered to be a character in its own right The exterior of Neibolt Street was built in Oshawa Ontario with the interior scenes being filmed in a former hospice br Six months after principal photography Par built the clown room on a sound stage at Pinewood Toronto Studios as Muschietti felt the Neibolt Street sequence required more scares to which Par stated Muschietti had the concept of wanting to have clowns from different eras in which Par said There were real clowns and fake clowns There was lots of work put into dressing mannequins and putting some heads on them with masks and wigs and so on Some of them were real people so they start moving as you see in the movie Conceptually Muschietti himself spoke of how he wished to keep the cistern more grounded and real instead of going into a world of fantasy I decided to do a compelling and surrealistic but still grounded physical place Par originally had wished that the sewers were composed of bricks due to it being of more period accuracy however the cost was deemed too great thus his team and himself decided to go with formed concrete which was constructed with a mixture of planks and plywood sheets Par spoke of the special attention paid to the water drainage for the sewer as well as the water marks that he said echoed those of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina br Par later explained that his team looked at the location with them later having kids climb up and down to which later resulted in the construction of the well on the stage which connects Pennywise s tunnel giving access to the tunnels which in turn gives access to the cistern which is the giant set that we re shooting now and in which Pennywise has his wagon and on top of which there s a pile of all the clothes and toys of the dead kids over the many centuries The vortex of dead children was also a creation of Muschietti and Par with floating being a metaphor for dying according to Muschietti Par had to get down to logistics with conversations taking place about how many bodies would be floating as well as the speed at which the children were spinning around with Par remarking We didn t want to go over a year worth of kids because all the kids that would have been dead would have been eaten in the years that Pennywise was away So the kids of that era are basically a reserve for the next years br br br Sound design br Chris Jenkins and Michael Keller were sound engineers for the film tasked with sound mixing while sound editor Victor Ray Ennis supervised the process Director Muschietti was clear unto the sound engineers about every aspect of the soundscape especially when it came to dynamics During the final mix there were moments when Muschietti conducted the peaks and valleys of the sound design and score to which sound designer Paul Hackner stated It was in these moments when perceived silence created by small transients such as water drips foot creaks or actual silence were revealed resulting in a dynamic mix br br br Visual effects br br Nicholas Brooks was the overall visual effects supervisor and the visual effects company Rodeo FX worked on most of the visual effects on It completing shots for the film Rodeo FX was tasked with creating a number of CG assets to either enhance or even completely replace Bill Skarsg rd s Pennywise amongst others being the giant abandoned cistern within the heart of Pennywise s lair Both from a technical and creative standpoint the various shapes created for Pennywise presented a large challenge for Rodeo FX s modeling rigging and creature FX teams The visual effects company Atomic Arts were initially brought in to create the paper boat sequence for It which covers much of the first trailers to which all of the shots were used in the final film and the company were awarded many more shots in Muschietti s piece Atomic Arts highlighted the challenges in creating the paper boat sequence as Muschietti and Chung shot in it bright sunshine Amalgamated Dynamics worked on the special makeup effects on It br Producer Barbara Muschietti stated that It would use computer generated imagery as a support tool in every circumstance never as an element standing on its own in regard to its relationship with practical effects to which she stated In every film in this day and age there is some CG but we will use it as little as possible Andy Muschietti spoke of It containing a small amount of CGI with much of Pennywise being Skarsg rd and his face The rest it s a shape shifting monster and I wanted to bring that to the screen when he s basically trying to throw everything he has at them while signifying the importance of design and execution in the eternal discussion of practical versus CG br Company s Stephen Nakamura collaborated with Muschietti to color grade It completing the film s digital intermediate in Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve at EFILM spoke of the concepts about the look of Muschietti s film that evolved during production and while continuing it in the DI the idea that a lot of the film takes place in fairly high key situations not the kind of dark shadowy world some horror films exist in Nakamura said It s a period piece It s set in a small town that sort of looks like this pleasant place to be but all this wild stuff is happening On the work connected on Pennywise during the digital intermediate Nakamura spoke of having alpha channel mattes cut around Pennywise s eyes for every shot he s in while using the color corrector to make changes to his eyes Other moments Nakamura mentioned was the battle between the kids and Pennywise underground wherein the setting shifts the story into darkness with such an effect working powerfully in the footlambert standard digital cinema version and even more so in the footlambert HDR pass which was completed for the film s Dolby Cinema version in contrast to Nakamura s work on Tomorrowland with him explaining In the Dolby Cinema version the scene can feel significantly darker but also contain more detail You re pushing more light through the images overall and the contrast ratio is massive so dark scenes can be even darker but we can hold onto every scary detail It s a very effective tool to have for this kind of movie br br br Themes br br It is a loss of innocence story with fear mortality and survivalist themes Muschietti remarked of the film s elements of coming of age and issues of mortality wherein he states such themes are prevalent in King s book though that in reality these occur in a more progressive way There s a passage in It that reads Being a kid is learning how to live and being an adult is learning how to die There s a bit of a metaphor of that and it just happens in a very brutal way of course br He also mentioned the characterization of Pennywise s survivalist attitude and a passage in the novel which inspired Muschietti was when Bill wonders if Pennywise is eating children simply because that s what we re told monsters do in stating It s a tiny bit of information but that sticks with you so much Maybe it is real as long as children believe in it And in a way Pennywise s character is motivated by survival In order to be alive in the imagination of children he has to keep killing While Muschietti acknowledges it to be a horror film he too felt that it s not simply just that It s a story of love and friendship and a lot of other beautiful emotions br br br Influences br Director Andy Muschietti said influences on It included the visceral authority of horror cinema The Howling The Thing and Near Dark He also spoke of the influential contributions of Clive Barker and John Carpenter He cited the influence of Steven Spielberg in the way of understanding story and filmmaking because he has such a strong emotional element to all his stories while crediting Stephen King alongside directors such as Carpenter and Joe Dante He also sought to emulate the whimsical and nostalgic perspective on childhood while providing a balance with a much harsher viewpoint He stated The movie the tone of the movie regarding what childhood is and experiences of childhood is pretty wide There s the Spielberg moments and there s the Larry Clark moments br Muschietti spoke of bringing certain cultural experience within the genre to It in which he highlights his devotion to horror coming from international horror films and literature to which he stated there s other sides to my storytelling influences that comes from of course Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares and writers like Horacio Quiroga But you know my love for horror comes from movies that were mainly English language Muschietti based his portrayal of bullying in It as an homage to personal experience in the s with bullies through the pure cruelty of Henry Bowers where he speaks of them being very mean and very expressionist in their art of bullying which is an aspect he wanted to explore The sequence with Judith the woman in the portrait whose form It assumes to terrify Stan was based on Muschietti s experience with the paintings of Amedeo Modigliani one of which hung in Muschietti s childhood home and which he found frightening interpreting Modigliani s stylisation as monstrous br Skarsg rd spoke of Heath Ledger as being an inspiration while contrasting between Ledger s Joker and his Pennywise in which he stated I think the biggest difference between Pennywise and the Joker character or at least Heath Ledger s interpretation is that he s far more based in reality He also sought to not attempt to emulate the performance in The Dark Knight he remarked I deliberately tried to make mine different because it s such a clear iconic performance so I wanted to stray away from it as far as possible Skarsg rd studied animal programs to assist him in developing Pennywise s physical behavior in which he zeroed in on the energy of hyenas and the lower lip scowl of bears as touchstones While speaking of the inexplicable nature of Pennywise Skarsg rd stated Ledger s Joker is rooted in the real you can break down the psychology But Pennywise is not a real person Skarsg rd explained that Pennywise s succinct shuffles whilst attacking and lunging toward his targets were inspired by his little brother Ossian to which he stated I don t know if you ve seen kids run like this but they move their arms way too fast and it looks really really funny And I just loved the way my brother ran as a kid It was just out of sync So I incorporated that into the character and you get this really explosive effect It s really unsettling when it happens br In approaching the story Barbara Muschietti referred to Stephen King s It as our bible while thinking it to be interesting to respect the proper chronology with the Muschietti siblings going into the casting process with the book in mind Muschietti spoke of using Fukunaga and Palmer s original screenplay as a basis however skewed it in a different direction to which her brother stated It was a good script in terms of characters and the depth of characters and such but it didn t really tap into one of the most attractive traits of the character which was the shape shifting qualities Screenwriter Gary Dauberman said influences on It included Stand by Me while stating that s one of my favorite stories so that s an element I wanted to preserve because it s there in the source material Andy wanted to preserve it and really make that a part of It because I think those moments of levity provide a great contrast to those darker moments or makes the darker moments feel all that much darker Dauberman also spoke of the inspiration Muschietti had upon him as well as director James Wan while stating that a lot of s horror movies and such helped to bring that sort of aesthetic and sensibility br br br Music br br On March Benjamin Wallfisch was announced as the composer of It s score Wallfisch stated that Jerry Goldsmith John Williams Alan Silvestri as well as Dave Grusin s composition for The Goonies were largely influential in the score of It as he felt so passionate about those big thematic style of scoring albeit at the same time wishing to go beyond the idea that it would be a purely orchestral and adventurous score According to Wallfisch he had to develop a theme for Pennywise which included finding and creating music that could infect all the other melodies as there are several themes in the film but the Pennywise score is a very quiet and whispered childlike tune using very high strings Wallfisch spoke of Pennywise s second theme inspired by Skarsg rd s portrayal in which he used the old children s song Oranges and Lemons which had always disturbed him as a child We knew we wanted some kind of children s song to signify Pennywise s strange and demented inner monologue I also very subtly use certain melodic fragments from it in other themes for example the piano music that opens and closes the movie br br br Release br br It premiered at Grauman s Chinese Theatre on September in Hollywood California after screening as a preview at BFI Southbank in London England on September while being selected to screen as the opening film of the

official image for It debuted on July to promote It introducing the first look at Skarsg rd s Pennywise The Dancing Clown as well as an interview with Skarsg rd conducted by Anthony Breznican Thomas Freeman of Maxim wrote that Skarsgard in full terrifying costume he s clearly got what it takes to fill King s most macabre nightmare inducing creation Chris Eggertsen of HitFix responded positively stating the image to be an appropriately macabre look that doesn t deviate too radically from the aesthetic of Curry s Pennywise dare I say a more creepily seductive look to Skarsgard s version that was absent from Curry s interpretation br On August Entertainment Weekly released the full costume image of Skarsg rd s Pennywise to promote It including an interview with costume designer Janie Bryant JoBlo com s Damion Damaske was fond of the new design though was understanding others being dismissive of it Damaske also stated One of the chief complaints is that it looked too automatically scary and that one of the reasons Pennywise chooses his guise is to trick and lure children Dave Trumbore of Collider noted that This one s going to divide some folks It s nowhere near as baggy or colorful as the one Tim Curry donned but the new version certainly seems to have a lot more thought and intent behind its creation Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting called the image one of drawing attention and curiosity Barkan then stated I don t know if it s morbid curiosity or hopeful wishes but the overall response to his face and makeup seemed to be quite positive br On March Neha Aziz of SXSW announced that Muschietti is set to appear at a screening event titled Face Your Fears to share footage from It while discussing his inspirations and influences On March New Line Cinema showcased its promotion of It by releasing a teaser trailer and a scene at the South by Southwest festival Trace Thurman of Bloody Disgusting heralded the trailer It was maybe seconds of footage but it was a damn impressive seconds of footage As far as teasers go it s one of the best that I ve ever seen Dread Central s Jonathan Barkan praised the scene and stated The kids are clearly very adept at working off one another There was a chemistry between the four that was wonderful to see and it s obvious that Muschietti worked very hard to ensure they were believable Eric Vespe of Ain t It Cool News

stated There s always tension in the sustained string chords of the soundtrack and it imbues everything with suspense and darkness Wired s Brian Raftery spoke most highly of the trailer to which he stated The teaser s scariest moment features no gore or gotcha ness instead it involves a misfiring slide projector and a barely discernible clown grin Nothing in the It trailer feels like a cheap thrill which is all the more thrilling IndieWire s William Earl reacted positively to the top notch production design of Derry Maine within the trailer The trailer reached million views in its first hours setting a new record as the trailer with the most views in one day In addition to dethroning The Fate of the Furious the trailer numbers surpassed previous records held by Beauty and the Beast

preview showcasing a snippet of the film where the Losers Club search for Pennywise s many victims Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone felt snippet of the film was initially similar to Stand By Me with the Losers Club playfully bantering about gray water A series of scary images soon follow before the trailer ends on Pennywise doing unimaginable balloon tricks to lure a victim Matt Goldberg of Collider com praised the trailer and stated This new trailer really plays up the kids role and their fears It s a smart move because if a sequel does come along it s going to be looking at the kids as adults so that aspect will be lost Digital Spy s Jack Tomlin spoke of the clarity in that director Muschietti s film will carry on down the creepy as hell vibe he gave the first trailer On July Entertainment

minute extended footage reel of It was attached to prints of Annabelle Creation as part of It s marketing campaign which included an introduction by Stephen King one month before release John Squires of Bloody Disgusting described Skarsgard as commanding the screen as Pennywise turning in a performance that s likely going to remind many of the next level believably of Heath Ledger as the Joker in The Dark Knight Kofi Outlaw of PopCulture wrote that Skarsg rd excels at portraying Pennywise as thing not of this world that is only pretending to take the shape of something comprehensible to the mind All in all it seems like we ll get a very good performance from Skarsg rd On August through to September Warner Bros and New Line Cinema announced a haunted house experience called The IT
