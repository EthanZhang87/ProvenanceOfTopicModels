dying as Sarah embraces him and tells him that she loves him br br br Cast br br br Production br br br Development br br After King s novel The Dead Zone was released in Lorimar Film Entertainment began developing a film adaptation Producer Carol Baum gave the book to screenwriter Jeffrey Boam and asked him to write a screenplay I saw it had great possibilities and agreed to do it Boam said He developed a script with director Stanley Donen who left the project before the film had reached production at Lorimar Boam completed his first draft for the film on the same day as Ronald Reagan s election as president br br Lorimar eventually closed its film division after a series of box office failures and soon after producer Dino De Laurentiis bought the rights to The Dead Zone He initially disliked Boam s screenplay and asked King to adapt his own novel De Laurentiis then reportedly rejected King s script as involved and convoluted however David Cronenberg who ultimately directed the film said that he was the one who decided not to use the script finding it needlessly brutal De Laurentiis commissioned another script from Andrzej u awski but rejected it and returned to Boam Cronenberg later questioned the quality of the script De Laurentiis read as it was initially written in Polish translated to English and then translated to Italian The film was finally on track to be made when De Laurentiis hired producer Debra Hill to work with Cronenberg and Boam br Cronenberg initially rejected De Laurentiis offer to direct the film but accepted the position after meeting Hill Cronenberg received five scripts for the film including one from King which he described as the worst one by far Although Cronenberg did not write Fast Company he was involved in the writing process and made edits during film The Dead Zone was his first film in which he did not have any involvement in writing the script It was also his first film that did not have any Canadian content br Boam abandoned King s parallel story structure for The Dead Zone s screenplay turning the plot into separate episodes Boam told writer Tim Lucas in King s book is longer than it needed to be The novel sprawls and it s episodic What I did was use that episodic quality because I saw The Dead Zone as a triptych His script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg who eliminated large portions of the novel s story including plot points about Johnny Smith having a brain tumor br Cronenberg Boam and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay page by page Boam s triptych in the screenplay surrounds three acts the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after he awakes from a coma a story about Smith assisting a sheriff in tracking down the Castle Rock Killer and finally Johnny deciding to confront the politician Stillson Boam said he enjoyed writing character development for Smith having him struggle with the responsibility of his psychic abilities and ultimately giving up his life for the greater good It was this theme that made me like the book and I particularly enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece a work of exploitation he said In Boam s first draft of the screenplay Johnny does not die at the end but rather has a vision about the Castle Rock Killer who is still alive and escaped from prison Cronenberg insisted that this trick ending be revised Boam submitted the final draft of the screenplay on November br Boam stated that Donen wanted the film to be told from an outside point of view while Cronenberg wanted it from Johnny s perspective King is reported to have told Cronenberg that the changes the director and Boam made to the story improved and intensified the power of the narrative br Before Christopher Walken was cast as Johnny Smith Bill Murray was considered for the role as it was King s first choice Cronenberg initially wanted Nicholas Campbell to portray Johnny but the director wound up casting him as the Castle Rock Killer instead Cronenberg also wanted Hal Holbrook to portray Sheriff Bannerman but De Laurentiis objected br In addition to Donen both John Badham and Michael Cimino were also considered to direct br br br Filming br The financial failure of Videodrome occurred during the filming of The Dead Zone Shooting started in early January and took place in the Greater Toronto Area and the Regional Municipality of Niagara of Cronenberg s native Ontario Canada The so called Screaming Tunnel located in nearby Niagara Falls Ontario was also used as the backdrop for one scene The gazebo was built by the film crew and donated to Niagara on the Lake It was Cronenberg s first film to utilize stereophonic sound br According to a David Cronenberg interview on the DVD The Dead Zone was filmed during a relentless deep freeze in southern Ontario which lasted for weeks creating an authentic atmosphere of subzero temperatures and icy snow packed terrain which made for great natural shooting locations despite it being almost too cold for cast and crew to tolerate at times Canada s Wonderland a theme park km north of Toronto s city limits was also used as a filming location br br br Music br The music soundtrack composed by Michael Kamen was recorded by the National Philharmonic Orchestra London at the famous EMI Abbey Road Studios Michael Kamen conducted the recording sessions the orchestra was contracted and led by Sidney Sax This is the only Cronenberg film since The Brood for which Howard Shore was not composer br br br Release br The film s premiere was planned for the Toronto International Film Festival but three days before the showing Paramount removed it as the studio did not want negative reviews six weeks before the film s theatrical release Daniel was premiered instead br Cronenberg criticized the film s theatrical distribution and stated that it could have been number one at the box office had its distribution been better The head of marketing at Paramount David Rose was arrested for embezzling money and Cronenberg theorized that Rose might have taken money meant for the marketing of the film br Cronenberg showed his own Dolby stereo version of the film in Toronto for a month as none of the theaters were playing that version and broke even without concessions br br br Reception br The Dead Zone received very positive reviews on release It

that date He praised Cronenberg s direction for successfully weaving the supernatural into the everyday and noted believable performances by the entire cast especially Walken Walken does such a good job of portraying Johnny Smith the man with the strange gift that we forget this is science fiction or fantasy or whatever and just accept it as this guy s story Janet Maslin of The New York Times referred to the film as a well acted drama more eerie than terrifying more rooted in the occult than in sheer horror Robin Wood stated that it was the first film by Cronenberg that he could admire and called it a healthy development br Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader was more critical of the film describing it as By no means a bad film just a disappointingly bland and superficial one in which director David Cronenberg relinquishes the one thing that had always set him apart from his Canadian colleagues his willingness to follow his intuitions rather than the logic of a script br br br Box
