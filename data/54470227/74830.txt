id: 74830
Jaws is a American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg based on the novel by Peter Benchley It stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody who with the help of a marine biologist Richard Dreyfuss and a professional shark hunter Robert Shaw hunts a man eating great white shark that attacks beachgoers at a summer resort town Murray Hamilton plays the mayor and Lorraine Gary portrays Brody s wife The screenplay is credited to Benchley who wrote the first drafts and actor writer Carl Gottlieb who rewrote the script during principal photography br Shot mostly on location at Martha s Vineyard in Massachusetts from May to October of Jaws was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean and consequently had a troubled production going over budget and schedule As the art department s mechanical sharks often malfunctioned Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark s presence employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer John Williams to indicate its impending appearances Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director Alfred Hitchcock Universal Pictures release of the film to over screens was an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture at the time and it was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign that heavily emphasized television spots and tie in merchandise br Regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history Jaws was the prototypical summer blockbuster and won several awards for its music and editing It was the highest grossing film of all time until the release of Star Wars two years later both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model which pursues high box office returns from action and adventure films with simple high concept premises released during the summer in thousands of theaters and advertised heavily Jaws was followed by three sequels none of which involved Spielberg or Benchley and many imitative thrillers In the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry br br br Plot br In the New England beach town of Amity Island a young woman goes for a late night ocean swim during a beach party An unseen force attacks and pulls her underwater Her remains are found washed up on the beach the next morning After the medical examiner concludes it was a shark attack newly hired police chief Martin Brody closes the beaches Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reconsider fearing the town s summer economy will suffer The coroner apparently under pressure now concurs with the mayor s theory that it was a boating accident Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until a young boy Alex Kintner is killed at a crowded beach A bounty is placed on the shark causing an amateur shark hunting frenzy Quint an eccentric and roughened local shark hunter offers his services for Consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines the girl s remains confirming that an abnormally large shark killed her br When local fishermen catch a tiger shark Vaughn declares the beaches safe A skeptical Hooper dissects the tiger shark and finding no human remains inside its stomach concludes that the killer shark is still out there While searching the night waters in Hooper s boat Hooper and Brody find the half sunken boat of Ben Gardner a local fisherman Hooper dons a scuba suit and goes underwater to check the boat s hull where he finds a large shark tooth embedded into it He accidentally drops the tooth in fright after encountering Gardner s corpse Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper s assertions that a great white shark caused the deaths and refuses to close the beaches allowing only increased safety precautions On the Fourth of July weekend tourists pack the beaches The shark enters a nearby lagoon killing a boater and coming close to killing Brody s son Brody then convinces a guilt ridden Vaughn to hire Quint br Despite initial tension between Quint and Hooper they and Brody head out to sea on Quint s boat to hunt for the shark As Brody lays down a chum line the shark suddenly appears behind the boat Quint estimating it is feet m long and weighs tonnes long tons short tons harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears br At nightfall Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted body scars One of Quint s is a removed tattoo and he reveals that he survived the attack on the USS Indianapolis during which many US sailors were killed by sharks The shark returns ramming the boat s hull and disabling the power The men work through the night repairing the engine In the morning Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard but Quint obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance smashes the radio After a long chase Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel The line is tied to the stern cleats but the shark drags the boat backward swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment As Quint is about to sever the line to save the boat s transom the cleats break off The barrels stay attached to the shark To Brody s relief Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters but the overtaxed engine fails br As the boat takes on water the trio attempt a riskier approach Hooper suits up and enters a shark proof cage intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine via a hypodermic spear The shark viciously attacks the cage causing Hooper to drop the spear While the shark destroys the cage Hooper escapes to the seabed The shark leaps onto the boat s stern subsequently devouring Quint Trapped on the sinking vessel Brody shoves a scuba tank into the shark s mouth and climbing onto the crow s nest shoots the tank with a rifle The resulting explosion kills the shark Hooper resurfaces and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels br br br Production br br br Development br Richard D Zanuck and David Brown producers at Universal Pictures independently heard about Peter Benchley s novel Jaws Brown came across it in the literature section of lifestyle magazine Cosmopolitan then edited by his wife Helen Gurley Brown A small card written by the magazine s book editor gave a detailed description of the plot concluding with the comment might make a good movie The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was the most exciting thing that they had ever read and that they wanted to produce a film version although they were unsure how it would be accomplished They purchased the film rights in before the book s publication for approximately equivalent to in Brown claimed that had they read the book twice they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences br To direct Zanuck and Brown first considered veteran filmmaker John Sturges whose r sum included another maritime adventure The Old Man and the Sea before offering the job to Dick Richards whose directorial debut The Culpepper Cattle Co had come out the previous year They soon grew irritated by Richards s habit of describing the shark as a whale and dropped him from the project Meanwhile Steven Spielberg very much wanted the job The year old had just directed his first theatrical film The Sugarland Express for Zanuck and Brown At the end of a meeting in their office Spielberg noticed their copy of the still unpublished Benchley novel and after reading it was immediately captivated He later observed that it was similar to his television film Duel in that both deal with these leviathans targeting everymen He also revealed in The Making of Jaws documentary on the DVD release that he directly referenced Duel by repurposing the sound of the truck being destroyed as the death roar of the shark After Richards s departure the producers signed Spielberg to direct in June before the release of The Sugarland Express br Before production began Spielberg grew reluctant to continue with Jaws in fear of becoming typecast as the truck and shark director He wanted to move over to th Century Fox s Lucky Lady instead but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure Brown helped convince Spielberg to stick with the project saying that after Jaws you can make all the films you want The film was given an estimated budget of million and a shooting schedule of days Principal photography was set to begin in May Universal wanted the shoot to finish by the end of June when the major studios contract with the Screen Actors Guild was due to expire to avoid any disruptions due to a potential strike br br br Writing br For the screen adaptation Spielberg wanted to stay with the novel s basic plot but discarded many of Benchley s subplots He declared that his favorite part of the book was the shark hunt on the last pages and told Zanuck when he accepted the job I d like to do the picture if I could change the first two acts and base the first two acts on original screenplay material and then be very true to the book for the last third When the producers purchased the rights to his novel they promised Benchley that he could write the first draft of the screenplay The intent was to make sure a script could be done despite an impending threat of a Writer s Guild strike given Benchley was not unionized Overall he wrote three drafts before the script was turned over to other writers delivering his final version to Spielberg he declared I m written out on this and that s the best I can do Benchley later described his contribution to the finished film as the storyline and the ocean stuff basically the mechanics given he didn t know how to put the character texture into a screenplay One of his changes was to remove the novel s adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper at the suggestion of Spielberg who feared it would compromise the camaraderie between the men on the Orca During the film s production Benchley agreed to return and play a small onscreen role as a reporter br Spielberg who felt that the characters in Benchley s script were still unlikable invited the young screenwriter John Byrum to do a rewrite but he declined the offer Columbo creators William Link and Richard Levinson also declined Spielberg s invitation Tony and Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Howard Sackler was in Los Angeles when the filmmakers began looking for another writer and offered to do an uncredited rewrite since the producers and Spielberg were unhappy with Benchley s drafts they quickly agreed At the suggestion of Spielberg Brody s characterization made him afraid of water coming from an urban jungle to find something more terrifying off this placid island near Massachusetts br Spielberg wanted some levity in Jaws humor that would avoid making it a dark sea hunt so he turned to his friend Carl Gottlieb a comedy writer actor then working on the sitcom The Odd Couple Spielberg sent Gottlieb a script asking what the writer would change and if there was a role he would be interested in performing Gottlieb sent Spielberg three pages of notes and picked the part of Meadows the politically connected editor of the local paper He passed the audition one week before Spielberg took him to meet the producers regarding a writing job br While the deal was initially for a one week dialogue polish Gottlieb eventually became the primary screenwriter rewriting nearly the entire script during a nine week period of principal photography The script for each scene was typically finished the night before it was shot after Gottlieb had dinner with Spielberg and members of the cast and crew to decide what would go into the film Many pieces of dialogue originated from the actors improvisations during these meals a few were created on set just prior to filming John Milius contributed other dialogue polishes and Sugarland Express writers Matthew Robbins and Hal Barwood also made uncredited contributions Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft although it is unclear to what degree the other screenwriters drew on his material One specific alteration he called for in the story was to change the cause of the shark s death from extensive wounds to a scuba tank explosion as he felt audiences would respond better to a big rousing ending The director estimated the final script had a total of scenes that were not in the book br Benchley had written Jaws after reading about sport fisherman Frank Mundus s capture of an enormous shark in According to Gottlieb Quint was loosely based on Mundus whose book Sportfishing for Sharks he read for research Sackler came up with the backstory of Quint as a survivor of the World War II USS Indianapolis disaster The question of who deserves the most credit for writing Quint s monologue about the Indianapolis has caused substantial controversy Spielberg described it as a collaboration between Sackler Milius and actor Robert Shaw who was also a playwright According to the director Milius turned Sackler s three quarters of a page speech into a monologue and that was then partially rewritten by Shaw Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw downplaying Milius s contribution br br br Casting br br Though Spielberg complied with a request from Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars He felt that somewhat anonymous performers would help the audience believe this was happening to people like you and me whereas stars bring a lot of memories along with them and those memories can sometimes corrupt the story The director added that in his plans the superstar was gonna be the shark The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary the wife of president of Universal Sidney Sheinberg as Ellen Brody and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island Stuntwoman turned actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie the first victim as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude Most minor roles were played by residents of Martha s Vineyard where the film was shot One example was Deputy Hendricks played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer Lee Fierro plays Mrs Kintner the mother of the shark s second victim Alex Kintner played by Jeffrey Voorhees br The role of Brody was offered to Robert Duvall but the actor was interested only in portraying Quint Charlton Heston expressed a desire for the role but Spielberg felt that Heston would bring a screen persona too grand for the part of a police chief of a modest community Roy Scheider became interested in the project after overhearing Spielberg at a party talk with a screenwriter about having the shark jump up onto a boat Spielberg was initially apprehensive about hiring Scheider fearing he would portray a tough guy similar to his role in The French Connection br Nine days before the start of production neither Quint nor Hooper had been cast The role of Quint was originally offered to actors Lee Marvin and Sterling Hayden both of whom passed Zanuck and Brown had just finished working with Robert Shaw on The Sting and suggested him to Spielberg Shaw was reluctant to take the role since he did not like the book but decided to accept at the urging of both his wife actress Mary Ure and his secretary The last time they were that enthusiastic was From Russia with Love And they were right Shaw based his performance on fellow cast member Craig Kingsbury a local fisherman farmer and legendary eccentric who was cast in the small role of fisherman Ben Gardner Spielberg described Kingsbury as the purest version of who in my mind Quint was and some of his offscreen utterances were incorporated into the script as lines of both Gardner and Quint Another source for some of Quint s dialogue and mannerisms especially in the third act at sea was Vineyard mechanic and boat owner Lynn Murphy br For the role of Hooper Spielberg initially wanted Jon Voight Timothy Bottoms Jan Michael Vincent Joel Grey and Jeff Bridges were also considered for the part Spielberg s friend George Lucas suggested Richard Dreyfuss whom he had directed in American Graffiti The actor initially passed but changed his decision after he attended a pre release screening of The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz which he had just completed Disappointed in his performance and fearing that no one would want to hire him once Kravitz was released he immediately called Spielberg and accepted the role in Jaws Because the film the director envisioned was so dissimilar to Benchley s novel Spielberg asked Dreyfuss not to read it As a result of the casting Hooper was rewritten to better suit the actor as well as to be more representative of Spielberg who came to view Dreyfuss as his alter ego br br br Filming br br Principal photography began May on the island of Martha s Vineyard Massachusetts selected after consideration was given to eastern Long Island Brown explained later that the production needed a vacation area that was lower middle class enough so that an appearance of a shark would destroy the tourist business Martha s Vineyard was also chosen because the surrounding ocean had a sandy bottom that never dropped below feet m for miles km out from shore which allowed the mechanical sharks to operate while also beyond sight of land As Spielberg wanted to film the aquatic sequences relatively close up to resemble what people see while swimming cinematographer Bill Butler devised new equipment to facilitate marine and underwater shooting including a rig to keep the camera stable regardless of tide and a sealed submersible camera box Spielberg asked the art department to avoid red in both scenery and wardrobe so that the blood from the attacks would be the only red element and cause a bigger shock br br Initially the film s producers wanted to train a great white shark but quickly realized this was not possible so three full size pneumatically powered prop sharks which the film crew nicknamed Bruce after Spielberg s lawyer Bruce Ramer were made for the production a sea sled shark a full body prop with its belly missing that was towed with a foot m line and two platform sharks one that moved from camera left to right with its hidden left side exposing an array of pneumatic hoses and an opposite model with its right flank uncovered The sharks were designed by art director and production designer Joe Alves during the third quarter of Between November and April the sharks were fabricated at Rolly Harper s Motion Picture Equipment Rental in Sun Valley California Their construction involved a team of as many as effects technicians supervised by mechanical effects supervisor Bob Mattey best known for creating the giant squid in Leagues Under the Sea After the sharks were completed they were trucked to the shooting location In early July the platform used to tow the two side view sharks capsized as it was being lowered to the ocean floor forcing a team of divers to retrieve it The model required operators to control all of the moving parts For Quint s boat the Orca Alves and his team constructed two identical foot models for the film The second boat dubbed Orca II had no motor and was designed to sink on command br Jaws was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean resulting in a troubled shoot and went far over budget David Brown said that the budget was million and the picture wound up costing million the effects outlays alone grew to million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname Flaws Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life sized shark I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere but it would not have looked the same he said As for his lack of experience I was naive about the ocean basically I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank Gottlieb said that there was nothing to do except make the movie so everyone kept overworking and while as a writer he did not have to attend the ocean set every day once the crewmen returned they arrived ravaged and sunburnt windblown and covered with salt water br Shooting at sea led to many delays unwanted sailboats drifted into frame cameras got soaked and the Orca once began to sink with the actors on board The prop sharks frequently malfunctioned owing to a series of problems including bad weather pneumatic hoses taking on salt water frames fracturing due to water resistance corroding skin and electrolysis From the first water test onward the non absorbent neoprene foam that made up the sharks skin soaked up liquid causing the sharks to balloon and the sea sled model frequently got entangled among forests of seaweed Spielberg later calculated that during the hour daily work schedule on average only four hours were actually spent filming Gottlieb was nearly decapitated by the boat s propellers and Dreyfuss was almost imprisoned in the steel cage The actors were frequently seasick Shaw also fled to Canada whenever he could due to tax problems engaged in binge drinking and developed a grudge against Dreyfuss who was getting rave reviews for his performance in Duddy Kravitz Editor Verna Fields rarely had material to work with during principal photography as according to Spielberg we would shoot five scenes in a good day three in an average day and none in a bad day br br The delays proved beneficial in some regards The script was refined during production and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot many scenes so that the shark was only hinted at For example for much of the shark hunt its location is indicated by the floating yellow barrels The opening had the shark devouring Chrissie but it was rewritten so that it would be shot with Backlinie being dragged and yanked by cables to simulate an attack Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin This forced restraint is widely thought to have added to the film s suspense As Spielberg put it years later The film went from a Japanese Saturday matinee horror flick to more of a Hitchcock the less you see the more you get thriller In another interview he similarly declared The shark not working was a godsend It made me become more like Alfred Hitchcock than like Ray Harryhausen The acting became crucial for making audiences believe in such a big shark The more fake the shark looked in the water the more my anxiety told me to heighten the naturalism of the performances br Footage of real sharks was shot by Ron and Valerie Taylor in the waters off Dangerous Reef in South Australia with a short actor in a miniature shark cage to create the illusion that the sharks were enormous During the Taylors shoot a great white attacked the boat and cage The footage of the cage attack was so stunning that Spielberg was eager to incorporate it in the film No one had been in the cage at the time and the script following the novel originally had the shark killing Hooper in it The storyline was consequently altered to have Hooper escape from the cage which allowed the footage to be used As production executive Bill Gilmore put it The shark down in Australia rewrote the script and saved Dreyfuss s character br Although principal photography was scheduled to take days it did not wrap until October after days Spielberg reflecting on the protracted shoot stated I thought my career as a filmmaker was over I heard rumors that I would never work again because no one had ever taken a film days over schedule Spielberg himself was not present for the shooting of the final scene in which the shark explodes as he believed that the crew were planning to throw him in the water when the scene was done It has since become a tradition for Spielberg to be absent when the final scene of one of his films is being shot Afterward underwater scenes were shot at the Metro Goldwyn Mayer water tank in Culver City with stuntmen Dick Warlock and Frank James Sparks as stand ins for Dreyfuss in the scene where the shark attacks the cage as well as near Santa Catalina Island California Fields who had completed a rough cut of the first two thirds of the film up until the shark hunt finished the editing and reworked some of the material According to Zanuck She actually came in and reconstructed some scenes that Steven had constructed for comedy and made them terrifying and some scenes he shot to be terrifying and made them comedy scenes The boat used for the Orca was brought to Los Angeles so the sound effects team could record sounds for both the ship and the underwater scenes br Two scenes were altered following test screenings As the audience s screams had covered up Scheider s bigger boat one liner Brody s reaction after the shark jumps behind him was extended and the volume of the line was raised Spielberg also decided that he was greedy for one more scream and reshot the scene in which Hooper discovers Ben Gardner s body using of his own money after Universal refused to pay for the reshoot The underwater scene was shot in Fields s swimming pool in Encino California using a lifecast latex model of Craig Kingsbury s head attached to a fake body which was placed in the wrecked boat s hull To simulate the murky waters of Martha s Vineyard powdered milk was poured into the pool which was then covered with a tarpaulin br br br Music br br John Williams composed the film s score which earned him an Academy Award and was later ranked the sixth greatest score by the American Film Institute The main shark theme a simple alternating pattern of two notes variously identified as E and F or F and F sharp became a classic piece of suspense music synonymous with approaching danger see leading tone Williams described the theme as grinding away at you just as a shark would do instinctual relentless unstoppable The piece was performed by tuba player Tommy Johnson When asked by Johnson why the melody was written in such a high register and not played by the more appropriate French horn Williams responded that he wanted it to sound a little more threatening When Williams first demonstrated his idea to Spielberg playing just the two notes on a piano Spielberg was said to have laughed thinking that it was a joke As Williams saw similarities between Jaws and pirate movies at other points in the score he evoked pirate music which he called primal but fun and entertaining Calling for rapid percussive string playing the score contains echoes of Claude Debussy s La mer and of Igor Stravinsky s The Rite of Spring br There are various interpretations of the meaning and effectiveness of the primary music theme which is widely described as one of the most recognizable cinematic themes of all time Music scholar Joseph Cancellaro proposes that the two note expression mimics the shark s heartbeat According to Alexandre Tylski like themes Bernard Herrmann wrote for Taxi Driver North by Northwest and particularly Mysterious Island it suggests human respiration He further argues that the score s strongest motif is actually the split the rupture when it dramatically cuts off as after Chrissie s death The relationship between sound and silence is also taken advantage of in the way the audience is conditioned to associate the shark with its theme which is exploited toward the film s climax when the shark suddenly appears with no musical introduction br Spielberg later said that without Williams s score the film would have been only half as successful and according to Williams it jumpstarted his career He had previously scored Spielberg s debut feature The Sugarland Express and went on to collaborate with the director on almost all of his films The original soundtrack for Jaws was released by MCA Records on LP in and as a CD in including roughly a half hour of music that Williams redid for the album In two versions of the score were released Decca Universal reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the th anniversary DVD featuring the entire minutes of the original score and Var se Sarabande put out a rerecording of the score performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra conducted by Joel McNeely br br br Themes br br br Influences br Herman Melville s Moby Dick is the most notable artistic antecedent to Jaws The character of Quint strongly resembles Captain Ahab the obsessed captain of the Pequod who devotes his life to hunting a sperm whale Quint s monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks even his boat the Orca is named after the only natural enemy of the white shark In the novel and original screenplay Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg similar to the death of Ahab in Melville s novel A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg s draft of the screenplay which introduces Quint watching the film version of Moby Dick his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater However the scene from Moby Dick could not be licensed from the film s star Gregory Peck its copyright holder Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to Ernest Hemingway s The Old Man and the Sea Jaws is a titanic struggle like Melville or Hemingway br The underwater scenes shot from the shark s point of view have been compared with passages in two s horror films Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Monster That Challenged the World Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted or not The Thing from Another World which Gottlieb described as a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel and It Came From Outer Space where the suspense was built up because the creature was always off camera Those precedents helped Spielberg and Gottlieb to concentrate on showing the effects of the shark rather than the shark itself Scholars such as Thomas Schatz have described how Jaws melds various genres while essentially being an action film and a thriller Most is taken from horror with the core of a nature based monster movie while adding elements of a slasher film The second half is both a buddy film in the interaction between the crew of the Orca and a supernatural horror based on the shark s depiction of a nearly Satanic menace Ian Freer describes Jaws as an aquatic monster movie citing the influence of earlier monster films such as King Kong and Godzilla Charles Derry in also compared Jaws to Godzilla and Spielberg cited Godzilla King of the Monsters as a formative influence growing up due to the masterful way in which it made you believe it was really happening br Critics such as Neil Sinyard have described similarities to Henrik Ibsen s play An Enemy of the People Gottlieb himself said he and Spielberg referred to Jaws as Moby Dick meets Enemy of the People The Ibsen work features a doctor who discovers that a seaside town s medicinal hot springs a major tourist attraction and revenue source are contaminated When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger he loses his job and is shunned This plotline is paralleled in Jaws by Brody s conflict with Mayor Vaughn who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight Sinyard calls the film a deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen s play br br br Scholarly criticism br Jaws has received attention from academic critics Stephen Heath relates the film s ideological meanings to the then recent Watergate scandal He argues that Brody represents the white male middle class there is not a single black and very quickly not a single woman in the film who restores public order with an ordinary guy kind of heroism born of fear and decency Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine Jaws as a signal example of the film as industrial product that sells on the basis of the pleasure of cinema thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry which is why part of the meaning of Jaws is to be the most profitable movie br Andrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel s post Watergate cynicism suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book Hooper s survival the shark s explosive death help make it a communal exorcism a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence He suggests that the experience of the film is inconceivable without the mass audience s jubilation when the shark is annihilated signifying the obliteration of evil itself In his view Brody serves to demonstrate that individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change Peter Biskind argues that the film does maintain post Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town s venal mayor Yet he observes that far from the narrative formulas so often employed by New Hollywood filmmakers of the era involving Us vs Them hip counterculture figures vs The Man the overarching conflict in Jaws does not pit the heroes against authority figures but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position br Whereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel s theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance Authority must be restored he writes but not by Quint The seaman s working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening irrational and out of control Hooper meanwhile is associated with technology rather than experience inherited wealth rather than self made sufficiency he is marginalized from the conclusive action if less terminally than Quint Britton sees the film more as concerned with the vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them which in turn helps generate a pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life a value clearly related to ideological stability and cultural continuity br Fredric Jameson s analysis highlights the polysemy of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very polysemousness which is profoundly ideological insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently natural ones to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence He views Quint s demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old populist New Deal America and Brody and Hooper s partnership as an allegory of an alliance between the forces of law and order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it br Neal Gabler analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle science represented by Hooper spiritualism represented by Quint and the common man represented by Brody The last of the three is the one which succeeds and is in that way endorsed by the film br br br Audience emotional response br While in theaters the film was said to have caused a single case of cinematic neurosis in a year old female viewer Cinematic neurosis is a condition in which viewers exhibit mental health disturbances or a worsening of existing mental health disturbances after viewing a film The symptoms first presented as sleep disturbances and anxiety but one day later the patient was screaming Sharks Sharks and experiencing convulsions br This case study caused the film to become notable in the medical community alongside The Exorcist for causing stress reactions in its viewers and was later used in a study by Brian R Johnson to test how susceptible audiences were to cinematic stress inducers His study found that stress could be induced by cinema in segments of the general population and Jaws specifically caused stress reactions in its viewers While Johnson could not find an exact cause for the stress response in viewers whether it be the suspense the gore or the music production a study by G Sparks found that particularly violent films including Jaws tended to cause the most intense reactions in viewers br br br Release br br br Marketing br Universal spent million marketing Jaws including an unprecedented on national television spot advertising The media blitz included about two dozen second advertisements airing each night on prime time network TV between June and the film s opening two days later Beyond that in the description of film industry scholar Searle Kochberg Universal devised and co ordinated a highly innovative plan for the picture s marketing As early as October Zanuck Brown and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the film The centerpieces of the joint marketing strategy were John Williams s theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer The poster was based on the paperback s cover and had the same artist Bantam employee Roger Kastel The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster principal Tony Seiniger explained that no matter what we did it didn t look scary enough Seiniger ultimately decided that you had to actually go underneath the shark so you could see his teeth br More merchandise was created to take advantage of the film s release In Graeme Turner wrote that Jaws was accompanied by what was probably the most elaborate array of tie ins including a sound track album T shirts plastic tumblers a book about the making of the movie the book the movie was based on beach towels blankets shark costumes toy sharks hobby kits iron on transfers games posters shark s tooth necklaces sleepwear water pistols and more The Ideal Toy Company for instance produced a game in which the player had to use a hook to fish out items from the shark s mouth before the jaws closed br br br Theatrical run br The glowing audience response to a rough cut of the film at two test screenings in Dallas on March and one in Long Beach on March along with the success of Benchley s novel and the early stages of Universal s marketing campaign generated great interest among theater owners facilitating the studio s plan to debut Jaws at hundreds of cinemas simultaneously A third and final preview screening of a cut incorporating changes inspired by the previous presentations was held in Hollywood on April After Universal chairman Lew Wasserman attended one of the screenings he ordered the film s initial release planned for a massive total of as many as theaters to be cut down declaring I want this picture to run all summer long I don t want people in Palm Springs to see the picture in Palm Springs I want them to have to get in their cars and drive to see it in Hollywood Nonetheless the several hundred theaters that were still booked for the opening represented what was then an unusually wide release At the time wide openings were associated with movies of doubtful quality not uncommon on the grindhouse and exploitation side of the industry they were customarily employed to diminish the effect of negative reviews and word of mouth There had been some recent exceptions including the rerelease of Billy Jack and the original release of its sequel The Trial of Billy Jack the Dirty Harry sequel Magnum Force and the latest installments in the James Bond series Still the typical major studio film release at the time involved opening at a few big city theaters which allowed for a series of premieres Distributors would then slowly forward prints to additional locales across the country capitalizing on any positive critical or audience response The outsized success of The Godfather in had sparked a trend toward wider releases but even that film had debuted in just five theaters before going wide in its second weekend br On June Jaws opened across North America on screens in the United States the remainder in Canada The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movie s then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard of at the time A month earlier Columbia Pictures had done something similar with a Charles Bronson thriller Breakout though that film s prospects for an extended run were much slimmer and it is today a common misconception that Jaws was the first to use an ad saturation strategy Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow scaled release Building on the film s success the release was subsequently expanded on July to nearly theaters and on August to more than Overseas distribution followed the same pattern with intensive television campaigns and wide releases in Great Britain for instance Jaws opened in December at more than theaters br For its th anniversary the film was released in selected theaters across approximately theaters in the United States on Sunday June and Wednesday June br Another theatrical reissue was released on September with the film debuting in both IMAX and RealD D formats as part of the th anniversary celebration of another Spielberg film E T the Extra Terrestrial On the announcement Travis Reed of RealD D remarked Jaws redefined what it means to be a summer event blockbuster and now for the first time ever audiences can experience Steven Spielberg s motion picture classic in D allowing fans a completely new opportunity to immerse themselves in one of the greatest summer suspense thrillers of all time br br br Reception br br br Box office br Jaws opened in theaters with a record million weekend and grossed a record in its first days recouping its production costs It grossed million in its first days from playdates In just days it overtook The Godfather as the highest grossing film at the North American box office sailing past that picture s earnings of million and became the first film to earn

the second biggest British TV audience ever for a feature film behind Live and Let Die br br br Critical reception br Jaws received mostly positive reviews upon release Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film four stars calling it a sensationally effective action picture a scary thriller that works all the better because it s populated with characters that have been developed into human beings It s a film that s as frightening as The Exorcist and yet it s a nicer kind of fright somehow more fun because we re being scared by an outdoor adventure saga instead of a brimstone and vomit devil Variety s A D Murphy praised Spielberg s directorial skills and called Robert Shaw s performance absolutely magnificent According to The New Yorker s Pauline Kael it was the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made with more zest than an early Woody Allen picture a lot more electricity and it s funny in a Woody Allen sort of way For New Times magazine Frank Rich wrote Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen It speaks well of this director s gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don t even see the shark Writing for New York magazine Judith Crist described the film as an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order and complimented its acting and extraordinary technical achievements Rex Reed praised the nerve frying action scenes and concluded that for the most part Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department David Thomson wrote that like Coppola on The Godfather Spielberg asserted his own role and deftly organized the elements of a roller coaster entertainment without sacrificing inner meanings The suspense of the picture came from meticulous technique and good humor about its own surgical cutting You have only to submit to the travesty of Jaws to realize how much more engagingly Spielberg saw the ocean the perils the sinister beauty of the shark and the vitality of its human opponents br Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote It s a measure of how the film operates that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark s victims In the best films characters are revealed in terms of the action In movies like Jaws characters are simply functions of the action like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it s necessary He did describe it as the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun Los Angeles Times critic Charles Champlin disagreed with the film s PG rating saying that Jaws is too gruesome for children and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age It is a coarse grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact Ashore it is a bore awkwardly staged and lumpily written Marcia Magill of Films in Review said that while Jaws is eminently worth seeing for its second half she felt that before the protagonists pursuit of the shark the film was often flawed by its busyness William S Pechter of Commentary described Jaws as a mind numbing repast for sense sated gluttons and filmmaking of this essentially manipulative sort Molly Haskell of The Village Voice similarly characterized it as a scare machine that works with computer like precision You feel like a rat being given shock therapy The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist Magill declared that the programmed shark has one truly phony close up and in online reviewer James Berardinelli said that if not for Spielberg s deftly suspenseful direction we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature Halliwell s Film Guide stated that despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over abundance of dialogue and when it finally appears a pretty unconvincing monster br br br Accolades br Jaws won three Academy Awards those being for Best Film Editing Best Original Dramatic Score and Best Sound Robert Hoyt Roger Heman Earl Madery and John Carter It was also nominated for Best Picture losing to One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest Spielberg greatly resented the fact that he was not nominated for Best Director

by the Writers Guild of America In the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed the film as the eighth best edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership br Jaws was key in establishing the benefits of a wide national release backed by heavy television advertising rather than the traditional progressive release in which a film slowly entered new markets and built support over time Saturation booking in which a film opens simultaneously at thousands of theaters and massive media buys are now commonplace for the major Hollywood studios According to Peter Biskind Jaws diminished the importance of print reviews making it virtually impossible for a film to build slowly finding its audience by dint of mere quality Moreover Jaws whet corporate appetites for big profits quickly which is to say studios wanted every film to be Jaws Scholar Thomas Schatz writes that it recalibrated the profit potential of the Hollywood hit and redefined its status as a marketable commodity and cultural phenomenon as well The film brought an emphatic end to Hollywood s five year recession while ushering in an era of high cost high tech high speed thrillers br Jaws also played a major part in establishing summer as the prime season for the release of studios biggest box office contenders their intended blockbusters winter had long been the time when most hoped for hits were distributed while summer was largely reserved for dumping films thought likely to be poor performers Jaws and Star Wars are regarded as marking the beginning of the new U S film industry business model dominated by high concept pictures with premises that can be easily described and marketed as well as the beginning of the end of the New Hollywood period which saw auteur films increasingly disregarded in favor of profitable big budget pictures The New Hollywood era was defined by the relative autonomy filmmakers were able to attain within the major studio system in Biskind s description Spielberg was the Trojan horse through which the studios began to reassert their power br The film had broader cultural repercussions as well Similar to the way the pivotal scene in s Psycho made showers a new source of anxiety Jaws led many viewers to fear going into the ocean Reduced beach attendance in was attributed to it as well as more reported shark sightings It is still seen as responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about sharks and their behavior and for producing the so called Jaws effect which allegedly inspired legions of fishermen who piled into boats and killed thousands of the ocean predators in shark fishing tournaments Benchley would later campaign to stop the depopulation of sharks saying that Jaws was entirely a fiction Spielberg later echoed this sentiment saying that he regretted the decimation of the shark population because of the book and the film Conservation groups have bemoaned the fact that the film has made it considerably harder to convince the public that sharks should be protected br Jaws set the template for many subsequent horror films to the extent that the script for Ridley Scott s science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as Jaws in space Many films based on man eating animals usually aquatic were released through the s and s such as Orca Grizzly Mako The Jaws of Death Barracuda Alligator Day of the Animals Tintorera and Eaten Alive Spielberg declared Piranha directed by Joe Dante and written by John Sayles the best of the Jaws ripoffs Among the various foreign mockbusters based on Jaws three came from Italy Great White which inspired a plagiarism lawsuit by Universal and was even marketed in some countries as a part of the Jaws franchise Monster Shark featured in Mystery Science Theater under the title Devil Fish and Deep Blood which blends in a supernatural element The Brazilian film Bacalhau parodies Jaws featuring a killer cod in place of a shark The Japanese horror film Psycho Shark was released in the United States as Jaws in Japan Filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki cited Jaws and Spielberg as an influence for his Japanese kaiju film Godzilla Minus One br Richard Dreyfuss made a cameo appearance in the film Piranha D a loose remake of the film Dreyfuss plays Matt Boyd a fisherman who is the first victim of the title creatures Dreyfuss later stated that his character was a parody

cheap carny trick Nonetheless he did consider taking on the first sequel when its original director John D Hancock was fired a few days into the shoot ultimately his obligations to Close Encounters of
