the fields include children as part of the May Day celebrations teach children of the phallic association of the maypole and place toads in their mouths to cure sore throats The islanders appear to be trying to thwart his investigation by claiming that Rowan never existed br While staying at the Green Man Inn the landlord s daughter attempts to seduce Howie but he resists explaining that he is engaged and saving himself for marriage He notices a series of photographs celebrating the annual harvest each featuring a young girl as the May Queen The photograph of the most recent celebration is missing the landlord tells him it was broken At the local school Howie asks the students about Rowan but all deny her existence He checks the school register and finds Rowan s name He questions the schoolteacher who directs him to Rowan s grave br The next day April Howie meets the island s leader Lord Summerisle grandson of a Victorian agronomist to get permission for an exhumation Summerisle explains that his grandfather developed strains of fruit trees that would prosper in Scotland s climate and encouraged the belief that the old gods would use the new strains to bring prosperity to the island among the pagan population Due to the bountiful harvests the island s other inhabitants gradually embraced paganism br Exhuming the grave Howie finds that the coffin contains only the carcass of a hare He also finds the missing harvest photograph showing Rowan standing amidst empty boxes the harvest had failed His research reveals that a human sacrifice is offered to the gods in the event of crop failure He concludes that Rowan is alive and will soon be sacrificed to ensure a successful harvest br The following morning on May Day Howie seeks assistance from the mainland and returns to

villagers will turn on Summerisle and sacrifice him next summer when the next harvest fails again but his pleas are ignored The villagers force Howie inside a giant wicker man statue along with various animals set it ablaze and surround it singing the Middle English folk song Sumer Is Icumen In Inside the wicker man Howie recites Psalm and prays to God Howie and the animals burn to death as the head of the wicker man collapses in flames revealing the setting sun br br br Cast br br br Production br br br Background br br In the early s Christopher Lee was a Hammer Horror regular best known for his roles in a series of successful films beginning with The Curse of Frankenstein as the monster Lee wanted to break free of this image and take on more interesting acting roles The idea for The Wicker Man film began in when Lee met with screenwriter Anthony Shaffer and they agreed to work together Film director Robin Hardy and British Lion head Peter Snell became involved in the project Shaffer had a series of conversations with Hardy and the two decided that making a horror film centring on old religion would be fun in sharp contrast to the Hammer films they had both seen as horror film fans br Shaffer read the David Pinner novel Ritual in which a devout Christian policeman is called to investigate what appears to be the ritual murder of a young girl in a rural village and decided that it would serve well as the source material for the project Pinner had originally written Ritual as a film treatment for director Michael Winner who had John Hurt in mind as a possible star Winner eventually declined the project so Pinner s agent persuaded him to write Ritual as a novel instead Shaffer and Lee paid Pinner equivalent to in for the rights to the novel and Shaffer set to work on the screenplay He soon decided that a direct adaptation would not work well so drafted a new story based only loosely on the story of the novel br Shaffer wanted the film to be a little more literate than the average horror picture He specifically wanted a film with a minimum of violence and gore He was tired of seeing horror films that relied almost entirely on viscera to be scary The focus of the film was crystallised when he finally hit upon the abstract concept of sacrifice The image of the wicker man which gave the filmmakers their title was taken from the description of the practice of human sacrifice by the Gauls in Julius Caesar s Commentaries on the Gallic War Others have figures of vast size the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with living men which being set on fire the men perish enveloped in the flames For Shaffer this was the most alarming and imposing image that I had ever seen The idea of a confrontation between a modern Christian and a remote pagan community continued to intrigue Shaffer who performed painstaking research on paganism Brainstorming with Hardy they conceived the film as presenting the pagan elements objectively and accurately accompanied by authentic music and a believable contemporary setting One of their main resources was The Golden Bough a study of mythology and religion written by Scottish anthropologist James Frazer br br br Casting br Television actor Edward Woodward was cast in the role of Sergeant Neil Howie after the part was declined by both Michael York and David Hemmings In Britain Woodward was best known for the role of Callan which he played from to After The Wicker Man Woodward went on to receive international attention for his roles in the film Breaker Morant and the s TV series The Equalizer br After Shaffer saw her on the stage he lured Diane Cilento out of semi retirement to play the town s schoolmistress They lived together in Queensland from and married in Ingrid Pitt another British horror film veteran was cast as the town librarian and registrar Swedish actress Britt Ekland was cast as the innkeeper s lascivious daughter although two body doubles were used for her naked scenes below the waist Ekland found out that she was three months pregnant with her son Nic to Lou Adler two weeks into filming Stuart Hopps the film s choreographer called upon Lorraine Peters a nightclub dancer from Glasgow who gyrated at the doorway and against the wall of a bedroom in the fully nude wall scenes Her speaking and singing voices were dubbed by Annie Ross and Rachel Verney respectively br Local girl Jane Jackson was employed as Ekland s stand in for camera setups Jackson was blond haired and bore a resemblance to Ekland but was otherwise not involved in any filming br br br Filming br br The film was produced at a time of crisis for the British film industry The studio in charge of production British Lion Films was in financial trouble and was bought by wealthy businessman John Bentley To convince the unions that he was not about to asset strip the company Bentley needed to get a film into production quickly This meant that although The Wicker Man was set in spring filming actually began in October artificial leaves and blossoms had to be glued to trees in many scenes The production was kept on a small budget Christopher Lee was extremely keen to get the film made he and others worked on the production without pay While filming took place British Lion was bought by EMI Films br The film was shot almost entirely in the small Scottish towns of Stranraer Gatehouse of Fleet Newton Stewart Kirkcudbright Anwoth and Creetown in Galloway as well as Plockton in Ross shire Some scenes were filmed in and around the Isle of Whithorn where the owners of the castle Elizabeth McAdam McLaughland and David Wheatley plus several other local people featured in various scenes Culzean Castle in Ayrshire and its grounds and Floors Castle in Roxburghshire were also used for the shooting Some of the opening flying shots feature the Isle of Skye including the pinnacles of The Storr and the Quiraing The interior cave scenes were filmed inside Wookey Hole in Somerset Hush Heath Estate in Staplehurst Kent makes a brief appearance in the film doubling as Lord Summerisle s orchard and gardens The climax of the film was shot at St Ninian s Cave and on the clifftops at Burrow Head in Wigtownshire br The amphibious aircraft that carries Sergeant Howie was a Thurston Teal owned and flown in the aerial sequences by Christopher Murphy br According to Britt Ekland some animals perished in the wicker man whereas Robin Hardy said in an interview that great care was taken to ensure that the animals were in no danger of being hurt during this scene and that they were not inside the wicker man when it was set on fire br br br Music br br The score was arranged recorded and part composed by Paul Giovanni According to Seamus Flannery in a subsequent documentary director Robin Hardy surprised the cast by suddenly announcing midway through filming that they were making a musical and performed by Magnet in some versions of the film credited as Lodestone the soundtrack contains folk songs performed by characters in the film Included are traditional songs original compositions by Giovanni and even a nursery rhyme Baa Baa Black Sheep br Willow s Song has been covered or sampled by various rock music bands It was first covered by an English musical project known as Nature and Organisation on their release Beauty Reaps the Blood of Solitude It was covered by Sneaker Pimps as How Do and is included on their release Becoming X How Do can be heard in the movie Hostel credited in the end titles as being composed by Sneaker Pimps Additionally the band has covered Gently Johnny as Johnny it is featured as a B side on their single Roll On It also was covered by Faith and the Muse on their album The Burning Season and The Mock Turtles on their album Turtle Soup br The songs on the soundtrack were composed or arranged by Giovanni under the direction of Hardy and Shaffer whose research into the oral folk tradition in England and Scotland was based largely on the work of Cecil Sharp a founding father of the folk revival movement of the early th century Using Sharp s collections as a template Shaffer noted to Giovanni which scenes were to have music and in some cases provided lyrics which would be appropriate to spring pagan festivals Other songs on the soundtrack come from a later folk tradition for example Corn Riggs by Scotland s national bard Robert Burns accompanies Howie s arrival on Summerisle The lyrics of this song were taken directly from the Burns song The Rigs of Barley but Giovanni used a very different tune Burns tune was based on Corn Riggs and altered to match his lyrics The song sung by the cultists of Summerisle at the end of the film Sumer Is Icumen In is a mid th century song about nature in spring br The Wickerman Festival was an annual music festival held near Auchencairn in Galloway Dubbed Scotland s Alternative Music festival it began in when the festival s artistic director Sid Ambrose hit upon the idea of a local counterculture based family friendly festival due to the surrounding area being inextricably linked with various locations used within The Wicker Man It was held annually until at East Kirkcarswell Farm Dundrennan br br br Distribution br By the time of the film s completion the studio had been bought by EMI and British Lion was managed by Michael Deeley The DVD commentary track states that studio executives suggested a more upbeat ending to the film in which a sudden rain puts the flames of the wicker man out and spares Howie s life but this suggestion was refused Hardy subsequently had to remove about minutes of scenes on the mainland early investigations and to Lee s disappointment some of Lord Summerisle s initial meeting with Howie br br br Original release br The first screening of the film was to trade and cinema distributors on December The first public theatrical release was a week of test screenings at the Metropole

the M motorway Hardy recalled that a copy of the film made prior to Deeley s cuts was sent to Roger Corman who it turned out still had it possibly the only existing print of Hardy s original cut The US rights had been sold by Warner Bros to a small firm called Abraxas managed by film buff Stirling Smith and critic John Alan Simon Stirling agreed to an American release of a reconstruction by Hardy

the film StudioCanal began a Facebook campaign in to find missing material which culminated in the discovery of a minute mm print at the Harvard Film Archive This print had previously been known as the Middle Version and was itself assembled from a mm print of the original edit Robin Hardy had made in the United Kingdom in but which was never released Robin Hardy believed that the original edit will probably never be found saying Sadly it seems as though this has been lost forever However I am delighted that a Abraxas print has been found as I also put together this cut myself and it
