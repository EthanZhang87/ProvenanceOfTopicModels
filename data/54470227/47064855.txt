Wyoming forest where a wolf is exposed to the pathogen br Primatologist Davis Okoye a former Special Forces soldier and member of an anti poaching unit works at the San Diego Wildlife Sanctuary He has befriended a rare albino western lowland gorilla named George that he saved from poachers who killed his mother and communicates with him using sign language One of the canisters crash lands in George s habitat and he is exposed to the pathogen br As George grows considerably larger and becomes more aggressive Davis is contacted by genetic engineer Doctor Kate Caldwell who explains that the pathogen was developed by Energyne to rewrite genes on a massive scale She had hoped to advance research on CRISPR as a potential cure for diseases but discovered Energyne s plans to use it as a biological weapon and was falsely incarcerated during which her terminally ill brother died George escapes from captivity and goes on a rampage at the preserve George calms down but is soon captured by a government team led by Agent Harvey Russell and put on a Boeing C Globemaster III airplane Meanwhile Claire and her brother Brett oversee a mercenary team s attempt to capture the mutated wolf Ralph which goes awry and the entire team is slaughtered br Claire hoping to capture Ralph and use George to cover up her plot uses a massive transmitter atop the Willis Tower to lure the animals

to the top of the tower Claire orders Davis to distract it while she attempts to escape with Kate at gunpoint Kate slips a vial into Claire s handbag and pushes her toward George who swallows her whole along with the vial returning him to his former personality Down below Russell takes incriminating evidence from Brett who is then crushed to death by falling debris As the damaged tower topples

MOAB against them George battles against Ralph whom Davis tricks into advancing towards Lizzie who decapitates him using her jaws and swallowing his head Lizzie chases Davis but George intervenes in

the arcade game Rampage in as part of their acquisition of Midway Games for million The project was announced in November with John Rickard set as a producer Rickard said that he decided to work on the movie by searching the list of titles to which Warner held the adapting rights and upon finding Rampage remembering playing the arcade game In June Dwayne Johnson was set to star re teaming with New Line and producer Beau Flynn while the studio was looking for a director to start production in mid Johnson mentioned that he loved the game as a child playing the arcade game in a pool hall and later owning it on the Nintendo Entertainment System During the search for a script writers offered many takes including a faithful one to the game where the monsters were mutated humans before the

who he pulls out of a building he punched and Claire is devoured while wearing a red dress just as the woman featured in the arcade s opening screen br br The visual effects were primarily provided by Weta Digital Effects supervisor Erik Winquist and a small crew travelled to Chicago to create a model of the Chicago Loop that would be destroyed in the climactic battle learning the building materials and architecture styles Up to photographs were taken with D scanners while motion cameras covered downtown Chicago As reference for the building destruction the artists studied both the World Trade Center collapse from and implosions of buildings affected by the Kaik ura earthquake in Weta s hometown of Wellington One of the more challenging aspects for Weta was figuring out how the weight and mass of the monsters would affect the city environment and destruction br Given Weta had plenty of experience creating animated apes in King Kong and Rise of the Planet of the Apes and its sequels Dawn and War it helped the studio create George in a much shorter time than it may have years ago according to Winquist Motion capture coach Terry Notary even took a break from Avengers Infinity War which was also filmed in Atlanta to help Jason Liles in his performance as George On the other hand the lack of motion capture for Ralph and Lizzie let the animators go loose with how these monsters were portrayed such as a wolf that has porcupine spines and wings br Other VFX companies like Hydraulx Scanline VFX and UPP contributed to the film br br The music was composed by

the movie claiming it s a stupid movie but one that s good at what it s supposed to be and honest about not being any more than that br Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film out of stars reviewing Rampage is a drag Three times during the thing I wrote down the phrase NO FUN with increasingly impatient underlines In an article for The Hollywood Reporter Nick Allen wrote about what he called the film s disastrous tone saying that despite the Rampage arcade cabinets being constantly visible in its villains headquarters director Brad Peyton s live action adaptation comes off as too emotionally glib and mean spirited even for a mega budget B movie br Empire described it as quintessential Johnson project it sounds like a dreadful basis for a movie And it sort of is but it s also sort of a lot of fun Empire notes that the film is not as tongue in cheek as viewers might expect concluding that Rampage is big dumb fun but not as big dumb and fun as it could have been br br
