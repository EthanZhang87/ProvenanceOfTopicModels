witches begin to levitate and Thomasin joins them laughing as she ascends above the trees br br br Cast br br br Production br br br Development br Eggers who lived in New Hampshire was inspired to write the film by his childhood fascination with witches and frequent visits to the Plimoth Plantation as a schoolboy After unsuccessfully pitching films that were too weird too obscure Eggers realized that he would have to make a more conventional film He said at a Q A If I m going to make a genre film it has to be personal and it has to be good Director Alfonso Cuar n read the screenplay in saying it made him more than anything curious The production team worked extensively with British and American museums as well as consulting experts on th century British agriculture Eggers wanted the set constructed to be as historically accurate as possible and therefore brought in a thatcher and a carpenter from Virginia and Massachusetts respectively who had the proper experience building in the style of the film s period br Although Eggers wanted to film the picture on location in New England the lack of tax incentives meant he had to settle for Canada This proved to be something of a problem for him because he could not find the forest environment he was looking for in the country He eventually began scouting off the map and found a suitable location Kiosk Ontario that was extremely remote he said that the nearest town made New Hampshire look like a metropolis br The casting took place in England as Eggers wanted authentic accents to represent a family newly arrived in colonial Plymouth br br br Filming br To give the film an authentic look Eggers shot only with natural light and indoors the only lighting was candles He also chose to stylize the film s title as The VVitch with two V s instead of a W in the title sequence and on posters stating that he found this spelling in a Jacobean era pamphlet on witchcraft among other period texts br In December costume designer Linda Muir joined the crew and consulted books in the Clothes of the Common People in Elizabethan and Early Stuart England series to plan the costumes which were made with wool linen and hemp She also lobbied for a larger costume budget br A troupe of Butoh dancers played the coven of witches at the end of the film creating their own choreography br br br Music br Mark Korven wrote the film s score which aimed to be tense and dissonant while focusing on minimalism Eggers vetoed the use of any electronic instruments and didn t want any traditional harmony or melody in the score so Korven chose to create music with atypical instruments including the nyckelharpa and waterphone He knew the director liked to retain a degree of creative control so he relied on loose play centered on improvisation so that Eggers could move notes around whenever he wanted br br br Track listing br br br Themes br According to analysts the film s impact is delivered not through scares but by the effect of ambience and scenography This is stylistically represented by the film s use of expressionist lighting the use of different kinds of camera to draw thematic limits the editing employed to hide horror from the main sight and the soundtrack s sonic dissonance accompanying instrumental scenes Samuel s physically impossible disappearance at the beginning of the film introduces the viewer to the film s atmosphere br br The film s plot orbits around a psychological conflict using a repressive patriarchal portrayal of Puritan society and the dark murderous liberation of the witches The main female character Thomasin harbors worldly desires that differ from those of her conventionally Christian family yearning for independence sexuality acceptance and power While her father and the Christian God fail to fulfill her needs Satan speaks personally to her offering earthly satisfaction Therefore with the demise of her family and the rejection of the Puritan society Thomasin joins Satan and the witches her only alternative in order to find her long desired control over her own life Her nudity in the last scene reflects her act of casting off the bonds of her previous society br The difference between both options nevertheless is rendered blurred by an evocation of equal religious extremism This is first felt in the architecture of the family s own home which ironically resembles an archetypal witch s cottage itself hinting at the gradual reveal that evil is already installed in them On the opposite side Satan s temptation of Thomasin also acquires traits of ideological grooming slowly alienating her from her family At the end despite her newfound cause and ecstatic laugh at the coven Thomasin has not escaped her previous religiosity but merely changed its direction turning to murder in exchange for freedom br The symbolic conflict between civilization and nature is also present in all the aspects of the film The family lives next to a dark forest a place tied to witchcraft in their culture which underlines the conflict between their civilized patriarchal religion and the Gothic wild natural world that surrounds them The forest as well as the state of nudity are associated with monstrosity with the untamed wilderness where forbidden liberation and sexuality emerge Accordingly Caleb returns nude after being seduced by the witch the witches themselves perform their acts while naked and Thomasin eventually adopts this code upon joining them At the end of the film nature triumphs over its adversary with the Pan like Black Phillip goring the axe wielding William in a metaphor for man being consumed by the wild br br br Release br The film had its world premiere on January at the Sundance Film Festival It was screened on September in

Variety Justin Chang commented that A fiercely committed ensemble and an exquisite sense of historical detail conspire to cast a highly atmospheric spell in The Witch a strikingly achieved tale of a mid th century New England family s steady descent into religious hysteria and madness Yohana Desta of Mashable stated that The Witch is a stunningly crafted experience that ll have you seeking out a church as soon as you leave the theater Peter Travers in his Rolling Stone review gave the film stars and wrote of the film Building his film on the diabolical aftershocks of Puritan repression Eggers raises The Witch far above the horror herd He doesn t need cheap tricks Eggers merely directs us to look inside Stephanie Zacharek summarized the movie in Time as a triumph of tone writing that Although Eggers is extremely discreet the things you don t see are more horrifying than those you do the picture s relentlessness sometimes feels like torment Gregory Wakeman writing for CinemaBlend gave it five out of five stars writing that its acting lighting music writing production design cinematography editing and direction all immediately impress While at the same time they combine to create an innately bewitching tale that keeps you on tenterhooks all the way up until its grandiose but enthralling finale Ann Hornaday wrote in The Washington Post that the film joins the ranks of horror films such as The Exorcist The Omen and Rosemary s Baby saying that The Witch comports itself less like an imitator of those classics than their progenitor which is a tribute to a filmmaker who despite his newcomer status seems to have arrived in the full throes of maturity in full control of his prodigious powers Writing for Best of Netflix Debiparna Chakraborty praised the narrative saying The Witch is a mesmerising exploration of the mundane horrors often spawned by barren isolation and religious fervour Independent filmmaker Jay Bauman of RedLetterMedia named it his favorite film of enthusiastically stating I love it I think it s a masterpiece It s a first time filmmaker which is shocking to me because it feels like it s made by someone who s been making movies for decades who s a master of their craft br However some critics as well as audiences were less pleased with the film Ethan Sacks of the New York Daily News wrote that the film does not suffer from the cinematography acting or setting and early on it seems that The Witch is tapping a higher metaphor for coming of age or religious intolerance or man s uneasy balance with nature or something It doesn t take long into the film s hour and a half running time however to break that spell Critics noted that the film received backlash from audiences regarding its themes and slow approach to horror Lesley Coffin criticized A saying it was a huge mistake to market The Witch as a terrifying horror film br br Not because it doesn t fit into the genre of horror but because of the power of expectations The less you know about this movie the better your experience will be but everyone who saw it opening weekend probably walked in with too much knowledge and hype to really get as much out of it as they could have if the film had the veil of mystery br HitFix writer Chris Eggertson blamed mainstream Hollywood more generally for the unenthusiastic response of some audiences saying that The Witch got under his skin profoundly but it did not have the moment to moment audience pleasing shocks that moviegoers have become accustomed to thanks to movies like Sinister and The Purge and Paranormal Activity and every other Blumhouse and Platinum Dunes title in the canon br Horror authors Stephen King and Brian Keene both reacted positively to the film King tweeted significant praise for the film writing The Witch scared the hell out of me And it s a real movie tense and thought provoking as well as visceral On social media Keene stated The Witch is a gorgeous thoughtful scary horror film that of the people in the theater with you will be too stupid to understand br br br Religious br Julia Alexander of Polygon wrote that The Witch asks people to try and understand what life would have been like for a family of devout Christians living in solitude terrified of what may happen if they go against the word of God In The Atlantic Alissa Wilkinson stated that many films featured at the Sundance Film Festival The Witch along with Last Days in the Desert Don Verdean and I Am Michael reveal a resurgence of interest in the religious and described The Witch as a chilling circa story of the devil taking over a devout Scripture quoting family Eve Tushnet commented in an article in TAC which was also published in First Things that The Witch s view of witchcraft is not revisionist and further said the film is pervaded by the fear of God There are occasional references to His mercy but only as something to beg for not something to trust in br A review by Adam R Holz in Plugged In a publication of the conservative Christian organisation Focus on the Family heavily criticised the film stating that br br William is absolutely devoted to leading his family in holiness and the ways of the Lord which should be a good thing But the fruit of William s rigorous focus on dogmatic piety isn t a lifting of burdens which we re told should happen in Matthew or a joyful celebration of living life to the fullest as is referenced in John rather it is deep fear and morbid meditations on hell damnation and the forces of spiritual darkness br Josh Larsen of Think Christian however offered a different Christian explanation of the conclusion of the film writing When it comes to encountering evil the family in the film veers wildly back and forth between triumphalism and defeatism two theological extremes and in refusing to allow for grace they become easy pickings for the witch br Emily VanDerWerff of Vox wrote br br A could have just as easily courted the approval of say theologians who have a fondness for Calvinism The Witch takes place in Colonial America and it unfolds from the perspective of period Christians who genuinely believe the woods around their tiny farm contain some sort of evil supernatural being and are ultimately proved correct br br br Accolades br br br See also br Witch trials in the early modern period br br br br br br External links br br
