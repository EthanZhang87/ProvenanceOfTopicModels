latter part of From Dusk till Dawn is so relentless that it s as if a spigot has been turned on and then broken Though some of the tricks are entertainingly staged the film loses its clever edge when its action heats up so gruesomely and exploitatively that there s no time for talk br Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote Rodriguez and Tarantino have taken the let em eat trash cynicism of modern corporate moviemaking and repackaged it as junk conscious attitude In From Dusk till Dawn they put on such a show of cooking up popcorn that they make pandering to the audience seem hip However in his review for The Washington Post Desson Howe wrote The movie which treats you with contempt for even watching it is a monument to its own lack of imagination It s a triumph of vile over content mindless nihilism posing as hipness br Cinefantastique magazine s Steve Biodrowski wrote Whereas one might reasonably have expected that the combo of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez would yield a critical mass of nuclear proportions instead of an atomic fireball s worth of entertainment we get a long fuse quite a bit of fizzle and a rather minor blast In his
