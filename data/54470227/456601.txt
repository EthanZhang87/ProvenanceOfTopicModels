telepod to understand the makeup of living tissue and he successfully teleports a second baboon Ronnie departs before they can celebrate and Seth worries that she is rekindling her relationship with her editor Stathis Borans in reality Ronnie has left to confront Stathis about a veiled threat spurred by his jealousy of Seth to publish the telepod story without her consent Seth teleports himself alone unaware that a housefly has slipped inside the transmitter pod with him He emerges from the receiving pod seemingly normal br Seth and Ronnie reconcile Seth exhibits increased strength stamina and sexual potency which he believes is a result of the teleportation purifying his body He has sugar cravings and Ronnie is concerned about Seth s deteriorating sanity and also the strange bristly hairs growing from a wound on his back Seth becomes arrogant and violent insisting that the teleportation process is beneficial and tries to force Ronnie to undergo teleportation When she refuses he abandons her goes to a bar and partakes in an arm wrestling match where he leaves his opponent with a compound fracture He meets a woman named Tawny and brings her back to his warehouse They have intercourse and Seth tries to coerce her into teleporting Ronnie rescues her from teleportation Seth throws Ronnie out but when his fingernails begin falling off he realizes something went wrong during his teleportation He checks his computer s records and discovers that the telepod computer confused by the presence of two lifeforms in the sending pod fused him with the fly at the molecular genetic level br Seth continues to deteriorate losing body parts and becoming less human in appearance After several weeks of being too scared to contact Ronnie he reconnects with her and says he is becoming a hybrid of human and insect He has nicknamed this Brundlefly He has also begun vomiting digestive enzymes onto his food to dissolve it and has gained the ability to cling to walls and ceilings He realizes he is losing his human reason and compassion driven by primitive impulses he cannot control br Seth installs a fusion program into the telepod computer planning to dilute the fly genes in his body with human DNA Ronnie learns that she is pregnant by Seth and has a nightmare of giving birth to a giant maggot She has Stathis persuade a doctor to perform an abortion in the middle of the night Having overheard their conversation Seth abducts Ronnie before the abortion can take place and begs her to carry the child to term since it may be the last remnant of his humanity Stathis breaks into Seth s lab with a shotgun but Seth disfigures him with his corrosive vomit br Seth reveals his desperate plan to Ronnie he will use the telepods to fuse himself and her together with their unborn child into one entity As Seth drags her into one of the telepods she accidentally rips off his jaw triggering his final transformation into an insectoid human creature which bursts from Seth s decayed human skin It traps Ronnie inside the first telepod and enters the other The wounded Stathis uses his shotgun to sever the cables connecting Ronnie s telepod to the computer allowing Ronnie to escape Breaking out of its own pod just as the fusion process is activated the creature is gruesomely fused with the metal door and cabling of telepod As the deformed creature crawls out of the receiving pod it silently begs Ronnie to end its suffering and she tearfully shoots it br br br Cast br br br Production br br br Preproduction br In the early s co producer Kip Ohman approached screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue with the idea of remaking the classic science fiction horror film The Fly Pogue began by reading George Langelaan s short story and then watching the original film which he had never seen Deciding that this was a project in which he was interested he talked with producer Stuart Cornfeld about setting up the production and Cornfeld very quickly agreed The duo then pitched the idea to executives at th Century Fox and received an enthusiastic response and Pogue was given money to write a first draft screenplay He initially wrote an outline similar to that of Langelaan s story but both he and Cornfeld thought that it would be better to rework the material to focus on a gradual metamorphosis instead of an instantaneous monster However when executives read the script they were so unimpressed that they immediately withdrew from the project After some negotiation Cornfeld orchestrated a deal whereby Fox would agree to distribute the film if he could set up financing through another source br The new producer was Mel Brooks the film was to be produced by his company Brooksfilms Cornfeld was a frequent collaborator and friend of Brooks Cornfeld introduced Brooks to David Lynch through Eraserhead and they later produced Lynch s The Elephant Man Brooks would leave his name off the film s credits to avoid confusing viewers who might expect a Mel Brooks film to be a comedy Cornfeld gave the script to Brooks who liked it but felt that a different writer was needed Pogue was then removed from the project and Cornfeld hired Walon Green for a rewrite However Green s draft was not a step in the desired direction so Pogue was then sought to polish the material br At the same time Brooks and Cornfeld were trying to find a suitable director David Cronenberg was shown the script for The Fly by Marc Boyman who later produced Dead Ringers but Cronenberg was working on Total Recall at the time Cornfeld decided on a young British director named Robert Bierman after seeing one of his short films Bierman was flown to Los Angeles to meet with Pogue and the film was in the very early stages of preproduction when tragedy struck Bierman s family had been vacationing in South Africa and his daughter was killed in an accident Bierman boarded a plane to go to his family and Brooks and Cornfeld waited for a month before approaching him about resuming work on the picture Bierman told them that he was unable to start working so soon and Brooks told him that he would wait three months and contact him again At the end of the three months Bierman told him that he could not commit to the project Brooks told him that he understood and had him freed from his contract br br br Writing br Cronenberg s agent Mike Marcus informed Cronenberg after he left the Total Recall production that Mel Brooks was interested in The Fly Cronenberg agreed to sign on as director if he would be allowed to rewrite the script Cronenberg who watched the original film when it came out was critical of the initial script stating that I remember reading it and the first sixteen pages were awful Cronenberg was paid twice the amount that he was paid for directing The Dead Zone br Cronenberg stated that one line of dialogue from Chuck s script remained in the final version Despite the extensive rewrite of Pogue s script Cronenberg insisted during Writers Guild arbitrations that he and Pogue share screenplay credit since he felt that his version could not have come to pass without Pogue s script to serve as a foundation He did not meet with Pogue who liked the film until after the film was released br Pogue s version of the lead scientist was rather a dull clever techno guy just a boring handsome guy according to Cronenberg br br br Casting br Brooks wanted Pierce Brosnan to play the role of Seth Brundle but Cronenberg rejected the casting John Malkovich was the top choice for the role but he declined John Lithgow was also offered the role but turned it down stating it was too grotesque Michael Keaton and Richard Dreyfuss were also considered Jeff Goldblum was proposed for the lead by Cronenberg as Goldblum was willing to perform with prosthetic makeup unlike other proposed actors like Dreyfuss br Cornfeld opposed Geena Davis s casting due to her being Goldblum s real life girlfriend Cronenberg wanted Davis and Cornfeld made him look at other actresses but they were all disasters which even Cornfeld admitted Davis requested that Cronenberg play the gynecologist as she did not want a stranger performing the role br br br Filming br The film s budget was reported as million and million It was shot in Canada at the Kleinburg Studio in Toronto Chris Walas who worked on Scanners was hired to create the film s special effects Principal photography began on December in Toronto br The film s audio mixing was done in London as it was cheaper than Los Angeles The producers commissioned musician Bryan Ferry to record a song for the film for promotional purposes The resulting track was Help Me A music video was made for the song and footage from the film was prominently featured in it Cronenberg admitted to liking the song but he felt that it was inappropriate to the film itself Brooks and Cornfeld originally wanted to play the song over the closing credits but after Cronenberg screened it for them they agreed with the director that it did not mesh with the movie As a result the song is featured only briefly in the film in the background during the scene where Brundle challenges Marky in the bar Help Me became rather obscure as it was not included on the film s soundtrack release The song resurfaced in on the Roxy Music Bryan Ferry compact disc Ultimate Collection br The design of Brundle s telepods was inspired by the engine cylinder of Cronenberg s Ducati Desmo motorcycle br br br Deleted and alternate scenes br After filming ended early in a rough cut of The Fly was shown to Fox executives who were very impressed A rough cut was then previewed at Toronto s Uptown Theatre in the spring of that year Due to a strong audience reaction the graphic and infamous monkey cat sequence was cut from the film to make it easier for audiences to maintain sympathy for Brundle s character Another preview screening was subsequently held at the Fox lot in Los Angeles and this version featured the butterfly baby coda As before the screening results dictated that the scene be cut Another ending had Ronnie wake up next to Stathis who she is married to and is pregnant with his child but it was disliked by audiences according to Cronenberg br br br Makeup and creature effects br br The Academy Award winning makeup was designed and executed by Chris Walas Inc over a period of three months The final Brundlefly creature was designed first and then the various steps needed to carry protagonist Seth Brundle to that final incarnation were designed The transformation was intended to be a metaphor for the aging process To that end Brundle loses hair teeth and fingernails with his skin becoming more and more discolored and lumpy The intention of the filmmakers was to give Brundle a bruised and cancerous look that gets progressively worse as the character s altered genome slowly asserts itself with the final Brundlefly hybrid creature literally bursting out of Brundle s hideously deteriorated human skin The creature itself was designed to appear horribly asymmetrical and deformed and not at all a viable or robust organism br Various looks were tested for the makeup effects Some early test footage can be seen on the The Fly Collector s Edition DVD as well as the Blu ray release br The transformation was broken up into seven distinct stages with Jeff Goldblum spending many hours in the makeup chair for Brundle s later incarnations br br Stages and subtle rash like skin discoloration that leads to facial lesions and sores with tiny fly hairs dotting Goldblum s face in addition to the patch of fly hairs growing out of the wound on Brundle s back br Stages and A piecemeal prosthetics covering Goldblum s face and later his arms feet and torso wigs with bald spots and crooked prosthetic teeth beginning with stage A br Stage B deleted from the film but briefly appeared in the trailer this variant of stage was seen only in the monkey cat scene and required Goldblum to wear the first of two full body foam latex suits as Brundle has stopped wearing clothing at this point br Stage the second full body suit with more exaggerated deformities and which also required Goldblum to wear distorting contact lenses that made one eye look larger than the other br Stage the final Brundlefly creature referred to as the space bug by the film s crew depicted by various partial and full body cable and rod controlled puppets br Stage another puppet which represented the mortally injured Brundlefly Telepod fusion creature initially dubbed the Brundlebooth and later the Brundlething by the crew as seen in the film s final moments br br br Music br The score to The Fly was composed and conducted by Howard Shore and performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra It was released on record cassette and Compact Disc with three additional tracks exclusively included on the latter by Var se Sarabande and in it was remastered and reissued on a two disc

received universal acclaim based on a weighted average of out of from critic reviews On Rotten Tomatoes of reviews are positive for the film with an average rating of The website s critical consensus reads David Cronenberg combines his trademark affinity for gore and horror with strongly developed characters making The Fly a surprisingly affecting tragedy Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br After its release The Fly was described as a remake that surpasses the original and exceeds the potential of the original story Chicago Tribune called it a rare personal work of art that is also a commercial success Los Angeles Times hailed the film as a stunning piece of filmmaking that allowed the audience to identify with the monstrous creation Time wrote that The Fly is a shocking horror film and also the most touching romance film of the year Conversely Caryn James of The New York Times criticized the film for what she considered distractingly excessive gore lack of emotional depth and tonal inconsistency She felt that the film tries to be too many things at once and ultimately falls short despite Goldblum s performance and the ambitious vision of Cronenberg br br Cronenberg was surprised when The Fly was seen by some critics as a cultural metaphor specifically for AIDS since he originally intended the film to be a more general analogy for disease itself terminal conditions like cancer and more specifically the aging process If you or your lover has AIDS you watch that film and of course you ll see AIDS in it but you don t have to have that experience to respond emotionally to the movie and I think that s really its power This is not to say that AIDS didn t have an incredible impact on everyone and of course after a certain point people were seeing AIDS stories everywhere so I don t take any offense that people see that in my movie For me though there was something about The Fly story that was much more universal aging and death something all of us have to deal with br Film critic Gene Siskel named The Fly as the tenth best film of In Premiere and American Film magazines both conducted independent polls of American film critics directors and other such groups to determine the best films of the s and The Fly appeared on both lists br In Time magazine film critics Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel included The Fly in their list of the All TIME Greatest Movies Time later named it one of the best horror films The film was ranked on Bravo s Scariest Movie Moments Similarly the Chicago Film Critics Association named The Fly the nd scariest film ever made In The Daily Star ranked The Fly at the top of its list of greatest short story adaptations praising the film for exhibit ing how greater a short story can evolve and very much become its own detached barely recognisable thing br br br Accolades br The Fly was nominated for the awards in the chart below Many genre fans and film critics at the time thought that Jeff Goldblum s performance would receive a Best Actor Oscar nomination but this did not happen Gene Siskel subsequently stated that Goldblum most likely got stiffed out of a nomination because the older Academy voters generally do not honor horror films br br br Legacy br The quote Be afraid Be very afraid was also used as the film s marketing tagline and this became so ingrained in popular culture as it and variants have appeared in numerous films and TV series that many people who are familiar with the phrase are unaware that it originated in The Fly br On October the film was referenced in a Saturday Night Live sketch regarding the vice presidential debate Jim Carrey provided an impression of Jeff Goldblum br Heavy metal band Ice Nine Kills released F L Y as part of their album The Silver Scream Welcome to Horrorwood The song is inspired by the film br br br Other media br br br Sequel br br Whereas the original was followed by two sequels Cronenberg has said that the stories in his films have definitive beginnings and endings and he has never considered making a sequel to one of his own films although others have made sequels to Cronenberg films including Scanners br The Fly II was directed by Chris Walas the man behind the makeup and creature effects of both films and Gremlins It is a direct continuation of The Fly It features Veronica Quaife giving birth to Brundle s mutant son before dying and it focuses on the Bartok company s attempts to get the Telepods working again br David Cronenberg was not involved with the project The only actor to return for the sequel was John Getz as an embittered Stathis Borans Veronica Quaife appears briefly in the film She is played by Saffron Henderson since Geena Davis declined to reprise the role Jeff Goldblum appears in archival footage of Seth Brundle in two scenes including the post teleportation interview segment that was deleted from the first film br An early treatment for a sequel written by Tim Lucas involved Veronica Quaife dealing with the evils of the Bartok company Brundle s consciousness had somehow survived within the Telepod computer and the Bartok scientists had enslaved him and were using him to develop the system for cloning purposes Brundle becomes able to communicate with Veronica through the computer and he eventually takes control of the Bartok complex s security systems to gruesomely attack the villains Eventually Veronica frees Brundle by conspiring with him to reintegrate a non contaminated version of his original body Cronenberg endorsed this concept at the time Geena Davis was open to doing a sequel and only pulled out of The Fly II because her character was to be killed in the opening scene while Goldblum was not although he determined a cameo appearance was acceptable and this treatment reflects that However a later treatment written by Jim and Ken Wheat was used as the basis for the final script written by Frank Darabont Mick Garris also wrote a treatment with elements incorporated into the final film br br br Comic books br Beginning in March IDW Publishing released The Fly Outbreak a five issue comic book miniseries written by Brandon Seifert The story is a direct sequel to the events of The Fly II and features Seth Brundle s son Martin inadvertently causing a transgenic outbreak while attempting to cure Anton Bartok to whom he d previously transferred his mutant genes at the end of The Fly II br br br Canceled projects br br br Renny Harlin s alternate sequel br In the s Geena Davis was involved with an alternate sequel to The Fly to be directed by her then husband Renny Harlin titled Flies The script by Richard Jefferies featured a story in which Veronica gives birth to twin boys but survives the ordeal The paranoid Veronica fears that the boys will begin developing fly hybrid characteristics When they eventually do she uses the teleporter to merge the untainted human genes from each twin into a single new being As a result the authorities believe that she murdered one of the children since there is now only one child br br br Todd Lincoln s second remake br In it was announced that a second remake of The Fly was being developed to be directed by Todd Lincoln produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures and released in but this did not happen br br br David Cronenberg s sequel br In it was rumored that David Cronenberg himself was preparing to direct a second remake of The Fly but it was not until that the director addressed the rumors Cronenberg stated that he had written not a remake but rather a sort of sequel script to his version and would film it if th Century Fox gave the project the go ahead br br I have written a script that is more of a strange lateral let s say oblique sequel than it is a true sequel and it s certainly not a remake of the original It s financed by Fox and whether it will get made or not I cannot say at the moment because there are a lot of up in the air factors that deal with internal studio politics and a bunch of other things that I m not in control of But I would make it if they greenlight it let s put it that way br Cronenberg elaborated further when interviewed by Empire in br br Well I did talk to Fox because my agent found out that they were approaching people to do a remake of my film He sort of said Well you know what about David And they said Well we never thought of that I think they d been to Guillermo del Toro and Michael Bay I said Long ago I proposed a sequel to Mel Brooks when he said he wanted to make a sequel He didn t like what I proposed because he said it wasn t the same as the original movie A sequel he said should be more of the same And I said Well Mel then I m not interested And he went off and did his sequels sic and they had nothing to do with me and they weren t very successful But I still had this idea in mind which no I won t tell you and I said to Fox I ll write that idea up because as I think of it it could be interesting And they were excited about it enough to pay me to write a script And then for various reasons it kind of got bogged down I don t know exactly why It seems now that it s not going to happen But it s a script that I like and would do It s not exactly a sequel and it s certainly not a remake More a meditation it involves teleportation br In a late interview Cronenberg provided additional details on why the project had stalled citing br br Budget constraints and other things I think maybe the script that I wrote was a little too radical for Fox and they felt it really needed to be a very low budget film at that point However what was in it that attracted them could not be done low budget So I think that was the problem He also described the project as more of a sequel or a sidebar It was a meditation on fly ness None of the same characters or anything and of course with an understanding of modern technology br Despite Cronenberg s prior assertions that he does not make sequels to his films he returned to The Fly for the opera The Fly in and his proposed sequel film project would mark a second return to the material as well as his first sequel to one of his previous movies However the film is not moving forward br On June Jeff Goldblum said he would be interested in doing a sequel only if Cronenberg was involved even though his character died I don t think my character would be involved because of course I got tragically mutated with the fly and then the machine oh boy But maybe I show up as a grandchild of the original Seth Brundle or Seth Brundle had a brother Had a brother that emerges in some ways Who knows I don t know but David Cronenberg was a thrill to work with Boy if he was involved I d like to work with him
