Officer Ryan br Geraldine Singer as Philomena King br Writer director Jordan Peele voices the sounds made by the wounded deer and narrates a UNCF commercial br br br Production br br br Development br br Get Out is the directorial debut of Jordan Peele who had previously worked in comedy including the sketch show Key Peele He felt the horror and comedy genres are similar in that so much of it is pacing so much of it hinges on reveals and that comedy gave him something of a training for the film The Stepford Wives provided inspiration about which Peele said it s a horror movie but has a satirical premise As the film deals with racism Peele has stated that the story is very personal although he noted that it quickly veers off from anything autobiographical br Peele was introduced to producer Sean McKittrick by comedy partner Keegan Michael Key in I was shooting a movie with Keegan Michael Key He said You gotta meet Jordan he s a horror fanatic and he has all these ideas Jordan and I met for coffee in New Orleans He said Here s one you ll never want to make and he pitched me the whole story I d never seen that movie before It fascinated me So I said right at the table Okay I m going to buy this pitch and pay you to write it I think he was a little shocked Peele wrote the first draft of the script in two months br br br Casting br br The lead actors Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams were cast in November with other roles cast between December and February Kaluuya was cast based on the strength of his performance in Black Mirror episode Fifteen Million Merits That party sequence is why I really wanted to do this film because I ve been to that party Kaluuya told the Los Angeles Times He Chris feels like an everyman He s kind of like J Cole Chris is that guy that everyone knows who has been in everyone s class at school That good guy from around the area Tiffany Haddish was asked to audition for a role in the film but declined br Williams said she was cast by Peele as a sneaky gambit to disorient audiences Jordan told me that he had always pictured me as Rose because Peter Pan or Marnie would make it easier for people to trust me Williams noted I was looking for a role that would weaponize everything that people take for granted about me So I instantly signed on to it Williams later observed that White audiences frequently misinterpret the motivations of her character Rose by defending her as being a victim of the cult an interpretation she rejects as the character is simply evil The scene where Rose drinks milk while looking at potential future victims was conceived shortly before shooting to add an additional creepy element to the character The song used in the scene I ve Had The Time of My Life is intended to reflect Rose s emotional detachment There s something kind of horrific about milk Peele explained Think about it Think about what we re doing Milk is kind of gross br br br Filming br Principal photography began on February Shooting took place in Fairhope Alabama for three weeks followed by Barton Academy and in the Ashland Place Historic District in midtown Mobile Alabama The exterior and interior of the house was filmed just south of Fairhope Principal photography lasted days Although this movie was filmed in Alabama Jordan Peele has stressed that the story is not supposed to be understood as taking place in Alabama or anywhere in the South During a February interview with Bethonie Butler in the Washington Post Peele said he deliberately avoided setting the movie in red state territory It was really important for me to not have the villains in this film reflect the typical red state type who is usually categorized as being racist It felt like that was too easy he said I wanted this film to explore the false sense of security one can have with the sort of New York liberal type According to a February Geoff Herbert article in the Syracuse NY Post Standard the movie is set in Upstate New York br Peele described conceptualizing the sunken place as an impassioned journey in an interview with Vanity Fair I always had this concept of the place that you re falling toward when you re going to sleep and you get that falling sensation and catch yourself And if you didn t catch yourself where would you end up I had this hellish image and I thought of this idea of What if you were in a place and you could look through your own eyes as if they were literal windows or a screen and see what your body was seeing but feel like a prisoner in your own mind the chamber of your mind Peele explained The moment I thought of that it immediately occurred to me the theme of abduction and connection to the prison industrial complex that this movie was sort of presenting a metaphor for It was a very emotional discovery I remember having so much fun writing it but at that moment when I figured out this weird esoteric but also an emotionally brutal form of suffering to put the character through I literally cried writing the scene br Lil Rel Howery says the allegorical symbolism in the film is strongly entrenched in the fear historically experienced by African Americans It goes back to the way I grew up I m just being honest Howery explained Segregation created this Stories about people like Emmett Till It s history crazy things have happened so people are going to embellish and pass that onto their kids as a warning Jordan was so smart to hit on all these stories that could be considered myths but a lot of it is rooted in truth br Peele was worried about the film s chances of success telling the Los Angeles Times What if white people don t want to come to see the movie because they re afraid of being villainized with black people in the crowd What if black people don t want to see the movie because they don t want to sit next to a white person while a black person is being victimized on screen br br br Alternative endings br In the original ending Chris is arrested by the police after strangling Rose Instead of rescuing Chris Rod meets him in jail and asks him for information about the Armitage family to investigate but Chris insists that he stopped them and everything is fine Peele intended this ending to reflect the realities of racism By the time production had begun however several high profile police shootings of black people had made discussion in Peele s words more woke After gauging reception at test screenings he decided the film needed a happy ending but felt a moment when the audience believes Chris is about to be arrested would preserve the intended reaction br Peele considered several other endings some of which are included on the DVD and Blu ray release In one ending Rod breaks into the estate finds Chris and calls his name but Chris responds I assure you I don t know who you re talking about br br br Music br br Michael Abels composed the film s score which Peele wanted to have distinctly black voices and black musical references This proved to be a challenge as Peele found that African American music typically has what he termed at the very least a glimmer of hope to it At the same time Peele also wanted to avoid having a voodoo motif The final score features Swahili voices as well as a blues influence Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga is a Swahili phrase that translates to listen to your ancestors which indicates to the listener something bad is coming Run br The words are issuing a warning to Chris Peele said The whole idea of the movie is Get out it s what we re screaming at the character on screen The song Redbone by Childish Gambino appears at the movie s beginning Other songs in the film include Run Rabbit Run by Flanagan and Allen and I ve Had The Time of My Life by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes br The soundtrack was released on vinyl for the first time in by Waxwork Records and included an exclusive essay by Peele br br br Themes and interpretations br Get Out has been described as critical of post racial America the concept of colorblindness and neoliberalism Lanre Bakare in The Guardian notes The villains here aren t southern rednecks or neo Nazi skinheads or the so called alt right They re middle class white liberals The thing Get Out does so well and the thing that will rankle with some viewers is to show how however unintentionally these same people can make life so hard and uncomfortable for black people It exposes a liberal ignorance and hubris that has been allowed to fester It s an attitude an arrogance which in the film leads to a horrific final solution but in reality leads to a complacency that is just as dangerous br Peele stated that the character of Hudson who literally is colorblind due to his physical blindness still plays a part in the system of racism due to his belief that the eyesight of a black photographer will give him an advantage Hudson distances himself from the racial context of taking Chris body claiming to be only interested in his eyesight and reducing him to an aesthetic br Scholar Thai Catherine Matthews draws parallels between Chris and Barack Obama noting their suspension between racial and social identities Matthews says Obama comes to the conclusion that this suspension can foster positive relations in his memoir Dreams from My Father while Get Out views suspension as the ultimate hell Ryan Poll cited the film as an example of Afro pessimism br The film also depicts the lack of attention on missing black Americans compared to missing white girls and women Slate s Damon Young stated the film s premise was depressingly plausible Although black people only comprise percent of America s population they are percent of America s missing a reality that exists as the result of a m lange of racial and socioeconomic factors rendering black lives demonstratively less valuable than the lives of our white counterparts br Peele wrote Rose as a subversion of the white savior trope and in particular of films where most white characters are evil but one is good Peele and Williams stated that Rose behaved like a teenager as her emotional development was delayed Williams believed that Rose was not a victim of indoctrination hypnotism or Stockholm syndrome but simply evil After Rose s intentions are revealed her previous soft and welcoming appearance becomes a vision of cold meticulous elitism with hunting jodhpurs a white dress shirt and a sleek ponytail she hangs photographs of her ex partners on her wall like hunting trophies br br br Reception br br br Box office br Get Out grossed

flat out funny as well Keith Phipps of Uproxx praised the cast and Peele s direction saying That he brings the technical skill of a practiced horror master is more of a surprise The final thrill of Get Out beyond the slow building sense of danger the unsettling atmosphere and the twisty revelation of what s really going on is that Peele s just getting started Mike Rougeau of IGN gave the film and wrote Get Out s whole journey through every tense conversation A plus punchline and shocking act of violence feels totally earned And the conclusion is worth each uncomfortable chuckle and moment of doubt Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave Get Out a out of and called it a jolt a minute horrorshow laced with racial tension and stinging satirical wit Scott Mendelson of Forbes said the film captured the zeitgeist and called it a modern American horror classic br Critic Armond White gave a negative review in National Review referring to the film as a Get Whitey movie and stating that it reduces racial politics to trite horror comedy it s an Obama movie for Tarantino fans The New York Observer critic Rex Reed included the film on his list of Worst Films of and later sardonically stated in a CBS Sunday Morning interview I didn t care if all the black men are turned into robots A writer on Sunday Morning s website noted that there are no robots in the film br In IndieWire writers ranked the script the third best American screenplay of the st century with Chris O Falt arguing that Peele walked a narrative tightrope that required as much craft as insight the audience s understanding of what Chris Daniel Kaluuya is thinking and feeling is always clear Hitchcock like in its execution and playing off genre and audience expectation especially about how racial dynamics are traditionally portrayed on screen the twists and turns of Get Out are not only gasp inducing each one reveals a new layer to its exploration of systematic racist belief systems br br br Accolades br br At the th Academy Awards the film earned four nominations Best Picture Best Director Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor for Daniel Kaluuya Peele became the third person after Warren Beatty and James L Brooks to earn Best Picture Director and Screenplay nominations for a debut film and the first African American winner for Best Original Screenplay and fourth overall nominated after John Singleton Spike Lee and Suzanne de Passe It also became the th horror film to be nominated for best picture after The Exorcist Jaws The Sixth Sense The Silence of the Lambs and Black Swan Get Out divided Oscar voters with many older members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences dismissing it or choosing not to see it According to Vulture new voting members said they ran into interference from more senior members when it came to evaluating the film as Best Picture I had multiple conversations with longtime Academy members who were like That was not an Oscar film according to a new voter Honestly a few of them had not even seen it and they were saying it so dispelling that kind of thing has been super important One anonymous Oscar voter told The Hollywood Reporter they felt alienated by the Oscar campaign Instead of focusing on the fact that this was an entertaining little horror movie that made quite a bit of money they started trying to suggest it had deeper meaning than it does and as far as I m concerned they played the race card and that really turned me off In fact at one of the luncheons the lead actor Kaluuya who is not from the United States was giving us a lecture on racism in America and how black lives matter and I thought What does this have to do with Get Out They re trying to make me think that if I don t vote for this movie I m a racist I was really offended br At the th Golden Globe Awards Get Out received two nominations Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and Best Actor Comedy or Musical for Daniel Kaluuya The submission in the comedy category prompted debate about the premise of the film Although advertised as a satirical horror film Universal Pictures submitted it as a comedy because of less competition in the category which gave the film a greater chance of receiving accolades Peele joked in a tweet Get Out is a documentary but it was reported he approved of the submission br The film also received nominations at the th Screen Actors Guild Awards th NAACP Image Awards and rd Critics Choice Awards among others It won Best Foreign International Film at the British Independent Film Awards At the rd
