the s ance his younger brother Ted as a doctor and his eldest children Emma Henry and Lorne in minor roles Frequent Raimi collaborator Scott Spiegel appears as a mourner at the death feast while fellow frequent Raimi collaborator John Paxton and Irene Roseen appear as the old couple at the diner br br br Themes and interpretations br Drag Me to Hell has been noted for its relevance to the subprime mortgage crisis and more broadly the Great Recession which were ongoing at the time of the film s release Director Sam Raimi reportedly considered this a coincidence stating We just wanted to tell the story of a person who wants to be a good person but who makes a sinful choice out of greed for their own benefit and pays the price for it br Additionally shortly after its release a fan theory garnered attention online positing that Christine who is depicted as having been overweight in her youth is experiencing hallucinations as a result of an eating disorder rather than a supernatural curse with her delusions repeatedly involving food or vomiting br br br Production br br br Background br The original story for Drag Me to Hell was written ten years before the film went into production and was written by Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan Raimi The film went into production under the name The Curse The Raimis wrote the script as a morality tale desiring to write a story about a character who wants to be a good person but makes a sinful choice out of greed for her own betterment and pays the price for it The Raimis tried to make the character of Christine the main focal point in the film and tried to have Christine in almost all the scenes in the film Elements of the film s story are drawn from the British horror film Night of the Demon itself an adaptation of M R James short story Casting the Runes such as the similar shaped demons and the three day curse theme in the film The most significant parallel is that both stories involve the passing of a cursed object which has to be passed to someone else or its possessor will be devoured by one or more demons Unlike his past horror films Raimi wanted the film to be rated PG and not strictly driven by gore stating I didn t want to do exactly the same thing I had done before br After finishing the script Raimi desired to make the picture after the first draft of the script was completed but other projects such as the Spider Man film series became a nearly decade long endeavor pushing opportunities to continue work on Drag Me to Hell to late Raimi offered director Edgar Wright to direct Drag Me to Hell which Wright turned down as he was filming Hot Fuzz and felt that If I did it it would just feel like karaoke After the previous three Spider Man films Raimi came back to the script of Drag Me to Hell wanting to make a simpler and lower budget film In Sam Raimi s friend and producer Robert Tapert of Ghost House Pictures had the company sign on to finance the film Universal Studios agreed to distribute domestically br br br Casting br After completing the script and having the project greenlit Raimi started casting the film Elliot Page was originally cast for the main role of Christine but dropped out of the project due to SAG strike related scheduling issues The main role eventually went to Lohman who did not enjoy horror films but enjoyed doing the stunts during filming Stage actress Lorna Raver auditioned for the role of Mrs Ganush Raver was not aware of the specific nature of her character until being cast stating that all she had read was about a little old lady coming into the bank because they re closing down her house It was only later that I saw the whole script and said Oh my To prepare for this role Raver met with a Hungarian dialect coach and asked to have portions of the script translated into Hungarian Raimi would later ask Raver to use some of the Hungarian words in the scenes of Ganush s attacking Christine Dileep Rao who plays Rham Jas made producer Grant Curtis mildly hesitant in casting him stating that during his audition he was a little bit younger than he read in the script But as we were looking at his reading Sam said There s no minimum age requirement on wisdom Dileep has that wisdom and presence on screen and that s what made him right Once he got on camera he brought that shoulder for Alison to lean on Many of the actors playing secondary characters in Drag Me to Hell have appeared previously in Raimi s films including Joanne Baron Tom Carey Molly Cheek Aimee Miles John Paxton Ted Raimi Bill E Rogers Chelcie Ross and Octavia Spencer br br br Filming br Raimi said he set out to create a horror film with lots of wild moments and lots of suspense and big shocks that ll hopefully make audiences jump But I also wanted to have a lot of dark humor sprinkled throughout I spent the last decade doing Spider Man and you come to rely on a lot of people doing things for you and a lot of help but it s refreshing and wonderful to be reminded that as with most filmmakers the best way to do it is yourself with a tight team doing the main jobs br Production for Drag Me to Hell began on location in Tarzana California The production team included director of photography Peter Deming production designer Steve Saklad and visual effects supervisor Bruce Jones The film was produced by Grant Curtis and Rob Tapert Tapert and Raimi are longtime collaborators having attended college together in Michigan br br br Editing br Drag Me to Hell was edited by Bob Murawski who has collaborated with Raimi on several films including the Spider Man series The Gift and Army of Darkness Raimi has said of working with Murawski on Drag Me to Hell He d come down to the set to see how things were going and to let me know if he d just cut something that wasn t working the way he d wanted it to or to suggest a pick up shot I should get for a piece he felt we needed in a sequence I hadn t realized I needed He s very detail oriented So we re very close collaborators Raimi finds editing with Murawski to be relaxing adding I love it For me it s so relaxing unlike pre production which is fraught with anxiety and fear about how we re going to do things and production which is so rushed and a sleepless time and you re just racing to finish every shot and worrying about focus and so on So post is soothing and I can watch the film come together so it s a time of discovery for me as Bob and I fit all the pieces together I see new possibilities in post as Bob puts the film together sometimes in a way I never imagined The film was edited by Murawski on an Avid computer system in a West Los Angeles facility The color grading was completed at Company with colorist Stephen Nakamura Nakamura used DaVinci Resolve It was CO s first start to finish feature in K resolution For us post is a very creative time where it s not just about this factory producing the blueprinted product It s really a very creative experimental time where we try and take everything that s been written and then shot to the next level said Raimi The final sound mix was completed at the Dub Stage in Burbank with mixers Marti Humphrey and Chris Jacobson br br br Effects br The effects in Drag Me to Hell were created in many different ways including green screen puppets prosthetics and computer generated imagery Bruce Jones was the visual effects supervisor on the film Of Jones Raimi commented He brought a great can do approach to the film He s got a great team of artists and technicians with him and he s got great instincts br There were hundreds of visual effects in the film and different effects houses were utilized According to Raimi the Bay Area s Tippett Studio was a big player We also had work done by Amalgamated Pixels Ghost VFX KNB Effects Home Digital Cinesoup and IE Effects said Raimi According to Raimi Bob Murawski and I kept adding visual effects as post proceeded In this film the supernatural the unseen is almost another character so sequences were developed even in post that would suggest the presence of the supernatural and we kept on adding The same with the sound effects so it was a very ongoing very live process in post br Director of photography Peter Deming tried to use realistic lighting in the film Said Deming Normally you d put all corrected bulbs in but we went with what was there including the shots in the street We used the streetlight look and mixed that with interior lighting There were a lot of odd color sources that we chose to leave the way they would be naturally It s a heightened sense of realism One of the earliest projects the special effects teams did was the scene in which Mrs Ganush attacks Christine in her car To film the action which included close ups of Christine jamming her foot on the pedal hitting the brake and shifting gears the team created a puzzle car which allowed the front engine compartment and back trunk as well as all four sides and doors to come away from the car The roof came off in two directions br br br Soundtrack br br The film score was composed by Christopher Young Young has worked with director Raimi previously on his films The Gift and Spider Man The soundtrack was released on August Sam Raimi stated that emphasis was on using the soundtrack to create a world that didn t exist a world of the supernatural The score

horror movie in years Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times praised the film writing that it should not be dismissed as yet another horror flick just for teens The filmmakers have given us a story winding staircase of psychological tension that is making very small circles near the end Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune described the film as a hellaciously effective B movie that comes with a handy moral tucked inside its scares laughs and Raimi s specialty the scare laugh hybrid Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film out of stars and stated that the film is a sometimes funny and often startling horror movie That is what it wants to be and that is what it is In a positive review Variety said of the film Scant and barren of subtext the pic is single mindedly devoted to pushing the audience s buttons Still there s no denying it delivers far more than competing PG thrillers Bloody Disgusting gave the film four and a half stars out of five with the review calling it quite simply the most perfect horror film I ve seen in a long long while It s a blast and moved quickly from start to finish and is well on its way to becoming an immediate classic The film was then ranked thirteenth in Bloody Disgusting s list of the Top Horror Films of the Decade br Rex Reed of The New York Observer thought that the plot wasn t believable enough and Peter Howell of The Toronto Star disliked Lohman s performance and thought the film was just not very funny br Some reviews considered the film a comedy horror in the style that Raimi is known for The film blends horror and humor so well that viewers don t know whether to laugh or scream noted TV Guide which also hailed it as a popcorn film that aims to entertain nothing more nothing less and it achieves that goal admirably Few films horror or otherwise can boast such a claim making Raimi s self described spook a blast an excellent example of a film where ambition and execution come together in perfect harmony Vic Holtreman of Screen Rant stated that the film blends comedy and horror in a similar fashion to the way Army of Darkness does According to a reviewer at UGO Networks the film is primarily a comedy rather than a horror and this is consistent with Raimi s directing style which has not included any true horror films br br br Accolades br The film was nominated for Choice Movie Horror Thriller at
