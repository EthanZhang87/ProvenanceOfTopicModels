visits Rynn br Scott Jacoby as Mario Podesta the nephew of Officer Miglioriti who befriends Rynn br br Felicia Feaster writing for Turner Classic Movies found an unusual theme in the film which she interpreted as being one of independence for children Professor James R Kincaid read the film as a call for children s rights T S Kord wrote the film argued that a child with money and a home does not need a parent if he or she does not believe it is necessary The adults who attempt to intrude in Rynn s affairs are a threat including her mother her landlord and the molester br Writer Anthony Synnott placed The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane in a trend of sexualizing children in film calling Rynn the murdering nymphet and comparing her to Foster s character Iris in Taxi Driver Anthony Cortese also referred to Foster as giving an encore performance of Taxi Driver calling Rynn a year old imp of maturing sexuality Scholar Andrew Scahill described it as fitting a cinematic narrative of children in rebellion one in which the child appears seemly as with The Innocents The Omen and others br The genre has been debated with Feaster arguing it was more psychological thriller than horror Jim Cullen summed the film up as a strange hybrid of genres being a horror thriller and feminist film Kord listed it among dramas about Eerie malevolent or criminal children distinct from depictions of children in the supernatural horror genre Martin Sheen said it was a horror film in some ways but not overt with mystery and suspense elements However director Nicolas Gessner denied it was horror characterizing it as a teenage love story br br Novelist Laird Koenig adapted the book Originally the script was intended as a play but this idea was abandoned due to the belief that a young actress would not be available to play Rynn for an extended period Gessner read the book only to find rights were optioned to Sam Spiegel but the project was derailed due to creative differences allowing Gessner to secure them br The film followed tax incentives for cinema offered by the government of Canada beginning in stimulating a Hollywood North It was a co production of Canada and France with Zev Braun producing as head of Zev Braun Productions based in Los Angeles alongside L C L Industries in Montreal and Filmedis Filmel in Paris Canadian producer Denis H roux who during the decade specialized in popular cinema with financiers from outside the country also worked on the project It was shot on a small budget Financiers disliked how in the novel Rynn murdered Mrs Hallet with poisonous gas causing the scene to be rewritten so the death is accidental br br Director Martin Scorsese was editing Alice Doesn t Live Here Anymore and Gessner s look at his work led him to discover Jodie Foster With the guidance of her mother Brandy Jodie took the role of Rynn and turned while the film was being shot br Sheen said he was contacted by Gessner personally about playing Frank Hallet which Sheen accepted because he found the part intriguing and because he believed Foster had a promising career Gessner claimed Sheen was initially more interested in playing Mario but Gessner persuaded Sheen that he was too old for that part Gessner noted that casting Alexis Smith who was born in Canada also helped secure Canadian tax incentives br br The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane was filmed in Montreal and Knowlton Quebec Sheen described the set as relaxed and as encouraging creativity and said Foster also built a friendship with his daughter Ren e Estevez during shooting br A producer s desire for sex and violence led to a nude scene depicting Rynn being added to the film Foster strongly objected saying I walked off the set As a result her older sister Connie acted as the nude double Her mother had suggested Connie who was at the time Following the release of Taxi Driver the industry shared stories of Foster having conflicts during the production of The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane However Gessner claimed Foster only regretted the scene after it was shot and her request that it be deleted was denied by the Canadian producers br The crew built a false trapdoor for Mrs Hallet s death scene but Gessner acknowledged Smith was nervous about the effect For the scene where Frank Hallet kills the hamster Gordon Sheen handled a dead and frozen rodent and attempted to make it seem like it was still alive Sound effects of squealing were added The dead hamster was obtained from a hospital which carried out animal research and the live hamster portraying Gordon in other scenes was given to the costume designer after production br br Mort Shuman who played Officer Miglioriti was a musician in real life so the crew intended that Shuman would also write the film score However Shuman s arranger Christian Gaubert wrote the bulk of the music giving him the credit of composer while Shuman was listed as the music supervisor br Gessner wanted to use the music of Polish composer and pianist Fr d ric Chopin finding his music a good match with the dialogue He said Chopin s music was intended to symbolize hope and absolution along with sadness Chopin s piano concerto No in E Minor was performed by pianist Claudio Arrau and The London Philharmonic Orchestra br br After a screening at the Cannes Film Festival in May Astral Bellevue Path Limited sold distribution rights to The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane allowing it to make worldwide by June The film was shown in Paris with a French dub on January and in Toronto on January According to Variety Beachfront Properties secured a temporary restraining order which gave it ownership of the film per a contract from September This order forbade any new sales but did not change the American International Pictures release in April The film had trial screenings in Albuquerque and Peoria Illinois on March It opened in Los Angeles on May and in New York City on August with a PG rating br On its initial release the film poster depicted The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane as a horror film with an image of a building evoking the film Psycho and the subtitle She was only a little girl She lived in a great big house all alone Where is her mother Where is her father Where are all the people who went to visit her What is her unspeakable secret Everyone who knows is dead br A VHS release of the film removed the nudity but it was re added to the DVD StudioCanal published a DVD in Region on October Kino Lorber released the film on Blu ray in Region A on May Hulu and Amazon Prime also made the film available to their customers in November br br The film has a approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on nine critics indicating mixed or average reviews Foster s biographer Louis Chunovic referred to the film as much maligned in his biography on the star br br Janet Maslin for The New York Times wrote this was Foster s most natural portrayal of a child and that Sheen was frightening and found the romance to be the greatest strength In The Washington Post Gary Arnold called the film engaging but claimed the murder plot is too glib too immorally contrived to be satisfying br Kathleen Carroll gave the film a two star rating out of four and in her review of it for the New York Daily News stated that Jodie Foster plays Rynn with her usual aplomb but it seems a dreadful waste of her talent What makes the movie even more reprehensible is that it shows her stripping off her blouse and casually getting into bed with a year old boy As such the movie appears to condone teenage sex and for that reason parents should use great discretion in allowing young people to see it in spite of the mild PG rating br Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called it the exact movie equivalent of one of those slim swift novels that are read on rainy Sundays or late at night or on vacation for their pleasurable unimportance Variety s review stated that the story was unbelievable and that the romance was one of the few positive aspects br Time s Christopher Porterfield felt the film failed to address the most interesting mysteries and that doing so combined with Foster s acting would have made the film memorable Judith Crist s review in the New York Post judged it to be a better than average thriller br br Clyde Gilmour of The Toronto Star said that Jodie Foster alone emerges from this wishy washy production with her renown intact She handles her complex role with the cool adult professionalism that is her trademark But the character itself is thinly developed in the script and remains an enigma at the obligatory freeze frame fadeout Martin Malina of the Montreal Star wrote that this odd little adolescent love story cum murder mystery depends very heavily for its effectiveness on the playing of its principal character and Miss Foster doesn t disappoint br Julie Maskoulis of The Gazette wrote that without her unbelievable cool and calm self sufficiency as the unusual adolescent of the story the film would not be nearly as penetrating It is hard to say how much of Foster s stunning performance can be credited to director Nicolas Gessner who brilliantly manipulates a build up of suspense by insinuation and suggestion using Laird Koenig s screenplay based on his novel He spares us visually gruesome de tails thus making the impact of their retelling within the film much more forceful br Frank Daley of the Ottawa Journal called the film very slight but said it might do business in the U S on the strength of Foster s name Noel Taylor of the Ottawa Citizen called the film a modest thriller with conventionally scarey moments adding that director Nicholas Gessner builds his tension gently and is decently wary of sensationalism br br Felicia Feaster of Turner Classic Movies remarked that The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane became a cult film noting Danny Peary profiled it in his Guide for the Film Fanatic Peary also listed it in his book Cult Horror Movies br In James Monaco gave the film three and a half stars assessing it as disturbing and complimenting the performances and writing In their DVD and Video Guide Mick Martin and Marsha Porter awarded it three and a half stars commenting it was remarkably subdued br Author David Greven praised Foster for a performance achingly suggesting adolescent anomie In his Movie Guide Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars declaring it as a Complex unique mystery br br The
