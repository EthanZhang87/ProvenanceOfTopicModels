sister Whitney Righetti who is captured by Jason Voorhees Mears while camping in woodland at Crystal Lake br The film was originally conceived as an origin story but the project evolved into a re imagining of the first four Friday the th films Voorhees was redesigned as a lean quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer to feel sympathy for him but not enough that he would lose his menace In keeping with the tone of the film Jason s mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Friday the th Part III with minor changes The film includes some of Harry Manfredini s musical score from the previous Friday the th films because the producers recognized its iconic status br Friday the th was theatrically released in the United States on February It received negative reviews while grossing million at the box office on a budget of million becoming the second highest grossing film in the franchise after Freddy vs Jason br br On Friday June a young Jason Voorhees watches as his mother Pamela is beheaded by a camp counselor who was trying to escape Mrs Voorhees s murder spree around Camp Crystal Lake Almost thirty years later five friends Wade Richie his girlfriend Amanda Mike and his girlfriend Whitney arrive for a camping trip at Crystal Lake where they hope to find a crop of marijuana growing in the woods That night an adult Jason kills everyone except Whitney whom he captures as she resembles his mother at a young age br Six weeks later Trent his girlfriend Jenna and friends Chelsea Bree Chewie Nolan and Lawrence arrive at Trent s summer cabin on the shore of Crystal Lake Meanwhile Whitney s brother Clay Miller arrives at the lake to search for her despite his local sheriff s pleas to look elsewhere Clay visits Trent s cabin and Jenna agrees to help him search for Whitney Chelsea and Nolan go wakeboarding on the lake where Jason kills Nolan with an arrow and fatally stabs Chelsea with his machete Meanwhile Clay and Jenna search the

tool shed near the cabin while Trent and Bree have sex in a bedroom Jenna and Clay arrive and Clay calls the police Jason then disconnects the cabin s electricity Lawrence heads outside to search for Chewie and Jason kills him with an axe Jason then sneaks inside and kills Bree A police officer arrives and knocks on the front door but is killed by Jason before he can enter Trent Clay and Jenna

and Whitney in a barn and Whitney confuses Jason by pretending to be Pamela Clay and Whitney subdue Jason with a chain and Whitney stabs Jason in the chest with his machete After sunrise Clay and Whitney dump Jason s body into the lake but before they leave Jason bursts through the wooden dock and grabs Whitney br br The film was produced by New Line Cinema Paramount Pictures Platinum Dunes and Crystal Lake Entertainment New Line Cinema s Toby Emmerich approached Platinum Dunes producers Michael Bay Brad Fuller and Andrew Form about remaking Friday the th in the same way they restarted The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise They agreed and spent over a year obtaining the film rights from Paramount Pictures New Line and Crystal Lake Entertainment the latter run by Friday the th creator Sean S Cunningham Paramount executives gave Platinum Dunes producers a license to use anything from the original films including the title Paramount was given the rights to distribute the film internationally and New Line retained U S distribution rights Fuller and Form said they did not want to make Friday the th Part or but wanted to rework the mythology They liked elements from the first four films such as plot points and ways particular characters are killed and planned to use these in their remake which they did with Paramount s approval Fuller said I think there are moments we want to address like how does the hockey mask happen It ll happen differently in our movie than in the third one Where is Jason from why do these killings happen and what is Crystal Lake The producers initially expressed an interest in using Tommy Jarvis a recurring character who first appeared in Friday the th The Final Chapter but the idea was scrapped br Though the producers decided that Friday the th would not be an origin story they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask and is given a reason for why he puts it on Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head similar to the one seen in Friday the th Part to finding and wearing his hockey mask whereas in Friday the th Part III he obtains the mask off screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it br Unlike both horror remakes The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Amityville Horror which were also produced by Bay Form and Fuller it was decided that Friday the th would not be a period piece Form and Fuller said the film was not strictly a remake so there was no reason they could not set the story in the s In October Mark Swift and Damian Shannon the writers of Freddy vs Jason were hired to write a script for Friday the th Jonathan Liebesman was in negotiations to direct the film but scheduling conflicts meant he was unavailable and Fuller and Form chose Marcus Nispel Nispel was apprehensive about taking the job mainly because he would be taking over another film franchise but Fuller eventually persuaded him to direct the project Principal photography began on April in Austin Texas and ended on June Additional scenes were shot on location at Camp Fern near Marshall Texas br br Stuntman Derek Mears was hired to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of special make up effects supervisor Scott Stoddard Before the producers contacted him Mears had already heard about the production of a new Friday the th and had decided to start physical training so he could pursue the role He was unaware that Stoddard and other industry professionals were suggesting him to the producers The studio worried that Mears pleasant demeanor might affect his ability to portray a menacing character but Mears assured them he was suitable for the role According to Mears They were like You re really nice are you going to be able to switch over right I was like I cage fight and I ve got a lot of dad issues So yeah Mears said he related to Jason the victim when he was growing up and he wanted to portray Jason as a victim in the film To Mears Jason represents people who were bullied in high school specifically those with physical deformities for being outcasts Jason is unusual because he exacts his revenge on those trying to take over his territory at Crystal Lake br When Mears went to audition for the role he was asked Why do we need an actor as opposed to just a guy in a mask Mears said portraying Jason is similar to Greek Mask Work in which the mask and the actor are separate entities and depending on the scene there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance Mears said the energy from the actor s thoughts will be picked up by the camera He compared his experience behind the camera to a stock car race he is the driver and the effects team is his pit crew As he performs the effects team subtly suggest ways he can give the character more life on camera br Amanda Righetti had not read the script when she was offered the role of Whitney Miller She wanted to be part of the Friday the th franchise from the start Righetti said she wanted to act in the film to be a part of the franchise and was convinced by the script Jared Padalecki describes Clay Miller as a real hero because he sets out to do the right thing when his sister goes missing and goes about it as a lone wolf who wants to take on the responsibility alone Adjustments were made to the filming schedule to accommodate Aaron Yoo who portrays Chewie Yoo had his appendix removed shortly before filming began and could not film his scenes immediately As soon as Yoo was ready for filming Nispel immediately hung him upside down from some rafters exposing the staples over his surgical wound for the character s post death shot br Fuller and Form said the casting process for Friday the th was more difficult than that for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because thirteen young actors were involved in Friday the th as opposed to five in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The pair continually recast roles to find which actors worked best together This recasting process lasted until the start of filming Hostel Part II s Richard Burgi who was cast as Sheriff Bracke did not sign his contract until twelve hours before he was due to start filming his scenes br br When Shannon and Swift began writing the script for Friday the th they imposed some rules based on their experiences of writing Freddy vs Jason on themselves They wanted their teenage characters to sound normal Shannon and Swift said they did not want the characters to know Jason s name or to become what they considered the Scooby Doo clich where it s a bunch of kids trying to figure something out The writers also wanted to distance themselves from self referential slasher films such as Scream and to give the film a gritty more s feel that had been lost in recent films They wanted to create a quick loose Jason The writing team decided to create a version of Jason who was actually in the woods surviving off the land and whose killings are presented as a way of defending his territory rather than randomly murdering whoever came along br br The writers did not want to spend a lot of time covering Jason s childhood experiences which they felt would remove the sense of mystery from the character They tried to write scenes that would add verisimilitude like the audience finding a deer carcass lying on the ground as they follow Jason through his tunnels Fuller told the writers they would have to do without it because it would cost Because of budget constraints certain character deaths and the ending of the film were also scaled back from what Shannon and Swift originally envisioned br The writers had written a scene in which Willa Ford s character Chelsea is stranded on the lake for hours after she sees Jason standing on the shore Eventually the girl would tire and drown Shannon and Swift felt this was something they had not seen in slasher films but later decided to make the death quicker and more visceral A similar incident occurred with Danielle Panabaker s character Jenna Panabaker said Jenna was scripted to survive longer than she did in the final version of the film where Jenna was supposed to escape Jason s lair and recite a cute line about a second date with Clay before an elaborate fight sequence that ends in her death The writers wanted to strike a balance between finding new and interesting ways to kill characters and paying homage to popular death scenes that appeared in installments of the previous series To accomplish this Shannon and Swift included the presence of a wheelchair and a sweater in Jason s tunnels because the character Mark Tom McBride was a paraplegic who was killed by Jason in Friday the th Part and Mrs Voorhees wore the sweater in the original version of Friday the th br The writers altered Jason s character Mears describes him as a combination of John Rambo Tarzan and the Abominable Snowman from Looney Tunes To Mears Jason is similar to Rambo because the audience sees him setting up the other characters to fall into his traps Like Rambo he is calculating because he feels he has been wronged and he is fighting back he is supposed to be more sympathetic in this film However Fuller and Form said they learned from their experience with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning not to make Jason too sympathetic to the audience They decided against an origin story because they did not want to focus on Jason s tormented childhood because the producers felt that would demystify the character in an unhelpful manner Fuller said We do not want him to be sympathetic Jason is not a comedic character he is not sympathetic He s a killing machine Plain and simple br br The producers used Asylum Visual Effects to create digital effects for Friday the th Although director Marcus Nispel is a proponent of practical effects Asylum had to digitally create some shots to protect the actors and to allow the director to achieve a specific look Visual effects supervisor Mitchell Drain assigned ten crew members to work on the visual effects they first analyzed the script in pre production to decide which shots would need digital effects Asylum worked on shots for the film br br One of the first scenes Asylum was given was the scene depicting the death of Amanda in which Jason ties her into her sleeping bag and hangs her over a campfire The risk to the actor and the surrounding woodland was deemed too great to physically perform the scene Asylum created a composite of two shots to show Amanda burning to death in her sleeping bag Instead of creating a computer generated CGI model of the campfire a real campfire was filmed Asylum compositor John Stewart blended that footage with shots of the hanging sleeping bag into a single shot Stewart digitally altered the flames to keep continuity between frames Another composite shot is used in the scene in which Chelsea is hit by a speedboat Because the scene would be too dangerous for even a stuntperson to perform Asylum digitally combined footage of Willa Ford reacting to an imaginary boat that runs over her with shots of the actual boat to create the effect br Asylum also enhanced some of Jason s signature machete kills In several scenes the company used a computer generated machete because Nispel wanted to show multiple characters deaths in one shot instead of cutting from the acts of murder to the aftermath of their deaths In one scene Jason kills Richie by slamming a machete into his head Instead of using a real machete with a fake head Nispel had Feldman act dead as Mears pulled a handle with only a portion of the blade attached away from Feldman s head Then Asylum digitally created the rest of the machete blade to complete the effect For this scene Asylum adjusted the actor s facial expressions to create a post mortem look The special effects team digitally drooped half of the actor s face to appear as though the nerves had been severed by Jason s machete br Asylum digitally created weapons for various scenes In the scene in which Nolan is killed suddenly by a shot in the head from Jason s arrow Asylum created the arrow in post production Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away striking him in the back The shot of a hatchet flying through the air in one instance appearing in the same frame as the actor would be too difficult to achieve practically Asylum rendered a complete D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent s death scene Here Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent s chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck br br Effects artist Scott Stoddard described his look for Jason s face as a combination of Carl Fullerton s design for Friday the th Part and Tom Savini s design for Friday the th The Final Chapter Stoddard s vision of Jason included hair loss skin rashes and the traditional deformities in his face Stoddard tried to craft Jason s look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen Mears was required to wear full body make up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements He wore a hump on his back to give the impression that Jason had scoliosis A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears face to show realistic eye movements Stoddard initially spent three and a half hours applying the make up to Mears head and torso He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask For scenes in which Jason s face is revealed it took approximately four hours to apply the make up br For Jason s wardrobe Mears was given a pair of combat boots and a high priced t shirt that allowed the special effects make up to be seen through holes in the shirt The jacket Jason wears in the film was created by combining a hunting jacket and a military jacket Mears wanted to use the hunting jacket but the creative team liked the way the military jacket billowed as he was making his kill movements so the top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed over the top of the military jacket to create what Mears called a giant Frankenstein jacket He describes Jason as leaner in this film because the character does not eat much A leaner Jason was deemed more functional and allowed more emphasis to be placed on the hump on his back Stoddard was inspired by the third and fourth films when designing Jason s hockey mask Using an original mold Stoddard made six new versions of the mask He said Because I didn t want to take something that already existed There were things I thought were great but there were things I wanted to change a bit Make it custom but keep all the fundamental designs Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks Age them down a bit Break them up br br Form and Fuller recognized the iconic status of the music used in the first four Friday the th films For their film they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music which was composed and originally performed by Harry Manfredini They did not plan to use the score in its entirety but they had Steve Jablonsky compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini s and created the atmosphere for the film Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score Friday the th after having worked with him on the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Nispel told Jablonsky he wanted him to create something that Nispel could whistle when he left the theater but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film Nispel said I don t believe that when you watch a Friday the th film you want to feel like John Williams is sitting next to you with the London Symphony Orchestra Friday the th Music From The Motion Picture was released on February by New Line Records Friday the th Expanded Score From The Motion Picture was released on June br br A teaser trailer of the film debuted at the Scream Awards held in October and was later released online In December the film s theatrical trailer was released along with the theatrical poster On Friday February Friday the th was released in theaters in North America It was theatrically released by New Line Cinema in the United States and Canada and by Paramount Pictures

reviews from mainstream critics calculated an average score of based on reviews CinemaScore polls reported that average grade cinemagoers gave the film a B on a scale of A to F Exit polls showed that of the audience was male and were at least years old br Alonso Duralde wrote that the film should please slasher fans but that it added nothing new to the genre or the franchise and would not appeal to people who did not like slasher films He also said the prospect of another Friday the th crafted by the film s sequel friendly ending did not leave him with a feeling of dread Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic said the film accepts the ridiculousness of what it is trying to accomplish mainly the death and dismemberment of party hungry kids and that audiences would enjoy it if they also recognized that Although Goodykoontz acknowledges the unique touches the film brings to certain characters deaths he was unimpressed with the acting and said Padalecki s presence gave the film a less good episode of Supernatural vibe br The Washington Post s Dan Zak wrote that the film fails to provide laughs scares suspense or gore Zak also said it fails to provide the exhibition of nudity expected of horror films that cannot deliver on the previously listed criteria Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said Nispel captured the despair he created with his Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake Olsen also said the film failed to provide the giddiness teenage lust and rambunctiousness that made the previous Friday the th films work Wesley Morris said Friday the th did have humor he said the characters continually act the clich d role of would be victim making it hard to fear for their safety In his opinion the film lacked the psycho social aspect a mother killing out of revenge for her son s death crafted by its predecessor and ultimately the film is more hilarious than terrifying br USA Today s Claudia Puig said that the film keeps to the same formula as its predecessors with a story that adds little to nothing to the franchise She also said Padalecki and Panabaker filled their lead roles well and that Aaron Yoo s comic relief made him one of the most likable characters on screen Rob Nelson of Variety also praised Panabaker and Yoo s performances br In contrast to the film s detractors The New York Times s Nathan Lee said Friday the th managed to reboot the concept of the original films with style Lee said the film takes pleasure in killing off each of its characters that there is a desire among cinemagoers for this type of material and that Friday the th satisfies that desire Adam Graham from The Detroit News said that it is the most effective and scary film in the Friday the th franchise praising its choice of allowing Jason to run after his victims as opposed to slowly walking behind them as became prominent in later sequels because it made him more menacing Graham also said the film does not soften Jason s scariness by providing a sympathetic backstory Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times explained his review of the film he stated It will come as little surprise that Jason still lives in the woods around Crystal Lake and is still sore about the death of his mom Jason must be sore in general Entertainment Weekly s Clark Collis said director Nispel made a competent film that performs better as a whole than the previously released remakes of Prom Night and My Bloody Valentine D although it does provide a few too many unbelievable character moments br Jason Anderson of the Toronto Star said the film added freshness to the standard formula of the previous films by focusing on the chasing and killing aspects instead of lingering on the prolonged suffering of victims like the Saw films IGN s Chris Carle said Aaron Yoo stole the film with his comic timing and with his memorable death Carle said Derek Mears portrayal of Jason adds more to the character than being simply a stuntman Mears s subtle movements athleticism and physicality created an imposing image of Jason br br In October Warner Bros Pictures set a release date for a sequel to Friday the th as August On December however the sequel was pulled from its release date and was delayed indefinitely In April producer Brad Fuller announced that a sequel to the film was not happening In February Fuller announced that Damian Shannon and Mark Swift had finished a script for the sequel In June Warner Bros relinquished their film rights to the Friday the th franchise to Paramount Pictures During the same month however Derek Mears who portrayed Jason Voorhees in the film
