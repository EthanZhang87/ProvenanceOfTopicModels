away our safety br br Since the release of Take Shelter viewers have discussed the meaning of the film s ambiguous ending In an interview with Creative Screenwriting five years after the release of the film Nichols reflected I had a very strict idea of what the end of Take Shelter was I know exactly what happens and it s fascinating to see people respond to it in their own ways The beautiful part of storytelling is that you re not just telling people a story they re also telling you something about themselves too through their reactions In that situation you re in a conversation with your audience I really can t think of a more rewarding or fulfilling result for something you ve written It s active kinetic and really humbling br In a video interview with Chase Whale in September Nichols elaborated on the ending saying For me personally the moment that matters dream not dream real not real whatever it is is these two characters looking at each other and connecting The fact that they re both seeing it that s what matters because if this is a film that is a meditation on marriage and commitment and communication then what the ending has to be is that these people are on the same page again They had this wedge put in between them from all of these various factors and now at the end they re looking at each other and they are seeing each other and they re together and the circumstances that surround that please open to interpretation br br List of films featuring the deaf and hard of hearing br br Official website br Take Shelter at IMDb br Take Shelter at AllMovie
