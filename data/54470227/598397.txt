commercial success grossing million worldwide on a budget of million and receiving two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards It was ranked third on the Channel list of the Greatest Comedy Films and quickly acquired a cult following In film studies it is seen as a product of post anxiety and a model for transnational comedy while the zombie outbreak as depicted in the film has been used as a modelling example for disease control br br br Plot br In the Crouch End area of London year old electronics salesman Shaun is disrespected by his colleagues does not get along with his stepfather Philip and is dumped by his girlfriend Liz after he is unsuccessful in making decent plans for an anniversary date At his favourite pub the Winchester a heartbroken Shaun gets drunk with

They devise a plan to rescue Shaun s mother Barbara and Liz and then wait out the crisis at the Winchester They escape from a now zombified Pete by stealing his car They pick up Philip who has been bitten and Barbara Ed deliberately crashes Pete s car to force the group to use Philip s Jaguar Series which he has always wanted to drive They fetch Liz and her flatmates David and Dianne Philip

member resembling a doppelg nger of the other group s members Shaun defends Barbara from a zombie which he is forced to impale with a swingball pole After imitating zombies to bypass a horde and reach the Winchester Shaun and Ed argue when Ed answers his mobile phone attracting the zombies attention David panics and breaks a window of the Winchester forcing Shaun to lure the horde away using himself as bait before returning br As the group takes refuge inside the Winchester Shaun discovers that the zombies followed him and Ed inadvertently attracts them by playing on the pub s slot machine While fighting the pub s zombified owner Shaun discovers that the Winchester rifle above the bar is functional something he had previously debated with Ed Barbara reveals she was bitten and dies after giving Liz and Shaun s relationship her approval David attempts to shoot Barbara but Shaun stops him accusing David of hating him and being in love with Liz David denies this but Dianne admits she knows it is true Barbara becomes a zombie forcing a distraught Shaun to shoot her and further fighting ensues after David gives his unprompted opinion that Shaun was right to do so br The zombies break into the pub and pull David out of the window eating him alive Dianne rushes into the horde of zombies with David s severed leg as a weapon allowing the horde to enter The zombified Pete reappears and is shot by Shaun after biting Ed Shaun Liz and Ed take cover behind the bar Shaun sets the bar on fire with alcohol and matches to serve as a barrier which also causes rifle ammunition left on the bar to explode and kill several zombies The three take refuge in the cellar where they realise they only have two bullets left Shaun and Liz contemplate suicide while Ed volunteers to be killed by the zombies Upon discovering a small lift for kegs that opens onto the street Shaun and Liz exit the pub while Ed buys them time by staying behind with the rifle Yvonne arrives with the British Army who gun down the zombies before taking Shaun and Liz to safety br Six months later civilisation has returned to normal but with the added bonus that the surviving zombies are now used for free labour and entertainment Liz has moved in with Shaun who keeps the now zombified Ed chained up in his garden shed revealing that Ed is still at least somewhat sentient the two play video games together in the shed br br br Cast br br br Production br br br Development br br Shaun of the Dead was inspired by Art an episode of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright s sitcom Spaced Written by Pegg and Jessica Hynes and directed by Wright the episode involves Pegg s character hallucinating a zombie invasion after playing the video game Resident Evil while under the influence of amphetamine br With a mutual appreciation for George A Romero s Dead trilogy of zombie films Pegg and Wright decided to write their own zombie film In late they conceived and pitched the film to Film who took it on until their production budget was cut back Despite this Wright was still invested in the production and refused to take other television directing jobs until Shaun of the Dead was made which left him in some debt for a while According to Wright other companies passed on it because they weren t sure what the tone was and said it wasn t all that scary and not that funny They didn t get it After eighteen months Working Title Films picked the project up which Wright felt was ironic as the film mocks the classic British rom coms that Working Title produces The film was first announced at the Cannes Film Festival br Wright has said that he came up with the film while riding in a cab with Pegg after the excitement of filming the zombie episode in Spaced and while watching a horror film with both Pegg and Nick Frost He began developing it in earnest after playing Resident Evil one late night himself and then going out in the early morning hours wondering what a British person s reaction to a zombie apocalypse would be He considered the lack of firearms typical of American zombie movies and his experience of the dazed early morning walk to the shop turned into a scene in the film where Shaun does the same thing Another influence from Wright s life came from how he missed the foot and mouth epidemic by simply not having paid attention to the news for a fortnight and turning his television on one day to see cattle being burnt which left him confused Due to this Wright said it s plausible that the world could be ending and these two guys could be the last to know as they also skip over the news on television in the film The idea of Shaun and Ed spending their time at the Winchester was also inspired by their actors lives as Pegg and Frost always used to go to the same bar all the time according to Wright who had been trying to convince them not to br Wright and Pegg wrote the screenplay in eight weeks They were inspired by films including Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead as well as Raising Arizona Back to the Future Braindead and The Birds The actors met three weeks before filming began for read throughs where they also made changes to the script According to Pegg the script has a set structure with certain lines and actions being repeated throughout the film making improvisation harder Only two scenes were improvised which include when Ed begins to describe the people at the pub and when Shaun offers the group some peanuts Pegg said that the screenplay played well into being an actor in the film because he could write to his own strengths and create his own wish fulfilment br br br Casting br The film s cast features several British comedians comedy actors and sitcom stars most prominently from Spaced Black Books and The Office and co stars other actors from the same shows Cast members from them include Pegg Frost Stevenson and Peter Serafinowicz Frost met Pegg when he was working as a waiter and was brought aboard Spaced despite a lack of acting experience Frost explained that Shaun and Ed have a dynamic similar to that of Simon and himself in real life as they had been living together for years br The filmmakers originally approached Helen Mirren to play Shaun s mother Barbara which she turned down with a note that she would rather play other funnier characters The role of Barbara ultimately went to Penelope Wilton who was asked to take on the role because of her work in the sitcom Ever Decreasing Circles Shaun s stepfather Philip is played by Bill Nighy who accepted the role after Wright sent him an early script of the film to read br br br Cameos and extras br Secondary roles and cameos include Martin Freeman Tamsin Greig Julia Deakin and Reece Shearsmith The voices of Mark Gatiss and Julia Davis can be heard as radio news presenters Trisha Goddard also makes a cameo appearance hosting two fictionalised episodes of her real life talk show Trisha Many other comics and comic actors appear in cameos as zombies including Rob Brydon Paul Putner Pamela Kempthorne Joe Cornish Antonia Campbell Hughes Mark Donovan and Michael Smiley Coldplay members Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland also have cameo roles in the film Martin is a close friend of Pegg who is the godfather of Martin s daughter and also contributed to the soundtrack by guest singing the cover of Buzzcocks Everybody s Happy Nowadays with Ash He does not appear as a zombie but as himself in a charity drive br Zombie extras were recruited from Spaced fan communities Wright revealed in that the zombies spent a week cooped up on set They had to stand outside The Winchester the pub where our heroes take refuge banging on the windows and not doing much else really When we eventually involved them properly they had this electric energy a pure crazed hysteria Originally there were forty stunt performers hired to be the zombies but when the production realised that they would need a lot more to fill the set pieces many fans responded to the online call that auditions to select zombies were set up There were over zombie extras until local children saw the zombie makeup and wanted to be involved leading to another fifty child zombies being added br br br Filming br br The film was shot over nine weeks in London both on location and at Ealing Studios between May and July Wright uses in camera transitions typical to his style to enable powerful visual storytelling Pegg also commented on the use of a magical realism style which he says is part of Wright s direction br Many exterior shots were filmed in and around the North London areas of Crouch End where the film is set Highgate Finsbury Park and East Finchley The electrical appliance shop that Shaun works at is a real shop located in North Finchley The scenes filmed in and around the Winchester pub were shot at the Duke of Albany pub in New Cross South London A three storey Victorian pub it was turned into flats in br br br Music br The film score by Pete Woodhead and Daniel Mudford is a pastiche of Italian zombie film soundtracks by Goblin and Fabio Frizzi It also uses many musical cues from the original Dawn of the Dead that were originally taken by George A Romero from the De Wolfe production music library A friend of the assistant editor on the film had been compiling music library tracks from zombie films making finding some music for the film much easier Before production began on the film Wright and Pegg had created a mixtape of songs they wanted to use The Goblin music though was used as a temp track by Wright in editing he liked the feel of it so much they decided to get the clearance to use it br Bobby Olivier of Billboard attributes the initial rebirth of Queen s Don t Stop Me Now to its appearance in the film which introduced it to a new generation of listeners saying Perhaps the most famous scene from Shaun of the Dead features Don t Stop Me Now which blares from a pub jukebox while stars Simon Pegg Nick Frost and Kate Ashfield bash a zombie with pool cues to the song s hurtling beat The moment had been Wright s idea as he loves Queen and had the idea of playing Don t Stop Me Now one of the most positive exciting happy tunes ever over a scene of extreme violence Pegg explained that the fight in the pub was choreographed to the song even before it had been cleared to be used in the film so they wrote to Brian May and begged to use it br The other choreographed sequence near the start of the film used different music than that which it had been set to The original was a Cornelius song and had been the track written in for the scene from the screenplay Wright then heard the song used in the film The Blue Wrath by I Monster when editing and felt that it worked better The tempo of both songs is the same so the new song fit the original choreography br br br Release br The film was distributed by United International Pictures UIP in the United Kingdom UK and Universal Pictures in the United States and Canada as well as other international markets Universal Pictures also distributed Zack Snyder s remake of Dawn of the Dead at that time and only took on Shaun of the Dead after setting the condition that they would market and release it two weeks after the release of Snyder s film br br br Marketing br UIP created a heavy targeted marketing strategy in the UK including hiring actors to play zombies and dropping them around London to create disruption shortly before the film s release ZenithOptimedia ran this part of the campaign their head said that It has to be the most powerful way to communicate what Shaun of the Dead is all about br Beyond traditional print advertising posters were also placed in the London Underground As the poster depicted Shaun crammed tightly against train windows surrounded by zombies the company chose to buy up poster spaces that would give the impression to anyone walking through the tunnels between platforms that the zombie carriages were on the tracks this is a tactic that UIP had not done before but the creative angle of the posters positioning naturally lent itself to such a move A similar tactic was used with digital posters for the film at an international football match between England and Sweden less restrictive advertising laws in Sweden where the game was held meant that UIP had hoardings incorporating flailing zombie like arms which would not have been permitted in England br br br Home media br The film was released on VHS and DVD shortly after its theatrical run in the US with a VHS and DVD release on September in the UK and around December in the US in widescreen only for both formats Features included several audio commentaries EPK featurettes about the film s production pre production video diaries and concept videos photo galleries bloopers and more The film also saw release on the HD DVD format in and UMD with a Blu ray Disc release following in br The Blu ray release had high definition visuals and a surround sound audio mix Special features include four audio commentaries the DVD features and U Control features giving access to storyboards missing bits and of course the Zomb O Meter trivia track br br br Comic adaptations and other media br br Pegg and Wright scripted a one off tie in comic strip for the British comic magazine AD titled There s Something About Mary Set the day before the zombie outbreak the strip follows and expands on the character of Mary who appears briefly in the introductory credits and is the first zombie whom Shaun and Ed are aware of the strip details how she became a zombie The strip was made available on the DVD release of Shaun along with two other strips that wrapped up plotholes in the film like how Dianne escaped and survived the Winchester incident and Ed s fate after taking refuge in the pub s basement The comics which feature Pegg and Wright s voices on the DVD and are in black and white were drawn by Oscar Wright a graphic artist and Edgar Wright s brother In IDW Publishing released a four issue adaptation written by Chris Ryall with input from Edgar Wright Simon Pegg and drawn by Zack Howard The comic also contains scenes that were left out of the film br In the National Entertainment Collectibles Association announced that it would produce action figures based on the film Upper Deck Entertainment released a card for the popular World of Warcraft TCG in an ally named Shawn of the Dead with the power of bringing back allies from the enemy graveyard Pegg and Frost reprised their roles as Shaun and Ed for a public service announcement video The Plan which was released on March on YouTube In the video Shaun and Ed share advice about the ongoing COVID pandemic with the former urging the latter to follow National Health Service guidelines stay home and avoid the pub br br br Cultural references br br Shaun of the Dead contains many references to Romero s films Night of the Living Dead Dawn of the Dead and particularly Day of the Dead The name Shaun of the Dead is a pun on Dawn of the Dead A hand in mouth theoretical sequel From Dusk Till Shaun was discussed by Wright and Pegg referencing From Dusk till Dawn as was a parallel sequel starring Stevenson called Yvonne of the Dead A poster was made for From Dusk Till Shaun to feature in the alternate universe Times Square in the animated Sony Pictures Marvel Comics film Spider Man Into the Spider Verse a co director of this film Rodney Rothman had reached out to Wright to ask for a film suggestion that he could have theoretically made in the alternate universe br Other zombie film references include one to Days Later made during the ending scene when Shaun and Liz are watching television and a news report mentions the idea of raging infected monkeys in Days Later the rage virus was started by monkeys in a laboratory and another to Italian gore director Lucio Fulci with the restaurant called Fulci s The film was the first instalment of Wright and Pegg s Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy in which each film makes a passing reference to a different flavour of Cornetto ice cream Shaun of the Dead features red strawberry flavoured ice cream signifying the film s bloody and gory elements The Cornetto was included as Ed s hangover cure because it is Wright s actual hangover cure br Wright and Pegg had contacted various artists to ask for the use of their records in the famed scene where Shaun and Ed throw LPs at a zombie to defend themselves While some artists never got back Wright said that Sade was the coolest She said we could trash Diamond Life without hesitation Wright would later include a Sade song in the soundtrack of his film Scott Pilgrim vs the World the Beachwood Sparks version of By Your Side It was on an original list of songs for the Scott Pilgrim graphic novel and Wright joked that he owed Sade some publishing money after destroying the album in Shaun of the Dead Of the moment Pegg said that they love using Sade as a weapon noting that she was one of only two artists who gave permission to show cover art in the scene the other being New Order br Besides the short The Plan being made during the COVID pandemic the film saw renewed interest in as an Internet meme It began trending on Twitter because the film s poster which showed zombies pressed up against door windows bears a striking resemblance to a photojournalist s image of protesters in Ohio at the Statehouse demanding lockdown be lifted The situation was also described as reminiscent of some of the scenes towards the end of the movie The photojournalist was Joshua A Bickel who said that he thought the windows and door were an interesting compositional element Dawn of the Dead prosthetist Tom Savini said it reminds him of Shaun of the Dead because both use the pressed up against glass horror trope br The film also has a tribute with a zombie hand sculpture at the Hakone Museum in Japan where it is a cult hit despite not having a theatrical release in the country until March years after it was first released br Films that have been based on or inspired by Shaun of the Dead include Juan of the Dead Hsien of the Dead and Shed of the Dead br br br Analysis br Film scholar Kyle Bishop Literature scholar and leading zombie film researcher Peter Dendle and Sci Fi scholar Gerry Canavan all comment on Shaun of the Dead as part of a large body of zombie narratives produced in the wake of Bishop explained that the renaissance of the subgenre reveals a connection between zombie cinema and post cultural consciousness because horror films function as barometers of society s anxieties and zombie movies represent the inescapable realities of unnatural death while presenting a grim view of the modern apocalypse He finds that the subgenre of zombie films can shock and terrify a population that has become numb to other horror subgenres with Dendle similarly assessing that the possibility of wide scale destruction and devastation which brought once again into the communal consciousness found a ready narrative expression in the zombie apocalypses which over thirty years had honed images of desperation subsistence and amoral survivalism to a fine edge br Dirk Eitzen also examined the film in depth as an example of how comedy is made in film particularly how interpretive humour and satire are used For instance when Shaun slips and falls in the shop in the opening sequence per Eitzen s explanation it is funny on several levels Falling is funny not noticing the zombie apocalypse is funny the social satire that contrasts Shaun s mindless behaviour with the mindless zombies is funny and the self reference to where Shaun had slipped on a curb earlier in the sequence is funny too Media scholar Lindsey Decker wrote on how the film created comedy through transnational generic hybridisation taking cues from American zombie films as well as British comedic practices from WWII era Ealing comedies television two man comedy teams and the Monty Python sketch troupe In this use of British comedy within an American genre it also serves as commentary on British American relations in the film industry br Multiple chapters of the book The Laughing Dead The Horror Comedy Film from Bride of Frankenstein to Zombieland are devoted to analysing aspects of Shaun of the Dead Steven Webley s chapter looks at the use of the Uncanny in the film while Shelley S Rees chapter discusses the film s Marxist implications and the transgressive nature of zombies and zombie films in terms of relationships and sexuality Comparatively Kathryn A Cady and Thomas Oates write in their article Family Splatters Rescuing Heteronormativity from the Zombie Apocalypse that the film imagines a single generation heteronormative family as the outcome of zombie invasion br Beyond film studies a Bayesian mathematical model using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods was performed on examples of epidemic progression by Caitlyn Witkowski and Brian Blais in As an example of how such modelling could be applied to infectious disease control Witkowski and Blais took examples of zombie apocalypses in Romero s original Dead trilogy and Shaun of the Dead to demonstrate disease dynamics br br br Reception br br br Box office br In the UK all figures in US Shaun of the Dead grossed million at the box office in its opening weekend being shown in cinemas and starting a run of five consecutive weekends in the UK top In the United States and Canada it grossed million in its opening weekend across theatres starting a run of three consecutive weekends in the US Canada Top Including brief re releases in and Shaun of the Dead grossed million in the United States and Canada and million in other territories for a worldwide total of million against a budget of million br br br Critical response br br Shaun of the Dead received critical acclaim On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes of critics reviews are positive with an average rating of The website s consensus reads Shaun of the Dead cleverly balances scares and witty satire making for a bloody good zombie movie with loads of wit Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews br Nev Pierce reviewing the film for the BBC called it a side splitting head smashing gloriously gory horror comedy that will amuse casual viewers and delight genre fans Peter Bradshaw gave it four stars out of five saying it boasts a script crammed with real gags and is pacily directed and nicely acted Wendy Ide for Screen Daily wrote that the film proves that the move from small to big screen comedy does not always end in artistic failure saying that the film stays true to Pegg and Wright s style but also makes use of comedy more accessible to the British masses than that of Spaced br Pierce wrote that the choice of weapons was amusing and he suggested that the film s real strength was the characterisation of the unhappy leads He felt that the climax at the pub was lacking in horror and comedy compared to the rest of the film Like Pierce Ide felt that there is a convincing emotional depth despite the comedy she similarly noted that the second half was slower but chalked this up to being darker in tone at the climax She praised the special effects make up and prosthetics created by Stuart Conran Keith Phipps of The A V Club enjoyed the record throwing scene citing it as an example of where the film doesn t mind putting in extra work for its laughs as it comes off funnier with Shaun and Ed debating which records they sacrifice rather than throwing indiscriminately He found Wright s technical skills to be impressive adding that Wright left the spotlight to the performances rather than the camerawork but found the finale to be disappointingly played straight br Both the American critics Roger Ebert and Robert K Elder said that the film brought something more to the zombie genre Ebert wrote that he was by now more or less exhausted by the cinematic possibilities of killing zombies and so he was glad for what Shaun of the Dead brought to the table outside of this writing that instead of focusing on the Undead and trying to get the laughs there it treats the living characters as sitcom regulars whose conflicts and arguments keep getting interrupted by annoying flesh eaters Elder agreed that by its release the zombie film had ambled its course but thought that Shaun of the Dead stands on its own a romantic comedy crossed with a quarter life crisis drama just played against a background horde of brain hungry decomposing undead B Alan Orange of MovieWeb wrote that The British Zombie experience is different enough to change the outlook of a whole genre br Of the cast Ebert particularly praised Nighy writing that there s something endearing about his response I ran it under the tap when he is bitten by a zombie Elder described Nighy as the film s scene stealer br Peter Travers also gave the film three out of four stars and praised Pegg he makes you root for Shaun even when he s slacking with Ed neglecting Liz and battling with his mum Phipps take on Shaun was that Pegg gives his hero a defeated look that slowly melts away as the crisis at last gives him a chance to become a man of action br br br Accolades br br br Best of lists and appraisal br In Total Film magazine named Shaun of the Dead the th greatest British film of all time In it was rated as the third greatest comedy
