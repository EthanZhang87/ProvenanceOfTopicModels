item announced that the independent production company Producers Sales Organization PSO bought first time screenwriters Janice Fischer and James Jeremias Lost Boys script for on February PSO announced their acquisition of the project at the American Film Market in Warner Bros later joined the project taking over domestic distribution and some foreign territories br The film s title is a reference to the characters featured in J M Barrie s Peter Pan stories who like vampires never grow old Jeremias said I had read Anne Rice s Interview with the Vampire and in that there was a year old vampire trapped in the body of a year old girl Since Peter Pan had been one of my all time favourite stories I thought What if the reason Peter Pan came out at night and never grew up and could fly was because he was a vampire According to academic William Patrick Day the central theme of The Lost Boys organized around loose allusions to Peter Pan is the tension surrounding the Emerson family and the world of contemporary adolescence The film was originally set to be directed by Richard Donner and Fischer and Jeremias screenplay was modeled on Donner s recent film The Goonies In this way the film was envisioned as more of a juvenile vampire adventure with or year old vampires while the Frog brothers were chubby year old Cub Scouts and the character of Star was a young boy When Donner committed to other projects Joel Schumacher was approached to direct the film although Donner eventually received credit as an executive producer He came up with the idea of making the film sexier and more adult bringing on screenwriter Jeffrey Boam to retool the script and raise the ages of the characters br br Schumacher said he had one of the greatest casts in the world They are what make the film Most of the younger cast members were relatively unknown Schumacher and Marion Dougherty met with many candidates Jason Patric was approached early on by Schumacher to play Michael but Patric had no interest in doing a vampire film and turned it down many times Eventually he was won over by Schumacher s vision and his promise to allow the cast a lot of creative input in making the film According to Kiefer Sutherland Patric was really instrumental in adapting the script with Schumacher and shaping the film br Schumacher envisioned the character of Star as being a waifish blonde similar to Meg Ryan but he was convinced by Jason Patric to consider Jami Gertz who had just worked with Patric in Solarbabies Schumacher was impressed but only at Patric s insistence did he finally cast Gertz Schumacher was surprised when his first choice for the role of Lucy Dianne Wiest accepted the role as she had just recently won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Hannah and Her Sisters br After seeing Kiefer Sutherland s portrayal of Tim in At Close Range Schumacher arranged a reading with him at which they got on very well Sutherland had just completed work on Stand by Me when he was offered the role of David Schumacher said Sutherland can do almost anything He s a born character actor You can see it in The Lost Boys He has the least amount of dialogue in the movie

built on Stage of the Warner Bros lot and a recreation of the interior and exterior of the Pogonip clubhouse on Stage which stood in for Grandpa s house br Sutherland broke his right wrist while doing a wheelie on his motorcycle and had to wear gloves on set to conceal the cast His motorcycle for the movie was adapted so he could operate it with his left hand only br br The Lost Boys opened at

cinematography and a cast that s good right down the line but ultimately describing Lost Boys as a triumph of style over substance and an ambitious entertainment that starts out well but ends up selling its soul Caryn James of The New York Times called Dianne Wiest s character a dopey mom and Barnard Hughes s character a caricature of a feisty old Grandpa She found the film more of a comedy than a horror and the finale funny Elaine Showalter commented that the film brilliantly portrays vampirism as a metaphor for the kind of mythic male bonding that resists growing up commitment especially marriage Variety panned the film calling it a horrifically dreadful vampire teensploitation entry that daringly advances the theory that all those missing children pictured on garbage bags and milk cartons are actually the victims of bloodsucking bikers br The film won a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film in br br The Lost Boys has been credited with helping shift depictions of vampires
