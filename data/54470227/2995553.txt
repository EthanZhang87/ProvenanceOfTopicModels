America in association with Universal Television The original executive producers were Daniels Gervais Merchant Howard Klein and Ben Silverman with numerous others being promoted in later seasons br

replacement and ended its nine season run on May with a two part series finale Its original main cast was Steve Carell Rainn Wilson John Krasinski Jenna Fischer and B J Novak It experienced numerous changes to its ensemble cast during its run Notable stars outside the original main cast include Ed Helms Rashida Jones Amy Ryan Mindy Kaling Craig Robinson James Spader Ellie Kemper and Catherine Tate br The Office received moderately positive reviews from critics except for the pilot episode which received mixed reviews during its short first season but the following seasons particularly Carell s performance received significant acclaim from television critics as the show s characters content structure and tone diverged considerably from the original British series These seasons were included on several critics year end top TV series lists winning several awards including a Peabody Award in two Screen Actors Guild Awards a Golden Globe Award for Carell s performance and four Primetime Emmy Awards including one for Outstanding Comedy Series in The eighth season was criticized for a decline in quality with Carell s departure in season seven seen as a contributing factor However the ninth and final season ended the series with a generally positive response The series finale which originally aired on May was viewed by an estimated million viewers and garnered critical acclaim In Rolling Stone named The Office one of the greatest television shows of all time br br Greg Daniels developed the British Office series for American television and served as the showrunner for the first four seasons of the series He then left the position when he co created the comedy series Parks and Recreation with fellow Office writer Michael Schur and divided his time between both series Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta were named the showrunners for the fifth season Celotta left the series after the sixth season and Lieberstein stayed on as showrunner for the following two seasons He left the showrunner spot after the eighth season for the potential Dwight Schrute spin off The Farm which was eventually passed on by NBC Daniels returned to the showrunner position for the ninth and final season Other executive producers include cast members B J Novak and Mindy Kaling Kaling Novak Daniels Lieberstein and Schur made up the original team of writers Kaling Novak and Lieberstein also served multiple roles on the series as they played regular characters on the show as well as wrote directed and produced episodes Credited with twenty four episodes Kaling is the most prolific writer among the staff Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant who created the original British series are credited as executive producers and wrote both pilot and the third season episode The Convict Merchant later directed the episode Customer Survey while Gervais appeared in the episodes The Seminar and Search Committee reprising his role as David Brent from the British series br Randall Einhorn is the most frequent director of the series with credited episodes The series also had several guest directors including Lost co creator J J Abrams Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon both of whom are fans of the series and filmmakers Jon Favreau Harold Ramis Jason Reitman and Marc Webb Episodes have been directed by several of the actors on the show including Steve Carell Rainn Wilson John Krasinski B J Novak Ed Helms Brian Baumgartner Mindy Kaling and Paul Lieberstein br br Prior to the second episode airing the writers spent time conducting research in offices This process was used for Daniels other series King of the Hill and Parks and Recreation The pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the original British series Daniels chose to go this route because completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do owing to the show being an adaptation He had briefly considered using the idea for The Dundies as the pilot episode After the writers knew who the cast was they were allowed to write for the actors which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode Diversity Day Following the mixed reaction toward the first season the writers attempted to make the series more optimistic and to make Michael Scott more likable They also established the supporting characters of the series more giving them relatable personalities They also made the lights in the office brighter which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the British series br A common issue with the scripts according to Novak is that they tended to run too long for the regular minute time slot leading to several cuts For example the script for the episode Search Committee was initially pages which was pages too long A complete script was written for each episode however actors were given opportunities to improvise during filming Fischer said Our shows are percent scripted They put everything down on paper But we get to play around a little bit too Steve and Rainn are brilliant improvisers These improvisations led to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of The Office all of which are considered part of the show s canon and storyline by Daniels Deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage In an experiment a deleted scene from The Return was made available over NBC com and iTunes explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes Daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information but he eventually considered the experiment a failure br br According to Jenna Fischer the series used an unusual casting process that did not involve a script For example the producers asked the actors several questions and they responded as the characters they were auditioning for NBC programmer Kevin Reilly originally suggested Paul Giamatti to producer Ben Silverman for the role of Michael Scott but the actor declined Martin Short Hank Azaria and Bob Odenkirk were reported to be interested in the part br In January Variety reported that Steve Carell of the Comedy Central program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart was in talks to play the role At the time he was already committed to another NBC midseason replacement comedy Come to Papa but the series was quickly canceled allowing his full commitment to The Office Carell later said that he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the British series before he auditioned He did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying Gervais characterizations Other people who were considered or auditioned for the role included Ben Falcone Alan Tudyk Jim Zulevic and Paul F Tompkins Rainn Wilson was cast as power hungry sycophant Dwight Schrute and he watched every episode of the British series before he auditioned Wilson had originally auditioned for Michael a performance that he described as a terrible Ricky Gervais impersonation however the casting directors liked his audition as Dwight much more and hired him Seth Rogen Matt Besser Patton Oswalt and Judah Friedlander also auditioned for the role Carell was later joined by his wife Nancy Carell when she was cast to play Carol Stills a love interest of Michael Scott When asked what it was like working with her husband Carell said she was intimidated at first as she had retired from acting years prior but they had so much fun together br br John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer were cast in their respective roles as Jim and Pam the main love interests Krasinski attended school with B J Novak where the two were best friends Before Krasinski landed the role he considered quitting acting He discussed on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that he moved to New York City and gave himself two to three years for his acting career to succeed or he would quit He did not enjoy waiting tables and struggling to find roles but his mom told him to wait it out until the end of the year He booked his role in The Office just three weeks later br Fischer prepared for her audition by looking as boring as possible creating the original Pam hairstyle In an interview on NPR s Fresh Air she recalled the last stages of the audition process for Pam and Jim where the producers paired up the potential Pams and Jims four of each to gauge their chemistry When Fischer finished her scene with Krasinski he told her that she was his favorite Pam to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite Jim Adam Scott and John Cho both auditioned for the role of Jim and Kathryn Hahn also auditioned for the role of Pam br The supporting cast includes actors known for their improv work Angela Kinsey Kate Flannery Oscar Nunez Leslie David Baker Brian Baumgartner Melora Hardin and David Denman Kinsey originally auditioned for Pam The producers thought she was too feisty for the character but called her back for the part of Angela Martin which she won Flannery first auditioned for the part of Jan Levinson Gould before landing the role of Meredith Palmer br Baumgartner originally auditioned for Stanley but was eventually cast as Kevin Ken Kwapis the director of the pilot episode liked the way Phyllis Smith a casting associate read with other actors auditioning so much that he cast her as Phyllis At the beginning of the third season Ed Helms and Rashida Jones joined the cast as members of Dunder Mifflin Stamford Jones later left the cast becoming a regular on Parks and Recreation in February and NBC announced that Helms was being promoted to a series regular br Four of the show s writers have also appeared in the show B J Novak was cast as the reluctant temp Ryan Howard after Daniels saw his stand up act Paul Lieberstein was cast as human resources director Toby Flenderson on Novak s suggestion after his cold readings of scripts Greg Daniels was originally unsure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen until the opportunity came in the script for the second episode Diversity Day where Michael needed to be slapped by a minority Since that slap I ve been on the show as Kelly Kapoor Kaling said Michael Schur has also made several guest appearances as Dwight s cousin Mose and consulting producer Larry Wilmore has played diversity trainer Mr Brown br Plans were made for Mackenzie Crook Martin Freeman and Lucy Davis from the British series to appear in the third season but scheduling conflicts prevented them however Ricky Gervais made two appearances in the show s seventh season as David Brent br br The Office was filmed with a single camera setup in cin ma v rit style to create the look of an actual documentary with no studio audience or laugh track allowing its deadpan and absurd humor to fully come across The show s primary premise is that a camera crew is filming Dunder Mifflin and its employees seemingly around the clock The presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters especially Michael Scott who enthusiastically participates in the filming The characters especially Jim and Pam also look towards the camera when Michael creates an awkward situation The show s main action is supplemented with talking head interviews or confessionals where characters speak one on one with the camera Actor John Krasinski shot the footage of Scranton for the opening credits when he found out he was cast as Jim He visited Scranton for research and interviewed employees at actual paper companies br To create the show s documentary style the producers hired cinematographer Randall Einhorn known for directing episodes of Survivor who gave the show its rough and jumpy feel This was facilitated by the main set s open floor plan purposely designed by showrunner Daniels production designer Donald Lee Harris Matt Flynn became production designer later and pilot director Ken Kwapis to allow camera operators to catch characters unaware Unlike most sets the office layout was built with immovable walls to emphasize its airless claustrophobic atmosphere trapping the documentary film crew with the characters br Producer Michael Schur said that the series would strictly follow the documentary format The producers and directors had long discussions on how scenes could work in the documentary format For example in the fourth season episode Did I Stutter a scene featured Michael going through a long process to go to the bathroom without passing Stanley The producers debated whether it was possible and Einhorn walked through the scene to see if a camera operator could get everywhere to shoot the whole scene Later seasons relaxed the format with the camera crew often going where actual documentary crews would not This also changed the series writing and comedy styles an inconsistency criticized by some reviewers and fans br br When it came to choosing the theme music for The Office producer Greg Daniels had several tracks he was thinking of using existing songs including Better Things by The Kinks Float On by Modest Mouse and Mr Blue Sky by Electric Light Orchestra and several original pieces artists contributed to the producers via a cattle call Daniels decided that the cast would vote on what song to use and gave them four of the choices Most of them wanted Mr Blue Sky but that option turned out to be invalid as it was already used in the drama series LAX Thus the final choice was an original track written by Jay Ferguson and performed by The Scrantones br The theme is played over the title sequence which features scenes of Scranton various tasks around the office and the main cast members Some episodes of the series use a shortened version of the theme song Starting with the fourth season the theme song is played over the closing credits which previously rolled in silence Ferguson described his theme as against type it has this vulnerability this yearning to it that soon explodes into this overdone optimism which then gets crushed which is pretty much what the show is about br The mockumentary format of the show contains no laugh track and most of the music is diegetic with songs either sung or played by the characters or heard on radios computers or other devices however songs have been played during montages or the closing credits such as Tiny Dancer by Elton John The Dundies and Islands in the Stream by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton E mail Surveillance Featured music tends to be well known and often songs reflect the character such as Michael s attempt to seem hip by using Mambo No and later My Humps as his cell phone ringtone Michael confusing Lady Gaga s Just Dance with Britney Spears Gimme More is another example of this Daniels has said that it does not count as film score as long as it already appeared in the episode br br The Office features an ensemble cast br Many of its characters are based on characters in the original British series While these characters generally have the same attitudes and perceptions as their British counterparts the roles were modified to fit the American show The show is known for its relatively large cast and many of its actors and actresses are known particularly for their improvisational work br Steve Carell stars as Michael Scott regional manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch Loosely based on David Brent Gervais character in the British series Scott is a well intentioned man whose oblivious attempts at humor often offend and annoy his peers and employees and sometimes draw reprimands from his superiors Rainn Wilson portrays Dwight Schrute based on Gareth Keenan who is a salesman and the Assistant to the Regional Manager an imaginary title created by Michael br John Krasinski portrays Jim Halpert a salesman and in later seasons assistant manager or co manager who is known for his wittiness and his practical jokes on Dwight Halpert is based upon Tim Canterbury and at the start of the series is known to have feelings

ultra religious woman who likes to keep things orderly and make sure situations remain as businesslike as possible Kevin Malone Brian Baumgartner a lovable but dim witted man who revels in juvenile humor and frequently indulges in gambling and Oscar Martinez Oscar Nu ez who is intelligent and cultured but often patronizing and whose homosexuality and Hispanic heritage made him a frequent target

response from critics with some of them comparing it to the short lived NBC series Coupling which was also based on a British version The New York Daily News called it so diluted there s little left but muddy water and USA Today called it a passable imitation of a miles better BBC original A Guardian Unlimited review panned its lack of originality stating that Steve Carell just seems to be trying too hard Maybe in later episodes when it deviates from Gervais and Merchant s script he ll come into his own But right now he s a pale imitation Tom Shales of The Washington Post said it was not the mishmash that the Americanized version of Coupling turned out to be but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim like when the copying machine is just about to give out br br The second season was better received James Poniewozik of Time remarked Producer Greg Daniels created not a copy but an interpretation that sends up distinctly American work conventions with a tone that s more satiric and less mordant The new boss is different from the old boss and that s fine by me He named it the second best TV show of after Battlestar Galactica Entertainment Weekly writer Mark Harris echoed these sentiments a week later stating Thanks to the fearless Steve Carell an ever stronger supporting cast and scripts that spew American corporate absurdist vernacular with perfect pitch this undervalued remake does the near impossible it honors Ricky Gervais original and works on its own terms The A V Club reviewer Nathan Rabin expressed its views on the show s progression After a rocky start The Office improved immeasurably instantly becoming one of TV s funniest sharpest shows The casting of Steve Carell in the Gervais role proved to be a masterstroke The American

Dilbert which also features employees coping with an inept superior John Spector CEO of The Conference Board says that they both show the impact a leader can have for good or bad Dilbert creator Scott Adams also touts the similarities The lesson from The Office and from Dilbert is that people are often dysfunctional and no amount of training can fix it A labor affiliated group American Rights at
