br br br Production br br Like Universal s earlier version starring Bela Lugosi the screenplay for this adaptation of Bram Stoker s novel Dracula is based on the stage adaptation by Hamilton Deane and John L Balderston which ran on Broadway and also starred Langella in a Tony Award nominated performance Set in the Edwardian period and strikingly designed by Edward Gorey the play ran for over performances between October and January Langella also appeared in the play for a limited run in the West End The play is also known for switching the names of the characters of Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra When Badham was asked why he had also switched their names in his film he said that he could not quite remember but that maybe he and Richter felt like Mina was a dopey name and that Lucy was kind of a nice name br The film was shot on location in England at Shepperton Studios and Black Park Buckinghamshire Locations in Cornwall doubled for the majority of the exterior Whitby scenes Tintagel for Seward s Asylum and St Michael s Mount for Carfax Abbey The Castle Dracula was a glass matte painted by Albert Whitlock br Gilbert Taylor was the cinematographer and the original music score was contributed by John Williams br According to Frank Langella Count Dracula was a dominant aggressive force He must have Miss Lucy or he dies He wants what he wants and he doesn t analyze it Dracula as a character is very erotic A woman can be totally passive with Dracula he made me drink I couldn t help it Dracula seems to represent a kind of doorway to sexual abandonment not possible with a mere mortal Besides he s offering immortality Actually I can t think of a woman who wouldn t like to be taken if it s with love If you take a woman by force and at the same time gently you can t fail br Langella wanted to explore sides of the character which weren t shown before I decided he was a highly vulnerable and erotic man not cool and detached and with no sense of humour or humanity I didn t want him to appear stilted stentorian or authoritarian as he s often presented I wanted to show a man who while evil was lonely and could fall in love br Langella held this view many years after the release of the movie In his interview during SITGES film festival he said that he saw a gentleman in Dracula while the bad guys were the ones who wanted to destroy him and we see that today in many instances ignorance leads to the desire to destroy different people there is the suffering of homosexuals or women Langella remembers that the beginning of shooting was very disorganized The cinematographer was changed and they had continual changes of plans However the actor said that the process turned out well in the end br However Langella s most vivid memories were his efforts to create a different Dracula I did not want to look like Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee remembers Langella He thus read the novel and found the character to be gothic elegant lonely without anyone who understood his problem which consisted of the need for blood to survive Langella also understood that the attraction that the character produced among women was key to realize his enormous power of seduction which Langella did not hesitate to use br Badham hired legendary composer John Williams to write the musical score for the film Williams was originally set to score Ronald Neame s sci fi disaster Meteor but numerous production delays forced Williams to step back from the project freeing him to work with Badham Williams recorded the score with the renowned London Symphony Orchestra in the spring of The original soundtrack album was released by MCA Records followed by a Deluxe Edition encompassing the complete score by Var se Sarabande in br br br Reception br br br Box office br In at least three Dracula films were released around the world this film West German director Werner Herzog s retelling as Nosferatu the Vampyre and the comedy Love at First Bite The success of the jokey Love at First Bite starring George Hamilton may have been relevant to the muted response this version experienced The film opened at number one at the US box office with an opening weekend gross of nationally from theaters but performed modestly at the box office grossing domestically and was seen as something of a disappointment by the studio br br br Critical response br Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film stars out of writing What an elegantly seen Dracula this is all shadows and blood and vapors and Frank Langella stalking through with the grace of a cat The film is a triumph of performance art direction and mood over materials that can lend themselves so easily to self satire This Dracula restores the character to the purity of its first film appearances Janet Maslin of The New York Times stated In making this latest trip to the screen in living color Dracula has lost some blood The movie version is by no means lacking in stylishness if anything it s got style to spare But so many of its sequences are at fever pitch and the mood varies so drastically from episode to episode that the pace becomes pointless even taxing after a while Film historian Leonard Maltin gave the film out of a possible stars describing it as Murky with Langella s acclaimed Broadway interpretation sabotaged by trendy horror gimmicks and ill conceived changes to Bram Stoker s novel br br br Accolades br br br Home video br The movie made it onto Variety s All Time Horror Rentals in but it fell into relative cinematic obscurity for several years partly due to it having a very limited video release outside of the US br br br Video recolouring br The theatrical version looks noticeably different from later prints When the film was reissued for a widescreen laserdisc release in the director chose to alter the colour timing desaturating the look of the film br John Badham had intended to shoot the film in black and white to mirror the monochrome film and the stark feel of the Gorey stage production but Universal Studios executives objected Cinematographer Gilbert Taylor was prompted to shoot the movie in warm golden colours to show off the distinctive production design The original version has not been widely screened since the s Other than an occasional broadcast such as on TCM in a pan and scan format the movie has effectively been out of print
