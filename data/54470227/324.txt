The Academy Awards of Merit commonly known as the Oscars or Academy Awards are awards for artistic and technical merit for the film industry They are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS in the United States in recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy s voting membership The Oscars are widely considered to be the most prestigious awards in the film industry br The major award categories are presented during a live televised Hollywood ceremony that is typically held in February or March It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony The st Academy Awards were held in The second ceremony in was the first one broadcast by radio The ceremony was the first one televised It is the oldest of the four major annual American entertainment awards Its equivalents the Emmy Awards for television the Tony Awards for theater and the Grammy Awards for music are modeled after the Academy Awards The Oscar statuette depicts a knight rendered in the Art Deco style br br The first Academy Awards presentation was held on May at a private dinner function at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about people br The post awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel The cost of guest tickets for that night s ceremony was at prices Fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other participants in the film making industry of the time for their works during the period The ceremony ran for minutes br For this first ceremony winners were announced to the media three months earlier For the second ceremony in and the rest of the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at pm on the night of the awards In the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began As a result in the Academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners br The term Oscar is a registered trademark of the AMPAS In the Italian language it is used generically to refer to any award or award ceremony regardless of which field br br The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh He had to return to Europe before the ceremony so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier This made him the first Academy Award winner in history At that time winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period For example Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films With the fourth ceremony the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film For the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years br At the th ceremony held in the Best Foreign Language Film category now known as Best International Feature Film was introduced Until then foreign language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award br Perhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was year old Robert Opel who streaked across the stage of The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles flashing a peace sign on national US television at the th Academy Awards in Bemused host David Niven quipped Isn t it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings Later evidence arose suggesting that Opel s appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show s producer Jack Haley Jr br Robert Metzler the show s business manager believed that the incident had been planned in some way During the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler s wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line which was thus not the ad lib it appeared to be br The th Academy Awards held in presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature br Since all Academy Awards ceremonies except for have ended with the Academy Award for Best Picture Traditionally the previous year s winners for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively The previous year s winners for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor br On February Parasite became the first foreign language film to win Best Picture at the nd Academy Awards br That same evening Tom Hanks announced the opening of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures originally slated for December The museum development started in under Kerry Brougher but is now led by Bill Kramer The industry curated exhibits are geared toward the history of motion pictures and the art science of film making exhibiting trailblazing directors actors film makers sound editors and more and the museum houses famous artifacts from acclaimed movies such as Dorothy s Ruby Red Slippers from The Wizard of Oz br The rd Academy Awards ceremony honoring the best films of and early was held on April after it was postponed from its original February schedule due to the impact of the COVID pandemic on cinema As with the two previous ceremonies there was no host The ceremony was broadcast on ABC It took place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles California for the th consecutive year along with satellite location taking place at the Union Station also in Los Angeles Because of the virus impact on films and TV industries Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson announced that for the Oscar Ceremony streaming movies with a previously planned theatrical release were eligible The theatrical requirement was reinstated starting with the th Academy Awards br br The Oscar statuette officially the Academy Award of Merit is given to winners of each year s awards Made of gold plated bronze on a black metal base it is in cm tall weighs lb kg and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy Actors Writers Directors Producers and Technicians br br Sculptor George Stanley who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl sculpted Cedric Gibbons design The statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold plated solid bronze Within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of Britannia metal a pewter like alloy which is then plated in copper nickel silver and finally karat gold Due to a metal shortage during World War II Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years Following the war the Academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold plated metal ones br The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base The original Oscar mold was cast in at the C W Shumway Sons Foundry in Batavia Illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Award statuettes From to approximately Oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R S Owens Company It would take between three and four weeks to manufacture statuettes br In the Academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes handing manufacturing duties to Walden New York based Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry now owned and operated by UAP Urban Art Projects While based on a digital scan of an original Oscar the statuettes retain their modern era dimensions and black pedestal Cast in liquid bronze from D printed ceramic molds and polished they are then electroplated in karat gold by Brooklyn New York based Epner Technology The time required to produce such statuettes is roughly three months R S Owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the Academy and service existing Oscars that need replating br br The origin of the nickname of the trophy has been disputed as multiple people have taken credit for naming the trophy Oscar br Margaret Herrick librarian and president of the Academy may have said she named it after her supposed uncle Oscar in The only corroboration was a clipping from the Los Angeles Examiner in which Herrick told a story of her and her husband joking with each other using the phrase How s your uncle Oscar br Bette Davis in her autobiography claimed she named it in after her first husband Harmon Oscar Nelson of whom the statue s rear end reminded her But the term had been in use at least two years before In a biography written by Whitney Stine with commentary from Davis Davis wrote I relinquish once and for all any claim that I was the one so Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences the honor is all yours br Columnist Sidney Skolsky wrote in his memoir that he came up with the term in under pressure for a deadline mocking Vaudeville comedians who asked Will you have a cigar Oscar The Academy credits Skolsky with the first confirmed newspaper reference to Oscar in his column on March which was written about that year s th Academy Awards But in the newspaper clipping that Skolsky referred to he wrote that these statues are called Oscars meaning that the name was already in use br Bruce Davis a former executive director of the Academy credited Eleanore Lilleberg a secretary at the Academy when the award was first introduced for the nickname She had overseen the pre ceremony handling of the awards Davis credits Lilleberg because he found in an autobiography of Einar Lilleberg Eleanore s brother that Einar had referenced a Norwegian army veteran named Oscar that the two knew in Chicago whom Einar described as having always stood straight and tall He asserts credit should almost certainly belong to Lilleberg br In Brazilian researcher Dr Waldemar Dalenogare Neto found the probable first public mention of the name Oscar in journalist Relman Morin s Cinematters column in the Los Angeles Evening Post Record on December Since the awards didn t take place that year he said What s happened to the annual Academy banquet As a rule the banquet and the awarding of Oscar the bronze statuette given for best performances is all over long before this This information changes the version of Sidney Skolsky as the first to publicly mention the name br br To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates Until winners returned their statuettes to the Academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective Oscars Since winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription processing station at the Governor s Ball a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony The R S Owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony bearing the name of every potential winner The nameplates for the non winning nominees are later recycled br br Prior to Oscar statuettes were and remain the property of the recipient Since then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette be first offered for sale back to the Academy for US If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the Academy keeps the statuette Academy Awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six figure sums br In Michael Todd s grandson tried to sell Todd s Best Picture Oscar for his production of Around the World in Days to a movie prop collector The Academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale br In Harold Russell consigned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for The Best Years of Our Lives to auction to raise money for his wife s medical expenses Though his decision caused controversy the first Oscar ever to be sold passed to a private collector on August for today Russell defended his action saying I don t know why anybody would be critical My wife s health is much more important than sentimental reasons The movie will be here even if Oscar isn t br In December Orson Welles Oscar for Citizen Kane Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay was put up for auction after his heirs won a court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy On December it sold in an online auction for US today br Some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy which keeps them in its treasury br br In addition to the Academy Award of Merit Oscar award there are nine honorary non competitive awards presented by the Academy from time to time except for the Academy Honorary Award the Technical Achievement Award and the Student Academy Awards which are presented annually br br Governors Awards br The Academy Honorary Award annual which may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette br The Irving G Thalberg Memorial Award since in the form of a bust of Thalberg br The Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award since in the form of an Oscar statuette br The Academy Scientific and Technical Awards br Academy Award of Merit non competitive in the form of an Oscar statuette br Scientific and Engineering Award in the form of a bronze tablet br Technical Achievement Award annual in the form of a certificate br The John A Bonner Medal of Commendation since in the form of a medal br The Gordon E Sawyer Award since and br The Academy Student Academy Awards annual br The Academy also awards Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting br br From to the Academy Award nomination results were announced to the public in mid January Prior to that the results were announced in early February In the nominees were announced in March In the nominees were announced in early February for the first time since br br The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of as of br Academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production As of actors constitute the largest bloc numbering of the voting body Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and its predecessor Price Waterhouse since the th Academy Awards in In May the Academy sent a letter advising its or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting would be implemented in replacing mailed paper ballots br All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or an existing member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures br New membership proposals are considered annually The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join br In the results of a study conducted by the Los Angeles Times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately of AMPAS voting membership Of the active voters confirmed were Caucasian were male and were found to be over the age of of voting members are former nominees and winners In the Academy launched an initiative to expand its membership and increase diversity In voting membership stood at br br According to Rules and of the official Academy Awards Rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of January to midnight at the end of December in Los Angeles County California and play for seven consecutive days to qualify except for the Best International Feature Film Best Documentary Feature and awards in short film categories The film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run with at least one of the daily showings starting between pm and pm local time br For example the Best Picture winner The Hurt Locker was originally first released in but did not qualify for the awards as it did not play its Oscar qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid thus qualifying for the awards Foreign films must include English subtitles Each country can submit only one film for consideration in the International Feature Film category per year br Rule states that a film must be feature length defined as a minimum of minutes except for short subject awards It must exist either on a mm or mm film print or in frame s or frame s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of by pixels Since the th Academy Awards presented in multi part and limited series have been ineligible for the Best Documentary Feature award This followed the win of O J Made in America an eight hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on ABC and ESPN in that category in The Academy s announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film br The Best International Feature Film award does not require a U S release It requires the film to be submitted as its country s official selection br The Best Documentary Feature award requires either week long releases in both Los Angeles County and any of the five boroughs of New York City during the previous calendar year or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the Documentary Feature Qualifying Festival list regardless of any public exhibition or distribution or submission in the International Feature Film category as its country s official selection The qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings A film must have been reviewed by a critic from The New York Times Time Out New York the Los Angeles Times or LA Weekly br Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline In case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year The form includes the production credits for all related categories Then each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases br Awards in short film categories Best Documentary Short Subject Best Animated Short Film and Best Live Action Short Film have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards First the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year instead covering one year starting on October and ending on September of the calendar year before the ceremony Second there are multiple methods of qualification The main method is a week long theatrical release in either New York City or Los Angeles County during the eligibility period Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the Academy also without regard to prior public distribution br A film that is selected as a gold silver or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible Documentary category for that award and Animation Narrative Alternative or International for the other awards The requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards Only one screening per day is required For the Documentary award the screening must start between noon and pm local time For other awards no specific start time is required but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times br In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around active members For most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories i e only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc In the special case of Best Picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees In all major categories a variant of the single transferable vote is used with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees ten for Best Picture ranked preferentially In certain categories including International Feature Film Documentary and Animated Feature nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches br In most categories the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members Since the Best Picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting Since re weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the Best Visual Effects br Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in Oscar season The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders For example a producer of the Best Picture nominee The Hurt Locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front runner The Hurt Locker eventually won br br The Academy Screening Room or Academy Digital Screening Room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the Academy to view all eligible films except initially those in the International category in one place It was introduced in for the Oscars DVD screeners and Academy in person screenings were still provided For films to be included on the platform the North American distributor must pay including a watermarking fee and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the Academy The platform can be accessed via Apple TV and Roku players The watermarking process involved several video security firms creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings br In for the Oscars the Academy banned all physical screeners and in person screenings restricting official membership viewing to the Academy Screening Room Films eligible in the Documentary and International categories were made available in different sections of the platform Distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform The in person screenings were said to be cancelled because of the COVID pandemic Eligible films do not have to be added to the platform but the Academy advertises them to voting members when they are br br The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees It is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during November or December of the previous year This is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men Fashion may dictate not wearing a bow tie and musical performers are sometimes not required to adhere to this The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast br The Academy Awards is the world s longest running awards show televised live from the U S to all time zones in North America and worldwide and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world The Oscars were first televised in by NBC which continued to broadcast the event until when ABC took over televising the festivities including the first color broadcast of the event in to NBC regained the rights for five years then ABC resumed broadcast duties in and its current contract with the Academy runs through br The Academy has produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets especially those outside of the Americas in more desirable local timeslots The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since but only two South American countries Chile and Brazil purchased the rights to air the broadcast By that time the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in countries In the rights were sold to countries and by the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in countries br In the ceremonies were moved up from late March early April to late February to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the NCAA division I men s basketball tournament which would cut into the Academy Awards audience In and ABC s regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite the national championship game on NBC The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period br Some years the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March to avoid a clash with the Winter Olympic Games Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of Passover and Easter which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public Advertising is somewhat restricted as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast As of the production of the Academy Awards telecast held the distinction of winning one the highest number of Emmys in history with wins and nominations overall br After many years of being held on Mondays at p m Pacific pm Eastern since the ceremonies it was moved to Sundays at pm PT pm ET The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays that Los Angeles rush hour traffic jams could be avoided and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier For many years the film industry opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office br In the Academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January citing TV viewers fatigue with the film industry s long awards season However such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail Furthermore a January ceremony on Sunday would clash with National Football League playoff games In the Academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late February to mid February beginning with the nd Academy Awards in In the ceremony was moved to an even earlier start time of pm PT pm ET the apparent impetus being the ability for ABC to air a half hour of primetime programming as a lead out program at pm PT pm ET br Originally scheduled for April the th Academy Awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King Jr On March the rd Academy Awards was postponed for one day after the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington D C br In an In Memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding months a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect with the segment having a popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject s cultural impact The applause has since been muted during the telecast and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead This segment was later followed by a commercial break br In terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours The first Oscars in lasted minutes At the other end of the spectrum the ceremony lasted four hours and twenty three minutes In the organizers of the Academy Awards announced winners acceptance speeches must not run past seconds This according to organizer Bill Mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion In in a further effort to streamline speeches winners dedications were displayed on an on screen ticker br During the ceremony host Jimmy Kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become by announcing that he would give a brand new jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night a reward won by Mark Bridges when accepting his Best Costume Design award for Phantom Thread The Wall Street Journal analyzed the average minutes spent across the telecasts as follows on song performances on the hosts speeches on prerecorded clips and on the awards themselves broken into on the introduction and announcement on winners walking to the stage and on their acceptance speeches br Although still dominant in ratings the viewership of the Academy Awards has steadily dropped The th Academy Awards were the lowest rated in the past eight years although with increases in male and viewership while the show itself also faced mixed reception Following the show Variety reported that ABC was in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the Oscars seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself Currently and nominally AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast including the choice of production staff and hosting although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions In August AMPAS extended its contract with ABC to the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast br br Historically the telecast s viewership is higher when box office hits are favored to win the Best Picture award More than million viewers tuned to the telecast for the th Academy Awards in the year of Titanic which generated a box office haul during its initial run of US million in the US a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years The th Academy Awards ceremony in which The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King pre telecast box office earnings of US million received Awards including Best Picture drew million viewers The most watched ceremony based on Nielsen ratings to date was the nd Academy Awards Best Picture Midnight Cowboy which drew a household rating on April Hoping to reinvigorate the pre show and ratings the Oscars organizers hired members of the Met Gala creative team br By contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings despite how much critical acclaim those films have received The th Academy Awards which awarded a low budget independent film Crash with a pre Oscar gross of US million generated an audience of million with a household rating of In the th Academy Awards telecast was watched by million viewers on average with an household rating the lowest rated and least watched ceremony at the time in spite of celebrating years of the Academy Awards The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film this time the Coen brothers s No Country for Old Men br br Whereas the nd Academy Awards drew an average of million viewers the rd Academy Awards drew an even lower viewership of million the lowest viewership recorded by Nielsen since it started recording audience totals in The th and th editions drew and million viewers respectively still below the audience of the nd edition br br The Academy Film Archive holds copies of every Academy Awards ceremony since the Oscars as well as material on many prior ceremonies along with ancillary material related to more recent shows Copies are held in a variety of film video and digital formats br br In the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel From to the ceremony alternated between two venues the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard and the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles br Grauman s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood then hosted the awards from to followed by the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles from to The st Academy Awards in were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what had been the Academy s headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood br From to the awards were presented at Hollywood s Pantages Theatre With the advent of television the awards from to took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York first at the NBC International Theatre and then at the NBC Century Theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles In the Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica California In the Academy moved the ceremonies back to Downtown Los Angeles to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music Center In the late s and early s the ceremony returned to the Shrine Auditorium br In Hollywood s Dolby Theatre previously known as the Kodak Theatre became the presentation s current venue br br In the first year of the awards the Best Directing award was split into two categories Drama and Comedy At times the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories Drama and Comedy Musical From the s to the s the Art Direction now Production Design Cinematography and Costume Design awards were split into two categories black and white films and color films Prior to the Production Design award was called Art Direction while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup br In August the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live but recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony br Following dissent from Academy members they announced that they would air all categories live This followed several proposals among them the introduction of a Popular Film category that the Academy had announced but did not implement br br The Board of Governors meets each year and considers new award categories To date the following categories have been proposed br br Best Casting rejected in will be implemented for the ceremony br Best Popular Film proposed in for presentation at the ceremony postponed until the ceremony at the earliest yet to be implemented br Best Stunt Coordination rejected every year from to br Best Title Design rejected in br br The Special Academy Awards are voted on by special committees rather than by the Academy membership as a whole They are not always presented on an annual basis br br Academy Honorary Award since br Academy Scientific and Technical Award three different awards since br Gordon E Sawyer Award since br Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award since br Irving G Thalberg Memorial Award since br Academy Special Achievement Award from to and again for br br Academy Juvenile Award to br br Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards many studios spend around million dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the Oscar season This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing and lobbying than by quality William Friedkin an Academy Award winning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself br Tim Dirks editor of AMC s Filmsite has written of the Academy Awards br br Unfortunately the critical worth artistic vision cultural influence and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight Especially since the s moneymaking formula made blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd pleasing titans and Best Picture winners but they haven t necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure A recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the Oscar season is the whisper campaign These campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those who were involved in creating the movie Examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against Zero Dark Thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that Lincoln distorts history br br Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over representation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the U S in the last three months of the calendar year The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded The term Oscar bait was coined to describe such movies This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience e g by favoring Oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues br Despite the success of The Dark Knight the film did not receive a Best Picture nomination at the st Academy Awards This decision received substantial criticism and was described as a snub by many publications The backlash to the decision was such that for the nd Academy Awards awards in the Academy increased the limit for Best Picture nominees from five to ten a change known as The Dark Knight Rule br br The Academy Awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees This criticism is based on the statistics from every Academy Awards since which show that only of Academy Award nominees have been non white and since of nominees have been non white with the rate of winners being even more polarizing For a variety of reasons including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples a number of high profile Oscars have been given to yellowface portrayals as well as performances of Asian characters rewritten for white characters It took until for an Asian woman to win an Academy Award for Best Actress when Michelle Yeoh received the award for her performance in Everything Everywhere All at Once The th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott popularized on social media with the hashtag OscarsSoWhite based on activists perception that its all white acting nominee list reflected bias In response the Academy initiated historic changes in membership by Some media critics claim the Academy s efforts to address its purported racial gender and national biases are merely distractions By contrast the Golden Globe Awards already have multiple winners of Asian descent in leading actress categories Some question whether the Academy s definition of merit is just or empowering for non Americans br The Academy s Representation and Inclusion Standards have been criticized for excluding Jews as a distinct underrepresented class br br The Academy has no rules for how to categorize whether a performance is leading or supporting and it is up to the discretion of the studios whether a given performance is submitted for either Best Actor Actress or Best Supporting Actor Actress This has led to situations where a film has two or more co leads and one of these is submitted in a supporting category to avoid the two leads competing against each other and to increase the film s chances of winning This practice has been derisively called category fraud br For example Rooney Mara was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Carol despite her having a comparable amount of screentime to Cate Blanchett who was nominated for Best Actress Another example is Once Upon a Time in Hollywood where Brad Pitt was nominated for and won Best Supporting Actor even though he played an equally important role to Best Actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio In both these cases critics argued that The Weinstein Company the studio behind the former film had placed someone who was actually a leading actor or actress into the supporting categories to avoid them competing against their co lead br br Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity to make up for a snub for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominee s entire body of work br br Following the st Academy Awards in February in which the Netflix broadcast film Roma had been nominated for ten awards including the Best Picture category Steven Spielberg and other members of the Academy discussed changing the requirements through the Board of Governors for films as to exclude those from Netflix and other media streaming services Spielberg had been concerned that Netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than for typical Oscar winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than for other Best Picture nominated films while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical run status to qualify for an Oscar br The United States Department of Justice having heard of this potential rule change wrote a letter to the Academy in March cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti trust concerns against the Academy Following its April board meeting the Academy Board of Governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for Oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs br br During the th Academy Awards on March Chris Rock joked about Jada Pinkett Smith s shaved head with a G I Jane reference Will Smith walked onstage and slapped Rock across the face then returned to his seat and told Rock twice to Keep my wife s name out of your fucking mouth While later accepting the Best Actor award for King Richard Smith apologized to the Academy and the other nominees but not to Rock Rock decided not to press charges against Smith br On April the Academy made an announcement via a letter sent by president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson informing the public that Will Smith had received a ten year ban from attending the Oscars as a result of the incident br br Some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars The first to do so was screenwriter Dudley Nichols Best Writing in for The Informer Nichols boycotted the th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers Guild Nichols eventually accepted the award three years later at the ceremony Nichols was nominated for three further Academy Awards during his career br George C Scott became the second person to refuse his award Best Actor in for Patton at the rd Academy Awards ceremony Scott described it as a meat parade saying I don t want any part of it br The third person to refuse the award was Marlon Brando who refused his award Best Actor for s The Godfather citing the film industry s discrimination against and mistreatment of Native Americans At the th Academy Awards ceremony Brando asked actress and civil rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather to read a page speech in his place detailing his criticisms for which there was booing and cheering by the audience In Littlefeather was accused by her sisters of misrepresenting her ancestry as Native American br br Seven films have had nominations revoked before the official award ceremony br br The Circus The film was voluntarily removed by the Academy from competitive

Academy Awards in the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed Disney princess characters in live action remakes of their respective animated films Lily James Cinderella Naomi Scott Aladdin and Halle Bailey The Little Mermaid While introducing the category Bailey stated that animated films are formative experiences as kids who watch them as James put it So many kids watch these movies over and over over and over again Scott added I see some parents who know exactly what we re talking about The remarks were heavily criticized by animation fans and those working in the animation industry as infantilizing the medium and perpetuating the stigma that animated works are strictly for children especially since the industry was credited with sustaining the flow of Hollywood content and revenue during the height of the COVID pandemic Phil Lord co producer of one of the nominated films The Mitchells vs the Machines tweeted that it was super cool to position animation as something that kids watch and adults have to endure The film s official social media accounts responded to the joke with an image reading Animation is cinema A week later Lord and his producing partner Christopher Miller wrote a guest column in Variety criticizing the Academy for the joke and how Hollywood has treated animation writing that no one set out to diminish animated films but it s high time we set out to elevate them They also suggested to the Academy that the category should be presented by a filmmaker who respects the art of animation as cinema br Adding to the controversy was that the award for Best Animated Short Film the nominees for which were mostly made up of shorts not aimed at children was one of the eight categories that were not presented during the live broadcast The winner for the Best Animated Short award was The Windshield Wiper a multilingual Spanish American film which is adult animated while another nominee in three categories Best Animated Feature Best Documentary Feature Film and Best International Feature Film was Flee a PG rated animated documentary about an Afghan refugee Alberto Mielgo director of The Windshield Wiper later gave an acceptance speech for the Oscar Animation is an art that includes every single art that you can imagine Animation for adults is a fact It s happening Let s call it cinema I m very honored because this is just the beginning of what we can do with animation Some speculations suggested that the speech played a role in the decision not to broadcast the award br Another factor is that numerous animated films have been made for mature audiences or with ranges of PG or more with a few of them The Triplets of Belleville Persepolis Chico and Rita The Wind Rises Anomalisa My Life as a Courgette The Breadwinner Loving Vincent Isle of Dogs I Lost My Body and Flee having been nominated in this category with The Boy and the Heron being the first adult animated film in this case PG rated to win in the th Academy Awards br These comments came as NewDeal Animation a movement of animation workers demanding equal pay treatment and recognition alongside their contemporaries working in live action was picking up momentum during negotiations for a new contract between The Animation Guild IATSE Local SAG AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and the presentation is being used to rally the movement br During the th Academy Awards in host Jimmy Kimmel said Please raise your hand if you let your kid fill out this part of the ballot
