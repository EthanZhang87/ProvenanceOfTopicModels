In filmmaking a pitch is a concise verbal and sometimes visual presentation of an idea for a film or TV series generally made by a screenwriter or film director to a film producer or studio executive in the hope of attracting development finance to pay for the writing of a screenplay br The expression is borrowed from sales pitch A pitch is used throughout different stages of production such as casting and distribution as well as to urge film producers to further fund a project Filmmakers who devise a pitch tend to manufacture a production package which is handed out to each potential investor during the pitch The package contains the basic information for the filmmaker s project such as a plot synopsis and budgeting values Sometimes filmmakers will produce an independent pitch trailer as a part of the package to help potential financiers better visualize the project and the filmmaker s vision br Though pitches are usually made on the basis of a full script or teleplay animated productions for both film and television are often pitched on the basis of storyboards alone For example the animated television show Phineas and Ferb was pitched from a storyboard Co founders of the project Dan Povenmire and Jeff Swampy Marsh needed to convince overseas executives for The Walt Disney Company to greenlight the series so they drew a storyboard and recorded it as a reel They then mixed it and dubbed it over with sound effects voices and narrative then sent the recording to the executives who accepted it br Television pitches can also be devised by the network or company that produces the program Certain networks are pitched the idea of including a character in a series in order to boost ratings Such pitches have been used with Oliver in The Brady Bunch and Luke on Growing Pains Networks also try to force their ideas on series producers through their pitches though their approach is business oriented and their ideas are generally not favored by writers and viewers In the crew of the animated series Rugrats was approached by Nickelodeon which pitched the idea of a Rugrats Hanukkah special Paul Germain co creator of the series responded by suggesting a passover special which he dubbed a funny idea After they closed production for that special they began considering the Hanukkah special and eventually created it in as the episode A Rugrats Chanukah br br br br br br Further reading br Aguado Ken Eboch Douglas The Hollywood Pitching Bible A Practical Guide to Pitching Movies and Television ScreenMaster Books ISBN br Alberti John ed Leaving Springfield The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture Wayne State University Press ISBN br Karg Barbara Van Over Jim Sutherland Rick The everything filmmaking book from script to premiere a complete guide to putting your vision on the screen Everything Books ISBN br Steiff Josef The Complete Idiot s Guide to Independent Filmmaking Penguin Group ISBN
