with how this all started Simmonds who is deaf in real life described her character s evolution after the first film She has a lot of pressure to become an adult very quickly Simmonds has a more

the vehicles often going full speed br br For the sequel s sound design supervising sound editors Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn and re recording mixer Brandon Proctor returned for the film

than we ever would ve been able to otherwise br In an interview with Headliner Magazine Ethan Van der Ryn and Erik Aadahl shared how sound and silence was a central character in the film We started

sequel from writer director John Krasinski may not quite have all its focus and intimate horror while the borrowings from Alien Jurassic Park and Jaws are admittedly more obvious this time around But it s a really effective and engrossing followup with an absolutely sensational prelude sequence at the top of the movie a barnstorming shocker equal to anything in AQP He also praised the performances of Millicent Simmonds and Cillian Murphy stating that Simmonds is an excellent performer bold confident and forthright holding her own opposite the alpha emoting presence of Murphy Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times gave the film a positive review stating while this new installment is like its predecessor wonderfully acted and intuitively directed by John Krasinski who is solely responsible for the story this time around it has also largely replaced the hushed horror of the original with full on action Faster coarser and far noisier Part II sacrifices emotional depth for thriller setups that do less to advance the plot than grow the younger characters and Though in many respects an exemplary piece of filmmaking Part II remains hobbled by a script that resolves two separate crises while leaving the movie itself in limbo Justin Chang of NPR said that A Quiet Place Part II is an unexpectedly resonant film for the present moment as this country slowly emerges from a crisis that while surely less terrifying than an alien apocalypse has revealed humanity at its best and its worst and praised Krasinski s direction saying Not being able to fall back on verbal exposition has
