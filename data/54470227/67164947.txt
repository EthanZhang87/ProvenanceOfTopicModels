with Michael Bay Andrew Form Brad Fuller and Krasinski producing Sarnoski cited Children of Men as an inspiration for the film s look br Lupita Nyong o and Joseph Quinn came on board to star in November Nyong o s character in the film Sam has a cat Frodo The actress had asked Sarnoski if they could change the animal due to a fear of cats which she overcame with cat therapy by the end of production she adopted a cat of her own Paramount executives wanted Frodo to be computer generated but Sarnoski s insistence for a real cat changed their minds Frodo was played by two cats named Nico and Schnitzel The script originally depicted Frodo as hissing and arching its back a natural reaction to feeling threatened which animal handlers could not train the cats to do to avoid scaring the cats or using CGI those elements were removed The character of Sam was inspired by Sarnoski s desire to subvert expectations of the genre by focusing on someone who had a different relationship to

score with saying they would definitely recommend it br Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B and stated Anyone who has seen the previous A Quiet Place films knows that an exuberant happy ending is not awaiting Samira and Eric but in the time they have together perhaps they can find things that will make life a little better You can see this same sensitivity with performers in A Quiet Place Day One Nyong o walks from Chinatown to Harlem for a slice of pizza even though aliens are killing everyone in the city On paper that s idiotic But somehow this movie ends up being quite touching in between scenes when it s making you jump A two and a half star review at RogerEbert com stated There are enough interesting ideas and at least two confident performances holding A Quiet Place Day One together even if it sometimes feels like a first draft of a richer more complex final film Rating it three out of five stars Peter Bradshaw s review for The Guardian read It s an efficient if familiar spectacle of suspense br Variety s Peter Debruge criticized the fact that most of the film was tiptoeing through a mostly off screen apocalypse br br br br br br External links br Official website br
