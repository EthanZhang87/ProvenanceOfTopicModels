title: Gun politics in the United States
id: 450957
Gun politics is defined in the United States by two primary opposing ideologies concerning the private ownership of firearms Those who advocate for gun control support increasingly restrictive regulation of gun ownership those who advocate for gun rights oppose increased restriction or support the liberalization of gun ownership These groups typically disagree on the interpretation of the text history and tradition of the laws and judicial opinions concerning gun ownership in the United States and the meaning of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States American gun politics involves these groups further disagreement concerning the role of firearms in public safety the studied effects of ownership of firearms on public health and safety and the role of guns in national and state crime br Private firearm ownership has experienced a steady increase in the United States since the turn of the st century and accelerated rapidly during and following the year of The National Firearms Survey of currently the nation s largest and most comprehensive study into American firearm ownership found that privately owned firearms are used in roughly million defensive usage cases self defense from an attacker attackers inside and outside the home per year across the nation The study also found an increase in diversity amongst firearm owner demographics reporting that rates of firearm ownership amongst females and ethnic minorities had risen sharply since the last national survey had been conducted br American gun politics is increasingly a question of demography and political party affiliation and is influenced by well known gender age and income differences according to major social surveys br br br History br br Firearms in American life begin with the earliest attempts to settle and colonize the United States Firearms were made imported and provided for agrarian hunting defense and diplomatic purposes A connection between shooting skills and survival among American men in the colonial expanses was often a necessity and could serve as a rite of passage for those entering manhood Today the figures of the settler colonist hunter and outdoorsman survive as central to American gun culture regardless of modern trends away from hunting and rural life br Prior to the American Revolution there was neither the ability nor political desire to maintain a standing army in the American colonies Since at least the time of the Glorious Revolution English political ideology was strongly opposed to the idea of a standing army Therefore the armed citizen soldier carried responsibility Service in colonial militia including providing one s own ammunition and weapons was mandatory for all men Yet as early as the s the mandatory universal militia duty evolved gradually to voluntary militia units and a reliance on a regular army Throughout the th century the institution of the organized civilian militia gradually declined The unorganized civilian militia under current U S law consists of all able bodied males at least seventeen years of age and under the age of with some exceptions who are not members of the National Guard or Naval Militia as codified in U S C br Closely related to the militia tradition is the frontier tradition with the need for self protection pursuant to westward expansion and the extension of the American frontier Though it has not been a necessary part of daily survival for over a century generations of Americans continued to embrace and glorify it as a living inheritance as a permanent ingredient of this nation s style and culture br Since the founding era of American Federalist politics debates regarding firearm availability and gun violence in the United States have been characterized by concerns about the right to bear arms as found in the Second Amendment to the U S Constitution and the responsibility of the United States government to serve the needs of its citizens and to prevent crime and deaths Firearms regulation supporters say that indiscriminate or unrestricted gun rights inhibit the government from fulfilling that responsibility and causes a safety concern Gun rights supporters promote firearms for self defense including security against tyranny as well as hunting and sporting activities Gun control advocates state that restricting and tracking gun access would result in safer communities while gun rights advocates state that increased firearm ownership by law abiding citizens reduces crime and assert that criminals have always had easy access to firearms br Gun legislation in the United States has become increasingly subject to federal judicial interpretation of the Constitution The Second Amendment to the U S Constitution reads A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed In the United States adopted the Second Amendment and in adopted the Fourteenth Amendment The historical tradition bounded by these two amendments has been the subject of U S Supreme Court decisions in District of Columbia v Heller where the Court affirmed for the first time that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to possess firearms for traditionally lawful purposes such as self defense within the home independent of service in a state militia in McDonald v City of Chicago where the Court ruled that the Second Amendment s restrictions are incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and thereby apply to state as well as federal law and most recently in the NYSRPA v Bruen As emphasized in Bruen the Second Amendment makes an unqualified command that the individual right of firearms ownership as opposed to the collective or militia based theory of the right is protected from all restriction unless a government authority can demonstrate their law is with the Nation s historical tradition of firearms regulation br In it was estimated that U S civilians own million firearms and that to of the households in the country have at least one gun However record gun sales followed in the following years The U S has by far the highest estimated number of guns per capita in the world at guns for every people br br br Colonial era through the Civil War br In the summer of in Jamestown Virginia leaders of the settlement came together to pass the first gun law br br That no man do sell or give any Indians any piece shot or powder or any other arms offensive or defensive upon pain of being held a traitor to the colony and of being hanged as soon as the fact is proved without all redemption br br In the years prior to the American Revolution the British in response to the colonists unhappiness over increasingly direct control and taxation of the colonies imposed a gunpowder embargo on the colonies in an attempt to lessen the ability of the colonists to resist British encroachments into what the colonies regarded as local matters Two direct attempts to disarm the colonial militias fanned what had been a smoldering resentment of British interference into the fires of war br These two incidents were the attempt to confiscate the cannon of the Concord and Lexington militias leading to the Battles of Lexington and Concord of April and the attempt on April to confiscate militia powder stores in the armory of Williamsburg Virginia which led to the Gunpowder Incident and a face off between Patrick Henry and hundreds of militia members on one side and the Royal Governor of Virginia Lord Dunmore and British seamen on the other The Gunpowder Incident was eventually settled by paying the colonists for the powder br According to historian Saul Cornell states passed some of the first gun control laws beginning with Kentucky s law to curb the practice of carrying concealed weapons in There was opposition and as a result the individual right interpretation of the Second Amendment began and grew in direct response to these early gun control laws in keeping with this new pervasive spirit of individualism As noted by Cornell Ironically the first gun control movement helped give birth to the first self conscious gun rights ideology built around a constitutional right of individual self defense br The individual right interpretation of the Second Amendment first arose in Bliss v Commonwealth which evaluated the right to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state pursuant to Section of the Second Constitution of Kentucky The right to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state was interpreted as an individual right for the case of a concealed sword cane This case has been described as about a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons that was violative of the Second Amendment br The first state court decision relevant to the right to bear arms issue was Bliss v Commonwealth The Kentucky court held that the right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State must be preserved entire br Also during the Jacksonian Era the first collective right or group right interpretation of the Second Amendment arose In State v Buzzard the Arkansas high court adopted a militia based political right reading of the right to bear arms under state law and upheld the st section of the second article of the Arkansas Constitution that declared that the free white men of this State shall have a right to keep and bear arms for their common defense while rejecting a challenge to a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons br The Arkansas high court declared That the words a well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free State and the words common defense clearly show the true intent and meaning of these Constitutions i e Arkansas and the U S and prove that it is a political and not an individual right and of course that the State in her legislative capacity has the right to regulate and control it This being the case then the people neither individually nor collectively have the right to keep and bear arms Joel Prentiss Bishop s influential Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes took Buzzard s militia based interpretation a view that Bishop characterized as the Arkansas doctrine as the orthodox view of the right to bear arms in American law br The two early state court cases Bliss and Buzzard set the fundamental dichotomy in interpreting the Second Amendment i e whether it secured an individual right versus a collective right br br br Post Civil War br br In the years immediately following the Civil War the question of the rights of freed slaves to carry arms and to belong to the militia came to the attention of the federal courts In response to the problems freed slaves faced in the Southern states the Fourteenth Amendment was drafted br When the Fourteenth Amendment was drafted Representative John A Bingham of Ohio used the Court s own phrase privileges and immunities of citizens to include the first Eight Amendments of the Bill of Rights under its protection and guard these rights against state legislation br The debate in Congress on the Fourteenth Amendment after the Civil War also concentrated on what the Southern States were doing to harm the newly freed slaves One particular concern was the disarming of former slaves br The Second Amendment attracted serious judicial attention with the Reconstruction era case of United States v Cruikshank which ruled that the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not cause the Bill of Rights including the Second Amendment to limit the powers of the State governments stating that the Second Amendment has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government br Akhil Reed Amar notes in The Yale Law Journal the basis of common law for the first ten amendments of the U S Constitution which would include the Second Amendment following John Randolph Tucker s famous oral argument in the Chicago anarchist Haymarket affair case Spies v Illinois br br Though originally the first ten Amendments were adopted as limitations on Federal power yet in so far as they secure and recognize fundamental rights common law rights of the man they make them privileges and immunities of the man as citizen of the United States br br br th century br br br First half of th century br Since the late th century with three key cases from the pre incorporation era the U S Supreme Court consistently ruled that the Second Amendment and the Bill of Rights restricted only Congress and not the States in the regulation of guns Scholars predicted that the Court s incorporation of other rights suggested that they may incorporate the Second should a suitable case come before them br br br National Firearms Act br br The first major federal firearms law passed in the th century was the National Firearms Act NFA of It was passed after Prohibition era gangsterism peaked with the Saint Valentine s Day massacre of The era was famous for criminal use of firearms such as the Thompson submachine gun Tommy gun and sawed off shotgun Under the NFA machine guns short barreled rifles and shotguns and other weapons fall under the regulation and jurisdiction of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms ATF as described by Title II br br br United States v Miller br br In United States v Miller the Court did not address incorporation but whether a sawn off shotgun has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia In overturning the indictment against Miller the U S District Court for the Western District of Arkansas stated that the National Firearms Act of offend ed the inhibition of the Second Amendment to the Constitution The federal government then appealed directly to the Supreme Court On appeal the federal government did not object to Miller s release since he had died by then seeking only to have the trial judge s ruling on the unconstitutionality of the federal law overturned Under these circumstances neither Miller nor his attorney appeared before the Court to argue the case The Court only heard argument from the federal prosecutor In its ruling the Court overturned the trial court and upheld the NFA br br br Second half of th century br br The Gun Control Act of GCA was passed after the assassinations of President John F Kennedy Senator Robert Kennedy and African American activists Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr in the s The GCA focuses on regulating interstate commerce in firearms by generally prohibiting interstate firearms transfers except among licensed manufacturers dealers and importers It also prohibits selling firearms to certain categories of individuals defined as prohibited persons br In Congress passed the Firearm Owners Protection Act It was supported by the National Rifle Association because it reversed many of the provisions of the GCA It also banned ownership of unregistered fully automatic rifles and civilian purchase or sale of any such firearm made from that date forward br The assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in led to enactment of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act Brady Law in which established the national background check system to prevent certain restricted individuals from owning purchasing or transporting firearms In an article supporting passage of such a law retired chief justice Warren E Burger wrote br br Americans also have a right to defend their homes and we need not challenge that Nor does anyone seriously question that the Constitution protects the right of hunters to own and keep sporting guns for hunting game any more than anyone would challenge the right to own and keep fishing rods and other equipment for fishing or to own automobiles To keep and bear arms for hunting today is essentially a recreational activity and not an imperative of survival as it was years ago Saturday night specials and machine guns are not recreational weapons and surely are as much in need of regulation as motor vehicles br A Stockton California schoolyard shooting in led to passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of AWB or AWB which defined and banned the manufacture and transfer of semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices br According to journalist Chip Berlet concerns about gun control laws along with outrage over two high profile incidents involving the ATF Ruby Ridge in and the Waco siege in mobilized the militia movement of citizens who feared that the federal government would begin to confiscate firearms br Though gun control is not strictly a partisan issue there is generally more support for gun control legislation in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party The Libertarian Party whose campaign platforms favor limited government regulation is outspokenly against gun control br br br Advocacy groups br The National Rifle Association NRA was founded to promote firearm competency and natural conservation in The NRA supported the NFA and ultimately the GCA After the GCA more strident groups such as the Gun Owners of America GOA began to advocate for gun rights According to the GOA it was founded in when the radical left introduced legislation to ban all handguns in California The GOA and other national groups like the Second Amendment Foundation SAF and its offshoot the Firearms Policy Coalition FPC Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership JPFO and the Second Amendment Sisters SAS often take stronger stances than the NRA and criticize its history of support for some firearms legislation such as GCA The National Association for Gun Rights NAGR has been an outspoken critic of the NRA for a number of years According to the Huffington Post NAGR is the much leaner more pugnacious version of the NRA Where the NRA has looked to find some common ground with gun reform advocates and at least appear to be reasonable NAGR has been the unapologetic champion of opening up gun laws even more These groups believe any compromise leads to greater restrictions br According to the authors of The Changing Politics of Gun Control in the late s the NRA changed its activities to incorporate political advocacy Despite the impact on the volatility of membership the politicization of the NRA has been consistent and the NRA Political Victory Fund ranked as one of the biggest spenders in congressional elections as of According to the authors of The Gun Debate the NRA taking the lead on politics serves the gun industry s profitability In particular when gun owners respond to fears of gun confiscation with increased purchases and by helping to isolate the industry from the misuse of its products used in shooting incidents br The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence began in as Handgun Control Inc HCI Soon after it formed a partnership with another fledgling group called the National Coalition to Ban Handguns NCBH later known as the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence CSGV The partnership did not last as NCBH generally took a tougher stand on gun regulation than HCI In the wake of the murder of John Lennon HCI saw an increase of interest and fundraising and contributed to congressional campaigns Following the Reagan assassination attempt and the resultant injury of James Brady Sarah Brady joined the board of HCI in HCI was renamed in to Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence br br br Centers for Disease Control CDC restriction br In Congress added language to the relevant appropriations bill which required none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control This language was added to prevent the funding of research by the CDC that gun rights supporters considered politically motivated and intended to bring about further gun control legislation In particular the NRA and other gun rights proponents objected to work supported by the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control then run by Mark L Rosenberg including research authored by Arthur Kellermann br br br st century br br In October the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report on the effectiveness of gun violence prevention strategies that concluded Evidence was insufficient to determine the effectiveness of any of these laws A similar survey of firearms research by the National Academy of Sciences arrived at nearly identical conclusions in In September of that year the Assault Weapons Ban expired due to a sunset provision Efforts by gun control advocates to renew the ban failed as did attempts to replace it after it became defunct br The NRA opposed bans on handguns in Chicago Washington D C and San Francisco while supporting the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of also known as the School Safety And Law Enforcement Improvement Act which strengthened requirements for background checks for firearm purchases The GOA took issue with a portion of the bill which they termed the Veterans Disarmament Act br Besides the GOA other national gun rights groups continue to take a stronger stance than the NRA These groups include the Second Amendment Sisters Second Amendment Foundation Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership and the Pink Pistols New groups have also arisen such as the Students for Concealed Carry which grew largely out of safety issues resulting from the creation of gun free zones that were legislatively mandated amidst a response to widely publicized school shootings br In in United States v Emerson the Fifth Circuit became the first federal appeals court to recognize an individual s right to own guns In in Parker v District of Columbia the D C Circuit became the first federal appeals court to strike down a gun control law on Second Amendment grounds br br br Smart guns br Smart guns only fire when in the hands of the owner a feature gun control advocates say eliminates accidental firings by children and the risk of hostile persons such as prisoners criminal suspects an opponent in a fight or an enemy soldier grabbing the gun and using it against the owner Gun rights advocates fear mandatory smart gun technology will make it more difficult to fire a gun when needed br Smith Wesson reached a settlement in with the administration of President Bill Clinton which included a provision for the company to develop a smart gun A consumer boycott organized by the NRA and NSSF nearly drove the company out of business and forced it to drop its smart gun plans br br The New Jersey Childproof Handgun Law of requires that months after personalized handguns are available anywhere in the United States only smart guns may be sold in the state br Some gun safety advocates worry that by raising the stakes of introducing the technology this law contributes to the opposition that has prevented smart guns from being sold anywhere in the United States despite availability in other countries br In a Maryland gun dealer dropped plans to sell the first smart gun in the United States after receiving complaints br br br District of Columbia v Heller br br In June in District of Columbia v Heller the Supreme Court upheld by a vote the Parker decision striking down the D C gun law Heller ruled that Americans have an individual right to possess firearms irrespective of membership in a militia for traditionally lawful purposes such as self defense within the home However in delivering the majority opinion Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the operative clause of the amendment the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed codifies an individual right derived from English common law and codified in the English Bill of Rights The majority held that the Second Amendment s preamble A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State is consistent with this interpretation when understood in light of the framers belief that the most effective way to destroy a citizens militia was to disarm the citizens The majority also found that United States v Miller supported an individual right rather than a collective right view contrary to the dominant th century interpretation of that decision In Miller the Supreme Court unanimously held that a federal law requiring the registration of sawed off shotguns did not violate the Second Amendment because such weapons did not have a reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia Finally the court held that because the framers understood the right of self defense to be the central component of the right to keep and bear arms the Second Amendment implicitly protects the right to use arms in defense of hearth and home br The four dissenting justices said that the majority had broken established precedent on the Second Amendment and took the position that the Amendment refers to an individual right but in the context of militia service br br br McDonald v City of Chicago br br In June a Chicago law that banned handguns was struck down The ruling incorporated the Second Amendment stating that The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States Justice Samuel Alito s plurality opinion attributed incorporation to the Amendment s Due Process Clause br br br New York State Rifle Pistol Association Inc v Bruen br br In June the Supreme Court struck down the Sullivan Act s requirement for New York residents to show proper cause to obtain a license for concealed carry of handguns The Supreme Court s majority opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas rejected a two part test previously used by federal courts to review challenges to gun control measures It found that carrying a handgun in public for self defense is protected under the Second Amendment while still allowing for restrictions on carrying handguns in certain sensitive places The opinion however only allows for sensitive place restrictions where historical analogues may be present such as schools courthouses and polling places using the island of Manhattan as an example of one such sensitive place that would be considered unconstitutional br br br Advocacy groups PACs and lobbying br One way advocacy groups influence politics is through outside spending using political action committees PACs and c organizations PACs and c s raise and spend money to affect elections PACs pool campaign contributions from members and donate those funds to candidates for political office Super PACs created in are prohibited from making direct contributions to candidates or parties but influence races by running ads for or against specific candidates Both gun control and gun rights advocates use these types of organizations br The NRA s Political Victory Fund super PAC spent million in the election cycle and as of April it had raised million for elections Michael Bloomberg s gun control super PAC Independence USA spent million in and million in Americans for Responsible Solutions another gun control super PAC started by retired Congresswoman Gabby Giffords raised million in and planned to raise to million by the elections The group s treasurer said that the funds would be enough to compete with the NRA on an even keel basis br Another way advocacy groups influence politics is through lobbying some groups use lobbying firms while others employ in house lobbyists According to OpenSecrets gun politics groups with the most lobbyists in were the NRA s Institute for Legislative Action NRA ILA Mayors Against Illegal Guns MAIG the National Shooting Sports Foundation NSSF and the Brady Campaign Gun rights groups spent over million lobbying in Washington D C in with the National Association for Gun Rights NAGR spending million and the NRA spending million Gun control groups spent million with MAIG spending million and the Brady Campaign spending in the same period br br br D printed firearms br br In August an open source group called Defense Distributed launched a project to design and release a blueprint for a handgun that could be downloaded from the Internet and manufactured using a D printer In May the group made public the STL files for the world s first fully D printable gun the Liberator single shot pistol br Since D printed gun files have exponentially multiplied and been freely published on the Internet for anyone in the world to access on websites like DEFCAD and Odysee br br br Proposals made by the Obama administration br On January in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and other mass shootings President Barack Obama announced a plan for reducing gun violence in four parts closing background check loopholes banning so called assault weapons and large capacity magazines making schools safer and increasing access to mental health services The plan included proposals for new laws to be passed by Congress and a series of executive actions not requiring Congressional approval No new federal gun control legislation was passed as a result of these proposals President Obama later stated in a interview with the BBC that gun control br br has been the one area where I feel that I ve been most frustrated and most stymied it is the fact that the United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common sense gun safety laws Even in the face of repeated mass killings And you know if you look at the number of Americans killed since by terrorism it s less than If you look at the number that have been killed by gun violence it s in the tens of thousands And for us not to be able to resolve that issue has been something that is distressing But it is not something that I intend to stop working on in the remaining months br br br United Nations Arms Treaty br br The Arms Trade Treaty ATT is a multilateral treaty that regulates the international trade in conventional weapons which entered into force on December Work on the treaty commenced in with negotiations for its content conducted at a global conference under the auspices of the United Nations from July in New York As it was not possible to reach an agreement on a final text at that time a new meeting for the conference was scheduled for March On April the UN General Assembly adopted the ATT The treaty was opened for signing on June and by August it had been signed by states and ratified or acceded to by It entered into force on December after it was ratified and acceded to by states br On September Secretary of State John Kerry signed the ATT on behalf of the Obama administration This was a reversal of the position of the Bush administration which had chosen not to participate in the treaty negotiations Then in October a bipartisan group of senators and representatives released concurrent letters to President Barack Obama pledging their opposition to ratification of the ATT The group was led by Senator Jerry Moran R Kansas and Representatives Mike Kelly R Pennsylvania and Collin Peterson D Minnesota Following these two letters four Democratic senators sent a separate letter to the President stating that because of unaddressed concerns that this Treaty s obligations could undermine our nation s sovereignty and the Second Amendment rights of law abiding Americans they would oppose the Treaty if it were to come before the U S Senate The four Senators are Jon Tester D Montana Max Baucus D Montana Heidi Heitkamp D North Dakota and Joe Donnelly D Indiana br Supporters of the treaty claim that the treaty is needed to help protect millions around the globe in danger of human rights abuses Frank Jannuzi of Amnesty International USA states This treaty says that nations must not export arms and ammunition where there is an overriding risk that they will be used to commit serious human rights violations It will help keep arms out of the hands of the wrong people those responsible for upwards of deaths worldwide every day Secretary Kerry was quoted as saying that his signature would help deter the transfer of conventional weapons used to carry out the world s worst crimes As of December the U S has not ratified or acceded to the treaty br br br Proposals made by the Trump administration br Following the Las Vegas shooting in October and the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February President Donald Trump and the Department of Justice DOJ sought ways to ban bump stocks devices that can be used to make semi automatic weapons fire as fully automatic ones as used in both shootings Initially the DOJ believed it had to wait for Congress to pass the appropriate legislation to ban the sale and possession of bump stocks However by March the DOJ introduced proposed revised regulations on gun control that incorporated bump stocks under the definition of machine guns which would make them banned devices as Congress had not yet taken any action After a period of public review the DOJ implemented the proposed ban starting on December giving owners of bump stocks the option to either destroy them or turn them into authorities within days after which the ban would be in full effect on March Pro gun groups immediately sought to challenge the order but could not get the Supreme Court to put the ban on hold while the litigation was ongoing In the following week the Supreme Court refused to exempt the litigants in the legal challenge from the DOJ s order after this was raised as a separate challenge br br br Proposals made by the Biden administration br Since his election President Joe Biden urged Congress to pass a ban on assault rifles and other measures br In April the President announced plans to crack down on privately made firearms saying that they have become weapons of choice for many criminals From to the number of suspected privately made firearms recovered in criminal investigations increased tenfold with about suspected privately made firearms reported to ATF in The Justice Department decision restricted the sale of weapons parts kits determining the kits which can be assembled into firearms in a little as minutes to qualify as firearms within the definition of the federal Gun Control Act thus requiring serial numbers and licensure of manufacturers and commercial sellers U S district judge in Texas Reed O Connor blocked the rule finding that it exceeded the department s authority and issuing a nationwide injunction The U S has appealed to the Fifth Circuit br On June President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law which included strengthened background checks for firearm purchasers under the age of billion in funding for mental health programs and school security upgrades federal funding to encourage states to implement red flag laws and gun ownership bans for individuals convicted of domestic abuse charges br br br Public opinion br br br Polls br Huffington Post reported in September that of Americans said gun laws should be made more strict while said they should be made less strict and said there should be no change Similarly a Gallup poll found that support for stricter gun laws has fallen from after the Newtown shooting to in September Both the Huffington Post poll and the Gallup poll were conducted after the Washington Navy Yard shooting Meanwhile the Huffington Post poll found that of Americans believe stricter gun laws would prevent future mass shootings while said changing things would not make a difference The same poll also found that of Americans think better mental health care is more likely to prevent future mass shootings than stricter gun laws while said the opposite of those who incorrectly believed that the USA has universal background checks supported stricter gun laws but of those who thought that such checks were not universally required supported stricter laws br In a study conducted by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence state gun laws were examined based on various policy approaches and were scored on grade based and ranked scales States were rated positively for having passed stricter measures and stronger gun laws Positive points were also given for states that required background checks on all sales of firearms and that limited bulk firearms purchases and that prohibited sales of assault weapons and large capacity magazines and that carried out stricter evaluations of applications for handgun concealed carry licenses especially in the context of prohibited domestic violence offenders Meanwhile points were deducted from states with laws that expanded access to guns or that allowed concealed carry in public areas particularly schools and bars without a permit or that passed Stand Your Ground Laws which remove the duty to retreat and instead allow people to shoot potential assailants Eventually states were graded indicating the overall strengths or weakness of their gun laws The ten states with the strongest gun laws ranked from strongest starting with California then New Jersey Massachusetts Connecticut Hawaii New York Maryland Illinois Rhode Island and finally Michigan The states with weakest gun laws were ranked as follows South Dakota Arizona Mississippi Vermont Louisiana Montana Wyoming Kentucky Kansas and Oklahoma A comparable study of state laws was also conducted in Based on these findings The Law Center concluded that comprehensive gun laws reduce gun violence deaths whereas weaker guns laws increase gun related deaths Furthermore among different kinds of legislation universal background checks were the most effective at reducing gun related deaths br br br Gallup poll br The Gallup organization regularly polls Americans on their views on guns br On December br br supported a ban on semi automatic guns known as assault weapons br supported background checks on all gun show gun sales br supported a ban on high capacity ammunition magazines that can contain more than rounds br br On April br br supported reinstating and strengthening the assault weapons ban of br supported requiring background checks for all gun purchases br supported

they are less strict br this was sharply polarised by party with of Democratic Party supporters wanting stricter laws against of Republican Party supporters br continued to oppose civilian handgun bans br br On October br br of Americans believing that new gun laws would have little or no effect on mass shootings br said the law on sales of firearms should be more strict br would support a law making it illegal to manufacture sell or possess semi automatic firearms br The following day a survey was published stating br supported requiring background checks for all gun purchases br this includes of gun owners and of non gun owners br supported enacting a day waiting period for all gun sales br this includes of gun owners and of non gun owners br supported requiring all privately owned guns to be registered with the police br this includes of gun owners and of non gun owners br According to a Fox News poll found registered voters overwhelmingly supported a wide variety of gun restrictions br br said they support requiring criminal background checks for all gun buyers br support raising the age requirement to buy guns to br support requiring mental health checks for all gun purchasers br said police should be allowed take guns away from people considered a danger to themselves or others br supported banning assault rifles and semi automatic weapons br br br National Rifle Association br A member poll conducted for the NRA between January and found br br of members favor Reforming our mental health laws to help keep firearms out of the hands of people with mental illness A majority of believe that strengthening laws this way would be more effective at preventing mass murders than banning semi automatic rifles br of NRA members oppose gun confiscation via mandatory buy back laws br oppose banning semi automatic firearms firearms that chamber a new round automatically when discharged br oppose a law requiring gun owners to register with the federal government br oppose a federal law banning the sale of firearms between private citizens br of members are in favor of a program that would place armed security professionals in every school br agreed that President Obama s ultimate goal is the confiscation of many firearms that are currently legal br Place of living of respondents br br A rural area br A small town br A suburban area br An urban area or city br Regional Break br br South br Mid West br West br North East Mid Atlantic br br br Media depictions and public opinion br A study conducted by Berryessa et al in with qualifying respondents investigated how characteristics of victims and types of incidents described in a media report would affect respondents support towards gun regulations They found that mentions of victim race particularly those of Black victims was a strong predictor of lowered support for all categories of firearm regulation Furthermore regulations designed to address gun deaths from suicide and accidents were less likely to garner support compared to those addressing mass shootings or street level gun homicide Descriptions of age mental illness prior incarceration and victim gender were less salient predictors of public support than those of race or incident type br br br Political arguments br br br Rights based arguments br Rights based arguments involve the most fundamental question about gun control to what degree the government has the authority to regulate guns br Proponents of gun rights include but are not limited to the following br br National Rifle Association br Second Amendment Foundation br Gun Owners of America br American Rifle Pistol Association br National Association for Gun Rights br Firearms Policy Coalition FPC br Pink Pistols br The Well Armed Woman br Evolve USA br Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership br National African American Gun Association br California Rifle Pistol Association br Socialist Rifle Association br Redneck Revolt br br br Fundamental right br br The primary author of the United States Bill of Rights James Madison considered the rights contained within including a right to keep and bear arms to be fundamental In he wrote The political truths declared in that solemn manner acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free Government and as they become incorporated with the national sentiment counteract the impulses of interest and passion br The view that gun ownership is a fundamental right was affirmed by the U S Supreme Court in District of Columbia v Heller The Court stated By the time of the founding the right to have arms had become fundamental for English subjects The Court observed that the English Bill of Rights of had listed a right to arms as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen br When the Court interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment in McDonald v City of Chicago it looked to the year when the amendment was ratified and said that most states had provisions in their constitutions explicitly protecting this right The Court concluded It is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty br br br Second Amendment rights br br The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution adopted on December states br br A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed br Prior to District of Columbia v Heller in the absence of a clear court ruling there was a debate about whether or not the Second Amendment included an individual right In Heller the Court concluded that there is indeed such a right but not an unlimited one Although the decision was not unanimous all justices endorsed an individual right viewpoint but differed on the scope of that right br Before Heller gun rights advocates argued that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own guns They stated that the phrase the people in that amendment applies to individuals rather than an organized collective and that the phrase the people means the same thing in the st nd th th and th Amendments They also said the Second s placement in the Bill of Rights defines it as an individual right As part of the Heller decision the majority endorsed the view that the Second Amendment protects an individual though not unlimited right to own guns Political scientist Robert Spitzer and Supreme Court law clerk Gregory P Magarian argued that this final decision by the Supreme Court was a misinterpretation of the U S Constitution br After the Heller decision there was an increased amount of attention on whether or not the Second Amendment applies to the states In in the case of McDonald v City Chicago the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment s provisions do apply to the states as a result of the Fourteenth Amendment br br br Defense of self and state br br The eighteenth century English jurist William Blackstone b whose writings influenced the drafters of the U S Constitution called self defense the primary law of nature which he said man made law cannot take away Following Blackstone the American jurist St George Tucker b wrote that the right of self defense is the first law of nature in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible br In both Heller and McDonald the Supreme Court deemed that the right of self defense is at least partly protected by the United States Constitution The court left details of that protection to be worked out in future court cases br The two primary interest groups regarding this issue are the Brady Campaign and the National Rifle Association They have clashed for example regarding stand your ground laws which give individuals a legal right to use guns for defending themselves without any duty to retreat from a dangerous situation After the Supreme Court s decision in Heller the Brady Campaign indicated that it would seek gun laws without infringing on the right of law abiding persons to possess guns for self defense br br br Protection of marginalized people br Left wing and far left advocates for gun rights argue that gun ownership is necessary for protecting marginalized communities such as African Americans and the working class from state repression Far left advocates argue that gun control laws mostly benefit white people and harm people of color br br br Security against tyranny br Another fundamental political argument associated with the right to keep and bear arms is that banning or even regulating gun ownership makes government tyranny more likely A January Rasmussen Reports poll indicated that percent of Americans believe the purpose of the Second Amendment is to ensure that people are able to protect themselves from tyranny A Gallup poll in October showed that percent of American gun owners mention personal safety protection as a reason for owning them and percent mention a Second Amendment right among other reasons Another poll published by the Pew Research Center in August confirms these results of polled gun owners state that self protection is a major reason for their gun ownership The anti tyranny argument extends back to the days of colonial America and earlier in Great Britain br Various gun rights advocates and organizations such as former governor Mike Huckabee former Congressman Ron Paul and Gun Owners of America say that an armed citizenry is the population s last line of defense against tyranny by their own government This belief was also familiar at the time the Constitution was written The Declaration of Independence mentions the Right of the People to alter or to abolish the government and Abraham Lincoln s first inaugural address reiterated the revolutionary right of the people A right of revolution was not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution instead the Constitution was designed to ensure a government deriving its power from the consent of the governed Historian Don Higginbotham wrote that the well regulated militia protected by the Second Amendment was more likely to put down rebellions than participate in them br Gun rights advocates such as Stephen Halbrook and Wayne LaPierre support the Nazi gun control theory The theory states that gun regulations enforced by the Third Reich rendered victims of the Holocaust weak and that more effective resistance to oppression would have been possible if they had been better armed Other gun laws of authoritarian regimes have also been brought up such as gun control in the Soviet Union and in China This counterfactual history theory is not supported by mainstream scholarship though it is an element of a security against tyranny argument in U S politics br American gun rights activist Larry Pratt says that the anti tyranny argument for gun rights is supported by successful efforts in Guatemala and the Philippines to arm ordinary citizens against communist insurgency in the s Gun rights advocacy groups argue that the only way to enforce democracy is through having the means of resistance Militia movement groups cite the Battle of Athens Tennessee as an example of citizens who used armed force to support the Rule of Law in what they said was a rigged county election Then senator John F Kennedy wrote in that it is extremely unlikely that the fears of governmental tyranny which gave rise to the Second Amendment will ever be a major danger to our nation br In the legal scholar Roscoe Pound expressed a different view He stated A legal right of the citizen to wage war on the government is something that cannot be admitted In the urban industrial society of today a general right to bear efficient arms so as to be enabled to resist oppression by the government would mean that gangs could exercise an extra legal rule which would defeat the whole Bill of Rights br br br Public policy arguments br br Public policy arguments are based on the idea that the central purpose of government is to establish and maintain order This is done through public policy which Blackstone defined as the due regulation and domestic order of the kingdom whereby the inhabitants of the State like members of a well governed family are bound to conform their general behavior to the rules of propriety good neighborhood and good manners and to be decent industrious and inoffensive in their respective stations br br br Gun violence debate br br The public policy debates about gun violence include discussions about firearms deaths including homicide suicide and unintentional deaths as well as the impact of gun ownership criminal and legal on gun violence outcomes After the Sandy Hook shooting the majority of people including gun owners and non gun owners wanted the government to spend more money in order to improve mental health screening and treatment to deter gun violence in America In the United States in there were recorded intentional homicides committed with a firearm per inhabitants The U S ranks in the world for gun homicides per capita A U S male aged is times more likely to be killed with a gun than their counterpart in the eight G largest industrialized nations in the world United Kingdom France Germany Japan Canada Italy Russia In there were gun related deaths in the United States Meanwhile in the same year of Japan there were only deaths that were involved with guns In incidents concerning gun homicide or accidents a person in America is about times more likely to die than a Japanese person In there were deaths due to firearms and some claim as many as mass shootings in the U S while guns were used to kill about people in the U K More people are typically killed with guns in the U S in a day about than in the U K in a year br Within the gun politics debate gun control and gun rights advocates disagree over the role that guns play in crime Gun control advocates concerned about high levels of gun violence in the United States look to restrictions on gun ownership as a way to stem the violence and say that increased gun ownership leads to higher levels of crime suicide and other negative outcomes Gun rights groups say that a well armed civilian populace prevents crime and that making civilian ownership of firearms illegal would increase the crime rate by making civilians vulnerable to criminal activity They say that more civilians defend themselves with a gun every year than the law enforcement arrest for violent crimes and burglary and that civilians legally shoot almost as many criminals as law enforcement officers do br Studies using FBI data and Police Reports of the incidents have found that there are approximately verified instances of firearms used in self defense annually in the United States Survey based research derived from data gathered by the National Crime Victimization Survey has generated estimates that out of roughly million violent crime victims in the U S annually approximately percent or used a firearm in self defense for the year period When including property crimes of the million victims of property crimes annually found in the survey million for the NCV survey data yielded estimates that around percent of property crime victims or annually for the year period used a firearm in self defense from the loss of property Researchers working from the most recent NCVS data sets have found approximately uses of a firearm in self defense in the U S each year for the years In addition the United States has a higher rate of firearm ownership than any other nation The United States gun homicide rate while high compared to other developed nations has been declining since the s br br Gun Control has limited the availability of firearms to many individuals Some of the limitations include any persons who have been dishonorably discharged from the military any person that has renounced their United States citizenship has been declared mentally ill or committed to a mental institution is a fugitive is a user or addicted to a controlled substance and anyone illegally in the country Still in according to the Center for Disease Control there were homicides in the United States Firearms were used in or a little over of all homicides There were also suicides that were performed with the assistance of a firearm In total in firearms were involved in the deaths of Americans According to Rifat Darina Kamal and Charles Burton in study data presented by Priedt showed that just the homicide rate by itself was times greater than the rates of Australia Sweden and France Due to the increase in mass shootings in the United States new laws are being passed Recently Colorado became the fifteenth state to pass the Red Flag bill which gives judges the authority to remove firearms from those believed to be a high risk of harming others or themselves This Red Flag law has now been proposed in twenty three states br br br Criminal violence br br There is an open debate regarding a causal connection or the lack of one between gun control and its effect on gun violence and other crimes The numbers of lives saved or lost by gun ownership are debated by criminologists Research difficulties include the difficulty of accounting accurately for confrontations in which no shots are fired and jurisdictional differences in the definition of crime br br Such research is also subject to a more fundamental difficulty affecting all research in this field the effectiveness of the Criminal Law in preventing crime in general or in specific cases is inherently and notoriously difficult to prove and measure and thus issues in establishing a causal link between gun control or particular gun control policies and violent crime must be understood to be an aspect of a more general empirical difficulty which pervades the fields of Criminology and Law at large It is not simple for example to prove a causal connection between the laws against murder and the prevailing murder rates either Consequently this general background must be appreciated when discussing the causal and empirical issues here br A study published in The American Journal of Economics and Sociology in concluded that the amount of gun related crime and deaths is affected more by the state of the area in terms of unemployment alcohol problems and drug problems instead of the laws and regulations This study analyzed statistics gathered on the amount of gun crime in states with strict and lenient gun policies and determined that the amount of gun crime is related to how impoverished an area is br A CDC study determined The Task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes They go on to state a finding of insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness but rather as an indicator that additional research is needed before an intervention can be evaluated for its effectiveness br br br Homicide br br With of the world s population U S residents own roughly of the world s civilian owned firearms In addition up to of households within America have guns According to the UNODC of U S homicides in were perpetrated using a firearm U S homicide rates vary widely from state to state In the lowest homicide rates were in New Hampshire North Dakota and Vermont each per people and the highest were in Louisiana and Mississippi br Gary Kleck a criminologist at Florida State University and his colleague Marc Gertz published a study in estimating that approximately million American adults used their gun in self defense annually The incidents that Kleck extrapolated based on his questionnaire results generally did not involve the firing of the gun and he estimates that as many as million of those instances involved a handgun These studies have been subject to criticism on a number of methodological and logical grounds and Kleck has responded with a rebuttal br Another study from the same period the National Crime Victimization Survey NCVS estimated DGUs Defensive gun use annually The NCVS survey differed from Kleck s study in that it only interviewed those who reported a threatened attempted or completed victimization for one of six crimes rape robbery assault burglary non business larceny and motor vehicle theft The NCVS however does not actually directly ask about defensive gun use so estimates of this set of events are not very meaningful A National Research Council report said that Kleck s estimates appeared to be exaggerated and that it was almost certain that some of what respondents designate d as their own self defense would be construed as aggression by others br In a review of research of the effects of gun rates on crime rates Kleck determined that of studies addressing homicide rate half of them found a connection between gun ownership and homicide but these were usually the least rigorous studies Only six studies controlled at least six statistically significant confound variables and none of them showed a significant positive effect Eleven macro level studies showed that crime rates increase gun levels not vice versa The reason that there is no opposite effect may be that most owners are noncriminals and that they may use guns to prevent violence br Commenting on the external validity of Kleck s report David Hemenway director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center said Given the number of victims allegedly being saved with guns it would seem natural to conclude that owning a gun substantially reduces your chances of being murdered Yet a careful case control study of homicide in the home found that a gun in the home was associated with an increased rather than a reduced risk of homicide Virtually all of this risk involved homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance Kleck however pointed out that most of the firearms used in the Kellermann study were not the same ones kept in the household by the victim Similarly in when the Permit To Purchase law was repealed in Missouri saw a increase in the rate of firearm homicides in that year alone and the figure continues to be higher than the figure pre br br One study found that homicide rates as a whole especially those as a result of firearms use are not always significantly lower in many other developed countries Kleck wrote cross national comparisons do not provide a sound basis for assessing the impact of gun ownership levels on crime rates One study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology found that for the year of During the one year study period firearm deaths were reported Overall firearm mortality rates are five to six times higher in high income HI and upper middle income UMI countries in the Americas than in Europe or Oceania and times higher than in Asia The rate of firearm deaths in the United States per exceeds that of its economic counterparts eightfold and that of UMI countries by a factor of Suicide and homicide contribute equally to total firearm deaths in the U S but most firearm deaths are suicides in HI countries and homicides in UMI countries br br br Suicide br br Firearms accounted for of U S suicides in and suicides account for of all firearm related deaths A review by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health found that in the United States the percent of suicide attempts that prove fatal is strongly related to the availability of household firearms Prior to this one book written by criminologist Gary Kleck in the s stated that they found no relationship between gun availability and suicide rates br br br Public health crisis br Though the CDC does not prescribe firearm legislation measures due to limited policy related research findings a CDC Vital Signs report identifies firearm related death as a significant and growing public health problem in the United States The same report states that firearm related violence in the U S is linked to widening racial and ethnic inequalities br A correspondence between researchers at the University of Michigan and the New England Journal of Medicine states that generational investments are being made in the prevention of firearm violence including new funding opportunities from the CDC and the National Institutes of Health The correspondence refers to funding for the prevention of community violence that has been proposed in federal infrastructure legislation The researchers emphasize the significance of such policy measures as a preventative public health solution in light of data indicating rising child mortality as a result of firearm related incidents citing statistical evidence of firearm related deaths replacing motor vehicle accidents as the leading cause of child mortality in br In the Public Health Law Research program an independent organization published several evidence briefs summarizing the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health that concern the effectiveness of various laws related to gun safety Among their findings br br There is not enough evidence to establish the effectiveness of shall issue laws as distinct from may issue laws as a public health intervention to reduce violent crime br There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of waiting period laws as public health interventions aimed at preventing gun related violence and suicide br Although child access prevention laws may represent a promising intervention for reducing gun related morbidity and mortality among children there is currently insufficient evidence to validate their effectiveness as a public health intervention aimed at reducing gun related harms br There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of such bans as public health interventions aimed at reducing gun related harms br There is insufficient evidence to validate the effectiveness of firearm licensing and registration requirements as legal interventions aimed to reduce firearm related harms br br br Federal and state laws br The number of federal and state gun laws is unknown A American Journal of Preventive Medicine study says and the NRA says though the Washington Post fact checker says of that decades old figure This figure appears to be an ancient guesstimate that has hardened over the decades into a constantly repeated never questioned talking point It could be lower or higher depending on who s counting what br br br Federal laws br br Federal gun laws are enforced by the Bureau

Owners Protection Act br Undetectable Firearms Act br Gun Free School Zones Act of ruled unconstitutional as originally written upheld after minor edits were made by Congress br Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act br Federal Assault Weapons Ban expired br br br State laws and constitutions br br In addition to federal gun laws all U S states and some local jurisdictions have imposed their own firearms restrictions Each of the fifty states has its own laws regarding guns br Provisions in State constitutions vary For example Hawaii s constitution simply copies the text of the Second Amendment verbatim while North Carolina and South Carolina begin with the same but continue with an injunction against maintaining standing armies Alaska also begins with the full text of the Second Amendment but adds that the right shall not be denied or infringed by the State or a political subdivision of the State Rhode Island subtracts the first half of the Second Amendment leaving only t he right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed br The majority of the remaining states constitutions differ from the text of the U S Constitution primarily in their clarification of exactly to whom the right belongs or by the inclusion of additional specific protections or restrictions Seventeen states refer to the right to keep and bear arms as being an individual right with Utah and Alaska referring to it explicitly as t he individual right to keep and bear arms while the other fifteen refer to the right as belonging to every citizen all individuals all persons or another very similar phrase In contrast are four states which make no mention whatever of an individual right or of defense of one s self as a valid basis for the right to arms Arkansas Massachusetts and Tennessee all state that the right is for the common defense while Virginia s constitution explicitly indicates that the right is derived from the need for a militia to defend the state br Most state constitutions enumerate one or more reasons for the keeping of arms Twenty four states include self defense as a valid protected use of arms twenty eight cite defense of the state as a proper purpose Ten states extend the right to defense of home and or property five include the defense of family and six add hunting and recreation Idaho is uniquely specific in its provision that n o law shall impose licensure registration or special taxation on the ownership or possession of firearms or ammunition Nor shall any law permit the confiscation of firearms except those actually used in the commission of a felony Fifteen state constitutions include specific restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms Florida s constitution calls for a three day waiting period for all modern cartridge handgun purchases with exceptions for handgun purchases by those holding a CCW license or for anyone who purchases a black powder handgun Illinois prefaces the right by indicating that it is s ubject to the police power Florida and the remaining thirteen states with specific restrictions all carry a provision to the effect that the state legislature may enact laws regulating the carrying concealing and or wearing of arms Forty states preempt some or all local gun laws due in part to campaigning by the NRA for such legislation br br br See also br United States gun violence protests br
