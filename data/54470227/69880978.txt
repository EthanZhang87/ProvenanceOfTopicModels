gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale while those polled by PostTrak gave it an overall positive score with saying they would definitely recommend it br Adrian Horton of The Guardian awarded the film out of stars writing that it checks the boxes on the elements of a family friendly movie but also noting that it does not fully conjure the magic of other films in the genre Another mixed review was published on NPR by Bob Mondello who wrote that mostly the filmmakers detour decorate and digitize their story rather than telling it and that doesn t mesh well with the real world stuff dad s surgery for instance and Bea s wandering all over Brooklyn without her grandma seeming to notice And yes I know IF is a kid flick but it still needs grounding We re in Brooklyn not Willy Wonkaland RogerEbert com reviewer Clint Worthington called the film a well intentioned misfire br Tomris Laffly of Variety wrote that the movie was in desperate need of some coherent world building while praising the performance of Cailey Fleming in the lead role In a more negative review for The Hollywood Reporter Frank Scheck criticised the film as plagued by significant tonal shifts and pacing issues br Noah Berlatsky of Chicago Reader was even more dismissive stating IF makes you wish you were watching some other movie There s a fine line between the whimsical dream logic of Roald Dahl and irritating incoherent nonsense Director John Krasinski s new kids film IF is nowhere near that line Despite the best efforts of the extremely talented child actor Cailey Fleming IF makes no sense narratively emotionally or visually Several critics noted the film s sharing some similarities with the Cartoon Network animated series Foster s Home for Imaginary Friends which itself featured an orphanage that takes care of imaginary friends after their kids outgrow them and they leave after other children adopt them br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Official website br IF
