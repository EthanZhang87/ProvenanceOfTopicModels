contemplates his future life with Liz and their baby Liz corrects him by revealing that she is pregnant with twins br br Ron Perlman as Hellboy An immensely powerful demon who works for the government organization Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense B P R D Guillermo del Toro described the character s dilemma in the sequel He has always fought on the side of humans but this fantasy of destruction pushes his buttons to reconsider In the sequel Hellboy is armed with an enormous new gun called The Big Baby which fires flare like bullets Montse Rib plays a young version of Hellboy in an opening flashback br Selma Blair as Liz Sherman A pyrokinetic member of B P R D and Hellboy s girlfriend Blair described her character as more engaging in the sequel In the first one she was afraid to take a step She was completely a zombie not wanting to own up to her power and having the memory of what she d created in her life I was really eager to come and play Liz with a little more vibrancy Blair also had short hair for her role avoiding long hair from her portrayal in the first film which she felt brought her face down The actress emphasized Liz Sherman s growth in the sequel She s looking to the future much more and things are happening in this one that she has to buck up I think you re dealing with a lot knowing this young girl that we last saw as very damaged and now she s with this guy and all these people around her I think we ve really had to step up a strength and a confidence in her so that I don t look like the little baby kid sister tagging along br Doug Jones as three characters br Abe Sapien An ichthyo sapien psychic who works for B P R D with Hellboy Jones said of his return to the role after the first film He s been an absolute treat for me to play this time He s written with so many different colours and levels and there s a love interest And his buddy time with Hellboy is more concrete and his brother sister time with Liz is even better Jones believed that Abe Sapien became the brains the intellect of the team while Hellboy protects his character because he is still kind of innocent The actor pointed to his character s adolescence with love His love life is something that s never been tapped into before So just like a year old with his first crush this is how you re going to see Abe this time A portion of him Will this affect his decision making powers Unlike the first movie where Abe s voice was dubbed by David Hyde Pierce Doug Jones provided the voice himself br Angel of Death A female angel with androgynous characteristics Jones explained his portrayal The script refers to the angel as a her and that s what I do I think she has feminine qualities but she s not totally a woman either And that s okay I like characters that keep you guessing br Chamberlain The door keeper for King Balor The creature is long gangly eight feet tall and wears silk and velvet robes It also has long spindly fingers which filmmakers mobilized with servos and which Jones wore as extensions of his own hands br John Alexander and James Dodd as Johann Krauss Krauss is a German psychic whose ectoplasmic being is contained in a suit after a botched s ance Originally filmmakers planned to create a computer generated version of the glass fishbowl helmet but with the cost being prohibitive they created an actual helmet To ensure the invisibility of the actor s head under the glass perspective and mirror tricks were used The helmet was controlled by two puppeteers so the heavy contraption had to be shared between Alexander and Dodd br Seth MacFarlane voices Johann Krauss having taken over from Thomas Kretschmann after del Toro decided that Kretschmann s voice and the mechanical sound effects to Johann s suit did not mesh well br John Alexander also performs and voices the Bethmoora Goblin a legless goblin who helps Hellboy and the team find the Angel of Death He is the master goblin blacksmith who forged the Golden Army and lost his original legs in the process br Luke Goss as Prince Nuada Silverlance King Balor s son and a martial arts expert of extraordinary proficiency Goss was previously cast as mutant vampire Jared Nomak in del Toro s film Blade II and the director approached the actor to be cast in Hellboy II The only other actor considered for the part was Charlie Hunnam Goss trained with action director and former Jackie Chan Stunt Team member Brad Allan learning sword and spear skills for six to seven months for his role He and Anna Walton also learned ancient Gaelic from a dialog coach for their lines Goss did not perceive Nuada as evil explaining It s issues his people he s part of what he truly believes I don t think really he s so deluded He is driven by an ethic that was instilled by the person he has problems with that is his father and inevitably that leads into the conflict with him and Hellboy Goss also noted that his character admired and revered his twin sister portrayed by Anna Walton He said of the prince and the princess There is an incestuous relationship that s not maybe overly obvious to everybody but some people hopefully will pick up on the fact certainly from my direction towards her br Anna Walton as Princess Nuala King Balor s daughter and Nuada s twin sister She is described as very light while Nuada is very dark creating a yin and yang dynamic She elaborated on the incestuous tones between her character and Prince Nuada He s the dark side and she s the light side and they re pulled apart and pulled back together again and she s trying to get away because she knows there is something she has to do He can t let that go and they can t really do anything without each other so it s a really interesting thing Her character also forms a relationship with Abe Sapien and Walton noted their similarities They are both slightly lost souls and they understand each other Walton spoke of her character s sense of purpose She feels very strongly about what she has to do in the film and then her absolute connection and love for the Earth and what we are given That s what she s here to protect Her relationship with her brother and how he is almost a part of her but she has to break away and will do whatever it takes to stop him from achieving what he wants to achieve which is the mass destruction of mankind br Jeffrey Tambor as Tom Manning Head of the B P R D he has a slightly antagonistic relationship with Hellboy br John Hurt as Trevor Bruttenholm Hellboy s adoptive father he is seen in the beginning of the film telling young Hellboy the story of the Golden Army br Brian Steele as four of the trolls br Mr Wink A giant cave troll who was originally conceived by Guillermo del Toro Wink was sculpted by Mario Torres and the costume was worn by Brian Steele In the film Wink s right arm has a giant metal fist The fist was designed by filmmakers to be made of heavy plastic to stay light enough for motors to operate the mechanical fingers The fist could also be physically detached and used as a projectile without any computer generated imagery used Several of Mike Mignola s comics characters wield similar mechanical fists on chains including the Kriegaffes used by Herman von Klempt Likewise Mr Wink has an old wound on the left side of his face that has closed one of his eyes Del Toro said that he named Mr Wink after Selma Blair s one eyed dog which Blair confirms in a commentary track for the DVD release br Cathedral Head A troll who is the owner of a map shop who gives Princess Nuala the hidden map br

announced by Revolution Studios with del Toro returning to direct and Ron Perlman reprising his lead role as the title character The director sought to create a film trilogy with the first sequel anticipated for release in Revolution Studios planned to produce the film and distribute it through a deal with Columbia Pictures but by their distribution deal was not renewed and Revolution began refocusing on exploiting their film library In August Universal Pictures acquired the project with the intent to finance and distribute the sequel which was newly scheduled to be released in summer of Production was scheduled to begin in April in Etyek Hungary near Budapest and London England br Director Guillermo del Toro explored several concepts for the sequel initially planning to recreate the classic versions of Frankenstein Dracula and the Wolf Man He and comic book creator Mike Mignola also spent a few days adapting the Almost Colossus story featuring Roger the Homunculus They then found it easier to create an original story based on folklore because del Toro was planning Pan s Labyrinth and Mignola s comics were becoming increasingly based on mythology Later del Toro pitched a premise to Revolution Studios that involved four Titans from the four corners of Earth Wind Water Fire and Earth before he replaced the Titans with a Golden Army Mignola described the theme of the sequel The focus is more on the folklore and fairy tale aspect of Hellboy It s not Nazis machines and mad scientists but the old gods and characters who have been kind of shoved out of our world br Del Toro released Pan s Labyrinth in and the film earned multiple Academy Awards providing the director enough clout to begin production on the film Guillermo del Toro began filming the film in June in Budapest and concluded in December The film was the first American production to shoot at Korda Studios in Hungary then newly built outside Budapest The creature shop was led by the company Spectral Motion and Filmefex contributed work in makeup and prosthetics The latter company designed a creature for the troll market scene and built several statues and full size replicas of the Golden

grossing million br In its second weekend in the United States and Canada the film s box office performance dropped to gross million a larger drop than its predecessor which dropped in comparison The

consensus reads Guillermo del Toro crafts a stellar comic book sequel boasting visuals that are as imaginative as the characters are endearing On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of based on reviews indicating generally favorable reviews br Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four the same rating he gave the first film writing In every way the equal of del Toro s original Hellboy although perhaps a little noisier it s another celebration of his love for bizarre fantasy and diabolical machines Michael Rechtshaffen writing in The Hollywood Reporter said Hellboy II was an uncompromised vision of del Toro s imagination He said that with the director given free rein the film came across as an amalgam of the best moments from his previous films only with better visual effects John Anderson of Variety wrote of a rococo precision to the visuals that exceeded that of the first film He cited del Toro s clockmaker s preoccupation with detail and ability to blend state of the art technology with more classical visuals as the reasons for the film s success Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the plot did not often deviate from its comic book traditions but that del Toro staged the action brilliantly He said that while the visual effects deserved recognition what made the film so exciting was the personality they were imbued with Chuck Wilson of The Village Voice said that del Toro was on autopilot but that he and his Pan s Labyrinth crew cinematographer Guillermo Navarro in particular staged the steady stream of action set pieces expertly Mike Goodridge of Screen International wrote that del Toro had retained the B movie tone of the first film saying the film managed to avoid the self importance of The Incredible Hulk and the Batman film series and that del Toro was simply a great storyteller providing a good time Stuart Levine in Premiere praised the visuals and beautiful set pieces but said del Toro s script fell a little short of his direction Alonso Duralde writing for msnbc com said it represented a backwards step for del Toro saying that despite several creepy sequences the film was a return to the muddled storytelling and pretty visuals of his pre Pan s Labyrinth films He said del Toro s screenplay lacked energy or momentum However Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian said almost the opposite was the case as he thinks it is a crackingly enjoyable and exciting sequel with something that the memory of Pan s Labyrinth might have entirely erased a sense of humour Noting that this spectacular movie seethes and fizzes with wit and energy absorbing and transforming influences such as Ghostbusters and even Harry Potter and the secret world of Diagon Alley br John Anderson said the film would be almost unthinkable without Ron Perlman in the lead role saying the film was more successful than its predecessor mainly due to the more deliberately amusing tone and the drily ironic title character He said the only weak link was Luke Goss s unimposing villain While praising the general banter between Perlman and Blair Stuart Levine said the nonchalant Hellboy exhibited insufficient growth as a character and that Jeffrey Tambor was largely wasted in his role He agreed that Goss s villain was weak as written with no tangible menace Helen O Hara of Empire said the character was only let down by a lack of screentime in which to give him enough dramatic weight and that Goss did a perfectly good job Owen Gleiberman said Perlman was more assured than in the first Hellboy funnier and more cantankerous He said the entire ensemble had an appealing outsize grandeur about it Mike Goodridge said the film carefully developed the character relationships and Chuck Wilson said that other than the title character s penchant for chewing cigars he was otherwise uninteresting Alonso Duralde wrote that the sitcom ish character dilemmas were uninteresting saying that Perlman and Tambor s performances were regularly let down by the script He said that Blair s performance was possibly the first bad one he d seen by the actress and that while Jones was brilliant physically his vocal performance was inferior to David Hyde Pierce s in the first Hellboy film Michael Rechtshaffen called Perlman terrific and said Blair s brooding portrayal was effective br Michael Rechtshaffen concluded that Hellboy II was less focused than the first film but that it played faster and looser and mostly a wild ride In a positive review John Anderson s main criticism was a sequence set in Northern Ireland which he called the least interesting and most conventional segment of the film Chuck Wilson said the film didn t have much on its mind but that it would amaze children and amuse adults Stuart Levine said the film was worth viewers time and Alonso Duralde said Hellboy II was limp and unengaging Owen Gleiberman surmised that the film was derivative yet dazzling and Mike Goodridge concluded by praising the filmmakers skill at creating a film that despite featuring stunning action sequences and creature effects still found time for character development and a fulfilling story that expanded the franchise s wider mythology Peter Bradshaw suggested that Visionary is a word too easily applied to fantasy movies but it sticks easily here br The film appeared on some critics top ten lists of the best films of Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald named it the fifth best film of along with The Dark Knight and Stephanie Zacharek of Salon named it the tenth best film of along with Iron Man br br Guillermo del Toro and Matthew Robbins co authored the short story Tasty Teeth which was published in the anthology Hellboy Odder Jobs by Dark Horse Comics In the story Hellboy encounters tooth fairies in a tomb in Romania featuring elements that were later incorporated into the auction house sequence in the film br br This story by

Toro affirms his and Mignola s admiration of Velasco s clean propulsive narrative draftsmanship and artistic skills and states that the intention of this title is to treat the film s opening narrative as a mini epic and give the artist the opportunity to tell it with unlimited budget and shooting time br In the story Professor Trevor Bruttenholm caring for the young Hellboy at Douglas Air Force Base New Mexico on Christmas Eve relates the story of the Golden Army from the film s opening prologue which he describes as the first tale ever told as a bedtime story that he ends by saying one day

antagonist from the comics br br Included as a special feature on the DVD is an animated comic that foreshadows the events of the next film In the Zinco Epilogue a group of men go into Rasputin s tomb and find Kroenen s body After bringing Kroenen to a doctor along with instructions to revive him with an alchemical manual Zinco and his party travel to an arctic cave with Zinco as the only survivor Upon entering the cavern Zinco opens a container he has with him containing the preserved head of Kroenen and attaches it to a giant robot As soon as it is attached the cyborg awakens and the spirit of Rasputin appears stating that he has one more job for him br br Del Toro had expressed interest in a sequel saying I think we would all come back to do a third Hellboy if they can wait for me to get out of Middle Earth but we don t know Ron may want to do it sooner but I certainly know where we re going with the movie on the third one On May Guillermo del Toro dropped out of directing The Hobbit br In June Del Toro speculated that Hellboy III might happen after his next project but said that the screenplay had yet to be written br On July after being inspired by a recent Make A Wish function in which Ron Perlman appeared in full Hellboy makeup for a terminally ill boy Del Toro stated I can say publicly that now we are together in trying to do Hellboy br On April in an interview with Comic Book Resources Hellboy creator Mike Mignola commented that the possibility of a third Hellboy film seemed unlikely stating The biggest problem I see as far as PR for the next billion years is explaining endlessly that there s no Hellboy movie br On June del Toro discussed the possibility of developing Hellboy at Legendary Pictures He stated I hate giving pieces about it but last night we were at dinner and Ron said I would be very happy to do Hellboy again when are we doing Hellboy Thomas Tull said I would love to see Hellboy He didn t say he would love to do it he just said he d like to see it but today I ll ask him Ron Perlman added his support for the idea stating Not just anybody can make this movie I loved working for Legendary and I know for Guillermo working on Pacific Rim was one of his greatest experiences The reason I loved working for them is because Guillermo was so happy I came in six months into the shoot and he seemed as fresh as a daisy simply because he was working for someone who appreciated and supported his outlandish visions of what he wanted to put on the screen My immediate silent wish was wouldn t it be great if these guys came in and helped resolve the Hellboy series br Del Toro suggested telling the story of Hellboy in comic book form but Mignola vetoed the idea br On June in an interview Ron Perlman spoke about Hellboy saying Hellboy needs to be twice as big as Hellboy or Hellboy It s all of these oracles coming home to roost with these apocalyptic things taking place Guillermo s version of this resolve in the trilogy is epic in scope Not just anybody can make this movie It has to be somebody who s no stranger to this sense of scope For me to do Hellboy it could kill me in terms of physically demanding for a guy my age but it s worth it because anyone who sits and listens to Guillermo s version of how this thing ends is completely seduced It s so theatrical and compelling and if you liked the first two movies in any way shape or form this is the ultimate one two punch br On July in a Reddit AMA Del Toro said Well you know we don t have that movie on the horizon but the idea for it was to have Hellboy finally come to terms with the fact that his destiny his inevitable destiny is to become the beast of the Apocalypse and having him and Liz face the sort of that part of his nature and he has to do it in order to be able to ironically vanquish the foe that he has to face in the rd film He has to become the beast of the Apocalypse to be able to defend humanity but at the same time he becomes a much darker being It s a very interesting ending to the series but I don t think it will happen We have gone through basically every studio and asked for financing and they are not interested I think that the first movie made its budget back and a little bit of profit but then it was very very big on video and DVD The story repeated itself with the second already it made its money back at the box office but a small margin of profit in the release of the theatrical print but was very very big on DVD and video Sadly now from a business point of view all the studios know is that you don t have that safety net of the DVD and video so they view the project as dangerous br In July del Toro said that Legendary Pictures might fund Hellboy if Pacific Rim Uprising does well at the box office The hard fact is that the movie s going to need about million and there s nobody knocking down our doors to give it to us It s a little beyond Kickstarter After del Toro left the director s chair for Pacific Rim Uprising the deal fell through br In February Del Toro announced via Twitter Must report that Hellboy will not happen br In July Perlman said that he would still love to finish the trilogy with del Toro ignoring the reboot and that he thought it could happen if financing could be found In January Perlman encouraged Del Toro to proceed with the sequel saying that they owed it to the fans to get it done and that it would be an epic conclusion br In Hellboy screenwriter Peter Briggs was asked by Universal to script a spin off centring on Prince Nuada and provisionally agreed that Briggs could direct the film in New Zealand Briggs began work on an outline with co writer Aaron Mason Titled Hellboy Silverlance the script was a B P R D story featuring Abe Sapien as the main character with Hellboy in a supporting role Moving into the new B P R D headquarters in Colorado Abe is troubled by his psychic connection with Princess Nuala and begins researching the elves history The film would have shown Nuada s adventures throughout history including his rivalry with a fairy courtier who orchestrates Nuada s exile in hopes of marrying Nuala and seizing control of the fairy kingdom Nuada first meeting Mister Wink by saving him from a troupe of soldiers during the Spanish Inquisition and Nuada in Nazi Germany engineering a pact to keep various supernatural entities safe during World War II with Nuada and Kroenen fighting in a friendly match for Project Ragnarok men Doug Jones would have played both Abe and the Angel of Death who strikes a bargain with Nuada Rupert Evans s Agent Myers would also have returned The story climaxed at the new B P R D headquarters with the return of Rasputin s summoning gauntlet Universal wanted to proceed with the project but it emerged that del Toro s Hellboy was still a possibility so Silverlance was shelved br In Briggs received another call from Universal saying that Hellboy had been cancelled and asking him and Mason to return for a reworked Silverlance with producer Lawrence Gordon involved The caveat was that Hellboy could not appear but the writers managed to get the character a cameo appearance at the climax If successful the film would have launched a From the Files of the B P R D spin off series br In May Briggs affirmed that with the announcement of the Hellboy reboot the Silverlance project was dead br In September Perlman stated that he was still interested in making a third film with del Toro to complete the trilogy br br About Mignola writer Andrew Cosby and the producers began work on the story for a new film The project was initially intended as a sequel to del Toro s films but Perlman was unwilling to star without del Toro involved When Neil Marshall joined it was decided that the new film would be a reboot br On May it was announced that Millennium Films was in negotiations with producers Larry Gordon and Lloyd Levin for a film with the working title Hellboy Rise of the Blood Queen with Marshall is in talks to direct and Stranger Things star David Harbour expected to play Hellboy Hellboy creator Mike Mignola co wrote the script with Cosby and Christopher Golden On August Lionsgate confirmed that the project would finally only be known as Hellboy The film was released on April to negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office br In February Millennium Media announced plans for a new live action reboot titled Hellboy The Crooked Man the first in a potential series of films Production is scheduled to begin in March in Bulgaria with Brian Taylor directing from a
