id: 6675
Conservatism is a cultural social and political philosophy and ideology that seeks to promote and preserve traditional institutions customs and values The central tenets of conservatism may vary in relation to the culture and civilisation in which it appears In Western culture depending on the particular nation conservatives seek to promote and preserve a range of institutions such as the nuclear family organised religion the military the nation state property rights rule of law aristocracy and monarchy Conservatives tend to favour institutions and practices that enhance social order and historical continuity br Edmund Burke an th century Anglo Irish statesman who opposed the French Revolution but supported the American Revolution is credited as one of the forefathers of conservative thought in the s along with Savoyard statesman Joseph de Maistre The first established use of the term in a political context originated in with Fran ois Ren de Chateaubriand during the period of Bourbon Restoration that sought to roll back the policies of the French Revolution and establish social order br Conservatism has varied considerably as it has adapted itself to existing traditions and national cultures Thus conservatives from different parts of the world each upholding their respective traditions may disagree on a wide range of issues One of the three major ideologies along with liberalism and socialism conservatism is the dominant ideology in many nations across the world including Hungary Iran Israel Japan Poland Russia and South Korea Historically associated with right wing politics the term has been used to describe a wide range of views Conservatism may be either libertarian or authoritarian populist or elitist progressive or reactionary moderate or extreme br br br Beliefs and principles br Scholars have tried to define conservatism as a set of beliefs or principles Andrew Heywood argues that the five central beliefs of conservatism are tradition human imperfection organic society authority hierarchy and property Russell Kirk developed five canons of conservatism in The Conservative Mind br br A belief in a transcendent order which Kirk described variously as based in tradition divine revelation or natural law br An affection for the variety and mystery of human existence br A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize natural distinctions br A belief that property and freedom are closely linked br A faith in custom convention and prescription and a recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs which entails a respect for the political value of prudence br Some political scientists such as Samuel P Huntington have seen conservatism as situational Under this definition conservatives are seen as defending the established institutions of their time According to Quintin Hogg the chairman of the British Conservative Party in Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude a constant force performing a timeless function in the development of a free society and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself Conservatism is often used as a generic term to describe a right wing viewpoint occupying the political spectrum between classical liberalism and fascism br Conservatism has been called a philosophy of human imperfection by No l O Sullivan reflecting among its adherents a negative view of human nature and pessimism of the potential to improve it through utopian schemes Thomas Hobbes the intellectual godfather of the realist right argued that the state of nature for humans was poor nasty brutish and short requiring centralised authority with a strong monarchy and powerful state Edmund Burke often called the father of modern conservatism believed that society needs traditional institutions such as an established church and a landed aristocracy in order to function since human beings are steeped in original sin br br br Tradition br Despite the lack of a universal definition certain themes can be recognised as common across conservative thought According to Michael Oakeshott br br To be conservative is to prefer the familiar to the unknown to prefer the tried to the untried fact to mystery the actual to the possible the limited to the unbounded the near to the distant the sufficient to the superabundant the convenient to the perfect present laughter to utopian bliss br Such traditionalism may be a reflection of trust in time tested methods of social organisation giving votes to the dead Traditions may also be steeped in a sense of identity br br br Hierarchy br In contrast to the tradition based definition of conservatism some left wing political theorists like Corey Robin define conservatism primarily in terms of a general defence of social and economic inequality From this perspective conservatism is less an attempt to uphold old institutions and more a meditation on and theoretical rendition of the felt experience of having power seeing it threatened and trying to win it back On another occasion Robin argues for a more complex relation br br Conservatism is a defense of established hierarchies but it is also fearful of those established hierarchies It sees in their assuredness of power the source of corruption decadence and decline Ruling regimes require some kind of irritant a grain of sand in the oyster to reactivate their latent powers to exercise their atrophied muscles to make their pearls br In Conservatism A Rediscovery political philosopher Yoram Hazony argues that in a traditional conservative community members have importance and influence to the degree they are honoured within the social hierarchy which includes factors such as age experience and wisdom Conservatives often glorify hierarchies as demonstrated in an aphorism by conservative philosopher Nicol s G mez D vila Hierarchies are celestial In hell all are equal The word hierarchy has religious roots and translates to rule of a high priest br br br Authority br Authority is a core tenet of conservatism More specifically conservatives tend to believe in traditional authority According to Max Weber this form of authority is resting on an established belief in the sanctity of immemorial traditions and the legitimacy of those exercising authority under them Alexandre Koj ve distinguishes between two different forms of traditional authority br br The Authority of the Father represented by actual fathers as well as conceptual fathers such as priests and monarchs br The Authority of the Master represented by aristocrats and military commanders br Robert Nisbet acknowledges that the decline of traditional authority in the modern world is partly linked with the retreat of old institutions such as guild order parish and family institutions that formerly acted as intermediaries between the state and the individual Hannah Arendt claims that the modern world suffers an existential crisis with a dramatic breakdown of all traditional authorities which are needed for the continuity of an established civilisation br br br Historical background br Edmund Burke has been widely regarded as the philosophical founder of modern conservatism He served as the private secretary to the Marquis of Rockingham and as official pamphleteer to the Rockingham branch of the Whig party Together with the Tories they were the conservatives in the late th century United Kingdom br br Burke s views were a mixture of conservatism and republicanism He supported the American Revolution of but abhorred the violence of the French Revolution of He accepted the conservative ideals of private property and the economics of Adam Smith but he thought that capitalism should remain subordinate to the conservative social ethic and that the business class should be subordinate to aristocracy He insisted on standards of honour derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition and saw the aristocracy as the nation s natural leaders That meant limits on the powers of the Crown since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive He favoured an established church but allowed for a degree of religious toleration Burke ultimately justified the social order on the basis of tradition tradition represented the wisdom of the species and he valued community and social harmony over social reforms br br Another form of conservatism developed in France in parallel to conservatism in Britain It was influenced by Counter Enlightenment works by philosophers such as Joseph de Maistre and Louis de Bonald Many continental conservatives do not support separation of church and state with most supporting state cooperation with the Catholic Church such as had existed in France before the Revolution Conservatives were also early to embrace nationalism which was previously associated with liberalism and the Revolution in France Another early French conservative Fran ois Ren de Chateaubriand espoused a romantic opposition to modernity contrasting its emptiness with the full heart of traditional faith and loyalty Elsewhere on the continent German thinkers Justus M ser and Friedrich von Gentz criticised the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen that came of the Revolution Opposition was also expressed by German idealists such as Adam M ller and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel the latter inspiring both leftist and rightist followers br Both Burke and Maistre were critical of democracy in general though their reasons differed Maistre was pessimistic about humans being able to follow rules while Burke was sceptical about humans innate ability to make rules For Maistre rules had a divine origin while Burke believed they arose from custom The lack of custom for Burke and the lack of divine guidance for Maistre meant that people would act in terrible ways Both also believed that liberty of the wrong kind led to bewilderment and political breakdown Their ideas would together flow into a stream of anti rationalist romantic conservatism but would still stay separate Whereas Burke was more open to argumentation and disagreement Maistre wanted faith and authority leading to a more illiberal strain of thought br br br Ideological variants br br br Authoritarian conservatism br br Authoritarian conservatism refers to autocratic regimes that portray authority as absolute and unquestionable Authoritarian conservative movements show strong devotion towards religion tradition and culture while also expressing fervent nationalism akin to other far right nationalist movements Examples of authoritarian conservative dictators include Marshal Philippe P tain in France Regent Mikl s Horthy in Hungary General Ioannis Metaxas in Greece King Alexander I in Yugoslavia Prime Minister Ant nio de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in Austria Generalissimo Francisco Franco in Spain and King Carol II in Romania br Authoritarian conservative movements were prominent in the same era as fascism with which it sometimes clashed Although both ideologies shared core values such as nationalism and had common enemies such as communism there was nonetheless a contrast between the traditionalist and elitist nature of authoritarian conservatism and the revolutionary and populist nature of fascism thus it was common for authoritarian conservative regimes to suppress rising fascist and Nazi movements The hostility between the two ideologies is highlighted by the struggle for power in Austria which was marked by the assassination of the ultra Catholic dictator Engelbert Dollfuss by Austrian Nazis Likewise Croatian fascists assassinated King Alexander I of Yugoslavia In Romania as the fascist Iron Guard was gaining popularity and Nazi Germany was making advances on the European political stage King Carol II ordered the execution of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and other top ranking Romanian fascists The exiled German Emperor Wilhelm II was an enemy of Adolf Hitler stating that Nazism made him ashamed to be a German for the first time in his life and referring to the Nazis as a bunch of shirted gangsters Ant nio de Oliveira Salazar who was Portugal s dictator for years denounced fascism and Nazism as a pagan Caesarism that did not recognise legal religious or moral limits br Political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset has examined the class basis of right wing extremist politics in the era He reports br br Conservative or rightist extremist movements have arisen at different periods in modern history ranging from the Horthyites in Hungary the Christian Social Party of Dollfuss in Austria Der Stahlhelm and other nationalists in pre Hitler Germany and Salazar in Portugal to the pre Gaullist movements and the monarchists in contemporary France and Italy The right extremists are conservative not revolutionary They seek to change political institutions in order to preserve or restore cultural and economic ones while extremists of the centre fascists Nazis and left communists anarchists seek to use political means for cultural and social revolution The ideal of the right extremist is not a totalitarian ruler but a monarch or a traditionalist who acts like one Many such movements in Spain Austria Hungary Germany and Italy have been explicitly monarchist The supporters of these movements differ from those of the centrists tending to be wealthier and more religious which is more important in terms of a potential for mass support br Edmund Fawcett claims that fascism is totalitarian populist and anti pluralist whereas authoritarian conservatism is somewhat pluralist but most of all elitist and anti populist He concludes The fascist is a nonconservative who takes anti liberalism to extremes The right wing authoritarian is a conservative who takes fear of democracy to extremes br During the Cold War right wing military dictatorships were prominent in Latin America with most nations being under military rule by the middle of the s One example of this was General Augusto Pinochet who ruled over Chile from to According to Erik von Kuehnelt Leddihn military dictatorships arise in democratic systems in order to stop leftist parties from becoming totalitarian The most recent instance occurred in Bolivia in when General Juan Jos Z iga staged a coup in order to overthrow the far left president Luis Arce br In the st century the authoritarian style of government experienced a worldwide renaissance with conservative statesmen such as President Vladimir Putin in Russia President Recep Tayyip Erdo an in Turkey Prime Minister Viktor Orb n in Hungary Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India and President Donald Trump in the United States br br br Liberal conservatism br br Liberal conservatism is a variant of conservatism that is strongly influenced by liberal stances It incorporates the classical liberal view of minimal economic interventionism meaning that individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference However individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation Originally opposed to capitalism and the industrial revolution the conservative ideology in many countries adopted economic liberalism especially in the United States where this ideology is known as fiscal conservatism br br br National conservatism br br National conservatism prioritises the defence of national and cultural identity often based on a theory of the family as a model for the state National conservatism is orientated towards upholding national sovereignty which includes limited immigration and a strong national defence In Europe national conservatives are usually eurosceptics Yoram Hazony has argued for national conservatism in his work The Virtue of Nationalism br br br Paternalistic conservatism br br Paternalistic conservatism is a strand in conservatism which reflects the belief that societies exist and develop organically and that members within them have obligations towards each other There is particular emphasis on the paternalistic obligation noblesse oblige of those who are privileged and wealthy to the poorer parts of society which is consistent with principles such as duty organicism and hierarchy Its proponents often stress the importance of a social safety net to deal with poverty supporting limited redistribution of wealth along with government regulation of markets in the interests of both consumers and producers br Paternalistic conservatism first arose as a distinct ideology in the United Kingdom under Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli s One Nation Toryism There have been a variety of one nation conservative governments in the United Kingdom with exponents such as Prime Ministers Disraeli Stanley Baldwin Neville Chamberlain Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan br In th century Germany Chancellor Otto von Bismarck adopted a set of social programs known as state socialism which included insurance for workers against sickness accident incapacity and old age The goal of this conservative state building strategy was to make ordinary Germans not just the Junker aristocracy more loyal to state and Emperor Chancellor Leo von Caprivi promoted a conservative agenda called the New Course br br br Progressive conservatism br br In the United States President Theodore Roosevelt has been identified as the main exponent of progressive conservatism Roosevelt stated that he had always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand The Republican administration of President William Howard Taft was progressive conservative and he described himself as a believer in progressive conservatism President Dwight D Eisenhower also declared himself an advocate of progressive conservatism br In Canada a variety of conservative governments have been part of the Red Tory tradition with Canada s former major conservative party being named the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada from to Prime Ministers Arthur Meighen R B Bennett John Diefenbaker Joe Clark Brian Mulroney and Kim Campbell led Red Tory federal governments br br br Reactionary conservatism br br Reactionary conservatism also known as reactionism opposes policies for the social transformation of society In popular usage reactionism refers to a staunch traditionalist conservative political perspective of a person who supports the status quo and opposes social political and economic change Some adherents of conservatism rather than opposing change seek to return to the status quo ante and tend to view the modern world in a negative light especially concerning mass culture and secularism although different groups of reactionaries may choose different traditional values to revive br Some political scientists such as Corey Robin treat the words reactionary and conservative as synonyms Others such as Mark Lilla argue that reactionism and conservatism are distinct worldviews Francis Wilson defines conservatism as a philosophy of social evolution in which certain lasting values are defended within the framework of the tension of political conflict br Some reactionaries favour a return to the status quo ante the previous political state of society which that person believes possessed positive characteristics absent from contemporary society An early example of a powerful reactionary movement was German Romanticism which centred around concepts of organicism medievalism and traditionalism against the forces of rationalism secularism and individualism that were unleashed in the French Revolution br In political discourse being a reactionary is generally regarded as negative Peter King observed that it is an unsought for label used as a torment rather than a badge of honor Despite this the descriptor has been adopted by intellectuals such as the Italian esoteric traditionalist Julius Evola the Austrian monarchist Erik von Kuehnelt Leddihn the Colombian political theologian Nicol s G mez D vila and the American historian John Lukacs br br br Religious conservatism br br Religious conservatism principally applies the teachings of particular religions to politics sometimes by merely proclaiming the value of those teachings at other times by having those teachings influence laws In most democracies political conservatism seeks to uphold traditional family structures and social values Religious conservatives typically oppose abortion LGBT behaviour or in certain cases identity drug use and sexual activity outside of marriage In some cases conservative values are grounded in religious beliefs and conservatives seek to increase the role of religion in public life br br Christian democracy is a moderately conservative centre right ideology inspired by Christian social teaching It originated as a reaction against the industrialisation and urbanisation associated with laissez faire capitalism In post war Europe Christian democratic parties dominated politics in several nations the Christian People s Party in Belgium CDU and CSU in Germany Fine Gael and Fianna F il in Ireland and Christian Democracy in Italy Many post war Europeans saw Christian democracy as a moderate alternative to the extremes of right wing nationalism and left wing communism Christian democratic parties were especially popular among European women who often voted for these parties to a large extent due to their pro family policies br br br Social conservatism br br Social conservatives believe that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty traditional values and established institutions and that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or practices A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores often by opposing what they consider radical policies or social engineering Some social conservative stances are the following br br Support of a culture of life and opposition to the destruction of human life at any stage including abortion embryonic stem cells research and euthanasia br Support of bioconservatism and opposition to both eugenics and transhumanism br Support of traditional family values viewing the nuclear family model as society s foundational unit br Support of a traditional definition of marriage as being one man and one woman and opposition to expansion of civil marriage and child adoption to couples in same sex relationships br Support of public morality with prohibition of drugs and prostitution and censorship of pornography br Support of organised religion and opposition to atheism and secularism especially when militant br br br Traditionalist conservatism br br Traditionalist conservatism also known as classical conservatism emphasises the need for the principles of natural law transcendent moral order tradition hierarchy organicism agrarianism classicism and high culture as well as the intersecting spheres of loyalty Some traditionalists have embraced the labels reactionary and counter revolutionary defying the stigma that has attached to these terms since the Enlightenment Having a hierarchical view of society many traditionalist conservatives including a few notable Americans such as Ralph Adams Cram William S Lind and Charles A Coulombe defend the monarchical political structure as the most natural and beneficial social arrangement br br br National variants br Conservative parties vary widely from country to country in the goals they wish to achieve Both conservative and classical liberal parties tend to favour private ownership of property in opposition to communist socialist and green parties which favour communal ownership or laws regulating responsibility on the part of property owners Where conservatives and liberals differ is primarily on social issues where conservatives tend to reject behaviour that does not conform to some social norm Modern conservative parties often define themselves by their opposition to liberal or socialist parties The United States usage of the term conservative is unique to that country where its first modern usage was for pro free enterprise opponents of the New Deal br br br Asia br br br China br br Chinese conservatism can be traced back to Confucius whose philosophy is based on the values of loyalty duty and respect He believed in a hierarchically organised society modeled after the patriarchal family and headed by an absolute sovereign However Confucius also believed that the state should employ a meritocratic class of administrators and advisers recruited by civil service exams An alternative school of thought called Legalism argued that administrative discipline not Confucian virtue was crucial for the governance of the state br For thousands of years China was ruled by monarchs of various imperial dynasties The Mandate of Heaven theory was invoked in order to legitimise the absolute authority of the Emperor The Xinhai Revolution of overthrew Puyi the last Chinese Emperor and ushered in the Republic of China Between and China was ruled by the nationalist party Kuomintang which became right wing after General Chiang Kai shek purged communists from his party Following his defeat in the Chinese Civil War by the Chinese Communist Party CCP Chiang continued ruling the island of Taiwan until his death in br On the mainland Chinese conservatism was vehemently opposed and suppressed by the CCP especially during the Cultural Revolution Members of the Five Black Categories landlords rich farmers counter revolutionaries bad influencers and right wingers were violently persecuted Traditional authorities such as parents and teachers were regularly defied and attacked Young people formed cadres of Red Guards throughout the country and sought to destroy the Four Olds old ideas old culture old customs and old habits leading to the destruction of a large part of China s cultural heritage including historical artifacts and religious sites Among them some Red Guards who embraced local officials were pejoratively called conservatives br In recent decades Chinese conservatism has experienced a national revival The ancient schools of Confucianism and Legalism have found greater acceptance in mainstream Chinese thought Widely regarded as the grey eminence and chief ideologue of the CCP Wang Huning has criticised aspects of Marxism and recommended that China combine its historical and modern values General Secretary Xi Jinping has called traditional Chinese culture the soul of the nation and the foundation of the CCP China has also developed a form of authoritarian capitalism in recent years further breaking with the orthodox communism of its past Neoauthoritarianism is a current of political thought that advocates a powerful state to facilitate market reforms br br br India br br Indian politics has long been dominated by aristocratic and religious elites in one of the most hierarchically stratified nations in the world In modern times the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP led by Narendra Modi represents conservative politics With over million members as of October the BJP is by far the world s largest political party It promotes Hindu nationalism quasi fascist Hindutva a hostile foreign policy against Pakistan and a conservative social and fiscal policy The BJP movement is both elitist and populist attracting privileged groups that fear encroachment on their dominant positions as well as plebeian groups that seek recognition around a majoritarian rhetoric of cultural pride social order and national strength br br br Iran br br The Pahlavi dynasty replaced the Qajar dynasty in after a coup d tat ruling Iran as a constitutional monarchy from until and then as an autocratic monarchy from the U S instigated coup d tat until In an attempt to introduce reform from above while preserving traditional relations of hierarchy the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi launched the White Revolution in as a series of reforms of aggressive modernisation resulting in a great redistribution of wealth from the aristocratic landlord class to Iran s working class and explosive economic growth in subsequent decades The Iranian Revolution of overthrew the monarchy and transformed the nation into the Islamic Republic of Iran thus replacing the progressive conservatism of the Shah monarchy with the reactionary conservatism of Islamic theocracy The two main political camps in today s Iran are the Principlists and the Reformists br br br Israel br br After the declaration of the State of Israel politics was initially dominated by left wing parties but overtime right wing parties became increasingly powerful with conservatism now being the dominant ideology Israeli conservatism is based around upholding Jewish culture promotion of forms of Zionism that tend to be more irredentist in nature i e Revisionist and

modern Japanese history The right wing conservative Liberal Democratic Party has been the dominant ruling party since often referred to as the System Therefore some experts consider Japan a democratically elected one party state since the populace always votes for the same conservative party br Up until Japan was largely a feudal state ruled by members of the aristocratic Samurai order with its bushido code of honour In the Meiji era a process of modernisation industrialisation and nationalisation was inititated Power struggles between the old decentralised Samurai aristocracy and the new centralised imperial monarchy culminated in the Satsuma Rebellion in with imperial victory During the era of World War II Japan was transformed into an ultranationalist imperialist state that conquered much of east and southeast Asia Contemporary conservatives notably during the second premiership of Shinzo Abe from to advocate for revising the country s constitution particularly Article which renounces war and prohibits Japan from maintaining a military br Japan is the oldest continuing monarchy in the history of mankind with Naruhito currently serving as Emperor of Japan In accordance with the principle of monarchy Japanese society has an authoritarian family structure with a traditionalist fatherly authority that is primarily transferred to the oldest son br Anti communist and anti Chinese sentiment is widespread in Japan In the Peace Preservation Law was enacted with the aim of allowing the Special Higher Police to suppress socialists and communists more effectively In the Empire of Japan and Nazi Germany opposed the Communist International Comintern by signing the Anti Comintern Pact a pact later joined by the Kingdom of Italy Francoist Spain and the Kingdom of Hungary The Japanese term tenk refers to the coerced ideological conversions of Japanese socialists who were induced to renounce leftist ideology and enthusiastically embrace the Emperor centric capitalist and imperialist ideology favoured by the state In the late s and early s during the Red Purge tens of thousands of supporters of left wing groups especially those affiliated with the Japanese Communist Party were removed from their jobs in government schools and universities br Nippon Kaigi is an ultraconservative and ultranationalist non governmental organisation that exerts a significant influence over contemporary Japanese politics In a majority of National Diet members were part of the group Many ministers and a few prime ministers including Fumio Kishida Tar As Shinz Abe and Yoshihide Suga have been members br A highly developed and industrialised nation Japan is more capitalistic and Western orientated than other Asian nations Indeed some experts consider Japan part of the Western world In a treaty was signed that established a military alliance between the United States and Japan However the ultraconservative reactionary traditionalist Yukio Mishima feared that his fellow Japanese were too enamored of modernisation and Western style capitalism to protect traditional Japanese culture br br br Singapore br br Singapore s only conservative party is the

have been moderate centrist and not left wing South Korea s major conservative party the People Power Party has changed its form throughout its history First it was the Democratic Liberal Party and its first head was Roh Tae woo who was the first President of the Sixth Republic of South Korea Democratic Liberal Party was founded by the merging of Roh Tae woo s Democratic Justice Party Kim Young

opposition party until Lee Myung bak won the presidential election of br br br Europe br European conservatism has taken many different expressions Early forms were often reactionary and romantic idealising the Middle Ages and its feudal social order with aristocratic rule and an established church In the late th century conservatism became increasingly progressive adopting capitalism and espousing nationalism which up until now had been anti traditionalist and anti imperialist forces During the first half of the th century as socialist movements were becoming more powerful and the Tsarist regime was overthrown in the Russian Revolution conservatism in Austria Germany Greece Hungary Italy Portugal Spain and Romania transformed into the far right becoming more authoritarian and extreme In the post war era conservatism assumed a more moderate form with centre right Christian democratic parties dominating politics across Western Europe throughout the rest of the century although the authoritarian regimes of Francoist Spain and Salazarian Portugal survived for a few more decades Towards the end of the century after the collapse of the Soviet Union conservatism took on a more liberal form In recent decades nationalist parties have been on the rise across Europe in opposition to globalism br European nations with the exception of Switzerland have had a long monarchical tradition throughout history Today existing monarchies are Andorra Belgium Denmark Liechtenstein Luxembourg Monaco the Netherlands Norway Spain Sweden and the United Kingdom Some reactionary movements in republican nations such as Action Fran aise in France the Monarchist National Party in Italy and the Black Yellow Alliance in Austria have advocated a restoration of the monarchy br br br Austria br br Austrian conservatism originated with Prince Klemens von Metternich who was the architect behind the monarchist and imperialist Conservative Order that was enacted at the Congress of Vienna in the aftermath of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars The goal was to establish a European balance of power that could guarantee peace and suppress republican and nationalist movements During its existence the Austrian Empire was the third most populous monarchy in Europe after the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom Following its defeat in the Austro Prussian War it transformed into the Austro Hungarian Empire which was the most diverse state in Europe with twelve nationalities living under a unifying monarch The Empire was fragmented in the aftermath of World War I ushering in the democratic First Austrian Republic br The Austrian Civil War in saw a series of skirmishes between the right wing government and socialist forces When the insurgents were defeated the government declared martial law and held mass trials forcing leading socialist politicians such as Otto Bauer into exile The conservatives banned the Social Democratic Party and replaced parliamentary democracy with a corporatist and clerical constitution The Patriotic Front into which the paramilitary Heimwehr and the Christian Social Party were merged became the only legal political party in the resulting authoritarian regime the Federal State of Austria br While having close ties to Fascist Italy which was still a monarchy as well as a fellow Catholic nation rightist Austria harboured strong anti Prussian and anti Nazi sentiment Austria s most prominent conservative intellectual the Catholic aristocrat Erik von Kuehnelt Leddihn published several books in which he interpreted Nazism as a leftist ochlocratic and demagogic ideology opposed to the traditional rightist ideals of aristocracy monarchy and Christianity Austria s dictator Engelbert Dollfuss saw Nazism as another form of totalitarian communism and he saw Adolf Hitler as the German version of Joseph Stalin The conservatives banned the Austrian Nazi Party and arrested many of its activists causing tens of thousands of Nazi sympathisers to flee to Nazi Germany in order to avoid persecution A few months later Nazi forces initiated the July Putsch and managed to assassinate Chancellor Dollfuss in an attempt to overthrow the conservative government In response Benito Mussolini mobilised a part of the Italian army on the Austrian border and threatened Hitler with war in the event of a German invasion of Austria In when Nazi Germany annexed Austria in the Anschluss conservative groups were suppressed members of the Austrian nobility and the Catholic clergy were arrested and their properties were confiscated br Following World War II and the return to democracy Austrian conservatives abandoned the authoritarianism of its past believing in political compromise and seeking consensus in the middle while Austrian socialists also abandoned their extremism and distanced themselves from revolutionary activities The conservatives formed the Austrian People s Party which has been the major conservative party in Austria ever since In contemporary politics the party was led by Sebastian Kurz whom the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung nicknamed the young Metternich br br br

II although the number of conservative groups and their lack of stability defy simple categorisation Following the war conservatives supported Gaullist groups and parties espoused nationalism and emphasised tradition social order and the regeneration of France Unusually post war conservatism in France was formed around the personality of a leader army general and aristocrat Charles de Gaulle who led the Free French Forces against Nazi Germany and it did not draw on traditional French conservatism but on the Bonapartist tradition Gaullism in France continues under The Republicans formerly

reactionary Romantic movement that swept Europe in the aftermath of the progressive Age of Enlightenment and its culmination in the anti conservative French Revolution German Romanticism was deeply organicist and medievalist finding expression philosophically among the Old Hegelians and judicially in the German historical school Prominent conservative exponents were Friedrich Schlegel Novalis Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder Friedrich Carl von Savigny and Adam M ller br br During the second half of the th century German conservatism developed alongside nationalism culminating in Germany s victory over France in the Franco Prussian War the creation of the unified German Empire in and the simultaneous rise of Iron Chancellor Otto von Bismarck on the European political stage Bismarck s balance of power model maintained peace in Europe for decades at the end of the th century His revolutionary conservatism was a conservative state building strategy based on class collaboration and designed to make ordinary Germans not just the Junker aristocracy more loyal to state and Emperor He created the modern welfare state in Germany in the s According to scholars his strategy was granting social rights to enhance the integration of a hierarchical society to forge a bond between workers and the state so as to strengthen the latter to maintain traditional relations of authority between social and status groups and to provide a countervailing power against the modernist forces of liberalism and socialism br Bismarck also enacted universal manhood suffrage in the new German Empire in He became a great hero to German conservatives who erected many monuments to his memory after he left office in br During the interwar period after Germany s defeat in World War I the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II and the introduction of parliamentary democracy German conservatives experienced a cultural crisis and felt uprooted by a progressively modernist world This angst was expressed philosophically in the Conservative Revolution movement with prominent exponents such as historian Oswald Spengler jurist Carl Schmitt and author Ernst J nger The major conservative party of this era was the reactionary German National People s Party who advocated a restored monarchy br With the rise of Nazism in traditional agrarian movements faded and were supplanted by a more command based economy and forced social integration Adolf Hitler succeeded in garnering the support of many German industrialists but prominent traditionalists including military officers Claus von Stauffenberg and Henning von Tresckow pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer Bishop Clemens August Graf von Galen and monarchist Carl Friedrich Goerdeler openly and secretly opposed his policies of euthanasia genocide and attacks on organised religion The former German Emperor Wilhelm II was highly critical of Hitler writing in br br There s a man alone without family without children without God He builds

man could bring home victories to our people each year without bringing them either glory or danger But of our Germany which was a nation of poets and musicians of artists and soldiers he has made a nation of hysterics and hermits engulfed in a mob and led by a thousand liars or fanatics br Post World War II Germany developed a special form of conservatism called ordoliberalism which is centred around the concept of ordered liberty Neither socialist nor capitalist it promotes a compromise between state and market and argues that the national culture of a country must be taken into account when implementing economic policies Alexander R stow and Wilhelm R pke were two prominent exponents of this economic theory and its implementation is largely credited as a reason behind the German miracle the rapid reconstruction and development of the war wrecked economies of West Germany and Austria after World War II br More recently the work of conservative Christian Democratic Union leader and Chancellor Helmut Kohl helped bring about German reunification along with the closer European integration in the form of the Maastricht Treaty Today German conservatism is often associated with politicians such as Chancellor Angela Merkel whose tenure was marked by attempts to save the common European currency Euro from demise The German conservatives were divided under Merkel due to the refugee crisis in Germany and many conservatives in the CDU CSU opposed the immigration policies developed under Merkel The s also saw the rise of the right wing populist Alternative for Germany br br br Greece br br The main inter war conservative party was called the People s Party PP which supported constitutional monarchy and opposed the republican Liberal Party Both parties were suppressed by the authoritarian arch conservative and royalist th of August Regime of Ioannis Metaxas in The PP was able to re group after World War II as part of a United Nationalist Front which achieved power campaigning on a simple anti communist nationalist platform during the Greek Civil War in However the vote received by the PP declined during the so called Centrist Interlude in br In Marshal Alexandros Papagos created the Greek Rally as an umbrella for the right wing forces The Greek Rally came to power in and remained the leading party in Greece until After Papagos death in it was reformed as the National Radical Union under Konstantinos Karamanlis Right wing governments backed by the palace and the army overthrew the Centre Union government in and governed the country until the establishment of the far right Greek junta After the regime s collapse in August Karamanlis returned from exile to lead the government and founded the New Democracy party The new conservative party had four objectives to confront Turkish expansionism in Cyprus to reestablish and solidify democratic rule to give the country a strong government and to make a powerful moderate party a force

revolutionary heritage its governments advocated a nationalist Christian policy they extolled heroism faith and unity they despised the French Revolution and they spurned the liberal and socialist ideologies of the th century The governments saw Hungary as a bulwark against bolshevism and bolshevism s instruments socialism cosmopolitanism and Freemasonry They perpetrated the rule of a small clique of aristocrats civil servants and army officers and surrounded with adulation the head of the state the counterrevolutionary Admiral Horthy br Horthy s authoritarian conservative regime

Catholicism Irish republicanism free market economics and traditional values such as opposition to abortion br br br Italy br br After unification Italy was governed successively by the Historical Right which represented conservative liberal conservative and conservative liberal positions and the Historical Left br After World War I the country saw the emergence of its first mass parties notably including the Italian People s Party PPI a Christian democratic party that sought to represent the Catholic majority which had long refrained from politics The PPI and the Italian Socialist Party decisively contributed to the loss of strength and authority of the old liberal ruling class which had not been able to structure itself into a proper party the Liberal Union was not coherent and the Italian Liberal Party came too late br In Benito Mussolini founded the National Fascist Party PNF and the next year through the March on Rome he was appointed Prime Minister by King Victor Emmanuel III Fascism originated as a populist revolutionary anti royalist anti clerical and anti conservative ideology viewed by many socialists as a leftist heresy rather than a rightist opponent but it transformed and became distinctly right wing when it made compromises with the conservative establishment in order to consolidate authority and suppress communist movements Mussolini commented on the dynamic pragmatism of fascism br br We do not believe in dogmatic programs We permit ourselves the luxury of being aristocratic and democratic conservative and progressive reactionary and revolutionary legalists and illegalists according to the circumstances of the moment the place and the environment br In all parties were dissolved except the PNF which remained the only legal party in the Kingdom of Italy until the fall of the regime in July By fascists were discredited disbanded and outlawed while Mussolini was executed in April that year br In a referendum was held concerning the fate of the monarchy While southern Italy and parts of northern Italy were royalist other parts especially in central Italy were predominantly republican The outcome was in favour of a republic leading to a collapse of the monarchy br After World War II the centre right was dominated by the centrist party Christian Democracy DC which included both conservative and centre left elements With its landslide victory over the Italian Socialist Party and the Italian Communist Party in the political centre was in power In Denis Mack Smith s words it was moderately conservative reasonably tolerant of everything which did not touch religion or property but above all Catholic and sometimes clerical DC dominated politics until its dissolution in having governed for out of years Among DC s frequent allies there was the conservative liberal Italian Liberal Party At the right of DC stood parties like the royalist Monarchist National Party and the post fascist Italian Social Movement br In entrepreneur and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi founded the liberal conservative party Forza Italia FI He won three elections in and governing the country for almost ten years as prime minister FI formed a coalitions with several parties including the national conservative National Alliance AN heir of the MSI and the regionalist Lega Nord LN FI was briefly incorporated along with AN in The People of Freedom party and later revived in the new Forza Italia After the general election the LN and the Five Star Movement formed a populist government which lasted about a year In the general

Freedom which dominated the election supports liberal positions such as gay rights abortion and euthanasia br br br Norway br The Conservative Party of Norway Norwegian H yre literally Right was formed by the old upper class of state officials and wealthy merchants to fight the populist democracy of the Liberal Party but it lost power in when parliamentarian government was first practiced It formed its first government under parliamentarism in and continued to alternate in power with the Liberals until the s when Labour became the dominant party It has elements both of paternalism stressing the responsibilities of the state and of economic liberalism It first returned to power in the s During K re Willoch s premiership in the s much emphasis was laid on liberalising the credit and housing market and abolishing the NRK TV and radio monopoly while supporting law and order in criminal justice and traditional norms in education br br br Poland br br The dominant conservative party in Poland is Law and Justice PiS though there exist many smaller conservative parties most notably Sovereign Poland Polish conservatism is characterised by social and cultural conservatism patriotism adherence to Catholic social teaching and cooperation with the Catholic Church Contemporary Polish conservatives believe in Atlanticism and strong relations with the United States meanwhile taking a stand against Russia br PiS has taken a populist and statist approach to economics expanding regulations state control over industries and media greatly expanding social welfare and applying Keynesian esque anti crisis shields differentiating itself from previous conservative political parties and movements like AWS or Endecja which believed in economic liberalism Another difference to AWS is PiS euroscepticism Though not opposing European Union membership PiS pursues an assertive policy of conflict with the European Commission which in reaction took a hostile stance against PiS In the European Parliament PiS belongs to the European Conservatives and Reformists group Liberal media in Poland is vehemently biased against PiS and opposed to its rule often calling it authoritarian Liberal scholar Antoni Dudek rejects giving PiS the authoritarian label suggesting that PiS rejects the ideals of liberal democracy and instead embraces a national democratic or illiberal democratic form of governance br In the preceding interwar period Poland s conservative movement was split between the Old Galician and Kresy conservatives usually landowners which formed minor parties like the State Unity in the Kresy and the New Conservative movement of National Democracy Endecja under Roman Dmowski which was oriented around the urban intelligentsia and petite bourgeoise The latter sometimes cooperated with the right wing factions of the Polish peasant movement affiliated under the PSL Piast that cooperated with Endecja creating a common government under the Lanckorona Pact although the peasant movement was still not a part of the conservative movement Endecja espoused Russophilia and believed in cooperation with the Russian Empire and later the White Army They also advocated maintenance of democracy civic nationalism and parliamentarism opposing J zef Pi sudski s BBWR s attempts at empowering the presidency and later its absolute seizure of power In contrast many Old Conservatives such as Stanis aw Cat Mackiewicz found themselves as allies of Marshal Pi sudski Endecja rejected Romanticism and Messianism concepts which were important to the Old Conservatives br br br Russia br br Russian conservatism has experienced a revival in recent decades Under Vladimir Putin the dominant leader since Russia has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social cultural and political matters both at home and abroad Putin has criticised globalism and economic liberalism claiming that liberalism has become obsolete and that the vast majority of people in the world oppose multiculturalism free immigration and rights for LGBT people Russian conservatism is special in some respects as it supports a mixed economy with economic intervention combined with a strong nationalist sentiment and social conservatism which is largely populist As a result Russian conservatism opposes right libertarian ideals such as the aforementioned concept of economic liberalism found in other conservative movements around the world br Putin has also promoted new think tanks that bring together like minded intellectuals and writers For example the Izborsky Club founded in by Alexander Prokhanov stresses Russian nationalism the restoration of Russia s historical greatness and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies Vladislav Surkov a senior government official has been one of the key ideologues during Putin s presidency br In cultural and social affairs Putin has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church Under Patriarch Kirill of Moscow the Church has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine More broadly The New York Times reports in September how the Church s policy prescriptions support the Kremlin s appeal to social conservatives br br A fervent foe of homosexuality and any attempt to put individual rights above those of family community or nation the Russian Orthodox Church helps project Russia as the natural ally of all those who pine for a more secure illiberal world free from the tradition crushing rush of globalization multiculturalism and women s and gay rights br br br Sweden br br In the early th century Swedish conservatism developed alongside Swedish Romanticism The historian Erik Gustaf Geijer an exponent of Gothicism glorified the Viking Age and the Swedish Empire and the idealist philosopher Christopher Jacob Bostr m became the chief ideologue of the official state doctrine which dominated Swedish politics for almost a century Other influential Swedish conservative Romantics were Esaias Tegn r and Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom br Early parliamentary conservatism in Sweden was explicitly elitist Indeed the Conservative Party was formed in with one major goal in mind to stop the advent of universal suffrage which they feared would result in socialism Yet it was a Swedish admiral the conservative politician Arvid Lindman who first extended democracy by enacting male suffrage despite the protests of more traditionalist voices such as the later prime minister the arch conservative and authoritarian statesman Ernst Trygger who railed at progressive policies such as the abolition of the death penalty br Once a democratic system was in place Swedish conservatives sought to combine traditional elitism with modern populism Sweden s most renowned political scientist the conservative politician Rudolf Kjell n coined the terms geopolitics and biopolitics in relation to his organic theory of the state He also developed the corporatist nationalist concept of Folkhemmet the people s home which became the single most powerful political concept in Sweden throughout the th century although it was adopted by the Social Democratic Party who gave it a more socialist interpretation br After a brief grand coalition between Left and Right during World War II the centre right parties struggled to cooperate due to their ideological differences the agrarian populism of the Centre Party the urban liberalism of the Liberal People s Party and the liberal conservative elitism of the Moderate Party the old Conservative Party However in and in the three parties managed to form a government under Thorbj rn F lldin and again in this time under aristocrat Carl Bildt and with support from the newly founded Christian Democrats the most conservative party in contemporary Sweden br In modern times mass immigration from distant cultures caused a large populist dissatisfaction which was not channeled through any of the established parties who generally espoused multiculturalism Instead the s saw the rise of the right wing populist Sweden Democrats who were surging as the largest party in the polls on several occasions Due to its fascist roots the party was ostracised by the other parties until when Christian Democrat leader Ebba Busch reached out for collaboration after which the Moderate Party followed suit In the centre right parties formed a government with support from the Sweden Democrats as the largest party The subsequent Tid Agreement negotiated in Tid Castle incorporated authoritarian policies such as a stricter stance on immigration and a harsher stance on law and order br br br Switzerland br br In some aspects Swiss conservatism is unique as Switzerland is an old federal republic born from historically sovereign cantons comprising three major nationalities and adhering to the principle of Swiss neutrality br There are a number of conservative parties in Switzerland s parliament the Federal Assembly These include the largest ones the Swiss People s Party SVP the Christian Democratic People s Party CVP and the Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland BDP which is a splinter of the SVP created in the aftermath to the election of Eveline Widmer Schlumpf as Federal Council br The SVP was formed from the merger of the Party of Farmers Traders and Citizens formed in and the smaller Democratic Party formed in The SVP emphasised agricultural policy and was strong among farmers in German speaking Protestant areas As Switzerland considered closer relations with the European Union in the s the SVP adopted a more militant protectionist and isolationist stance This stance has allowed it to expand into German speaking Catholic mountainous areas The Anti Defamation League a non Swiss lobby group based in the United States has accused them of manipulating issues such as immigration Swiss neutrality and welfare benefits awakening antisemitism and racism The Council of Europe has called the SVP extreme right although some scholars dispute this classification For instance Hans Georg Betz describes it as populist radical right The SVP has been the largest party since br br br Ukraine br The authoritarian Ukrainian State was headed by Cossack aristocrat Pavlo Skoropadskyi and represented the conservative movement The Hetman government which appealed to the tradition of the th th century Cossack Hetman state represented the conservative strand in Ukraine s struggle for independence It had the support of the proprietary classes and of conservative and moderate political groups Vyacheslav Lypynsky was a main ideologue of Ukrainian conservatism br br br United Kingdom br br Modern English conservatives celebrate Anglo Irish statesman Edmund Burke as their intellectual father Burke was affiliated with the Whig Party which eventually split amongst the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party but the modern Conservative Party is generally thought to derive primarily from the Tories and the MPs of the modern conservative party are still frequently referred to as Tories br Shortly after Burke s death in conservatism was revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions This new generation of conservatives derived their politics not from Burke but from his predecessor the Viscount Bolingbroke who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory lacking Burke s sympathies for Whiggish policies such as Catholic emancipation and American independence famously attacked by Samuel Johnson in Taxation No Tyranny br In the first half of the th century many newspapers magazines and journals promoted loyalist or right wing attitudes in religion politics and international affairs Burke was seldom mentioned but William Pitt the Younger became a conspicuous hero The most prominent journals included The Quarterly Review founded in as a counterweight to the Whigs Edinburgh Review and the even more conservative Blackwood s Magazine The Quarterly Review promoted a balanced Canningite Toryism as it was neutral on Catholic emancipation and only mildly critical of Nonconformist dissent it opposed slavery and supported the current poor laws and it was aggressively imperialist The high church clergy of the Church of England read the Orthodox Churchman s Magazine which was equally hostile to Jewish Catholic Jacobin Methodist and Unitarian spokesmen Anchoring the ultra Tories Blackwood s Edinburgh Magazine stood firmly against Catholic emancipation and favoured slavery cheap money mercantilism the Navigation Acts and the Holy Alliance br Conservatism evolved after embracing free trade in and a commitment to democracy especially under Benjamin Disraeli The effect was to significantly strengthen conservatism as a grassroots political force Conservatism no longer was the philosophical defence of the landed aristocracy but had been refreshed into redefining its commitment to the ideals of order both secular and religious expanding imperialism strengthened monarchy and a more generous vision of the welfare state as opposed to the punitive vision of the Whigs and liberals As early as Disraeli attacked the Whigs and utilitarians as slavishly devoted to an industrial oligarchy while he described his fellow Tories as the only really democratic party of England devoted to the interests of the whole people Nevertheless inside the party there was a tension between the growing numbers of wealthy businessmen on the one side and the aristocracy and rural gentry on the other The aristocracy gained strength as businessmen discovered they could use their wealth to buy a peerage and a country estate br Some conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of noblesse oblige had promoted respect from the lower classes They saw the Anglican Church and the aristocracy as balances against commercial wealth They worked toward legislation for improved working conditions and urban housing This viewpoint would later be called Tory democracy However since Burke there has always been tension between traditional aristocratic conservatism and the wealthy liberal business class br In Tory Prime Minister Robert Peel issued the Tamworth Manifesto in which he pledged to endorse moderate political reform This marked the beginning of the transformation from High Tory reactionism towards a more modern form of conservatism As a result the party became known as the Conservative Party a name it has retained to this day However Peel would also be the root of a split in the party between the traditional Tories by the Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli and the Peelites led first by Peel himself then by the Earl of Aberdeen The split occurred in over the issue of free trade which Peel supported versus protectionism supported by Derby The majority of the party sided with Derby whilst about a third split away eventually merging with the Whigs and the radicals to form the Liberal Party Despite the split the mainstream Conservative Party accepted the doctrine of free trade in br In the second half of the th century the Liberal Party faced political schisms especially over Irish Home Rule Leader William Gladstone himself a former Peelite sought to give Ireland a degree of autonomy a move that elements in both the left and right wings of his party opposed These split off to become the Liberal Unionists led by Joseph Chamberlain forming a coalition with the Conservatives before merging with them in The Liberal Unionist influence dragged the Conservative Party towards the left as Conservative governments passed a number of progressive reforms at the turn of the th century By the late th century the traditional business supporters of the Liberal Party had joined the Conservatives making them the party of business and commerce as well br After a period of Liberal dominance before World War I the Conservatives gradually became more influential in government regaining full control of the cabinet in In the inter war period conservatism was the major ideology in Britain as the Liberal Party vied with the Labour Party for control of the left After World War II the first Labour government under Clement Attlee embarked on a program of nationalisation of industry and the promotion of social welfare The Conservatives generally accepted those policies until the s br In the s the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher guided by neoliberal economics reversed many of Labour s social programmes privatised large parts of the UK economy and sold state owned assets The Conservative Party also adopted soft eurosceptic politics and opposed Federal Europe Other conservative political parties such as the Democratic Unionist Party DUP founded in and the United Kingdom Independence Party UKIP founded in began to appear although they have yet to make any significant impact at Westminster As of the DUP is the largest political party in the ruling coalition in the Northern Ireland Assembly and from to the DUP provided support for the Conservative minority government under a confidence and supply arrangement br br br Latin America br br Conservative elites have long dominated Latin American nations Mostly this has been achieved through control of civil institutions the Catholic Church and the military rather than through party politics Typically the Church was exempt from taxes and its employees immune from civil prosecution Where conservative parties were weak or non existent conservatives were more likely to rely on military dictatorship as a preferred form of government br However in some nations where the elites were able to mobilise popular support for conservative parties longer periods of political stability were achieved Chile Colombia and Venezuela are examples of nations that developed strong conservative parties Argentina Brazil El Salvador and Peru are examples of nations where this did not occur br Louis Hartz explained conservatism in Latin American nations as a result of their settlement as feudal societies br br br Brazil br br Conservatism in Brazil originates from the cultural and historical tradition of Brazil whose cultural roots are Luso Iberian and Roman Catholic More traditional conservative historical views and features include belief in political federalism and monarchism br The military dictatorship in Brazil was established on April after a coup d tat by the Brazilian Army with support from the United States government and it lasted for years until March The coup received support from almost all high ranking members of the military along with conservative sectors in society such as the Catholic Church and anti communist civilian movements among the Brazilian middle and upper classes The dictatorship reached the height of its popularity in the s with the so called Brazilian Miracle Brazil s military government provided a model for other military regimes throughout Latin America being systematised by the National Security Doctrine which was used to justify the military s actions as operating in the interest of national security in a time of crisis br In contemporary politics a conservative wave began roughly around the Brazilian presidential election According to commentators the National Congress of Brazil elected in may be considered the most conservative since the re democratisation movement citing an increase in the number of parliamentarians linked to more conservative segments such as ruralists the military the police and religious conservatives The subsequent economic crisis of and investigations of corruption scandals led to a right wing movement that sought to rescue ideas from economic liberalism and conservatism in opposition to socialism At the same time fiscal conservatives such as those that make up the Free Brazil Movement emerged among many others National conservative candidate Jair Bolsonaro of the Social Liberal Party was the winner of the Brazilian presidential election br br br Chile br Chile s conservative party the National Party disbanded in following a military coup and did not re emerge as a political force after the return to democracy During the military dictatorship of Chile the country was ruled by a military junta headed by General Augusto Pinochet His ideology known as Pinochetism was anti communist militaristic nationalistic and laissez faire capitalistic Under Pinochet Chile s economy was placed under the control of a group of economists known collectively as the Chicago Boys whose liberalising policies have been described as neoliberal br br br Colombia br br The Colombian Conservative Party founded in traces its origins to opponents of General Francisco de Paula Santander s administration While the term liberal had been used to describe all political forces in Colombia the conservatives began describing themselves as conservative liberals and their opponents as red liberals From the s until the present the party has supported strong central government and the Catholic Church especially its role as protector of the sanctity of the family and opposed separation of church and state Its policies include the legal equality of all men the citizen s right to own property and opposition to dictatorship It has usually been Colombia s second largest party with the Colombian Liberal Party being the largest br br br North America br br American conservatism combining traditionalism and libertarianism is different from European conservatism and can be traced back to the classical liberalism of the th and th centuries although Canada also developed an American style conservatism that competed with the older Tory conservatism According to Louis Hartz French Canada is a fragment of feudal Europe whereas the United States and English Canada are liberal fragments Reginald Bibby has asserted that conservatism has been strong and enduring throughout North America because of the propagation of religious values from generation to generation br br br Canada br br Canada s conservatives had their roots in the Tory loyalists who left America after the American Revolution They developed in the socio economic and political cleavages that existed during the first three decades of the th century and had the support of the mercantile professional and religious elites in Ontario and to a lesser extent in Quebec Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices they were called the Family Compact in Ontario and the Chateau Clique in Quebec John A Macdonald s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late th century rested on his ability to bring together the English speaking Protestant aristocracy and the ultramontane Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition br The conservatives combined pro market liberalism and Toryism They generally supported an activist government and state intervention in the marketplace and their policies were marked by noblesse oblige a paternalistic responsibility of the elites for the less well off The party was known as the Progressive Conservatives from until when the party merged with the Canadian Alliance to form the Conservative Party of Canada br The conservative and autonomist Union Nationale led by Maurice Duplessis governed the province of Quebec in periods from to and in a close alliance with the Catholic Church small rural elites farmers and business elites This period known by liberals as the Great Darkness ended with the Quiet Revolution and the party went into terminal decline br By the end of the s the political debate in Quebec centred around the question of independence opposing the social democratic and sovereignist Parti Qu b cois and the centrist and federalist Quebec Liberal Party therefore marginalising the conservative movement Most French Canadian conservatives rallied either the Quebec Liberal Party or the Parti Qu b cois while some of them still tried to offer an autonomist third way with what was left of the Union Nationale or the more populists Ralliement cr ditiste du Qu bec and Parti national populaire but by the provincial election politically organised conservatism had been obliterated in

Legault s Coalition Avenir Qu bec which took power in The modern Conservative Party of Canada has rebranded conservatism and under the leadership of Stephen Harper added more conservative policies br Yoram Hazony a scholar on the history and ideology of conservatism identified Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson as the most significant conservative thinker to appear in the English speaking world in a generation br br br United States br br The meaning of conservatism in the United States is different from the way the word is used elsewhere As historian Leo P Ribuffo notes what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism However the prominent American conservative writer Russell Kirk argued in his influential work The Conservative Mind that conservatism had been brought to the United States and he interpreted the American Revolution as a conservative revolution against royal innovation The revolution was also supported by Anglo Irish statesman Edmund Burke widely known as the father of conservatism although Burke and a few Founding Fathers most notably John Adams were highly critical of the French Revolution br American conservatism is a broad system of political beliefs in the United States which is characterized by respect for American traditions support for Judeo Christian values economic liberalism anti communism and a defense of Western culture Liberty within the bounds of conformity to conservatism is a core value with a particular emphasis on strengthening the free market limiting the size and scope of government and opposing high taxes as well as government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur br In the United States libertarian conservatism describes certain political ideologies that combine libertarian economic issues with conservative stances The agorist philosopher Samuel Edward Konkin III labeled this ideology right libertarianism while Frank Meyer coined the term fusionism to describe this ideological hybrid Some scholars such as conservative philosopher Russell Kirk have highlighted the contrasts between the two ideologies stating that to talk of forming a league or coalition between these two is like advocating a union of ice and fire Libertarian activist Jerome Tuccille wrote Libertarianism is basically Aristotelian reason objectivity individual self sufficiency while conservatism is just fundamentally Platonic privileged elitism mysticism collective order br The s Democratic Party became divided between Southern Democrats who supported slavery secession and later segregation and the Northern Democrats who tended to support the abolition of slavery union and equality Many Democrats were conservative in the sense that they wanted things to be like they were in the past especially as far as race was concerned They generally favored poorer farmers and urban workers and were hostile to banks industrialization and high tariffs br The post Civil War Republican Party had conservative factions but was not uniformly conservative The Southern Democrats united with pro segregation Northern Republicans to form the Conservative Coalition which successfully put an end to Blacks being elected to national political office until when Edward Brooke was elected Senator from Massachusetts Conservative Democrats influenced US politics until s Republican Revolution as the American South shifted from solid Democrat to solid Republican while maintaining its conservative values br In late th century the Democratic Party split into two factions the more conservative Eastern business faction led by Grover Cleveland favored gold while the South and West led by William Jennings Bryan wanted more silver in order to raise prices for their crops In Cleveland won the election on a conservative platform which supported maintaining the gold standard reducing tariffs and taking a laissez faire approach to government intervention A severe nationwide depression ruined his plans Many of his supporters in supported the Gold Democrats when liberal William Jennings Bryan won the nomination and campaigned for bimetalism money backed by both gold and silver The conservative wing nominated Alton B Parker in but he got very few votes br The major conservative party in the United States today is the Republican Party also known as the GOP Grand Old Party Modern American conservatives often consider individual liberty as the fundamental trait of democracy as long as it conforms to conservative values small government deregulation of the government and economic liberalism which contrasts with modern American liberals who generally place a greater value on social equality and social justice Other major priorities within American conservatism include support for the traditional family law and order the right to bear arms Christian values anti communism and a defense of Western civilization from the challenges of modernist culture and totalitarian governments Economic conservatives and libertarians favor small government low taxes limited regulation and free enterprise Some social conservatives see traditional social values threatened by secularism so they support school prayer and oppose abortion Neoconservatives want to expand American ideals throughout the world and show a strong support for Israel Paleoconservatives oppose multiculturalism and press for restrictions on immigration Most US conservatives prefer Republicans over Democrats and most factions favor a strong foreign policy and a strong military br The conservative movement of the s attempted to bring together the divergent conservative strands stressing the need for unity to prevent the spread of godless communism which Reagan later labeled an evil empire During the Reagan administration conservatives also supported the so called Reagan Doctrine under which the US as part of a Cold War strategy provided military and other support to guerrilla insurgencies that were fighting governments identified as socialist or communist The Reagan administration also adopted neoliberalism and Reaganomics pejoratively referred to as trickle down economics resulting in the s economic growth and trillion dollar deficits Other modern conservative positions include anti environmentalism On average American conservatives desire tougher foreign policies than liberals do br The Tea Party movement founded in proved a large outlet for populist American conservative ideas Their stated goals included rigorous adherence to the US

earn higher ratings evaluations and tips than social liberal ones br br br Disgust sensitivity br A number of studies have found that disgust is tightly linked to political orientation People who are highly sensitive to disgusting images are more likely to align with the political right and value traditional ideals of bodily and spiritual purity tending to oppose for example abortion and gay marriage br Research in the field of evolutionary psychology has also found that people who are more disgust sensitive tend to favour their own in group over out groups A proposed reason for this phenomenon is that people begin to associate outsiders with disease while associating health with people similar to themselves br The higher one s disgust sensitivity is the greater the tendency to make more conservative moral judgments Disgust sensitivity is associated with moral hypervigilance which means that people who have higher disgust sensitivity are more likely to think that suspects of a crime are guilty They also tend to view them as evil if found guilty and endorse harsher punishment in the setting of a court br br br Authoritarianism br The right wing authoritarian personality RWA is a personality type that describes somebody who is highly submissive to their authority figures acts aggressively in the name of said authorities and is conformist in thought and behaviour According to psychologist Bob Altemeyer individuals who are politically conservative tend to rank high in RWA This finding was echoed by Theodor W Adorno in The Authoritarian Personality based on the F scale personality test br A study done on Israeli and Palestinian students in Israel found that RWA scores of right wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left wing party supporters However a study by H Michael Crowson and colleagues suggested a moderate gap between RWA and other conservative positions stating that their results indicated that conservatism is not synonymous with RWA br According to political scientist Karen Stenner who specialises in authoritarianism conservatives will embrace diversity and civil liberties to the extent that they are institutionalised traditions in the social order but they tend to be drawn to authoritarianism when public opinion is fractious and there is a loss of confidence in public institutions br br br Ambiguity intolerance br In British psychologist Glenn Wilson published an influential book providing evidence that a general factor underlying conservative beliefs is fear of uncertainty A meta analysis of research literature by Jost Glaser Kruglanski and Sulloway in found that many factors such as intolerance of ambiguity and need for cognitive closure contribute to the degree of one s political conservatism and its manifestations in decision making A study by Kathleen Maclay stated that these traits might be associated with such generally valued characteristics as personal commitment and unwavering loyalty The research also suggested that while most people are resistant to change social liberals are more tolerant of it br br br Social dominance orientation br Social dominance orientation SDO is a personality trait measuring an individual s support for social hierarchy and the extent to which they desire their in group be superior to out groups Psychologist Felicia Pratto and her colleagues have found evidence to support the claim that a high SDO is strongly correlated with conservative views and opposition to social engineering to promote equality Pratto and her colleagues also found that high SDO scores were highly correlated with measures of prejudice Edmund Burke often called the father of modern conservatism thought that prejudices are socially necessary writing Prejudice renders a man s virtue his habit and not a series of unconnected acts Through just prejudice his duty becomes a part of his nature br However David J Schneider argued for a more complex relationships between the three factors writing that correlations between prejudice and political conservatism are reduced virtually to zero when controls for SDO are instituted suggesting that the conservatism prejudice link is caused by SDO Conservative political theorist Kenneth Minogue criticised Pratto s work saying br br It is characteristic of the conservative temperament to value established identities to praise habit and to respect prejudice not because it is irrational but because such things anchor the darting impulses of human beings in solidities of custom which we do not often begin to value until we are already losing them Radicalism often generates youth movements while conservatism is a condition found among the mature who have discovered what it is in life they most value br A study by Pratto and her colleagues examined the topic of racism Contrary to what these theorists predicted correlations between conservatism and racism were strongest among the most educated individuals and weakest among the least educated They also found that the correlation between racism and conservatism could be accounted for by their mutual relationship with SDO br br br Happiness br In his book Gross National Happiness Arthur C Brooks presents the finding that conservatives are roughly twice as happy as social liberals A study suggested that conservatives tend to be happier than social liberals because of their tendency to justify the current state of affairs and to remain unbothered by inequalities in society A study disputed this hypothesis demonstrating that conservatives expressed greater personal agency e g personal control responsibility more positive outlook e g optimism self worth and more transcendent moral beliefs e g greater religiosity greater moral clarity br br br Prominent statesmen br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
