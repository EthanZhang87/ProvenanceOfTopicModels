Depression and World War II under the guidance of founders Arnold Gingrich David A Smart and Henry L Jackson while during the s it pioneered the New Journalism movement After a period of quick and drastic decline during the s the magazine revamped itself as a lifestyle heavy publication under the direction of David Granger br br br History br Esquire was first issued in October as an offshoot of trade magazine Apparel Arts which later became Gentleman s Quarterly Esquire and GQ would share ownership for almost years The magazine was first headquartered in Chicago and then in New York City It was founded and edited by David A Smart Henry L Jackson and Arnold Gingrich Jackson died in the crash of United Airlines Flight in while Gingrich led the magazine until his own death in Smart died in although he left Esquire in to found a different magazine for the company Coronet The founders all had different focuses Gingrich specialized in publishing Smart led the business side of the magazine while Jackson led and edited the fashion section which made up most of the magazine in its first fifteen years of publishing Additionally Jackson s Republican political viewpoints contrasted with the liberal Democratic views of Smart which allowed for the magazine to publish debates between the two br Esquire initially was supposed to have a quarterly press run of a hundred thousand copies It cost fifty cents per copy equivalent to today However demand was so high that by its second issue January it transformed itself into a more refined periodical with an emphasis on men s fashion and contributions by Ernest Hemingway F Scott Fitzgerald Alberto Moravia Andr Gide and Julian Huxley br In the s the popularity of the Petty Girls and Vargas Girls particularly among the Armed Forces provided a circulation boost but also proved controversial in the Democratic United States Postmaster General Frank Comerford Walker brought charges against the magazine on behalf of the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt which alleged that Esquire had used the US Postal Service to promote lewd images Republicans opposed the lawsuit and in the United States Supreme Court found in Hannegan v Esquire Inc U S that Esquire s right to use the Postal Service was protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution br During the s Al Moore replaced Petty and Vargas as the main pinup illustrator for Esquire Petty illustrated for Esquire from to Vargas was hired to replace Petty in and was active until br Beginning with its second number a blond pop eyed mustachioed character named Esky created by cartoonists E Simms Campbell and Sam Berman graced almost every Esquire front page for over a quarter of a century depicting the refined character of the magazine and its readership mostly in the form of figurines although a stylized design of his face would often appear as well replacing the figurines in the s and beginning in this graphic would be featured as the dot on the I of the logo until this was changed in After then the character would be occasionally revived most notably during the s and s a short lived Esky award given to popular rock bands during the s and during Jay Fielden s tenure in the s br Under Harold Hayes who ran it from to Esquire became as distinctive as its oversized pages helping pioneer the trend of New Journalism by publishing such writers as Norman Mailer Tim O Brien John Sack Gay Talese Tom Wolfe and Terry Southern In the mid s Esquire partnered with Verve Records to release a series of Sound Tour vinyl LPs that provided advice and music for traveling abroad In August Esquire published Normand Poirier s piece An American Atrocity one of the first reports of American atrocities committed against Vietnamese civilians Like many other magazines of the era Esquire shrank from the traditional large magazine format about in in or mm mm to the smaller standard letter size in in or mm mm in br br The magazine was sold by the original owners to Clay Felker in although Esquire Inc kept its name until its acquisition by Gulf Western in Felker reinvented the magazine as a fortnightly in under the title of Esquire Fortnightly ditching the script logo that had been used with minor tweaks since However the fortnightly experiment proved to be a failure and by the end of that year the magazine lost US million Felker sold Esquire in to the Corporation a Tennessee based publisher which reverted the magazine into a monthly beginning with the July issue dated both as of July and During this time New York Woman magazine was launched as something of a spin off version of Esquire aimed at a female audience In the Corporation renamed as the Esquire Magazine Group launched the New York Woman magazine as something of a spin off version of Esquire aimed at a female audience The company split up at the end of the year and Esquire was sold to Hearst with New York Woman going its separate way to American Express Publishing being published until br The arrival of male oriented lifestyle publications during the early s and the problems of the magazine industry during the middle of the decade led to a sustained decline in circulation that threatened the future of Esquire which had relied upon an elegant highly literate audience until the late s it published a back to college issue each September and during the second half of the s it published a year end register featuring leading cultural figures under years of age but did not appeal to younger men David M Granger was named editor in chief of the magazine in June fresh from a six year stint at GQ which he turned around from its fashion heavy tradition After his arrival the magazine received numerous awards including multiple National Magazine Awards Its award winning staff writers include Tom Chiarella Scott Raab Mike Sager Chris Jones John H Richardson Cal Fussman Lisa Taddeo and Tom Junod Famous photographers have also worked for the magazine among which fashion photographer Gleb Derujinsky and Richard Avedon In spite of its success the magazine under Granger became increasingly criticized for its focus on the so called metrosexual culture a criticism he previously had late in his GQ tenure David Granger stepped down in being replaced by Jay Fielden who revamped the magazine into its more classical up market style At the same time its political coverage became more comprehensive following a trend among American magazine publications in general After a series of shake ups at Hearst s magazine division Michael Sebastian became editor in mid reverting to its s era style br In September the magazine launched a special style focused issue entitled The Big Black Book which beginning in was published twice a year until the Spring Summer issue ran for the last time in br In the June and July issues were merged as were the December and January issues in and in the magazine moved to eight issues per year br br br Blog br In January Esquire launched a new blog the Daily Endorsement Blog Each morning the editors of the magazine recommend one thing for readers immediate enjoyment not a political candidate or position or party but a breakthrough idea or product or Web site The concept of the Daily Endorsement Blog was said to have emerged from Esquire s November issue called the Endorsement Issue in which after years Esquire publicly endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time The Daily Endorsement Blog was officially discontinued in April br br br Fiction br From to Gordon Lish served as fiction editor for Esquire and became known as Captain Fiction because of the authors whose careers he assisted Lish helped establish the career of writer Raymond Carver by publishing his short stories in Esquire often over the objections of Hayes Lish is noted for encouraging Carver s minimalism and publishing the short stories of Richard Ford Using the influential publication as a vehicle to introduce new fiction by emerging authors he promoted the work of such writers as T Coraghessan Boyle Barry Hannah Cynthia Ozick Reynolds Price and William Harrison br In February Esquire published For Rupert with no promises as an unsigned work of fiction this was the first time it had published a work without identifying the author Readers speculated that it was the work of J D Salinger the reclusive author best known for The Catcher in the Rye Told in first person the story features events and Glass family names from the story For Esm with Love and Squalor Gordon Lish is quoted as saying I tried to borrow Salinger s voice and the psychological circumstances of his life as I imagine them to be now And I tried to use those things to elaborate on certain circumstances and events in his fiction to deepen them and add complexity br Other authors appearing in Esquire at that time included William F Buckley Truman Capote Murray Kempton Malcolm Muggeridge Ron Rosenbaum Andrew Vachss and Garry Wills br During the mid late s the magazine s June Summer Reading issues featured a full length fiction story accompanied by shorter pieces all written for the magazine br Although the magazine greatly reduced its fiction content during the s in line with most other magazines it has nevertheless continued to publish fiction in occasion Writer Elizabeth Gilbert debuted in Esquire in while Chris Adrian Nathan Englander Benjamin Percy and Patrick Somerville among others have also contributed to the magazine Other writers who have recently appeared in Esquire include Ralph Lombreglia James Lee Burke and Stephen King br br br The Napkin Fiction Project br In Esquire launched the Napkin Fiction Project in which cocktail napkins were mailed to writers all over the country by the incoming fiction editor in a playful attempt to revive short fiction some with a half dozen books to their name others just finishing their first In return the magazine received nearly a hundred stories Rick Moody Jonathan Ames Bret Anthony Johnston Joshua Ferris Yiyun Li Aimee Bender and ZZ Packer are among the notable writers included br br br Dubious Achievement Awards br For many years Esquire has published its annual Dubious Achievement Awards lampooning events of the preceding year As a running gag the annual article almost always displayed an old photo of Richard Nixon laughing with the caption Why is this man laughing However the February Dubious Achievement Awards used the caption under a photo of W Mark Felt the former FBI official revealed in to be Deep Throat the source for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein to uncover the Watergate scandal The magazine discontinued the Nixon photo in February referring to a poll stating that George W Bush had surpassed Nixon as the worst president ever br A popular running gag featured in the Dubious Achievements of edition involved especially egregious achievements headlined with And then they went to Elaine s referring to a popular restaurant in New York City that closed in May br Esquire did not publish Dubious Achievement Awards for but resumed them with the awards published in the February issue br Dubious Achievement Awards were discontinued in according to an editor s note in the January issue considering that the overabundance of imitators had made the feature superfluous However after a nine year hiatus the feature was revived in the January issue with a skewering of events br br br Sexiest Woman Alive br br The annual Sexiest Woman Alive feature ran between and billed as a benchmark of female attractiveness br Originally it was a part of the Women We Love issue that had appeared yearly since after being a section of The Passions of Men issue June being initially titled Woman of the Year To build interest the magazine would do a tease releasing partial images of the woman in the issues preceding the November issue By it had become the dominating story of the issue and to create an element of surprise the hints were abandoned br br br Criticism br The Sexiest Woman Alive feature consists of a photoshoot of the woman selected alongside a profile about her Over the years the profile in particular has been criticized for being perceived as objectifying and heavily male gaze centric Following Pen lope Cruz being selected as the choice Katy Waldman ran an article on Slate titled Is It Impossible to Write a Decent Sexiest Woman Alive Profile writing that the profile is the latest icky entry in the icky genre and describing it as using rapt creepy overheated language to say practically nothing about his subject except that she is impossibly beautiful has no physical flaws looks like a thousand different women and can be whatever we want her to be So nothing Waldman in particular criticizes profile author Chris Jones use of a metaphor comparing Cruz eating a steak with bullfighting saying that The whole thing is pretentious overwritten and too satisfied with itself br Waldman is also critical of previous Sexiest Woman Alive profiles saying Esquire s Sexiest Woman Alive profiles are generally terrible writing They traffic in weirdo pious metaphors and exaggerations that aim to winkingly indicate how overcome a guy gets in the face of a gorgeous lady But they just make men seem like drooling louts She cites two examples s choice Jessica Biel Those liquid lips those pearly ankles those Boulder shoulders Jessica Biel is a woman of many parts Now at last she is whole Behold and s choice Rihanna She grabs her own radiant ass she handles it offers it like it s a rump roast Waldman highlights Ross McCammon s profile on choice Mila Kunis as one of the less objectionable instances for Instead of fogging up the page with lurid masturbatory descriptions they create space for the subject s voice by asking questions and quoting answers but adds that even the McCammon solution don t talk about looks feels like a bit of a runaround since the theme of the Sexiest Woman Alive feature is straight up the carnal allure of a female celebrity Waldman ultimately ends asking Do we want to declare that theme unacceptable at least in the hands of a male journalist Or is there a way for men to write about ladies physical appeal without sounding like obnoxious creeps br Esquire s style of writing about the women selected as Sexiest Woman Alive has been brought up when discussing other articles criticized for their language towards women described in them Following a Vanity Fair article on Margot Robbie that received such criticism Anne Helen Petersen at BuzzFeed compared this sort of language and the imposition of a male writer s gaze onto the image of a burgeoning woman star directly comparing it with the Pen lope Cruz article describing it as the author watching Pen lope Cruz eat steak against the backdrop of a forced matador metaphor while a Lainey Gossip article said of the Vanity Fair article on Robbie which is described as having so much derisive condescending misogynistic language One paragraph in and we ve already been treated to some Esquire level bullshit br br br Awards and honors br National Magazine Awards br br br
