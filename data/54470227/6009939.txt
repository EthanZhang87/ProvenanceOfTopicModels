Interstellar is a epic science fiction drama film directed by Christopher Nolan who co wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan It stars Matthew McConaughey Anne Hathaway Jessica Chastain Bill Irwin Ellen Burstyn Matt Damon and Michael Caine Set in a dystopian future where Earth is suffering from catastrophic blight and famine the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humankind br The screenplay had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in and was originally set to be directed by Steven Spielberg Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive producer and scientific consultant on the film and wrote the tie in book The Science of Interstellar Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on mm movie film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX mm Filming began in late and took place in Alberta Klaustur and Los Angeles Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects and the company DNEG created additional digital effects br Interstellar premiered in Los Angeles on October In the United States it was first released on film stock expanding to venues using digital projectors The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over million worldwide million after subsequent re releases making it the tenth highest grossing film of Thorne s computer generated depiction of a black hole in the film has also received commendation from astronomers and physicists Interstellar was nominated for five awards at the th Academy Awards winning Best Visual Effects and received numerous other accolades br br In humanity faces extinction due to a global blight Joseph Cooper a former NASA test pilot along with his son and daughter Tom and Murph and father in law Donald toil as farmers One evening during a dust storm Cooper and Murph discover mysterious patterns in falling particles Decoding the patterns leads them to a secret NASA facility run by scientist Dr John Brand Cooper is enlisted to pilot the spaceship Endurance through a newly discovered wormhole near Saturn searching for habitable planets Cooper struggles with leaving his children behind but decides to do it in the hope of saving Tom and Murph s generation from extinction He promises Murph he will return but she is distraught Cooper joins the Endurance team consisting of Romilly Doyle Brand s daughter Amelia and the robots TARS and CASE br After years of travel the Endurance crew transits the wormhole arriving in a distant planetary system circling a supermassive black hole named Gargantua Cooper Amelia and Doyle take a small spacecraft to the first candidate planet orbiting deep in the black hole s gravity well only to find that it is an inhospitable ocean world ravaged by colossal waves In the ensuing evacuation Doyle is swept away and killed by a wave but Cooper and Amelia narrowly manage to escape Due to severe time dilation in which one hour spent on the planet equals seven years on Earth years have passed upon their return to the Endurance br On Earth in an adult Murph helps Dr John Brand with his perennially unsolved gravity manipulation equation which is supposed to help transport humanity en masse to potentially habitable worlds On his deathbed Brand confesses that the crew was never supposed to return and that the equation was a charade meant to keep humans from dissolving into anarchy out of panic for their eventual doom Murph is frustrated and wonders if Cooper knowingly abandoned her She decides to continue Brand s work and returns to her childhood home to search for clues br The Endurance travels to the second candidate planet a frigid ice world They awaken Mann the surviving NASA explorer in cryostasis who landed decades ago Mann and Cooper go on a scouting trip but once alone Mann confesses that the planet is uninhabitable and that he falsified data to attract rescuers Mann assaults Cooper and leaves him to die but Amelia rescues him Romilly is killed in a booby trap set by Mann who hijacks a lander left by the Endurance crew and takes off for the orbiting spacecraft Mann intends to commandeer the Endurance but a failed docking kills Mann and severely damages the Endurance After a problematic docking sequence Cooper and Amelia regain control of the crippled spaceship br Charting a gravity assist path around Gargantua Cooper propels the Endurance towards the third and final planet losing another years to time dilation Cooper and TARS secretly agree to sacrifice themselves and detach their spacecraft from the Endurance during the gravity assist such that the now lightened Endurance will be capable of reaching the third planet much to the protest of Amelia br Cooper falls into the black hole and finds himself in a four dimensional tesseract where he travels through time and space and finds himself able to manipulate the falling dust grains in his childhood home allowing him to send the NASA site coordinates to his past self and bootstrap his mission He also deduces that the tesseract itself was constructed by a future generation of humankind to similarly guide their predecessors He and TARS transmit information from within the black hole by manipulating the hands of Murph s wristwatch Using the information Murph solves the gravity manipulation problem and enables humanity to escape extinction and build colonies in outer space br The tesseract collapses and ejects Cooper and TARS where they are rescued in and brought to an O Neill cylinder colony around Saturn Cooper reunites with Murph now on her deathbed in her advanced age She tells him not to wait for her to die and to seek out Amelia instead Cooper takes a spacecraft and sets off on another mission with TARS Meanwhile on the final candidate planet Amelia removes her helmet breathing in the air of the new habitable world br br Matthew McConaughey as Joseph Cooper a widower NASA pilot who reluctantly becomes a farmer after the

Doctor br br The premise for Interstellar was conceived by the producer Lynda Obst and the theoretical physicist Kip Thorne who collaborated on the film Contact and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date The two conceived a scenario based on Thorne s work about the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans and attracted Steven Spielberg s interest in directing The film began development in June when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science fiction film based on an eight page treatment written by Obst and Thorne Obst was attached to produce By March Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay br After Spielberg moved his production studio DreamWorks from Paramount to Walt Disney Studios in Paramount needed a new director for Interstellar Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher who joined the project in Christopher Nolan met with Thorne then attached as executive producer to discuss the use of spacetime in the story In January Paramount and Warner Bros announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct Interstellar Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of human spaceflight and intended to merge his brother s screenplay with his own By the following March Nolan was confirmed to direct Interstellar which would be produced under his label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions The Hollywood Reporter said Nolan would earn a salary of million against of the total gross To research for the film Nolan visited NASA and the private space program at SpaceX br Warner Bros sought a stake in Nolan s production of Interstellar from Paramount despite their traditional rivalry and agreed to give Paramount its rights to co finance the next film in the Friday the th horror franchise with a stake in a future film based on the television series South Park Warner Bros also agreed to let Paramount co finance an indeterminate A list property In August Legendary Pictures finalized an agreement with Warner Bros to finance approximately of the film s production Although it failed to renew its eight year production partnership with Warner Bros Legendary reportedly agreed to forgo financing Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice in exchange for the stake in Interstellar br br Jonathan Nolan worked on the script for four years To learn the scientific aspects he studied relativity at the California Institute of Technology He was pessimistic about the Space Shuttle program ending and how NASA lacked financing for a human mission to Mars drawing inspiration from science fiction films with apocalyptic themes such as WALL E and Avatar Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair His brother Christopher had worked on other science fiction scripts but decided to take the Interstellar script and choose among the vast array of ideas presented by Jonathan and Thorne He picked what he felt as director he could get across to the audience and hopefully not lose them before he merged it with a script he had worked on for years on his own Christopher kept in place Jonathan s conception of the first hour which is set on a resource depleted Earth in the near future The setting was inspired by the Dust Bowl that took place in the United States during the Great Depression in the s He revised the rest of the script where a team travels into space instead After watching the documentary The Dust Bowl for inspiration Christopher contacted the director Ken Burns and the producer Dayton Duncan They granted him permission to use some of their featured interviews in Interstellar br Christopher Nolan wanted an actor who could bring to life his vision of the main character as an everyman with whom the audience could experience the story He became interested in casting Matthew McConaughey after watching him in an early cut of the film Mud which he had seen as a friend of one of its producers Aaron Ryder Nolan went to visit McConaughey while he was filming for the TV series True Detective Anne Hathaway was invited to Nolan s home where she read the script for Interstellar In early both actors were cast in the starring roles Jessica Chastain was contacted while she was working on Miss Julie in Northern Ireland and a script was delivered to her Originally Irrfan Khan was offered the role of Dr Mann but rejected it due to scheduling conflicts Matt Damon was cast as Mann in late August and completed filming his scenes in Iceland br br Nolan shot Interstellar on mm film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX mm photography Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema was hired for Interstellar as Wally Pfister Nolan s cinematographer on all of his previous films was making his directorial debut working on Transcendence Pfister would later retire as a cinematographer for films br More IMAX cameras were used for Interstellar than for any of Nolan s previous films To minimize the use of computer generated imagery CGI Nolan had practical locations built such as the interior of a space shuttle Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be hand held for shooting interior scenes Some of the film s sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nose cone of a Learjet br Nolan who is known for keeping details of his productions secret strove to ensure secrecy for Interstellar Writing for The Wall Street Journal Ben Fritz stated The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to Interstellar just as he did with the blockbuster Dark Knight trilogy As one security measure Interstellar was filmed under the name Flora s Letter Flora being one of Nolan s four children with producer Emma Thomas br br The film s principal photography was scheduled to last four months It began on August in the province of Alberta Canada Towns in Alberta where shooting took place included Nanton Longview Lethbridge Fort Macleod and Okotoks In Okotoks filming took place at the Seaman Stadium and the Olde Town Plaza For a cornfield scene production designer Nathan Crowley planted acres ha of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalyptic dust storm scene intended to be similar to storms experienced during the Dust Bowl in s America Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey s character were also shot in Fort Macleod where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow cellulose based synthetic dust through the air Filming in the province lasted until September and involved hundreds of extras in addition to crew members most of whom were local br Shooting also took place in Iceland where Nolan had previously filmed scenes for Batman Begins It was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets one covered in ice and the other in water The crew transported mock spaceships weighing about pounds kg They spent two weeks shooting there during which a crew of about people including locals worked on the film Locations included the Sv nafellsj kull glacier and the town of Klaustur While filming a water scene in Iceland Hathaway almost suffered from hypothermia because her dry suit had not been properly secured br After the schedule in Iceland was completed the crew shot in Los Angeles for days Filming locations included the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites the Los Angeles Convention Center a Sony Pictures soundstage in Culver City and a private residence in Altadena California Principal photography concluded in December Production had a budget of million million less than was allotted by Paramount Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures br br Interstellar features three spacecraft the Endurance a ranger and a lander The Endurance the crew s mother ship is a circular structure consisting of capsules laid flat to mimic a clock Four capsules with planetary settling equipment four with engines and four with the permanent functions of cockpit medical labs and habitation Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station It s a real mish mash of different kinds of technology You need analogue stuff as well as digital stuff you need backup systems and tangible switches It s really like a submarine in space Every inch of space is used everything has a purpose The ranger s function is similar to the Space Shuttle s being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres Lastly the lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces Crowley compared it to a heavy Russian helicopter br The film features two robots CASE and TARS as well as a dismantled third robot KIPP Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a m ft quadrilateral design He said It has a very complicated design philosophy It s based on mathematics You ve got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways So you have three combinations you follow But then within that it subdivides into a further three joints And all the places we see lines those can subdivide further So you can unfold a finger essentially but it s all proportional Bill Irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots with his image digitally removed and Josh Stewart replaced his voicing for CASE The human space habitats resemble O Neill cylinders a theoretical space habitat model proposed by physicist Gerard K O Neill in br br Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo were the film s audio engineers tasked with audio mixing while sound editor Richard King supervised the process Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment and paid close attention to designing the sound mix like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves The studio s website stated that the film was mixed to maximize the power of the low end frequencies in the main channels as well as in the subwoofer channel Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment br br Hans Zimmer who scored Nolan s The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception returned to score Interstellar Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details but instead gave him a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the Interstellar soundtrack Zimmer and Nolan later decided the four manual Harrison Harrison organ of the Temple Church London would be the primary instrument for the score Zimmer conducted scoring sessions for Interstellar three times more than for Inception The soundtrack was released on November br br The visual effects company Double Negative which worked on Inception was brought back for Interstellar According to visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan s The Dark Knight Rises or Inception However for Interstellar they created the effects first allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens The film contained visual effect shots at a resolution of lines shots that were created in camera using digital projectors and another were created in post production Of those were presented in IMAX while the rest were anamorphic br The ranger Endurance and lander spacecraft were created using miniature effects by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios as opposed to using computer generated imagery as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space D printed and hand sculpted the scale models earned the nickname maxatures by the crew due to their immense size the th scale miniature of the Endurance module spanned over m ft while a pyrotechnic model of part of the craft was built at th scale The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned m ft and over m ft respectively and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries The models were then attached to a six axis gimbal on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements which were filmed against background plates of space using VistaVision cameras on a smaller motion control rig New Deal Studio s miniatures were used in special effects shots br br Nolan was influenced by what he called key touchstones of science fiction cinema including Metropolis A Space Odyssey Blade Runner Star Wars and Alien Andrei Tarkovsky s The Mirror influenced elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water according to Nolan who also compared Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre as a film about human nature He sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg s Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind for being family friendly but also as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum He screened The Right Stuff for the crew before production following in its example by capturing reflections on the Interstellar astronauts visors For further inspiration Nolan invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors Clark Kent s upbringing in Man of Steel was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest Apart from the films Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe br br Regarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes Kip Thorne said he worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole so what you see is based on Einstein s general relativity equations Early in the process Thorne laid down two guidelines First that nothing would violate established physical laws Second that all the wild speculations would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film At one point Thorne spent two weeks arguing Nolan out of having a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up According to Thorne the element that has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support br The astrobiologist David Grinspoon criticized the dire blight situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere s oxygen content He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds Neil deGrasse Tyson an astrophysicist explored the science behind the ending of Interstellar concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past and that we don t really know what s in a black hole so take it and run with it The theoretical physicist Michio Kaku praised the film for its scientific accuracy and said Interstellar could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come Timothy Reyes a former NASA software engineer said Thorne s and Nolan s accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent br Mathematical Physicist Ikjyot Singh Kohli first published an article on the blog defending the physics used in the film In particular he provided calculations in which he showed that the time dilation effect caused by the spinning black hole in the movie was indeed accurate The article was written shortly after the film s release in response to a number of scientific blogs that criticized the film s physics for not being accurate which were shown by Kohli to be due to several misunderstandings by the authors of the blogs in question br br To create the visual effects for the wormhole and a rotating supermassive black hole possessing an ergosphere as opposed to a non rotating black hole Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of people at Double Negative providing pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena Some individual frames took up to hours to render totaling terabytes of data Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as anemic and at low temperature about the temperature of the surface of the sun allowing it to emit appreciable light but not enough gamma radiation and X rays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes resulting in the publication of three scientific papers br br Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the Doppler effect which when added by the visual effects team resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue black hole the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand As a result it was omitted in the finished product Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives br As a reference the asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is very well visible in the first image of the event horizon of a black hole obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope team in Futura Sciences praised the correct depiction of the Penrose process br According to Space com the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is scientifically correct Rather than a two dimensional hole in space it is depicted as a sphere showing a distorted view of the target galaxy br br The teaser trailer for Interstellar debuted December and featured clips related to space exploration accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey s character Cooper The theatrical trailer debuted May at the Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater in Washington D C and was made available online later that month For the week ending on May it was the most viewed film trailer with over million views on YouTube br Christopher Nolan and McConaughey made their first appearances at San Diego Comic Con in July to promote Interstellar That same month Paramount Pictures launched an interactive website on which users uncovered a star chart related to the Apollo Moon landing br In October Paramount partnered with Google to promote Interstellar across multiple platforms The film s website was relaunched as a digital hub hosted on a Google domain which collected feedback from film audiences and linked to a mobile app It featured a game in which players could build Solar System models and use a flight simulator for space travel The Paramount Google partnership also included a virtual time capsule compiled with user generated content made available in The initiative Google for Education used the film as a basis for promoting math and science lesson plans in schools br Paramount provided a virtual reality walkthrough of the Endurance spacecraft using Oculus Rift technology It hosted the walkthrough sequentially in New York City Houston Los Angeles and Washington D C from October through November The publisher Running Press released Interstellar Beyond Time and Space a book by Mark Cotta Vaz about the making of the film on November W W Norton Company released The Science of Interstellar a book by Thorne Titan Books released the official novelization written by Greg Keyes and Wired magazine released a tie in online comic Absolute Zero written by Christopher Nolan and drawn by Sean Gordon Murphy The comic is a prequel to the film with Mann as the protagonist br br Before Interstellar s public release Paramount CEO Brad Grey hosted a private screening on October at the AMC Lincoln Square IMAX theater in Manhattan New York Paramount then showed Interstellar to some of the industry s filmmakers and actors in a first look screening at the California Science Center on October On the following day the film was screened at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles California for over members of the Screen Actors Guild The film premiered on October at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles and in Europe on October at the Odeon Leicester Square in London br Interstellar was released early on November in various mm IMAX film mm film and mm film theaters and had a limited release in North America on November with a wide release on November The film was released in Belgium France and Switzerland on November the UK on November and in additional territories in the following days For the limited North American release Interstellar was projected from mm and mm film in theaters that still supported those formats including at least forty one mm IMAX theaters A mm IMAX projector was installed at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles to display the format The film s wide release expanded to theaters that showed it digitally Paramount Pictures distributed the film in North America and Warner Bros distributed it in the remaining territories The film was released in over IMAX screens worldwide which was the largest global release in IMAX cinemas until surpassed by Universal Pictures Furious with IMAX theaters br Interstellar was an exception to Paramount Pictures goal to stop releasing films on film stock and to distribute them only in digital format According to Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter the initiative to project Interstellar on film stock would help preserve an endangered format which was supported by Christopher Nolan J J Abrams Quentin Tarantino Judd Apatow Paul Thomas Anderson and other filmmakers McClintock reported that theatre owners saw this as backward as nearly all theatres in the US had been converted to digital projection br br Interstellar was released on home video on March in both the United Kingdom and United States It topped the home video

critic reviews are positive with an average of The site s critics consensus reads Interstellar represents more of the thrilling thought provoking and visually resplendent filmmaking moviegoers have come to expect from writer director Christopher Nolan even if its intellectual reach somewhat exceeds its grasp Metacritic assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it an average grade of B on an A to F scale br Scott Foundas chief film critic at Variety said that Interstellar is as visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done and considered the film more personal than Nolan s previous films Claudia Puig of USA Today praised the visual spectacle and powerful themes while criticizing the dull dialogue and tedious patches inside the space vessel David Stratton of At the Movies rated the film four and a half stars out of five commending its ambition effects and mm IMAX presentation though criticizing the sound for being so loud as to make some of the dialogue inaudible Conversely co host Margaret Pomeranz rated the film three out of five as she felt the human drama got lost among the film s scientific concepts Henry Barnes of The Guardian scored the film three out of five stars calling it a glorious spectacle but a slight drama with few characters and too rare flashes of humour James Berardinelli called Interstellar an amazing achievement and simultaneously a big budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice It is by turns edgy breathtaking hopeful and heartbreaking He named it the best film of and the second best movie of the decade deeming it a real science fiction rather than the crowd pleasing watered down version Hollywood typically offers br br Oliver Gettell of the Los Angeles Times reported that film critics largely agree that Interstellar is an entertaining emotional and thought provoking sci fi saga even if it can also be clunky and sentimental at times James Dyer of Empire awarded the film a full five stars describing it as brainy barmy and beautiful to behold a mind bending opera of space and time with a soul wrapped up in all the science Dave Calhoun of Time Out London also granted the film a maximum score of five stars stating that it is a bold beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun Times awarded the film a full four stars and wrote This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen in terms of its visuals and its overriding message about the powerful forces of the one thing we all know but can t measure in scientific terms Love br Describing Nolan as a merchant of awe Tim Robey of The Telegraph thought that Interstellar was agonisingly close to a masterpiece highlighting the conceptual boldness and deep digging intelligence of the film Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos with mixed results but is never less than engrossing and sometimes more than that In his review for the Associated Press Jake Coyle praised the film for its big screen grandeur while finding some of the dialogue clunky He described it further as an absurd endeavor and one of the most sublime movies of the decade Scott Mendelson of Forbes listed Interstellar as one of the most disappointing films of stating that the film has a lack of flow loss of momentum following the climax clumsy sound mixing and thin characters despite seeing the film twice in order to give it a second chance He wrote that Interstellar ends up as a stripped down and somewhat muted variation on any number of go into space to save the world movies Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert com gave the film three and a half out of four stars saying that despite his usual quibbles regarding Nolan s excessive dialogue and its lack of a sense of composition Interstellar is still an impressive at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan s work melted away At times the movie s one stop shopping storytelling evokes the tough tender spirit of a John Ford picture a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one br New York Times columnist David Brooks concludes that Interstellar explores the relationships among science and faith and science and the humanities and illustrates the real symbiosis between these realms Mark Steyn commented on the technological future and the focus on the father daughter relationship Wai Chee Dimock in the Los Angeles Review of Books wrote that Nolan s films are rotatable at and degrees and that although there is considerable magical thinking here making it almost an anti sci fi film holding out hope that the end of the planet is not the end of everything it reverses itself however when that magic falls short when the poetic license is naked and plain for all to see Author George R R Martin called Interstellar the most ambitious and challenging science fiction film since Kubrick s In Empire magazine
