especially when young Riley falls under the hand s malignant influence Talk to Me has a hurtling energy that s often violent but never purposefully cruel She also applauded Wilde and Bird s performances saying the film owes much of its potency to Sophie Wilde s continually evolving lead performance and a remarkable Joe Bird Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times also praised Bird and Wilde s performances writing Joe Bird in a superb and surprising performance and But even when Talk to Me flirts with incoherence Wilde pulls it back from the brink More than just a great scream queen

of stars writing The grim prologue leaves little doubt that horrible things are going to happen to people we re asked to care about and while the ending may not fully satisfy the emotional

also a rock solid sense of instilling dread with a minimum of special effects and a sound design that turns the chill up to David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film saying that it deftly stitches its deepest fears around the idea that grief and trauma can be open invitations to predatory forces from the great beyond It marks a welcome splash of new blood on the horror landscape
