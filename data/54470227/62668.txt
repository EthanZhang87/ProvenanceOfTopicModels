admitted to not wanting to cast big stars as he wanted his film to be discovered and described the wave of harsh criticism from hardcore fans of the original Japanese film as inevitable although he expressed desire for them to find the remake equally compelling He also sought to retain the minimalism prevalent throughout Ring and set it in Seattle due to its wet and isolated atmosphere br br br

sources enough to match the natural lighting through the use of up to three layers of shades HMIs and CTB and set up to create as little shadow as possible to subconsciously alter the viewer s sense of perception and add a heightened sense of ambiguity br br br Title br As with the original Japanese film Ring the title of The Ring can be interpreted as referring to the telephone call which warns
