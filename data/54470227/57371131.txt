daughters Becca and Lindsey at the beach On the way there they witness paramedics taking away the bloody body of a man holding a sign identical to one Adelaide saw on the day of the doppelg nger encounter Jason later sees someone strangely similar to the man standing still with his arms outstretched and hands bloodstained br That night Adelaide relays her story to Gabe when the lights suddenly go out Jason notices a family of four in the driveway who break into the house and corner the Wilsons The intruders are Red and the Wilsons doppelg ngers Pluto Jason s pyromaniac facially scarred double Umbrae Zora s sadistic double and Abraham Gabe s animalistic double Red is the only double who can speak albeit in a guttural raspy voice She explains that they are called the Tethered

Gabe kills Abraham the family escapes br Meanwhile the Tyler family is attacked and murdered in their home by their doppelg ngers The Wilsons arrive and are attacked as well but they manage to overpower and kill the Tylers doubles They turn on the news and learn that the Tethered have been murdering their equivalents across the city and subsequently joining hands to form a massive human chain similar to the one from the Hands Across America demonstration surrounding the city to prevent anyone from entering or leaving The Wilsons decide to drive along the coast and escape to Mexico While they are leaving Umbrae intercepts the car but Zora kills her br Arriving at the boardwalk the Wilsons find many townspeople slaughtered The road is blocked by a burning car Jason realizing it is a trap set by Pluto orders everyone out of the car Before Pluto can ignite the family s car Jason walks backwards causing Pluto to do the same and thus walk directly into the fire While the Wilsons are distracted by Pluto burning to death Red appears and snatches Jason away Adelaide chases Red to the funhouse where they first met and finds a secret entrance that leads to an underground facility overrun by white rabbits where she finds Red in a classroom br Red explains that the Tethered are genetic clones created by the government to control the populace When the experiment failed the Tethered were abandoned underground for countless years mindlessly mimicking the actions of their counterparts and surviving on raw rabbit meat After the other doppelg ngers realized Red was different when she snapped them out of their lethargy she spent years organizing them to escape and take vengeance by murdering their counterparts Red and Adelaide begin to fight but Red evades and counters all of Adelaide s attacks When Adelaide allows Red to attack she impales Red with a fireplace poker and then strangles her to death breaking her neck in the process She rescues Jason from a locker and Jason also rescues one of the rabbits br As she escapes in an ambulance with her family Adelaide reflects back to the night she first met Red She recalls that she herself is the Tethered doppelg nger and that Red is the original Adelaide the doppelg nger having choked Adelaide unconscious damaging her larynx resulting in her hoarse voice dragging and trapping her underground and returning to the surface to usurp her life Jason looks at his mother who simply smiles br Meanwhile the Tethered form a human chain stretching out of Santa Cruz to nearby cities as helicopters fly overhead br br After being dismayed with the genre confusion over his previous film Get Out Peele opted to make his next film a full on horror film Peele has said that an inspiration for Us was The Twilight Zone episode Mirror Image which was centered on a young woman and her evil doppelg nger br Peele also revealed that the idea of the Tethered living underground came to him when he was a teenager taking the train home from studying at Sarah Lawrence College br br You get out of the train and you have to go down through an underpass and come out the other side There s no one else there just this dark American town I d come up and I d look over to the other side and I d picture seeing the tail end of myself going down that same tunnel to presumably emerge right near me seconds later And that s where I love to start with a horror story What is this primal thing that s affecting me in a way I don t quite understand br br On May it was announced that Lupita Nyong o Winston Duke and Elisabeth Moss were all in negotiations to star in the film with Nyong o and Duke portraying a black couple and Moss portraying one half of a white couple Nyong o later confirmed her casting by posting the film s promotional poster on her Instagram The rest of the cast including Tim Heidecker Yahya Abdul Mateen II Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex were all confirmed in July of that year br Peele saw the characters of the film as an archetypal foursome with Adelaide being the leader Zora being the warrior Gabe being jester fool and Jason being the wiz magician For her role Nyong o had to use a different voice for the character of Red She said her performance was inspired by the condition spasmodic dysphonia a condition that causes a person s voice to go into periods of spasm In order to perfect her voice she worked with an ear nose and throat doctor a vocal therapist and my dialect coach to try and make sure I could do it and do it safely Cause I had two roles to play I couldn t afford to damage my voice br br Principal photography began on July in Santa Cruz California including their famous Boardwalk Most of the film was shot in Los Angeles and the main house featured is located in Pasadena The house had modifications and the team spent six weeks there Filming wrapped on October br br The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light Magic and supervised by Grady Cofer br Michael Abels who had previously scored Peele s Get Out returned to do the same for Us br br The Luniz song I Got on It is featured in this film first at the beginning when the family is driving to the beach and then later on in the film when the tethered family breaks into the vacation home The once fun song transmogrifies into an eerie Tethered Mix slowing everything down and fully indulging the ominous quality of the film Due to the track s popularity upon the trailer s release it was edited into the final cut of the film appearing during the climax Waxwork Records announced in August that they would release the soundtrack to the film on vinyl which contained Abels s popular score The N W A song Fuck tha Police is also heard when Kitty Tyler tells the voice assistant Ophelia to call the police moments before she is killed by her Tethered counterpart Dahlia and the song plays throughout when the Wilsons enter the Tyler family s home The ending features the Minnie Riperton song Les Fleurs br br The official trailer was released on December The trailer which was set to a darker version of the song I Got on It featured a similar tone editing and shots as Peele s Get Out prompting speculation that the two films were set in the same universe br A second trailer was released on February for Super Bowl LIII That trailer featured a narration by Lupita Nyong o s character Adelaide speaking with her husband Gabriel about the strange coincidences happening since they arrived at their beach house and describing it as a black cloud hanging over them The new theatrical release date March was announced at the end of the trailer Deadline Hollywood estimated the studio spent around million on promotion and advertisements for the film br br Us had its world premiere at the South by

went on to earn million at the box office debuting at number one and becoming the second best opening for a live action original film after Avatar million in as well as the third best total for a horror film after It million in and Halloween million in and the best ever opening for an original horror film not based on a known property In its second weekend the film made million dropping slightly above average for a horror film but much larger than the seen by Get Out and finishing second behind newcomer Dumbo br br On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes of critics reviews are positive with an average rating of The website s critical consensus reads With Jordan Peele s second inventive ambitious horror film we have seen how to beat the sophomore jinx and it is Us On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating universal acclaim Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of with saying they would definitely recommend it Us was described by Rolling Stone as spill your soda scary compared to the existentially terrifying Get Out br Monica Castillo of RogerEbert com gave the film four out of four writing that Us is another thrilling exploration of the past and oppression this country is still too afraid to bring up Peele wants us to talk and he s given audiences the material to think to feel our way through some of the darker sides of the human condition and the American experience David Griffin of IGN gave the film calling it a very very strange film But that s OK because it wouldn t be a Jordan Peele joint if there wasn t a little risk involved Peele has proven that he s not a one hit wonder with this truly terrifying poignant look at one American family that goes through hell at the hands of maniacal doppelgangers John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called Us a fiercely scary movie whose meaning is up for grabs br Richard Brody of The New Yorker called the film a colossal achievement writing Us is a horror film though saying so is like offering a reminder that The Godfather is a gangster film or that A Space Odyssey is science fiction Genre is irrelevant to the merits of a film whether its conventions are followed or defied what matters is that Peele cites the tropes and precedents of horror in order to deeply root his film in the terrain of pop culture and then to pull up those roots br Conversely Stephanie Zacharek of Time thought Peele had too many ideas and not enough answers compared to Get Out and said Peele goes even deeper into the conflicted territory of class and race and privilege he also ponders the traits that make us most human But this time he s got so many ideas he can barely corral them let alone connect them He overthinks himself into a corner and we re stuck there with him br Disability rights groups National Spasmodic Dysphonia Association and RespectAbility criticised Nyong o for basing her performance on spasmodic dysphonia She later apologised br br Critic Jim Vejvoda related the Tethered to urban legends and xenophobic paranoia about the Other also writing they resembled the Morlocks in H G Wells s novel The Time Machine Journalist Noel Ransome viewed the film as being about the effects of classism and marginalization writing the Tethered are effigies of this same situational classism They re trapped mentally and physically and ignored Joel Meares of Rotten Tomatoes also noted that the Tethered referencing the we re Americans line are representatives of the duality of American society how some citizens can afford to live on top of the class system while others are stuck in poverty He also noted the title Us could mean U S or United States br Manohla Dargis of The New York Times notes that the Wilsons are introduced with an aerial sweep of greenery similar to the opening of Stanley Kubrick s The Shining and sees that movie as the principal influence on Us Describing Peele as a true cinephile she also identifies allusions to other films including Jaws A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Goonies as well as one scene suggesting an influence by the Austrian film director Michael Haneke s horror film Funny Games and subsequent U S remake br The Tethered s red jump suits and single glove were an allusion to Michael Jackson along with the Thriller shirt seen on young Adelaide and Peele has stated that Jackson was the patron saint of duality Peele referenced many other instances of s culture including allusions to The Lost Boys and Hands Across America stating Everything in this movie was deliberate that is one thing I can guarantee you Unless you didn t like something and that was a complete accident br The film contains numerous references to Jeremiah which reads Therefore thus saith the Lord I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape Although they cry out to me I will not listen to them NIV Critic Rosie Fletcher commented on the context with Jeremiah warning Jerusalem was facing destruction due to false idols and expressed the opinion that the film s characters also worshiped the wrong things such as Ophelia the virtual assistant br Peele later explained in the film s digital release special features that a central theme of the film is American privilege br br One of the central themes in Us is that we can do a good job collectively of ignoring the ramifications of privilege I think it s the idea that what we feel like we deserve comes you know at the expense of someone else s freedom or joy You know the biggest disservice we can do as a faction with a collective privilege like the United States is to presume that we deserve it and that it isn t luck that has us born where we re born For us to have our privilege someone suffers That s where the Tethered connection I think resonates the most is that those who suffer and those who prosper are two sides of the same coin You can never forget that We need to fight for the less fortunate br br Us was nominated for one Art Directors Guild four Critics Choice Movie Awards
