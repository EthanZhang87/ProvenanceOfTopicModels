In filmmaking and video production a shot is a series of frames that runs for an uninterrupted period of time Film shots are an essential aspect of a movie where angles transitions and cuts are used to further express emotion ideas and movement The term shot can refer to two different parts of the filmmaking process br br In production a shot is the moment that the camera starts rolling until the moment it stops br In film editing a shot is the continuous footage or sequence between two edits or cuts br br br Etymology br The term shot is derived from the early days of film production when cameras were hand cranked and operated similarly to the hand cranked machine guns of the time That is a cameraman would shoot film the way someone would shoot bullets from a machine gun br br br Categories of shots br br Shots can be categorized in a number of ways br br br By field size br The field size explains how much of the subject and its surrounding area is visible within the camera s field of view and is determined by two factors the distance of the subject from the camera camera subject distance and the focal length of the lens Note that the shorter a lens s focal length the wider its angle of view the angle in wide angle lens for instance which is how much you see so the same idea can also be expressed as that the lens s angle of view plus camera subject distance is the camera s field of view br br the long shot or wide shot often used as an establishing shot that shows the environment around the subjects br the full shot where the entirety of the subject is just visible within the frame br the medium long shot where the frame ends near the knees br the medium shot where the frame stops either just above or just below the waist br the medium close up where more of the shoulder is visible than in the close up br the close up where the shoulder line is visible br the extreme close up where the frame stops at the subject s chin and forehead br Three less often used field sizes are br br the extreme long shot used for epic views and panoramas br the American shot also shot a slight variation of the medium long shot to also include outside the waistband handgun holsters in Western movies a characterization from French film criticism for a type of shot in certain American films of the s and s also referred to as a Cowboy shot in reference to the gun holster being just above the bottom frame line br the Italian shot where only a person s eyes are visible named after the genre of Italo Westerns particularly the Dollars Trilogy by Sergio Leone that established this particular field size br br br By camera placement br Shots referring to camera placement and angle rather than field size include br br Camera angles br the aerial shot br the bird s eye shot sometimes performed as a crane shot br the low angle shot br the over the shoulder shot br the point of view shot br the reverse shot is defined as a degree camera turn to the preceding image common in point of view and over the shoulder in the latter care must be applied to avoid a continuity error by violating the degree rule br the two shot where two people are in the picture br br br By other criteria br the establishing shot is defined by giving an establishing broad overview over a scene whether performed by a wide shot with a fixed camera a zoom a series of different close ups achieved by camera motion or a sequence of independent close angle shots edited right after each other br the master shot is a scene done in one single take with no editing br the freeze frame shot is created in editing by displaying a single frame for an elongated duration of time br the insert shot is created in editing by replacing a picture with another while the audio stays the same br the dolly shot also known as a tracking or trolley shot in which the camera moves toward or away from its subject while filming Traditionally dolly shots are filmed from a camera dolly but the same motion may also be performed with a Steadicam or gimbal A dolly shot is generally described in terms of dollying in or dollying out br br br Film editing br br Cutting between shots taken at different times or from different perspectives is known as film editing and is one of the central arts of filmmaking br br br Duration br br The length of shots is an important consideration that can greatly affect a film The purpose of editing any given scene is to create a representation of the way the scene might be perceived by the story teller Shots with a longer duration can make a scene seem more relaxed and slower paced whereas shots with a shorter duration can make a scene seem urgent and faster paced br The average shot length ASL of a film is one of its cinemetrical measures For example The Mist has a length of minutes and consists of shots so the ASL is seconds while Russian Ark is a single minute long take so an ASL of minutes or about seconds a factor of difference br Shots with extremely long durations are difficult to do because any error in the shot would force the filmmaker to restart from scratch and are thus only occasionally used Films famous for their long cuts include Francis Ford Coppola s The Godfather in which the entire first scene is a long take featuring Bonasera describing the assault on his daughter and Alfred Hitchcock s Rope which only cuts at the end of each reel and does so surreptitiously so that it seems as if the whole film is one take Orson Welles s Touch of Evil opens with a long tracking crane shot as does Robert Altman s The Player br In addition to Russian Ark which was made in using digital recording technology other films known for their extremely long takes include Stanley Kubrick s A Space Odyssey and the works of Andrei Tarkovsky starting with Solaris B la Tarr is also known for using very long takes consistently in his films Joss Whedon s feature film Serenity introduces the main characters with a long take Although Fish Cat is a single minute long take the narrator succeeded in playing with time and including several flashbacks br br br See also br br Camera angle br Film frame br Filmmaking br Take br List of one shot
