Horror is a film genre that seeks to elicit fear or disgust in its audience for entertainment purposes br Horror films often explore dark subject matter and may deal with transgressive topics or themes Broad elements include monsters apocalyptic events and religious or folk beliefs br Horror films have existed for more than a century Early inspirations from before the development of film include folklore religious beliefs and superstitions of different cultures and the Gothic and horror literature of authors such as Edgar Allan Poe Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley From origins in silent films and German Expressionism horror only became a codified genre after the release of Dracula Many sub genres emerged in subsequent decades including body horror comedy horror slasher films splatter films supernatural horror and psychological horror The genre has been produced worldwide varying in content and style between regions Horror is particularly prominent in the cinema of Japan Korea Italy and Thailand among other countries br Despite being the subject of social and legal controversy due to their subject matter some horror films and franchises have seen major commercial success influenced society and spawned several popular culture icons br br br Characteristics br The Dictionary of Film Studies defines the horror film as representing disturbing and dark subject matter seeking to elicit responses of fear terror disgust shock suspense and of course horror from their viewers In the chapter The American Nightmare Horror in the s from Hollywood from Vietnam to Reagan film critic Robin Wood declared that commonality between horror films are that normality is threatened by the monster This was further expanded upon by The Philosophy of Horror or Parodoxes of the Heart by No l Carroll who added that repulsion must be pleasurable as evidenced by the genre s popularity br Prior to the release of Dracula historian Gary Don Rhodes explained that the idea and terminology of horror film did not exist yet as a codified genre although critics used the term horror to describe films in reviews prior to Dracula s release Horror was a term used to describe a variety of meanings In Moving Picture World defined horrors as showcasing striped convicts murderous Indians grinning black handers homicidal drunkards Some titles that suggest horror such as The Hand of Horror was a melodrama about a thief who steals from his own sister During the silent era the term horror was used to describe everything from battle scenes in war films to tales of drug addiction Rhodes concluded that the term horror film or horror movie was not used in early cinema br The mystery film genre was in vogue and early information on Dracula being promoted as mystery film was common despite the novel play and film s story relying on the supernatural Newman discussed the genre in British Film Institute s Companion to Horror where he noted that Horror films in the s were easy to identify but following that decade the more blurred distinctions become and horror becomes less like a discrete genre than an effect which can be deployed within any number of narrative settings or narratives patterns In the s the horror film was viewed in different terms Critic Siegfried Kracauer included The Lost Weekend among films described as terror films along with Shadow of a Doubt The Dark Corner Gaslight Shock The Spiral Staircase The Stranger Spellbound while two years earlier the New York Times described a new cycle of horror productions included Gaslight The Woman in the Window Dark Waters Laura and Phantom Lady Mark Jancovich wrote in The Shifting Definitions of Genre Essays on Labeling Films Television Shows and Media that the term was virtually synonymous with mystery as a generic term not being limited to films concerned with the strange eerie and uncanny br Various writings on genre from Altman Lawrence Alloway Violent America The Movies and Peter Hutchings Approaches to Popular Film implied it easier to view films as cycles opposed to genres suggesting the slasher film viewed as a cycle would place it in terms of how the film industry was economically and production wise the personnel involved in their respective eras and how the films were marketed exhibited and distributed br Mark Jancovich in an essay declared that there is no simple collective belief as to what constitutes the horror genre between both fans and critics of the genre Jancovich found that disagreements existed from audiences who wanted to distinguish themselves This ranged from fans of different genres who may view a film like Alien as belonging to science fiction and horror fan bases dismissing it as being inauthentic to either genre Further debates exist among fans of the genre with personal definitions of true horror films such as fans who embrace cult figures like Freddy Kruger of the A Nightmare on Elm Street series while others disassociate themselves from characters and series and focusing on genre auteur directors like Dario Argento while others fans would deem Argento s films as too mainstream having preferences more underground films Andrew Tudor wrote in Monsters and Mad Scientists A Cultural History of the Horror Movie suggested that Genre is what we collectively believe it to be br br br Cinematic techniques br br In a study by Jacob Shelton the many ways that audience members are manipulated through horror films was investigated in detail Negative space is one such method that can play a part in inducing a reaction causing one s eyes to remotely rest on anything in the frame a wall or the empty black void in the shadows br The jump scare is a horror film trope where an abrupt change in image accompanied with a loud sound intends to surprise the viewer This can also be subverted to create tension where an audience may feel more unease and discomfort by anticipating a jump scare br Mirrors are often used in horror films is to create visual depth and build tension Shelton argues mirrors have been used so frequently in horror films that audiences have been conditioned to fear them and subverting audience expectations of a jump scare in a mirror can further build tension Tight framing and close ups are also commonly used these can build tension and induce anxiety by not allowing the viewer to see beyond what is around the protagonist br br br Music br br Music is a key component of horror films In Music in the Horror Film Lerner writes music in horror film frequently makes us feel threatened and uncomfortable and intends to intensify the atmosphere created in imagery and themes Dissonance atonality and experiments with timbre are typical characteristics used by composers in horror film music br br br Themes br br In the book Dark Dreams author Charles Derry conceived horror films as focusing on three broad themes the horror of personality horror of Armageddon and the horror of the demonic The horror of personality derives from monsters being at the centre of the plot such Frankenstein s monster whose psychology makes them perform unspeakable horrific acts ranging from rapes mutilations and sadistic killings Other key works of this form are Alfred Hitchcock s Psycho which feature psychotic murderers without the make up of a monster The second Armageddon group delves on the fear of large scale destruction which ranges from science fiction works but also of natural events such as Hitchcock s The Birds The last group of the Fear of the Demonic features graphic accounts of satanic rites witchcraft exorcisms outside traditional forms of worship as seen in films like The Exorcist or The Omen br Some critics have suggested horror films can be a vessel for exploring contemporary cultural political and social trends Jeanne Hall a film theorist agrees with the use of horror films in easing the process of understanding issues by making use of their optical elements The use of horror films can help audiences understand international prior historical events occurs for example to depict the horrors of the Vietnam War the Holocaust the worldwide AIDS epidemic or post pessimism In many occurrences the manipulation of horror presents cultural definitions that are not accurate yet set an example to which a person relates to that specific cultural from then on in their life br br br History br br br Sub genres of horror films br Horror is a malleable genre and often can be altered to accommodate other genre types such as science fiction making some films difficult to categorize br br br Body horror br br A genre that emerged in the s body horror films focus on the process of a bodily transformation In these films the body is either engulfed by some larger process or heading towards fragmentation and collapse In these films the focus can be on apocalyptic implication of an entire society being overtaken but the focus is generally upon an individual and their sense of identity primarily them watching their own body change The earliest appearance of the sub genre was the work of director David Cronenberg specifically with early films like Shivers Mark Jancovich of the University of Manchester declared that the transformation scenes in the genre provoke fear and repulsion but also pleasure and excitement such as in The Thing and The Fly br br br Christmas horror br br Christmas horror is a film genre that emerged in the s with films such as Whoever Slew Auntie Roo and Silent Night Bloody Night which were soon followed by the influential Black Christmas Defining the Christmas horror genre has been described as challenging as it has generally been regarded as a sub genre of the slasher film Adam Rockoff in Rue Morgue noted that the sub genre sits within a trend of holiday themed slasher films alongside films such as My Bloody Valentine and April Fool s Day Others take a broader view that Christmas horror is not limited to the slasher genre noting how it evolved from the English Christmas tradition of telling ghost stories Christmas in literature has historically included elements of darkness fright misery death and decay tracing its literary antecedents as far back as the biblical account of the Massacre of the Innocents and more recently in works such as E T A Hoffmann s The Nutcracker and the Mouse King and Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol Although ghosts have largely been replaced by serial killers Christmas horror creates an outlet through which to explore a modern reinvention of the Christmas ghost story br br br Erotic horror br br Erotic horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that blends sensual and sexual imagery with horrific themes for the sake of sexual arousal Erotic horror has had influences on French and American horror cinema The works of Jean Rollin such as Le Viol du Vampire and Fascination are considered quintessential erotic horror films blending deeply sexual imagery with gore American cinema has also featured notable erotic horror film franchises such as Candyman An example of a British erotic horror film series is Hellraiser Alien features heavy erotic imagery with the design of the Xenomorph by H R Giger featuring both phallic and vaginal imagery intended to symbolize patriarchal guilt as well as sex rape and pregnancy br br br Folk horror br br Folk horror uses elements of folklore or other religious and cultural beliefs to instil fear in audiences Folk horror films have featured rural settings and themes of isolation religion and nature Frequently cited examples are Witchfinder General The Blood on Satan s Claw The Wicker Man The Witch and Midsommar Local folklore and beliefs have been noted as being prevalent in horror films from the Southeast Asia region including Thailand and Indonesia br br br Found footage horror br The found footage horror film technique gives the audience a first person view of the events on screen and presents the footage as being discovered after Horror films which are framed as being made up of found footage merge the experiences of the audience and characters which may induce suspense shock and bafflement Alexandra Heller Nicholas noted that the popularity of sites like YouTube in sparked a taste for amateur media leading to the production of further films in the found footage horror genre later in the s including the particularly financially successful Paranormal Activity br br br Gothic horror br br In their book Gothic film Richard J McRoy and Richard J Hand stated that Gothic can be argued as a very loose subgenre of horror but argued that Gothic as a whole was a style like film noir and not bound to certain cinematic elements like the Western or science fiction film The term gothic is frequently used to describe a stylized approach to showcasing location desire and action in film Contemporary views of the genre associate it with imagery of castles at hilltops and labyrinth like ancestral mansions that are in various states of disrepair Narratives in these films often focus on an audience s fear and attraction to social change and rebellion The genre can be applied to films as early as The Haunted Castle Frankenstein as well as to more complex iterations such as Park Chan wook s Stoker and Jordan Peele s Get Out br The gothic style is applied to several films throughout the history of the horror film This includes Universal Pictures horror films of the s the revival of gothic horror in the s and s with films from Hammer Roger Corman s Poe cycle and several Italian productions By the s American and British productions often had vampire films set in a contemporary setting such as Hammer Films had their Dracula stories set in a modern setting and made other horror material which pushed the erotic content of their vampire films that was initiated by Black Sunday In the s the older horror characters of Dracula and Frankenstein s monster rarely appeared with vampire themed films continued often in the tradition of authors like Anne Rice where vampirism becomes a lifestyle choice rather than plague or curse Following the release of Francis Ford Coppola s Bram Stoker s Dracula a small wave of high budgeted gothic horror romance films were released in the s br br br Natural horror br br Also described as eco horror the natural horror film is a subgenre featuring nature running amok in the form of mutated beasts carnivorous insects and normally harmless animals or plants turned into cold blooded killers In Alfred Hitchcock defined a new genre nature taking revenge on humanity with The Birds that was expanded into a trend into the s Following the success of Willard a film about killer rats had similar films with Stanley and an official sequel Ben Other films followed in suit such as Night of the Lepus Frogs Bug Squirm and what Muir described as the turning point in the genre with Jaws which became the highest grossing film at that point and moved the animal attacks genres towards a less fantastic route with less giant animals and more real life creatures such as Grizzly and Night Creature Orca and Jaws The film is linked with the environmental movements that became more mainstream in the s and early s such vegetarianism animal rights movements and organizations such as Greenpeace Following Jaws sharks became the most popular animal of the genre ranging from similar such as Mako The Jaws of Death and Great White to the Sharknado film series James Marriott found that the genre had lost momentum since the s while the films would still be made towards the turn of the millennium br br br Psychological horror br br Bill Gibron of PopMatters declared a mixed definition of the psychological horror film ranging from definitions of anything that created a sense of disquiet or apprehension to a film where an audience s mind makes up what was not directly displayed visually Gibron concluded it as a clouded gray area between all out splatter and a trip through a cinematic dark ride br br br Religious horror br br Religious horror is a subgenre of horror film whose common themes are based on religion and focus heavily on supernatural beings often with demons as the main antagonists that bring a sense of threat Such films commonly use religious elements including the crucifix or cross holy water the Bible the rosary the sign of the cross the church and prayer which are forms of religious symbols and rituals used to depict the use of faith to defeat evil br br br Slasher film br br The slasher film is a horror subgenre which involves a killer murdering a group of people often teenagers usually by use of bladed tools In his book on the genre author Adam Rockoff wrote that these villains represented a rogue genre of films that are tough problematic and fiercely individualistic Following the financial success of Friday the th at least other slasher films appeared in alone These films usually revolved around three properties unique social settings campgrounds schools holidays and a crime from the past committed an accidental drowning infidelity a scorned lover and a ready made group of victims camp counselors students wedding parties The genre was derided by several contemporary film critics of the era such as Ebert and often were highly profitable in the box office The release of Scream led to a brief revival of the slasher films for the s Other countries imitated the American slasher film revival such as South Korea s early s cycle with Bloody Beach Nightmare and The Record br br br Supernatural horror br br Supernatural horror films integrate supernatural elements such as the afterlife spirit possession and religion into the horror genre br br br Teen horror br Teen horror is a horror subgenre that victimizes teenagers while usually promoting strong anti conformity teenage leads appealing to young generations This subgenre often depicts themes of sex under aged drinking and gore Horror films aimed a young audience featuring teenage monsters grew popular in the s with several productions from American International Pictures AIP and productions of Herman Cohen with I Was a Teenage Werewolf and I Was a Teenage Frankenstein This led to later productions like Daughter of Dr Jekyll and Frankenstein s Daughter Teen horror cycle in the s often showcased explicit gore and nudity with John Kenneth Muir described as cautionary conservative tales where most of the films stated if you partook in such vices such as drugs or sex your punishment of death would be handed out br Prior to Scream there were no popular teen horror films in the early s After the financial success of Scream teen horror films became increasingly reflexive and self aware until the end of the s with films like I Know What You Did Last Summer and non slasher The Faculty The genre lost prominence as teen films dealt with threats with more realism in films like Donnie Darko and Crazy Beautiful In her book on the s teen horror cycle Alexandra West described the general trend of these films is often looked down upon by critics journals and fans as being too glossy trendy and sleek to be considered worthwhile horror films br br br Regional horror films br br br Asian horror films br Horror films in Asia have been noted as being inspired by national cultural or religious folklore particularly beliefs in ghosts or spirits In Asian Horror Andy Richards writes that there is a widespread and engrained acceptance of supernatural forces in many Asian cultures and suggests this is related to animist pantheist and karmic religious traditions as in Buddhism and Shintoism Although Chinese Japanese Thai and Korean horror has arguably received the most international attention horror also makes up a considerable proportion of Cambodian and Malaysian cinema br br br Hong Kong br The Hong Kong film industry has long been associated with genre cinema specifically for action films The Hong Kong horror films are generally broad and often feature demons wraiths and reanimated corpses and have been described by authors Gary Bettinson and Daniel Martin as generically diffuse and resistant to Western definitions This was due to Hong Kong cinema often creating various hybrid films which mesh traditional horror films with elements of other genres such as A Chinese Ghost Story which led to Hong Kong critic Chen Yu to suggest that this form was one more indication of the Hong Kong cinema s inability to establish a proper horror genre br Various interpretations of the Hong Kong horror film have included Bettinson and Martin stating that Hong Kong films frequently prioritize comedy and romance over fear Author Felicia Chan described Hong Kong cinema as being noted for its extensive use of parody and pastiche and the horror and ghost films of Hong Kong often turn to comedy and generally follow forms of ghost erotica and jiangshi transl stiff corpses Early horror related cinema in Mandarin and Cantonese featured ghost stories that occasionally had rational explanations The literary source of Hong Kong horror films is Pu Songling s Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio a series of short stories with supernatural themes written in the th century Unlike Western stories Pu focuses on the value of the human form which is essential for reincarnation leading to stories about ghosts such as Fox spirit trying to seal a mortal man s life essence usually through sex This led to a relatively large degree of Hong Kong horror films even more than their Korean and Japanese counterparts featuring chimeric creatures exhibiting bodily features of various animals According to author Stephen Teo corporeal trans substantiation such as in the form of a human to werewolf or vampire to bat is unthinkable in Chinese culture since the rule of pragmatism requires that one s physical human shape be kept intact for reincarnation and for the wheel of life to keep revolving br Early Hong Kong horror films of the s were often described by terms such as shenguai gods spirits and the strange bizarre qi guai strange and shen hua godly story Most of these films involved a man meeting a neoi gwei female ghost followed by a flashback illustrating how the woman had died and usually concluded with a happy ending involving reincarnation and romance Examples include the ghost story Beauty Raised from the Dead and The Nightly Cry of the Ghost which suggests the supernatural but concludes with a rational explanation for the proceedings Other trends included humorous variations such as The Dunce Bumps into a Ghost as well as films about snake demons that were imitating films from the Philippines and made co productions with the country with Sanda Wong and The Serpent s Girls Worldy Fancies br br Other Early works include The Enchanting Shadow based on Pu s work which did not create a cycle of ghost films In the s films such as the Shaw Brothers and Hammer Film Productions co production Legend of the Golden Vampires would not take off worldwide and not produce cycles of similar horror films King Hu s films such as Touch of Zen would touch upon Pu s work including plot points of fox spirits while his other work such as Legend of the Mountain would be full on ghost stories br Veteran stuntman actor and director Sammo Hung decided to blend horror with more humour leading to Encounters of the Spooky Kind The film was popular at the box office leading to several kung fu oriented ghost comedies Directors ranging from Ann Hui to Tsui Hark would all dabble with the genre with Sammo Hung producing Mr Vampire and Tsui Hark producing A Chinese Ghost Story which would be stories from Pu Songling s work br According to Gary Bettinson and Daniel Martin the critical attitude towards Hong Kong horror was that it reached its commercial and artistic peaks in the s partially in response to the audience s decline in the dominance of kung fu films The rise of Asian horror films in the s has been described by Laikwan Pang in Screen as setting Hong Kong horror films back stating that once famous for churning out hundreds of formulaic horror films have almost completely died out precisely because of the industry s fraught efforts to adapt to a Chinese market and its policy environment In author Daniel O Brien stated that the Hong Kong film industry still turned out horror films Still the number of them turned out much lower with the genre rarely attracting major filmmakers and operating on the low budget side of the industry with films like the Troublesome Night series which had entries In Bettinson and Martin found that the Hong Kong horror film had become nostalgic and contemporary noting films like Rigor Mortis as referencing the older Mr Vampire film while also as adapting to the shifting global market for Asian cinema br br br Exploitation and Category III br In the s a shift in style and type of Hong Kong horror films began being produced with more explicit depictions of sex Actor Kam Kwok leung who appeared in some of these films such as the Shaw Brothers produced The Killer Snakes stated that the studio s attitude was rather shameless they threw in nude scenes or sex scenes regardless of the genre As long as they could insert these scenes they didn t mind throwing logic out the window The Killer Snakes was no exception The film was directed by Kuei Chih Hung it was his first horror film and led to him being one of the few Hong Kong directors to specialize in horror These films were sometimes described as exploitation characterized by their gratuitous or excessive nudity extreme violence and gore are generally regarded by critics as bad rather than quality or serious cinema Keui would return to horror in various films after such as Ghost Eyes Hex Hex vs Witcraft Hex After Hex Curse of Evil and The Boxer s Omen These films were swept aside by the late s when an even more raw form of exploitation cinema arose with the Category III film creation in Category III films from the era such as Dr Lamb and The Untold Story were linked to horror from their excessive violence and blood letting of their serial killer central characters br Other horror films borrowing from Western trends were made such as Dennis Yu s two films The Beasts resembling Last House on the Left and The Imp Patrick Tam s Love Massacre resembling the American slasher film trend Later cases of the genre often exclude the ghost story style such as The Untold Story and Dream Home which have lead characters within scientific explanation br br br India br br The Cinema of India produces the largest amount of films in the world ranging from Bollywood Hindi cinema based in Mumbai to other regions such as West Bengal and Tamil Nadu Unlike Hollywood and most Western cinematic traditions horror films produced in India incorporate romance song and dance and other elements in the masala format where as many genres as possible are bundled into a single film Odell and Le Blanc described the Indian horror film as a popular but minor part of the country s film output and that has not found a true niche in mainstream Indian cinema These films are made outside of Mumbai and are generally seen as disreputable to their more respectable popular cinema As of the Central Board of Film Certification India s censorship board has stated films pointless or unavoidable scenes of violence cruelty and horror scenes of violence intended to provide entertainment and such scene that may have the effect of desensitising or dehumanizing people are not shown br br The earliest Indian horror films were films about ghosts and reincarnation or rebirth such as Mahal These early films tended to be spiritual pieces or tragic dramas opposed to having visceral content While prestige films from Hollywood productions had been shown in Indian theatres the late s had seen a parallel market for minor American and European co productions to films like the James Bond film series and the films of Mario Bava In the s and s the Ramsay Brothers created a career in the lower reaches of the Bombay film industry making low budget horror films primarily influenced by Hammer s horror film productions with little known about their production or distribution history The Ramsay Brothers were a family of seven brothers who made horror films that were featured monsters and evil spirits that mix in song and dance sections as well as comic interludes Most of their films played at smaller cinema in India with Tulsi Ramsay one of the brothers later stating Places where even the trains don t stop that s where our business was Their horror films are generally dominated by low budget productions such as those by the Ramsay Brothers Their most successful film was Purana Mandir which was the second highest grossing film in India that year The influence of American productions would have an effect on later Indian productions such as The Exorcist which would lead to films involving demonic possession such as Gehrayee India has also made films featuring zombies and vampires that drew from American horror films opposed to indigenous myths and stories Other directors such as Mohan Bhakri made low budget highly exploitive films such as Cheekh and his biggest hit the monster movie Khooni Mahal br Horror films are not self evident categories in Tamil and Telugu films and it was only until the late s that straight horror cinema was regularly produced with films like Uruvam Sivi and Eeram were released The first decade of the twenty first century saw a flurry of commercially successful Telugu horror films like A Film by Aravind Mantra and Arundhati were released Ram Gopal Varma made films that generally defied the conventions of popular Indian cinema making horror films like Raat and Bhoot with the latter film not containing and comic scenes or musical numbers In the horror film Tumbbad premiered in the critics week section of the th Venice International Film Festival the first ever Indian film to open the festival br br br Indonesia br br br Japan br br The Japanese film industry began in the late s with its most films from the s to the s being made through its studio system Following World War II Donald Richie noted that directors and screenwriters were no longer as interested in subjects that promoted a rosy future This led to development of ghost story and monster movies being made in Japan during the s The term horror as a genre only began circulating in Japan in the s in press and everyday language Prior to this horror fiction as it may be known was referred to with terms like mystery terror and dread According to manga author and critic Yoshihiro Yonezawa the first boom of horror manga with the success of the Kaiki sh setsu zensh and the success of the British horror films from Hammer Films which began circulating in Japan and gaining popularity Due to the circulation of these magazines a growing interest in the supernatural developed inspired by traditional Japanese ghost stories kaidan such as Yotsuya Kaidan as well as classical Japanese woodcut prints with themes of Japanese ghosts br br Colette Balmain in her book Introduction to Japanese Horror Film stated the two most important films that would influence the growth of the horror genre were Ugetsu exploring fears around modernization and Godzilla with its monster and its atomic breath reminding about the devastation caused by nuclear weapons Ugetsu would also lay the groundwork for several forms of Japanese horror films This included gothic ghost stories which accounted for most of Japanese horror films of the s and s the erotic themed ghost story films of the as well as later Japanese ghost story films like Ring and Ju On The Grudge Ugetsu would borrow from traditional Japanese theatre forms such as Kabuki and Noh Noh was marked for estrained understatement and abstraction with more focus on emotion than narrative of dialogue which would be reflected in later Japanese films like Onibaba and Kuroneko br In Shochiku released Daydream the first Japanese New Wave film to have a blatantly erotic story These films later became known as pink films a term of American origin applied to low budget and low profile films These softcore films helped struggling studios with the first wave of them being between and One sub genre of these films was the erotic ghost story which were less explicit than the usual pink cinema These films often featured wronged women such as the vengeful ghostly cat woman in Kuroneko Stories of ghost cats and similar creatures were part of the sub genre known as bakeneko mono or monster cat tales starting with The Ghost Cat of Otama Pond br In the Japanese film producer Ogura Satoru developed the series and directed the first installment Guinea Pig Devil s Experiment The series was controversial in Japan due in part to the public scrutiny the videos faced after the capture of Tsutomu Miyazaki a child murderer who had the films in his collection The series circulated enough within horror film fan circles that in a March issue of Fangoria a fan wrote in to ask the magazine to shift its toward underground films such as the notorious gorefests from Japan the infamous Guinea Pig series The magazine responded that the independent film market was fading away and that major studios had taken over the b film industry and that is where the power and commercial success lies Guinea Pig is not the future of horror Jay McRoy author of Nightmare Japan Contemporary Japanese Horror Cinema declared that films like Toshiharu Ikeda s Evil Dead Trap and Tetsuo The Iron Man spurred the emergence of an increasingly visceral and graphically violent wave of Japanese horror films with the latter film being one of the most influential Japanese horror films ever produced br Author and critic Kim Newman described the release of Hideo Nakata s Ring as one of the major cultural phenomenons in the horror film in the late s Along with the South Korean film Whispering Corridors it was a major hit across Asia leading to sequels and similar ghost stories from Asian countries With more than million sales worldwide the Resident Evil video game franchise began in Several Japanese productions involving zombies followed the games success such as Wild Zero and Versus and Junk These films zombies resembled the monsters from the s such Dawn of the Dead and Zombi In independent films had overtaken studio produced films with of the total films released in were independent The independent Japanese zombie film One Cut of the Dead became a sleeper hit in Japan receiving general acclaim worldwide and making Japanese box office history by earning over a thousand times its budget br br br South Korea br br The Korean horror film originated in the s and became a more prominent part of the countries film production in the early s While ghosts have appeared as early as in Korean film attempting to chart the history of the genre from this period was described by Alison Peirse and Daniel Martin the authors of Korean Horror Cinema as problematic due to the control of the Japanese colonial government blocking artistic or politically independent films Regardless of settings or time period many Korean horror films such as Song of the Dead have their stories focused on female relationships rooted in Korean Confucianism tradition with an emphasis on biological families Despite the influence of folklore in some films there is no key single canon to define the Korean horror film Korean horror cinema is also defined by melodrama as it does in most of Korean cinema br The Housemaid is widely credited as initiating the first horror cycle in Korean cinema which involved films of the s about supernatural revenge tales focused on cruelly murdered women who sought out revenge Several of these films are in dept to Korean folklore and ghost stories with stories of animal transformation Traces of international cinema are found in early Korean horror cinema such as Shin Sang ok s Madame White Snake from the traditional Chinese folktale Legend of the White Snake Despite bans of Japanese cultural products that lasted from to the influence of Japanese culture are still found in Kaiby eiga ghost cats themed films such as A Devilish Homicide and Ghosts of Chosun Other s films featured narratives involving kumiho such as The Thousand Year Old Fox Cheonnyeonho These tales based on folklore and ghosts continued into the s Korea also produced giant monster films that received release in the United States such as Yongary Monster from the Deep and Ape br br By the end of the s the Korean horror film entered a period known commonly as the dark time for South Korean cinema with audience attracted to Hong Kong and American imports The biggest influence on this was the S policy adopted by the Chun Doo hwan government which promoted the production of sports screen and sex for the film industry leading to more relaxed censorship leading to a boom in Erotic Korean films Horror films followed this trend with Suddenly at Midnight a reimagining of The Housemaid As of many pre Korean horror films are only available through the Korean Film Archive KOFA in Seoul It was not until the release of Whispering Corridors was the Korean horror film reinvigorated with its style containing traces of traditional Korean cinema culturally specific themes and melodrama but also the American pattern of making a franchise of horror films as the film received four sequels Since the film s release Korean horror films had had strong diversity with gothic tales like A Tale of Two Sisters gory horror films like Bloody Reunion horror comedy To Catch a Virgin Ghost vampire films Thirst and independent productions Teenage Hooker Became a Killing Machine These films varied in popularity with Ahn Byeong ki s Phone reaching the top ten in the domestic box office sales in while in no locally produced Korean horror films were financially successful with local audiences In Anton Bitel declared in Sight Sound that South Korea was one of the international hot spots for horror film production in the last decade citing the international and popular releases of films like Train to Busan The Odd Family Zombie on Sale Peninsula and The Wailing br br br Thailand br br br Oceania br br br Australia br It is unknown when Australia s cinema first horror title may have been with thoughts ranging from The Strangler s Grip to The Face at the Window while stories featuring ghosts would appear in Guyra Ghost Mystery By the more prolific era of Australian cinema ended with production not returning with heavy input of government finance in the s It took until the s for Australia to develop sound film with television films that eventually received theatrical release with Dead Easy and Night of Fear The Cars That Ate Paris was the first Australian horror production made for theatrical release s Australian art cinema was funded by state film corporations who considered them more culturally acceptable than local exploitation films Ozploitation which was part of the Australian phenomenon called the cultural cringe The greater success of genre films like Mad Max The Last Wave and Patrick led to the Australian Film Commission to change its focus to being a more commercial operation This closed in as its funding was abused by investors using them as tax avoiding measures A new development known as the BA tax shelter scheme was developed ushering a slew of productions leading to what Peter Shelley author of Australian Horror Films suggested meant making a profit was more important than making a good film Shelley called these films derivative of American films and presenting generic American material These films included the horror film productions of Antony I Ginnane While Australia would have success with international films between the mid s and the s less than five horror films were produced in the country between and It was only after the success of Wolf Creek that a new generation of filmmakers would continuously make horror genre films in Australia that continued into the s br br br New Zealand br By New Zealand has

Among the earliest known New Zealand horror films productions are Strange Behavior a co production with Australia and Death Warmed Up a single production Early features such as Melanie Read s Trial Run where a mother is sent to remote cottage to photograph penguins and finds it habitat to haunted spirits and Gaylene Preston s Mr Wrong purchases a car that is haunted by its previous owner Other films imitate American slasher and splatter films with Bridge to Nowhere and the early films of Peter Jackson who combined splatter films with comedy with Bad Taste and Braindead which has the largest following of the mentioned films Film producer Ant Timpson had an influence curating New Zealand horror films creating the Incredibly Strange Film Festival in the s and producing his own horror films over the s including The ABCs of Death Deathgasm and Housebound Timpson noted the latter horror entries from New Zealand are all humorous films like What We Do in the Shadows with Jonathan King director of Black Sheep and The Tattooist stating I d love to see a genuinely scary New Zealand film but I don t know if New Zealand audiences or the funding bodies are keen br br br European horror films br Ian Olney described the horror films of Europe were often more erotic and just plain stranger than their British and American counter parts European horror films generally referred to as Euro Horror draw from distinctly European cultural sources including surrealism romanticism decadent tradition early th century pulp literature film serials and erotic comics In comparison to the narrative logic in American genre films these films focused on imagery excessiveness and the irrational br Between the mid s and the mid s European horror films emerged from countries like Italy Spain and France and were shown in the United States predominantly at drive in theatre and grindhouse theatres br As producers and distributors all over the world were interested in horror films regardless of their origin changes started occurring in European low budget filmmaking that allowed for productions in the s and s for horror films from Italy France Germany the United Kingdom and Spain as well as co productions between these countries Several productions such as those in Italy were co productions due to the lack of international stars within the country European horror films began developing strong cult following since the late s br br br France br br France never truly developed a horror film movement to the volume that the United Kingdom or Italy had produced In their book European Nightmares editors Patricia Allmer Emily Brick and David Huxley noted that French cinema was generally perceived as having a tradition of the fantastic rather than horror films The editors noted that French cinema had produced a series of outstanding individual horror films from directors who did not specialize in the field In their book Horror Films Colin Odell Michelle Le Blanc referred to director Jean Rollin as one of the countries most consistent horror auteurs with years of productions described as highly divisive low budget horror films often featuring erotic elements vampires low budgets pulp stories and references to both high and low European art Another of the few French directors who specialized in horror is Alexandre Aja who stated that the problem with the French is that they don t trust their own language when it comes to horror American horror movies do well but in their own language the French just aren t interested br A st century movement of transgressive French cinema known as New French Extremity was named by film programmer James Quandt in who declared and derided that films of Catherine Breillat Claire Denis Gaspar No and Bruno Dumont among others had made cinema suddenly determined to break every taboo to wade in rivers of viscera and spumes of sperm to fill each frame with flesh nubile or gnarled and subject it to all manner of penetration mutilation and defilement In her book Films of the New French Extremity Alexandra West described the phenomenon as initially an art house movement but as the directors of those films started making horror films fitting arthouse standards such as Trouble Every Day and Marina de Van s In My Skin other directors began making more what West described as outright horror films such as Aja s High Tension and Xavier Gens Frontier s Some of these horror films of the New French Extremity movement would regularly place on Best Of genre lists such as Martyrs Inside and High Tension while Julia Ducournau s film Titane won the Palme d Or at the Cannes Film Festival br br br Germany br br German postwar horror films remained marginal after the silent film era The Third Reich ended production of horror films and German productions never gained a mass audience in Germany s horror film output leading the genre to not return in any major form until the late s Between and Randall Halle stated about only films that could be described as horror films and which were co productions with other countries primarily Spain and Italy Outside of Herzog s Nosferatu most of these films low budget that focused on erotic themes over horrific turns in narrative In the mid s Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons was tasked with protection of minors from violent racist and pornographic content in literature and comic books which led to increased the code which became law in These laws expanded to home video in following the release of titles such as Sam Raimi s The Evil Dead and the political change when Helmut Kohl became chancellor in The amount of West German film productions were already low in the s leaving the genre to be shot by amateurs who had little to no budgets In the early s West Germany s government cracked down on graphic horror films similar to the United Kingdom s Video nasty panic A direct response to this led to West German independent directors in the late s and early s West German indie directors to release a comparatively high number of what Kai Uwe Werbeck described as low budget hyper violent horror films sometimes described as German underground horror Werbeck described the most prominent of these were of J rg Buttgereit described by Werbeck as arguably the most visible German horror director of the s and early s one which Harald Harzheim claimed to be the first German director since the s to give the horror genre new impulses Similar gory films such as Olaf Ittenbach s The Burning Moon was the first and last film to be made in Germany that is still banned there as of br German horror films made a comeback in what Werbeck described as a mainstream fashion in the st century This included the box office hit Anatomy and Antibodies who Odell and Le Blanc described as being a similar to the s krimi genre of crime films The second were films made for international markets such as Legion of the Dead and the video game adaptations directed Uwe Boll such as House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark br br br Italy br br Early silent Italian fantastique films focused more on adventure and farce opposed to Germany s expressionism The National Fascist Party in Italy had forced film in the early sound era to spread the civilization of Rome throughout the world as quickly as possible Another influence was the Centro Cattolico Cinematografico Catholic Cinematic Centre that was described by Curti as permissive towards propaganda and repressive against anything related to sexuality or morality The Vatican City s newspaper L Osservatore Romano for example critiqued the circulation of films like Bride of Frankenstein in br As Italian neorealism had monopolized Italian cinema in the s and as the average Italian standard for living increased Italian critic and historian Gian Piero Brunetta stated that it would appear legitimate to start exploring the fantastic Italian film historian Goffredo Fofi echoed these statements stating in that ghosts monsters and the taste for the horrible appears when a society that became wealthy and evolves by industrializing and are accompanied by a state of well being which began to exist and expand in Italy only since a few years Initially this was a rise in peplum films after the release of Hercules Italy started moving beyond peplums making Westerns and horror films which were less expensive to produce than the previous sword and sandal films br Italy s initial wave of horror films were gothic horror were rooted in popular cinema and were often co productions with other countries Curti described the initial wave of the s Italian gothic horror allowed directors like Mario Bava Riccardo Freda and Antonio Margheriti to helm what Curti described as some of their very best works Bava s Black Sunday was particularly influential Many productions of this era were often written in a hurry sometimes developed during filming production by production companies that often did not last very long sometimes for only one film production After the gothic cycle ended primarily through a broader crisis that effected the Italian film industry with its audience rapidly shrinking Some gothics continued to be produced into the beginning of the s while the influence of the genre was felt in other Italian genres like the Spaghetti Western br The term giallo which means yellow in Italian is derived from Il Giallo Mondadori a long running series of mystery and crime novels identifiable by their distinctive uniform yellow covers and is used in Italy to describe all mystery and thriller fiction English language critics use the term to describe more specific films within the genre involving a murder mystery that revels in the details of the murder rather than the deduction of it or police procedural elements Tim Lucas deemed early films in the genre such as Bava s The Girl Who Knew Too Much while Curti described Blood and Black Lace as predominantly a series of violent erotically charged set pieces that are increasingly elaborate and spectacular in their construction and that Bava pushed these elements to the extreme which would solidify the genre It was not until the success of Dario Argento s film The Bird with the Crystal Plumage that the giallo genre started a major trend in Italian cinema br Other smaller trends permutated in Italy in the s such as films involving cannibals zombies and Nazis which Newman described as disreputable crazes In Italy entered the s the Italian film industry would gradually move towards making films for television The decade started with a high budgeted production of Argento s Inferno and with the death of Mario Bava Fulci became what historian Roberto Curti called Italy s most prominent horror film director in the early s Several zombie films were made in the country in the early s from Fulci and others while Argento would continue directing and producing films for others such as Lamberto Bava As Fulci s health deteriorated towards the end of the decade many directors turned to making horror films for Joe D Amato s Filmirage company independent films or works for television and home video Since the year European horror cinema has undergone a major revival Italian productions were part of this revival but these productions did not reach as either a wide audience or a critical recognition as films from France Germany Spain or the United Kingdom With the exception of a few films most Italian horror productions in the first years of the st century have not been theatrically released nor have they been featured in mainstream press discourse Bruno Mattei was the only Italian horror film maker active since the s and s continuing to make exploitation films with any regularity or consistency while Ivan Zuccon developed films cheaply often costing only a few thousand dollars Similarly The Last House in the Woods was entirely self funded by its director Gabriele Albanesi br br br Spain br The highest point of production of Spanish horror films took place during late Francoism between and a period associated to the so called Fantaterror the local expression of Euro Horror identifiable for its disproportionate doses of sex and violence During this period several Spanish filmmakers appeared with unique styles and themes such as Jes s Franco s The Awful Dr Orloff first internationally successful horror and exploitation film production from Spain Dr Orloff would appears in other films of Franco s during the period Paul Naschy the actor and screenwriter and Amando de Ossorio with his zombie like medieval knights in Tombs of the Blind Dead These directors adapted established monsters from popular films comics and pulp fiction and imbuing them with what Lazaro Reboll described as certain local flavour and relevance A partial overview of films from this era focused on classic monsters Frankenstein s Bloody Terror Dr Jekyll y el Hombre Lobo and films that grew from trends created by Night of the Living Dead and The Exorcist The Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue Exorcismo Most films of the period were low budget films with short shooting schedules while occasional films had respectable budgets such as Women and others that had art house directors attempt commercial production such as Vicente Aranda s The Blood Spattered Bride and Jorge Grau s Bloody Ceremony Antonio Lazaro Reboll wrote in that in the last forty years the horror film has formed as a significant part of Spain s local transnational filmic production that created its own auteurs stars and cycles For decades it was described by Beck and Rodr guez Ortega in Contemporary Spanish Cinema and Genre that the view of the genre has been almost exclusively been constructed negatively and that the rise in horror film productions in the late s and s in Spain was reviled by contemporary critics film historians and scholars In his book Cine espa ol cine de subg neros author Rom n Gurbern saw contemporary Spanish horror films as derivative of Authentic American and European traditions that will never make it into the histories of Spanish cinema unless it is dealt with in a succinct footnote br Film production decreased dramatically in the late s and s for several reasons including the boom in historical and political films in Spain during early year of democracy The film legislation implemented by general director of cinematography Pilar Mir in introduced a selective subvention system causing the overall number of annually made films including horror films to shrink thereby dealing a heavy blow to horror industry and the Fantaterror craze In addition there were changing habits on audiences and the visual material they sought It was not until the late s and the s that Spanish horror reached another production peak br After the success of private television operator Canal from the s onward investing in the production of films by the likes of lex de la Iglesia The Day of the Beast or Alejandro Amen bar Tesis and The Others through Sogecine other television companies such as Antena and Telecinco through Telecinco Cinema came to see horror as a profitable niche and the genre thereby became a successful formula for box office hits in the s underpinning the wider switch in the industry from the largely State dependent model of the s to the hegemony of mass media holdings in domestic film production Jaume Balaguer s The Nameless which became a popular film both in Spain and abroad paved the way for new Spanish horror films Filmax tried to capitalise on the success of the former film by creating the Fantastic Factory genre label and eventually came to develop one of the most successful Spanish film franchises with the Rec film series The success of Juan Antonio Bayona s The Orphanage ensued with the release of ersatz gothic films featuring creepy children Other key names for the development of the genre in the st century Spanish industry include Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and Paco Plaza br br br United Kingdom br br br Americas br br br Mexico br br After the release of a US produced Spanish language version of Dracula by George Melford for the Latin American market employing Mexican actors Mexican horror films were produced throughout the s and s often reflecting on the overarching theme of science vs religion conflict Ushered by the release of El vampiro the Mexploitation horror film era started in with films characterised by their low production values and camp appeal often featuring vampires wrestlers and Aztec mummies A key figure in the Mexican horror scene particularly in Germ n Robles starred vampire films was producer Abel Salazar The late s saw the advent of the prominence of Carlos Enrique Taboada as an standout Mexican horror filmmaker with films such as Hasta el viento tiene miedo El libro de piedra M s negro que la noche or Veneno para las hadas Mexican horror cinema has been noted for the mashup of classic gothic and romantic themes and characters with autochthonous features of the Mexican culture such as the Rancher a setting the colonial past or the myth of La Llorona shared with other Hispanic American nations br Horror has proven to be a dependable genre at the Mexican box office in the st century with Mexico ranking as having the world s largest relative popularity of the genre among viewers ahead of South Korea according to a research br br br Effects on audiences br br br Psychological effects br br In a study done by Uri Hasson et al brain waves were observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI This study used the inter subject correlation analysis ISC method of determining results It was shown that audience members tend to focus on certain facets in a particular scene simultaneously and tend to sit as still as possible while watching horror films br In another study done by John Greene Glenn Sparks it was found that the audience tends to experience the excitation transfer process ETP which causes a physiological arousal in audience members The ETP refers to the feelings experienced immediately after an emotion arousing experience such as watching a horror film In this case audience members heart rate blood pressure and respiration all increased while watching films with violence Audience members with positive feedback regarding the horror film have feelings similar to happiness or joy felt with friends but intensified Alternatively audience members with negative feedback regarding the film would typically feel emotions they would normally associate with negative experiences in their life br Only about of the American population enjoy the physiological rush felt immediately after watching horror films The population that does not enjoy horror films could experience emotional fallout similar to that of PTSD if the environment reminds them of particular scenes br A study suggested horror films that explore grief can provide psychological benefits to the bereaved with the genre well suited to representing grief through its genre conventions br br br Physical effects br In a study by Medes et al prolonged exposure to infrasound and low frequency noise Hz in long durations has an effect on vocal range i e longer exposure tends to form a lower phonation frequency range Another study by Baliatsas et al observed that there is a correlation between exposure to infrasound and low frequency noises and sleep related problems Though most horror films keep the audio around Hz the noise can still be unsettling in long durations br Another technique used in horror films to provoke a response from the audience is cognitive dissonance which is when someone experiences tension in themselves and is urged to relieve that tension Dissonance is the clashing of unpleasant or harsh sounds A study by Prete et al identified that the ability to recognize dissonance relied on the left hemisphere of the brain while consonance relied on the right half There is a stronger preference for consonance this difference is noticeable even in early stages of life Previous musical experience also can influence a dislike for dissonance br Skin conductance responses SCRs heart rate HR and electromyographic EMG responses vary in response to emotional stimuli showing higher for negative emotions in what is known as the negative bias When applied to dissonant music HR decreases as a bodily form of adaptation to harsh stimulation SCR increases and EMG responses in the face are higher The typical reactions go through a two step process of first orienting to the problem the slowing of HR then a defensive process a stronger increase in SCR and an increase in HR This initial response can sometimes result in a fight or flight response which is the characteristic of dissonance that horror films rely on to frighten and unsettle viewers br br br Reception br br br In film criticism br br Critic Robin Wood was not the first film critic to take the horror film seriously but his article Return of the Repressed in helped inaugurate the horror film into academic study as a genre Wood later stated that he was surprised that his work as well as the writing of Richard Lippe and Andrew Britton would receive historic importance intellectual views of the film genre William Paul in his book Laughing Screaming comments that the negative definition of the lower works would have it that they are less subtle than higher genres More positively it could be said that they are more direct Where lower forms are explicit higher forms tend to operate more by indirection Because of this indirection the higher forms are often regarded as being more metaphorical and consequently more resonant more open to the exegetical analyses of the academic industry br Steffen Hantke noted that academic criticism about horror cinema had always operated under duress noting that challenges in legitimizing its subject finding career minded academics might have always suspected that they were studying something that was ultimately too frivolous garish and sensationalistic to warrant serious critical attention br Some commentary has suggested that horror films have been underrepresented or underappreciated as serious works worthy of film criticism and major films awards As of only six horror films have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture with The Silence of the Lambs being the sole winner However horror films have still won major awards br Critics have also commented on the representation of women and disability in horror films as well as the prevalence of racial stereotypes br br br Censorship br br Many horror films have been the subject of moral panic censorship and legal controversy br In the United Kingdom film censorship has frequently been applied to horror films A moral panic over several slasher films in the s led to many of them being banned but released on videotape the phenomenon became popularly termed video nasties Constraints on permitted subject matter in Indonesian films has also influenced Indonesian horror films In March China banned all horror films from its market br In the U S the Motion Picture Production Code which was implemented in set moral guidelines for film content restraining movies containing controversial themes graphic violence explicit sexuality and or nudity The gradual abandonment of the Code and its eventual formal repeal in when it was replaced by the MPAA film rating system offered more freedom to the movie industry br br br br br br Notes
