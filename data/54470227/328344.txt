one of his earlier producers directing for the first time Spielberg and Marshall were the film s executive producers and Amblin Entertainment received a production credit br Marshall intended that the film would be reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock s The Birds People like to be scared but laughing like a roller coaster No one wants to be terrified Arachnophobia also bears similarities to the film Kingdom of the Spiders br Jamie Hyneman of MythBusters said in Popular Mechanics that Arachnophobia was one of the first films on which he worked and he often relied on simple magnets for effects The film used over Avondale spiders from New Zealand chosen for their large size unusually social lifestyle and harmlessness to humans they were guided around the set by heat and cold The spiders were tested for friendliness with humans and they were the ones selected for filming These spiders did not like Lemon Pledge furniture wax or hot blowing air so to make the spiders hit their marks during filming a pathway was created using Lemon Pledge as the boundaries and hair blow dryers were used to motivate the spiders to move The result was the spiders avoided the Lemon Pledge and moved following the non Pledged pathways created when the hot blow dryer air was aimed at them hitting their marks precisely On the unedited soundtrack the sound of multiple blow dryers had to be removed when the spiders followed their pathways The large general and queen spiders were articulated models For certain long shots a huge living spider was used Supervising sound editor Tom McCarthy recorded actual hisses from this spider for use in the final soundtrack The shower scene where the spider jumps on Becky Beechwood s face was a happy accident the spider was following the Lemon Pledge pathway and was supposed to jump onto her neck when the blow dryers were turned on full force However the spider landed directly on her face Actress Cori Wellins who had her eyes closed and was relishing her hot shower realized what had happened and thought oh God this is PERFECT and just continued on until the spider crawled down onto her neck and upper chest before she opened her eyes and screamed The cast actually adopted a few of the spiders and were not afraid of them in any way After cut was yelled on the set the cast would stop screaming and say Oh be careful don t step on that one and don t forget that one over there laughing the whole time after cut was called br Arachnophobia was primarily filmed in Cambria California the introductory and jungle scenes were filmed in southern Venezuela The school scenes were filmed at Coast Union High School with students and staff used in the football scenes and group events players in the locker room were CUHS student athletes For the sound effect of spiders being crushed Foley artists stepped on mustard packages or potato chips For the sound effect of the spiders crawling through the heating ducts long fingernails were used on pieces of tin to create the scurrying sound br br br Release and reception br Arachnophobia was the first film released by Hollywood Pictures Advertisers were uncertain if they should market it as a thriller or a
