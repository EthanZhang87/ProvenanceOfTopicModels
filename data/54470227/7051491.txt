Nelson and Beatrice Straight and was produced by Spielberg and Frank Marshall The film focuses on a suburban family whose home is invaded by malevolent ghosts that abduct their youngest daughter br As Spielberg was contractually unable to direct another film while he made E T the Extra Terrestrial Hooper was selected based on his work on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Funhouse The origin of Poltergeist can be traced to Night Skies which Spielberg conceived as a horror sequel to his film Close Encounters of the Third Kind Hooper was less interested in the sci fi elements and suggested they collaborate on a ghost story Accounts differ as to the level of Spielberg s involvement but it is clear that he was frequently on set during filming and exerted significant creative control For that reason some have said that Spielberg should be considered the film s co director or even main director though both Spielberg and Hooper have disputed this br Released by Metro Goldwyn Mayer through MGM UA Entertainment Co on June Poltergeist was a major critical and commercial success becoming the eighth highest grossing film of In the years since its release the film has been recognized

While the family rushes outside to rescue Robbie Carol Anne is pulled into a portal inside the closet After saving Robbie from the tree which got sucked into a tornado the family frantically search

rest They are attracted to Carol Anne s life force Tangina also detects a dark presence she calls the Beast who is restraining Carol Anne and manipulating her life force in order to prevent the other spirits from crossing over br The entrance to the other dimension is in the children s bedroom closet and exits through the living room ceiling Diane secured by a rope passes through the portal guided by another rope previously threaded through both portals Diane retrieves Carol Anne and they drop through the ceiling to the living room floor covered in ectoplasm As they recover from the ordeal

film Death Hunt when Steven Spielberg decided to invite them to possibly work with him After screening A Guy Named Joe for them and saying he wanted to remake that film which he would in s Always Spielberg also mentioned a ghost story idea he intended to turn into a script Grais called Spielberg the next day saying he and Victor only had interest in the ghost story and after plans with another writer fell through Spielberg brought the two to the job Spielberg wanted Stephen King to co write the screenplay but he was unavailable br Principal photography rolled mostly on Roxbury Street in Simi Valley California Following completion of principal photography in the first week of August Hooper went on to spend ten weeks in the editing room compiling the first cut of the film During much of this time Spielberg was at Industrial Light Magic ILM supervising the visual effects photography br br A clause in the Universal Studios contract prevented Steven Spielberg from directing another film while preparing E T the Extra Terrestrial According to Tobe Hooper the very core concept of the film was an idea he pitched to Spielberg after turning down the offer to direct Night Skies Writer Michael Grais stated that we weren t really working with Spielberg because he was on E T and that Spielberg only had sporadic meetings with the writers in MGM s commissary E T and Poltergeist were released a week apart in June Time and Newsweek referred to it as The Spielberg Summer There were suggestions that Spielberg in addition to being Poltergeist s co producer and co writer had also served as its de facto co director This view was bolstered by various statements Spielberg made about his involvement including a Los Angeles Times quote on May Tobe isn t a take charge sort of guy If a question was asked and an answer wasn t immediately forthcoming I d jump in and say what we could do Tobe would nod agreement and that became the process of collaboration br That same article noted that the Directors Guild of America had opened an investigation into the question of whether or not Hooper s official credit was being denigrated by statements Spielberg has made apparently claiming authorship The investigation ended in an arbitrator s ruling that MGM UA Entertainment Co must pay to director Tobe Hooper because the studio gave producer Steven Spielberg a bigger credit than Hooper got in its trailers although also noting that broader issues of dispute exist between producer writer Spielberg and the director damages of were originally sought by the DGA Co producer Frank Marshall told the LA Times that the creative force of the movie was Steven Tobe was the director and was on the set every day But Steven did the design for every storyboard and he was on the set every day except for three days when he was in Hawaii with Lucas However Hooper stated that he did fully half of the storyboards br The week of the film s release The Hollywood Reporter printed an open letter from Spielberg to Hooper br br Regrettably some of the press has misunderstood the rather unique creative relationship which you and I shared throughout the making of Poltergeist br I enjoyed your openness in allowing me as a writer and a producer a wide berth for creative involvement just as I know you were happy with the freedom you had to direct Poltergeist so wonderfully br br Through the screenplay you accepted a vision of this very intense movie from the start and as the director you delivered the goods You performed responsibly and professionally throughout and I wish you great success on your next project br In a Ain t It Cool News interview Zelda Rubinstein discussed her recollections of the shooting process She said Steven directed all six days she was on set Tobe set up the shots and Steven made the adjustments She also alleged that Hooper allowed some unacceptable chemical agents into his work and that during her audition Tobe was only partially there Comments from actor James Karen concerning a th anniversary Q A event which both attended categorized Rubinstein s remarks as unfair to Hooper She laid into Tobe and I don t know why Tobe was kind to her br In a Rue Morgue article commemorating Poltergeist s th anniversary interviews were conducted with several cast and crew members In response to the magazine s query about the authorship issue cast members unanimously sided with Hooper James Karen said Tobe had a hard time on that film It s tough when a producer is on set every day and there s always been a lot of talk about that I considered Tobe my director That s my stand on all those rumours Martin Casella stated So much of Poltergeist looks and feels like a Spielberg movie but my recollection is that Tobe was mostly directing Oliver Robins The guy who sets up the shots blocks the actors and works with the crew to create a vision is the director In those terms Tobe was the director He s the one who directed me anyway Make up and effects artist Craig Reardon said Spielberg often had the final say The original version of the cancerous steak for instance was created by Reardon per Hooper s specifications but vetoed by Spielberg Although the first steak did not represent a killing amount of work it had consumed enough time and effort none of which I could afford to waste that I determined in the future to make certain whatever I prepped would be approved in advance by Spielberg as well as Hooper br Hooper was asked about the controversy in a interview with online journal Film Talk and said the rumors originated from a Los Angeles Times article which reported on Spielberg shooting footage of little race cars in front of the house while Hooper was busy elsewhere shooting another scene From there it became its own legend That is how I remember it I was making the movie and later on I heard this stuff after it was finished I really can t set the record much straighter than that br According to the Blumhouse Productions website first assistant cameraman John R Leonetti reported that Spielberg directed the film more so than Hooper stating Hooper was so nice and just happy to be there He creatively had input Steven developed the movie and it was his to direct except there was anticipation of a director s strike so he was the producer but really he directed it in case there was going to be a strike and Tobe was cool with that It wasn t anything against Tobe Every once in a while he would actually leave the set and let Tobe do a few things just because But really Steven directed it br Following Hooper s passing on August director Mick Garris a publicist on the film who made several on set visits came to Hooper s defense on the Post Mortem podcast br br Tobe was always calling action and cut Tobe had been deeply involved in all of the pre production and everything But Steven is a guy who will come in and call the shots And so you re on your first studio film hired by Steven Spielberg who is enthusiastically involved in this movie Are you gonna say Stop that let me do this Which Tobe did br Tobe was a terrific filmmaker I don t think it s that Steven was controlling I think it was Steven was enthusiastic And nobody was there to protect Tobe But all of the pre production was done by Tobe Tobe was there throughout Tobe s vision is very much realized there And Tobe got credit because he deserved credit Including Steven Spielberg said that br br Yes Steven Spielberg was very much involved It s a Tobe Hooper film br br The special effects for Poltergeist were produced by Industrial Light and Magic and overseen by Richard Edlund The film won the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects and earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects which it lost to E T the Extra Terrestrial br The scene of Diane JoBeth Williams climbing up the walls was done using a static camera in a rotating set A similar effect was used in Royal Wedding to make it look like Fred Astaire was dancing on the ceiling br Spielberg recalled that the most complicated lighting effects were used in Carol Anne s closet There were so many lighting effects strobes and Las Vegas spots and fish tanks of water to give different kind of diffusion to the beams coming out and four large wind machines We wanted the light to live br The dolly zoom is used in the scene of Diane running down the hallway to Carol Anne s room This is done by pulling the camera back while zooming the lens forward In Poltergeist it creates the illusion of expanding space br br The music for Poltergeist was written by Jerry Goldsmith who recalled br br Steven Spielberg called me about five months before Poltergeist went into production and wanted to know if I would be interested in doing it He d long been an admirer of mine and we had met several times I said I d be very interested so he sent me a script and I loved it I was very excited about being involved with anything with Spielberg anyway With Spielberg probably more than any other director there s a tremendous amount of discussion He s very articulate about music and one can discuss for hours about approaches Anything I did was not on my own volition it was a joint effort in that we both agreed what we were trying to do with the music for the picture We wanted a childlike theme for the little girl Spielberg felt that much of the action in the closet should have a quasi religious atmosphere to it There was something definitely non human about it yet it was not evil all the way It was discussing specifics like that which resulted in our approach Tobe Hooper was not involved at all with post production That was all strictly with Steven and I worked very closely with him br Goldsmith wrote several themes for the score including the lullaby Carol Anne s Theme to represent blissful suburban life and the young female protagonist a semi religious melody for the souls caught between worlds and several dissonant atonal blasts for moments of terror The score went on to garner Goldsmith an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score though he lost to John Williams for E T the Extra Terrestrial br Goldsmith s score was first released in on LP through MGM Records in a minute version Rhino Movie Music later released a minute cut on CD in A two disc soundtrack album later followed on December by Film Score Monthly featuring additional source and alternate material The release also included previously unreleased tracks from Goldsmith s score to The Prize br There is an alternate version of Carol Anne s theme which has lyrics That version is unofficially titled Bless this House which is a line from the chorus It was not featured in the film but was part of the original album br br A clip of Spencer Tracy in A Guy Named Joe can be seen on the TV in the Freelings bedroom This is one of Spielberg s favorite childhood films which he would remake as Always Joe is also a film about the afterlife br Posters for Star Wars and Alien can be seen in the room shared by Robbie and Carol Anne br The story of Poltergeist has similarities to The Twilight Zone episode Little Girl Lost about a girl who finds a portal to another dimension in her bedroom the girl s family including the dog can hear her but can t see her The similarity was noted by the episode s author Richard Matheson They sort of used that idea and made their own concept of it Matheson said he had a positive relationship with Spielberg adding God knows the man has talent br A sign at the Holiday Inn reads Welcome Doctor Fantasy and Friends This is an inside joke producer Frank Marshall is an amateur magician and his stage name is Dr Fantasy After a production wraps Marshall performs magic for the crew br br Poltergeist initially received an R rating from the MPAA Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper disagreed with the R rating and succeeded in changing it to PG on appeal br br The film was reissued on October to take advantage of the Halloween weekend It was shown in theaters for one night only on October to promote the new restored and remastered th anniversary DVD released five days later This event also included the documentary They Are Here The Real World of Poltergeists which was created for the new DVD br The Poltergeist franchise is believed by some to be cursed due to the premature deaths of several people associated with the film including Heather O Rourke and Dominique Dunne a notion that was the focus of an E True Hollywood Story br br Poltergeist was released by MGM UA Home Video on VHS Betamax CED

film focuses mainly on the Freeling family much of the book leans toward the relationship between Tangina and Dr Lesh The novel also expands upon many scenes from the film such as the nighttime manifestation of outer dimensional entities of fire and shadows in the Freelings living room and an extended version of the kitchen scene in which Marty watches a steak crawl across a countertop In

Smartly filmed tightly scripted and most importantly consistently frightening Poltergeist is a modern horror classic On Metacritic it has a score of based on reviews from critics indicating generally favorable reviews Roger Ebert gave Poltergeist three stars out of four and called it an effective thriller not so much because of the special effects as because Hooper and Spielberg have tried to see the movie s strange events through the eyes of the family members instead of just standing back and letting the special effects overwhelm the cast along with the audience Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it a marvelously spooky ghost story with extraordinary technical effects that were often eerie and beautiful but also occasionally vividly gruesome Andrew Sarris in The Village Voice wrote that when Carol Anne is lost the parents and the two older children come together in blood kin empathy to form a larger than life family that will reach down to the gates of hell to save its loved ones In the Los Angeles Herald Examiner Peter Rainer wrote br br Buried within the plot of Poltergeist is a basic splendid fairy tale scheme the story of a little girl who puts her parents through the most outrageous tribulation to prove their love for her Underlying most fairy tales is a common theme the comforts of family Virtually all fairy tales begin with a disrupting of the family order and their conclusion is usually a return to order br David Thomson in his entry on Spielberg in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film calls Poltergeist wondrous br Not all reviews were as positive Gene Siskel gave the film one and a half stars out of four writing that Poltergeist is very good at getting the details of suburban life right in other words it sets its stage beautifully but when it comes time for the terror to begin the whole thing is very very silly Gary Arnold of The Washington Post observed that the film looks and feels decidedly patchy as if it had been assembled by different hands frequently working at cross purposes Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times wrote In terms of simple flat out roof rattling fright Poltergeist gives full value In terms of story however simple is indeed the word and dumb might be a better one And when so many effects are lavished on a story this frail you have a lopsided film br br The film continues to receive recognition
