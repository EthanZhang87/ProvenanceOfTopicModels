timeslot and the most viewed episode of Comedy Night Done Right The episode got mostly positive reviews from critics Dan Phillips of IGN gave the episode an saying it was Great and that The episode isn t the funniest of the season but it is fun to see the show gear up for its next extended story arc Whether or not the writers are really implying that we re all a little like Michael it s clear they re once again casting him as the goofy hero one who will help resist these new stuffy bosses in his uniquely funny ways And at the very least there s great potential in having Bates and Steve Carell square off for a run of episodes Nathan Rabin of The A V Club gave it a A saying that Wrestling with terrifying new financial realities has helped keep the show relevant and lively well into its sixth season I m excited about this current arc and look forward to more appearances from Kathy Bates who did an awful lot with very little screen time as the faux folksy semi terrifying head of
