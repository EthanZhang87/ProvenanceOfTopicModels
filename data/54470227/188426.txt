id: 188426
Survivalism is a social movement of individuals or groups called survivalists doomsday preppers or preppers who proactively prepare for emergencies such as natural disasters and other disasters causing disruption to social order that is civil disorder caused by political or economic crises Preparations may anticipate short term scenarios or long term on scales ranging from personal adversity to local disruption of services to international or global catastrophe There is no bright line dividing general emergency preparedness from prepping in the form of survivalism these concepts are a spectrum but a qualitative distinction is often recognized whereby preppers survivalists prepare especially extensively because they have higher estimations of the risk of catastrophes happening Nonetheless prepping can be as limited as preparing for a personal emergency such as losing one s job storm damage to one s home or getting lost in wooded terrain or it can be as extensive as a personal identity or collective identity with a devoted lifestyle br Survivalism emphasises self reliance stockpiling supplies and gaining survival knowledge and skills The stockpiling of supplies is itself a wide spectrum from survival kits ready bags bug out bags to entire bunkers in extreme cases br Survivalists often acquire first aid and emergency medical paramedic field medicine training self defense training martial arts ad hoc weaponry firearm safety and improvisation self sufficiency training and they often build structures survival retreats underground shelters etc or modify fortify existing structures etc that may help them survive a catastrophic failure of society br Use of the term survivalist dates from the early s br br The origins of the modern survivalist movement in the United Kingdom and the United States include government policies threats of nuclear warfare religious beliefs and writers who warned of social or economic collapse in both non fiction and apocalyptic and post apocalyptic fiction br The Cold War era civil defense programs promoted public atomic bomb shelters personal fallout shelters and training for children such as the Duck and Cover films The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints LDS Church has long directed its members to store a year s worth of food for themselves and their families in preparation for such possibilities and the current teaching advises beginning with at least a three month supply br The Great Depression that followed the Wall Street Crash of is cited by survivalists as an example of the need to be prepared br br The increased inflation rate in the s the US monetary devaluation the continued concern over a possible nuclear exchange between the US and the Soviet Union and perceived increasing vulnerability of urban centers to supply shortages and other systems failures caused a number of primarily conservative and libertarian thinkers to promote individual preparations Harry Browne began offering seminars on how to survive a monetary collapse in with Don Stephens an architect providing input on how to build and equip a remote survival retreat He gave a copy of his original Retreater s Bibliography to each seminar participant br Articles on the subject appeared in small distribution libertarian publications such as The Innovator and Atlantis Quarterly It was during this period that Robert D Kephart began publishing Inflation Survival Letter later renamed Personal Finance For several years the newsletter included a continuing section on personal preparedness written by Stephens It promoted expensive seminars around the US on similar cautionary topics Stephens participated along with James McKeever and other defensive investing hard money advocates br br In the next decade Howard Ruff warned about socio economic collapse in his book Famine and Survival in America Ruff s book was published during a period of rampant inflation in the wake of the oil crisis Most of the elements of survivalism can be found there including advice on food storage The book championed the claim that precious metals such as gold and silver have an intrinsic worth that makes them more usable in the event of a socioeconomic collapse than fiat currency Ruff later published milder variations of the same themes such as How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years a best seller in br Firearms instructor and survivalist Colonel Jeff Cooper wrote on hardening retreats against small arms fire In an article titled Notes on Tactical Residential Architecture in Issue of P S Letter April Cooper suggested using the Vauban Principle whereby projecting bastion corners would prevent miscreants from being able to approach a retreat s exterior walls in any blind spots Depending on the size of the group needing shelter design elements of traditional European castle architecture and Chinese Fujian Tulou and Mexican walled courtyard houses have been suggested for survival retreats br br Bruce D Clayton and Joel Skousen have both written extensively on integrating fallout shelters into retreat homes but they put less emphasis on ballistic protection and exterior perimeter security than Cooper and Rawles br Other newsletters and books followed in the wake of Ruff s first publication In Kurt Saxon began publishing a monthly tabloid size newsletter called The Survivor which combined Saxon s editorials with reprints of th century and early th century writings on various pioneer skills and old technologies Kurt Saxon used the term survivalist to describe the movement and he claims to have coined the term br In the previous decade preparedness consultant survival bookseller and California based author Don Stephens popularized the term retreater to describe those in the movement referring to preparations to leave cities for remote havens or survival retreats should society break down In before moving to the Inland Northwest he and his wife authored and published The Survivor s Primer Up dated Retreater s Bibliography br For a time in the s the terms survivalist and retreater were used interchangeably While the term retreater eventually fell into disuse many who subscribed to it saw retreating as the more rational approach to conflict avoidance and remote invisibility Survivalism on the other hand tended to take on a more media sensationalized combative shoot it out with the looters image br One newsletter deemed by some to be one of the most important on survivalism and survivalist retreats in the s was the Personal Survival P S Letter circa Published by Mel Tappan who also authored the books Survival Guns and Tappan on Survival The newsletter included columns from Tappan himself and notable survivalists such as Jeff Cooper Al J Venter Bruce D Clayton Nancy Mack Tappan J B Wood author of several gunsmithing books Karl Hess Janet Groene travel author Dean Ing Reginald Bretnor and C G Cobb author of Bad Times Primer The majority of the newsletter revolved around selecting constructing and logistically equipping survival retreats Following Tappan s death in Karl Hess took over publishing the newsletter eventually renaming it Survival Tomorrow br In John Pugsley published the book The Alpha Strategy It was on The New York Times Best Seller list for nine weeks in After years in circulation The Alpha Strategy remains popular with survivalists and is considered a standard reference on stocking food and household supplies as a hedge against inflation and future shortages br In addition to hardcopy newsletters in the s survivalists established their first online presence with BBS and Usenet forums dedicated to survivalism and survival retreats br br Further interest in the survivalist movement peaked in the early s with Howard Ruff s book How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years and the publication in of Life After Doomsday by Bruce D Clayton Clayton s book coinciding with a renewed arms race between the United States and Soviet Union marked a shift in emphasis in preparations made by survivalists away from economic collapse famine and energy shortages which were concerns in the s to nuclear war In the early s science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle was an editor and columnist for Survive a survivalist magazine and was influential in the survivalist movement Ragnar Benson s book Live Off The Land In The City And Country suggested rural survival retreats as both a preparedness measure and conscious lifestyle change br br Interest in the movement picked up during the Clinton administration due in part to the debate surrounding the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and the ban s subsequent passage in The interest peaked again in triggered by fears of the Y K computer bug Before extensive efforts were made to rewrite computer programming code to mitigate the effects some writers such as Gary North Ed Yourdon James Howard Kunstler and investments advisor Ed Yardeni anticipated widespread power outages food and gasoline shortages and other emergencies North and others raised the alarm because they thought Y K code fixes were not being made quickly enough While a range of authors responded to this wave of concern two of the most survival focused texts to emerge were Boston on Y K by Kenneth W Royce and Mike Oehler s The Hippy Survival Guide to Y K Oehler is an underground living advocate who also authored The and Up Underground House Book which has long been popular in survivalist circles br br Another wave of survivalism began after the September attacks and subsequent bombings in Bali Madrid and London This resurgence of interest in survivalism appears to be as strong as the s era focus on the topic The fear of war avian influenza energy shortages environmental disasters and global climate change coupled with economic uncertainty and the apparent vulnerability of humanity after the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and Hurricane Katrina have increased interest in survivalism topics br Many books were published in the wake of the Great Recession from and later offering survival advice for various potential disasters ranging from an energy shortage and crash to nuclear or biological terrorism In addition to the s era books blogs and Internet forums are popular ways of disseminating survivalism information Online survival websites and blogs discuss survival vehicles survival retreats emerging threats and list survivalist groups br In both his book Rawles on Retreats and Relocation and in his survivalist novel Patriots A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse James Wesley Rawles describes in great detail retreat groups upgrading brick or other masonry houses to that of a security compound with steel reinforced window shutters and doors excavating anti vehicular ditches installing gate locks constructing concertina wire obstacles and fougasses and setting up listening post observation posts LP OPs Rawles is a proponent of including a mantrap foyer at survival retreats an architectural element that he calls a crushroom br Economic troubles emerging from the credit collapse triggered by the US subprime mortgage lending crisis and global grain shortages prompted a wider cross section of the populace to prepare br The advent of H N Swine Flu in piqued interest in survivalism significantly boosting sales of preparedness books and making survivalism more mainstream br br These developments led Gerald Celente founder of the Trends Research Institute to identify a trend that he calls neo survivalism He explained this phenomenon in a radio interview with Jim Puplava on December When you go back to the last depressing days when we were in a survival mode the last one the Y K of course before the s what had happened was you only saw this one element of survivalist you know the caricature the guy with the AK heading to the hills with enough ammunition and pork and beans to ride out the storm This is a very different one from that you re seeing average people taking smart moves and moving in intelligent directions to prepare for the worst So survivalism in every way possible Growing your own self sustaining doing as much as you can to make it as best as you can on your own and it can happen in urban area sub urban area or the ex urbans And it also means becoming more and more tightly committed to your neighbors your neighborhood working together and understanding that we re all in this together and that when we help each other out that s going to be the best way forward This last aspect is highlighted in The Trends Research Journal Communal spirit intelligently deployed is the core value of Neo Survivalism br br Television shows such as the National Geographic Channel s Doomsday Preppers emerged to capitalize on what Los Angeles Times entertainment contributor Mary McNamara dubbed today s zeitgeist of fear of a world changing event br After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting the prepper community worried they would face public scrutiny after it was revealed the perpetrator s mother was a survivalist Earlier that year a double homicide was committed by survivalist Peter Keller who admitted to killing his wife and daughter in a video diary He killed himself while evading capture in a bunker he built in Rattlesnake Ridge in King County Washington Both were cited by The Christian Science Monitor as examples of survivalism being tied to violence br br During the ongoing COVID pandemic which was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization in early and the Russian invasion of Ukraine present survivalism has received renewed interest even by those who are not traditionally considered preppers br br Survivalism is approached by its adherents in different ways depending on their circumstances mindsets and particular concerns for the future The following are characterizations although most if not all survivalists fit into more than one category br br Safety preparedness oriented br While some survivalists believe in long term viability of Western civilization they learn principles and techniques needed for surviving life threatening situations that can occur at any time and place They prepare for such calamities that could result in physical harm or requiring immediate attention or defense from threats These disasters could be biotic or abiotic Survivalists combat disasters by attempting to prevent and mitigate damage caused by these factors br br Wilderness survival emphasis br br This group stresses being able to stay alive for indefinite periods in life threatening wilderness scenarios including plane crashes shipwrecks and being lost in the woods Concerns are thirst hunger climate terrain health stress and fear The rule of is often emphasized as common practice for wilderness survival The rule states that a human can survive br minutes without air br hours without shelter br days without water br weeks without food br br Self defense driven br This group focuses on surviving brief encounters of violent activity including personal protection and its legal ramifications danger awareness John Boyd s cycle also known as the OODA loop observe orient decide and act Combatives martial arts unarmed combat Melee weapons self defense tactics and tools both lethal and non lethal These survivalist tactics are often firearm oriented in order to ensure a method of defense against attackers or home invasion br br Natural disaster brief br This group consists of people who live in tornado hurricane flood wildfire earthquake or heavy snowfall prone areas and want to be prepared for possible emergencies They invest in material for fortifying structures and tools for rebuilding and constructing temporary shelters While assuming the long term continuity of society some may have invested in a custom built shelter food water medicine and enough supplies to get by until contact with the rest of the world resumes following a natural emergency br br Natural disaster prolonged br This group is concerned with weather cycles of years which have happened historically and can cause crop failures They might stock several tons of food per family member and have a heavy duty greenhouse with canned non hybrid seeds br br Natural disaster indefinite multi generational br br This group considers an end to society as it exists today under possible scenarios including global warming global cooling environmental degradation warming or cooling of gulf stream waters or a period of severely cold winters caused by a supervolcano an asteroid strike or nuclear warfare br br Bio chem scenario br This group is concerned with the spread of fatal diseases biological agents and nerve gases including COVID swine flu E coli botulism dengue fever Creutzfeldt Jakob disease SARS rabies Hantavirus anthrax plague cholera HIV ebola Marburg virus Lassa virus sarin and VX In response they might own NBC nuclear biological and chemical full face respirators polyethylene coveralls PVC boots nitrile gloves plastic sheeting and duct tape br br Monetary disaster investors br br Monetary disaster investors believe the Federal Reserve system is fundamentally flawed Newsletters suggest hard assets of gold and silver bullion coins and other precious metal oriented investments such as mining shares Survivalists prepare for paper money to become worthless through hyperinflation As of late this is a popular scenario Many will stockpile bullion in preparation for a market crash that would destroy the value of global currencies br br Biblical eschatologist br These individuals study End Times prophecy and believe that one of various scenarios might occur in their lifetime While some Christians and even people of other religions believe that the Rapture will follow a period of Tribulation others believe that the Rapture is imminent and will precede the Tribulation Pre Trib Rapture There is a wide range of beliefs and attitudes in this group They run the gamut from pacifist to armed camp and from having no food stockpiles leaving their sustenance up to God s providence to storing decades worth of food Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints are counseled to store up to two years worth of food and supplies to aid in the event of a natural disaster or long term economic hardship such as unemployment br br Peak oil doomers br This group believes that peak oil is a near term threat to Western civilization and take appropriate measures usually involving relocation to an agriculturally self sufficient survival retreat br br Legal continuity oriented br This group has a primary concern with maintaining some form of legal system and social cohesion after a breakdown in the technical infrastructure of society They are interested in works like The Postman by David Brin Lewis Dartnell s The Knowledge How to Rebuild Our World from Scratch or Marcus B Hatfield s The American Common Law The Customary Law of the American Nation br br Common preparations include the creation of a clandestine or defensible retreat haven or bug out location BOL in addition to the stockpiling of non perishable food water i e using water canisters water purification equipment clothing seed firewood defensive or hunting weapons ammunition agricultural equipment and medical supplies Some survivalists do not make such extensive preparations and simply incorporate a Be Prepared outlook into their everyday life br A bag of gear often referred to as a bug out bag BOB or get out of dodge G O O D kit can be created which contains basic necessities and useful items It can be of any size weighing as much as the user is able to carry br br Survivalists concerns and preparations have changed over the years During the s fears were economic collapse hyperinflation and famine Preparations included food storage and survival retreats in the country which could be farmed Some survivalists stockpiled precious metals and barterable goods such as common caliber ammunition because they assumed that paper currency would become worthless During the early s nuclear war became a common fear and some survivalists constructed fallout shelters br In many people purchased electric generators water purifiers and several months or even years worth of food in anticipation of widespread power outages because of the Y K computer bug Between and many people purchased those same items in anticipation of widespread chaos following the election and the events leading up to the COVID pandemic br Instead of moving or making such preparations at home many people also make plans to remain in their current locations until an actual breakdown occurs when they will in survivalist parlance bug out or get out of Dodge to a safer location br br Other survivalists have more specialized concerns often related to an adherence to apocalyptic religious beliefs br Some evangelical Christians hold to an interpretation of Bible prophecy known as the post tribulation rapture in which the world will have to go through a seven year period of war and global dictatorship known as the Great Tribulation Jim McKeever helped popularize survival preparations among this branch of evangelical Christians with his book Christians Will Go Through the Tribulation and How To Prepare For It br Similarly some Catholics are preppers based on Marian apparitions which speak of a great chastisement of humanity by God particularly those associated with Our Lady of Fatima and Our Lady of Akita which states fire will fall from the sky and will wipe out a great part of humanity br br People who are not part of survivalist groups or apolitically oriented religious groups also make preparations for emergencies This can include depending on the location preparing for earthquakes floods power outages blizzards avalanches wildfires terrorist attacks nuclear power plant accidents hazardous material spills tornadoes and hurricanes These preparations can be as simple as following Red Cross and U S Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA recommendations by keeping a first aid kit shovel and extra clothes in the car or by maintaining a small kit of emergency supplies containing emergency food water a space blanket and other essentials br Mainstream economist and financial adviser Barton Biggs is a proponent of preparedness In his book Wealth War and Wisdom Biggs has a gloomy outlook for the economic future and suggests that investors take survivalist measures In the book Biggs recommends that his readers should assume the possibility of a breakdown of the civilized infrastructure He goes so far as to recommend setting up survival retreats Your safe haven must be self sufficient and capable of growing some kind of food Mr Biggs writes It should be well stocked with seed fertilizer canned food medicine clothes etc Think Swiss Family Robinson Even in America and Europe there could be moments of riot and rebellion when law and order temporarily completely breaks down br For global catastrophic risks the costs of food storage become impractical for most of the population and for some such catastrophes conventional agriculture would not function due to the loss of a large fraction of sunlight e g during nuclear winter or a supervolcano In such situations alternative food is necessary which is converting natural gas and wood fiber to human edible food br br Survivalists maintain their group identity and subculture by using specialized terminology slang etc not generally understood outside their circles They often use government military paramilitary acronyms such as OPSEC and SOP and terminology common among adherents to gun culture or the peak oil scenario They also use terms that are unique to their own survivalist groups common acronyms include br br S s Shape Skyline Silhouette Speed Shine Sound Shade br essentials br Ad hoc A usually improvised temporary stand in br Alert state Level of danger threat etc br Alpha strategy The practice of storing extra consumable items as a hedge against inflation

containing everything needed to walk out into the woods and never return to society It is an often heavy pack loaded with the gear needed to accomplish any wilderness task from building shelter to gaining food designed to allow someone to survive indefinitely in the woods This requires skills and proper selection of equipment as one can only carry so much For example instead of carrying food one carries seeds steel traps a longbow reel spinners and other fishing gear Often INCH bag gear is designed to be more sustainable and durable and include tools to fix gear Common examples of this include files and Arkansas stones or whetstones to sharpen knives machetes axes and other blades This is due to the idea that when using an INCH bag materials and resupply will be rare if not nonexistent and as such tools need to be durable and self sustainable br MYOG Make Your Own Gear An advanced specialist form of Improvising Manufacturing clothing kit equipment etc from scratch or

preparedness The premise of the Zombie Squad is that if you are prepared for a scenario where the walking corpses of your family and neighbors are trying to eat you alive you will be prepared for almost anything Though there are some who are seriously preparing for a zombie attack br br Despite a lull following the end of the Cold War survivalism has gained greater attention in recent years resulting in increased popularity of the survivalist lifestyle and increased scrutiny A National Geographic show interviewing survivalists Doomsday Preppers was a ratings bonanza and the network s most watched series yet Neil Genzlinger in The New York Times declared it an absurd excess on display and at what an easy target the prepper worldview is for ridicule noting how offensively anti life these shows are full of contempt for humankind Nevertheless this show occupies a key position in the discourse on preppers br Gerald Celente founder of the Trends Research Institute noted how many modern survivalists deviate from the classic archetype terming this new style neo survivalism you know the caricature the guy with the AK heading to the hills with enough ammunition and pork and beans to ride out the storm This neo survivalist is a very different one from that br Nick Rushing author of How to Survive on a Deserted Island Better than your Friends made guest appearances on Doomsday Preppers as the foremost expert on island survival He taught episode guest Melia that running a sub six minute mile is essential to apple foraging br br In popular culture survivalism has been associated with activities of the self proclaimed militias in the United States and elsewhere Some survivalists do take active defensive preparations that have militaresque roots and that involve small arms and this aspect is sometimes emphasized by the mass media Kurt Saxon is one proponent of this approach to armed survivalism br The potential for social collapse is often cited as motivation for being well armed Thus some non militaristic survivalists have developed an unintended quasi militaristic image br The U S Department of Homeland Security DHS in their If You See Something Say Something campaign says that the public should report only suspicious behavior and situations rather than beliefs thoughts ideas expressions associations or speech However it is alleged that a DHS list of the characteristics of potential domestic terrorists used in law enforcement training includes Survivalist literature fictional books such as Patriots and One Second After are mentioned by name Self sufficiency stockpiling food ammo hand tools medical supplies and Fear of economic collapse buying gold and barter items br The Missouri Information Analysis Center MIAC issued on February a report intended for law enforcement personnel only entitled The Modern Militia Movement which described common symbols and media including political bumper stickers associated with militia members and domestic terrorists The report appeared March on WikiLeaks and a controversy ensued It was claimed that the report was derived purely from publicly available trend data on militias However because the report included political profiling on March an apology letter was issued explaining that the report would be edited to remove the inclusion of certain components br br Individual survivalist preparedness and survivalist groups and forums both formal and informal are popular worldwide most visibly in Australia Austria WSGV Belgium Canada br Spain France Germany often organized under the guise of adventuresport clubs Italy the Netherlands Sweden Switzerland the United Kingdom South Africa and the United States br br Adherents of the back to the land movement inspired by Helen and Scott Nearing sporadically popular in the United States in the s and s exemplified by The Mother Earth News magazine share many of the same interests in self sufficiency and preparedness Back to the landers differ from most survivalists in that they have a greater interest in ecology and counterculture Despite these differences The Mother Earth News was widely read by survivalists and back to the landers during that magazine s early years and there was some overlap between the two movements br Anarcho primitivists often shortened to Anprim An Prim or AnPrim share many characteristics with survivalists most notably predictions of a pending ecological disaster one of the most famous An Prims being Theodore Kaczynski Writers such as Derrick Jensen argue that industrial civilization is not sustainable and will therefore inevitably bring about its own collapse Non anarchist writers such as Daniel Quinn Joseph Tainter and Richard Manning also hold this view Some members of the Men Going Their Own Way subculture also promote off grid living and believe that modern society is no longer liveable br br Survivalism and survivalist themes have been fictionalized in print film and electronic media br The film The Survivors starring Walter Matthau Robin Williams and Jerry Reed used survivalism as part of its plot Michael Gross and Reba McEntire played a survivalist married couple in the film Tremors and its sequels Both of these films were comedies The film Distant Thunder starring John Lithgow concerned Vietnam War veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder
