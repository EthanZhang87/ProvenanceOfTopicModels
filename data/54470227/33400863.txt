id: 33400863
Diegetic music also called source music is music that is part of the fictional world portrayed in a piece of narrative media such as a film show play or video game and is thus knowingly performed and or heard by the characters This is in contrast to non diegetic music which refers to incidental music or a score that is heard by the viewer but not the characters or in musical theater when characters are singing in a manner that they would not do in a realistic setting br br br Etymology br The term refers to diegesis a style of storytelling In her work Unheard Melodies Claudia Gorbman was influential in establishing the terms diegetic and non diegetic derived from narrative theory for use in academic film music studies From there its usage spread to other disciplines br br br Film br Source music was sometimes used as scores from the earliest days of Hollywood talkies in some cases such as The Public Enemy using it to the exclusion of any underscoring or in Touch of Evil where there is proportionately more source compared to underscore br In Britain from onwards there was a trend for including specially composed piano concertos dubbed Denham Concertos by Steve Race after the film studios into films as part of the plot An early example was Jack Beaver s Portrait of Isla from the score for the Edgar Wallace film The Case of the Frightened Lady Here the piano is actually played by lead actor Marius Goring an accomplished pianist as Lord Lebanon A year later Richard Addinsell s much more famous Warsaw Concerto appeared in the film Dangerous Moonlight in which a piano virtuoso plays a concerts and recalls composing the concerto while the Germans bomb London br Songs are commonly used in various film sequences to serve different purposes They can be used to link scenes in the story where a character progresses through various stages toward a final goal If it is synchronized with the action as in the Good Morning dance sequence from Singin in the Rain it is said to be Mickey Mousing br br br Source and background music br If the characters in the film can or could hear the music the audience hears then that music is called diegetic It is also called source music by professionals in the industry It is said to be within the narrative sphere of the film For instance if a character in the film is playing a piano or turns on a CD player the resulting sound is diegetic The cantina band sequence in the original Star Wars is an example of diegetic music in film with the band playing instruments and swaying to the beat as patrons are heard reacting to the second piece the band plays In road movies where the characters are traveling by car we often hear the music that the characters are depicted as listening to on the car stereo br By contrast the background music that cannot be heard by the characters in the movie is termed non diegetic or extradiegetic An example of this is in Rocky where Bill Conti s Gonna Fly Now plays non diegetically as Rocky makes his way through his training regimen finishing on the top steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art with his hands raised in the air br br br Variations br A combination of these concepts in film sound and music is known in the industry as source scoring a blending of diegetic source music such as a character singing or playing an instrument with non diegetic dramatic scoring br There are other varying dimensions of diegesis in film sound for example metadiegetic sound which are sounds imagined by a character within the film such as memories hallucinatory sounds and distorted perspectives br Another notable condition of diegesis is cross over diegesis which is explored in the book Primeval Cinema An Audiovisual Philosophy by Danny Hahn in which he describes it as blending transforming a sound or piece of music from one spectrum of diegesis to another from diegetic to non diegetic space The sci film BR B To Be or Naught to Be is an example of cross over diegetic music in film with Schubert s Ave Maria playing over separate shot sequences as non diegetic music but then later showing it to come from a gramophone in a hospital waiting room A similar cross over occurs in the closing scene of the HBO docudrama Conspiracy in which a Schubert concerto is placed on a gramophone and commented on by the characters in the room then transforms into the incidental music for the closing credits Music can also becomes diegetic with the assistance of audio engineering techniques having its reverberation undergo change to match the room s characteristics and indicate a spatial location from the surround speakers Even though Ave Maria reappears extensively as diegetic music its inclusion was treated as non diegetic by the film makers the song being a bespoke recording by soprano Imogen Coward to match the film s tone and the film being edited to her recording The recording itself was timed to include a layer of narrative commentary for audiences familiar with the German lyrics br This distinction may also be made explicit for comic effect a form of breaking the fourth wall For example the first appearance of Kermit the Frog in The Muppets is accompanied by what initially appears to be a stock heavenly choir sound effect which is then revealed to be coming from an actual church choir singing on a passing bus The film Birdman does this several times throughout the movie where all the music turns out to be diegetic produced by street performers br br br Opera br Examples of diegetic music in opera go right back to its beginnings for instance the central wedding serenade in Monteverdi s L Orfeo Stories about musicians are common in opera and almost all operas include some level of internal performance Wagner used the singing contest as a plot mechanism in Tannh user and Die Meistersinger and Bizet s Carmen makes full use of the street music and street activity of Seville Ariadne auf Naxos by Richard Strauss is an example of opera within an opera Benjamin Britten s Peter Grimes contains a wide variety of diegetic music br br br Musical theatre br In musical theatre as in film the term diegesis refers to the context of a musical number in a work s theatrical narrative In typical operas or operettas musical numbers are non diegetic characters are not singing in a manner that they would do in a naturalistic setting in a sense they are not aware that they are in a musical In contrast when a song occurs literally in the plot the number is considered diegetic Diegetic numbers are often present in backstage musicals such as Cabaret and Follies br For example in The Sound of Music the song Edelweiss is diegetic since the character Captain von Trapp is performing the piece in front of other fictional characters at a gathering In Do Re Mi the character Maria is using the song to teach the children how to sing so this song is also diegetic In contrast the song How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria is non diegetic since the musical material is external to the narrative it being a conversation that would in a naturalistic setting take place as simple speech br In both the and the film versions of Show Boat as well as in the original stage version the song Bill is diegetic The character Julie LaVerne sings it during a rehearsal in a nightclub A solo piano played onscreen accompanies her and the film s offscreen orchestra presumably not heard by the characters sneaks in for the second verse of the song Julie s other song in the film Can t Help Lovin Dat Man is also diegetic In the film it is supposed to be an old folk song known only to blacks in the film it is merely a song that Julie knows however she and the captain s daughter Magnolia are fully aware that Julie is singing When Julie Queenie and the black chorus sing the second chorus of the song in the version they are presumably unaware of any orchestral accompaniment but in the film when Magnolia sings and dances this same chorus she does so to the accompaniment of two deckhands on the boat playing a banjo and a harmonica Two other songs in the Show Boat are also diegetic Goodbye My Lady Love sung by the comic dancers Ellie and Frank and After the Ball sung by Magnolia Both are interpolated into the film and both are performed in the same nightclub in which Julie sings Bill br The musical The Phantom of the Opera offers an interesting example of ambiguity in distinguishing between diegetic and non diegetic music At the end of Act Christine and Raoul sing All I Ask of You and the Phantom having eavesdropped on them reprises the song shortly after Narratively there is no reason for the characters to be singing and so these numbers would appear to be non diegetic However in Act within the opera Don Juan Triumphant which the Phantom composed not only are Christine and Raoul s words repeated but they are sung to the same tune they used suggesting that the eavesdropping Phantom heard them to be singing rather than speaking their conversation To define All I Ask of You as either diegetic or non diegetic is therefore not straightforward br br br Television br In the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer the episode entitled Once More with Feeling toys with the distinction between diegetic and non diegetic musical numbers In this episode the Buffy characters find themselves compelled to burst into song in the style of a musical The audience is led to assume that this is a musical episode in which the characters are unaware that they are singing It becomes clear that the characters are all too aware of their musical interludes and that determining the supernatural causes of the singing is the focus of the episode s story On the same show the episode entitled The Body was presented without any non diegetic music at all in order to convey the reality of the theme of death within the family that it portrays br br br See also br Diegesis br Incidental music br Background music br
