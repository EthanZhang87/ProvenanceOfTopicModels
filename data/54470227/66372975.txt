he can remove to dig an escape tunnel Finney starts to dig but the house s foundations are sunk too deeply for him to go beneath them br The Grabber brings Finney a meal and leaves the basement door unlocked As Finney is about to sneak out he gets a call from Billy another past victim Billy warns Finney that the Grabber is waiting at the top of the basement stairs to punish him if he tries to leave as part of a cruel game At Billy s suggestion Finney uses a hidden length of cable to climb up to the basement window however his weight pulls out the grate covering the pane leaving him with no way to reach it again br As Gwen confides to Terrence about her dreams of Finney s abduction Wright and Miller question an eccentric man named Max who is staying in the area with his brother and has shown great interest in the Grabber s crimes It is revealed that Finney is being held in Max s basement and that the Grabber is his brother br Finney receives a call from Griffin a third victim who

br br Development br br The Black Phone emerged from filmmakers Scott Derrickson and C Robert Cargill s adaptation of Joe Hill s short story of the same name published in the horror anthology th Century Ghosts Derrickson came across th Century Ghosts shortly after its initial US release The director was eager to conceive a film faithful to The Black Phone which fascinated him in its framing of a conventional serial killer story but struggled to produce ideas of his own devising He shelved the project to focus on his professional relationship with Cargill forged from Sinister and his contractual obligations to Marvel Studios as director of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness Cargill briefly pitched for a replacement director in the interim stopping once Derrickson convinced him to wait until he was available to commit Their collaboration resumed after Derrickson resigned from Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness over disputes about the film s artistic direction br To bolster The Black Phone s story Derrickson used his upbringing in suburban Denver Colorado as a major source of inspiration He gleaned from people in his everyday life to shape the characters their circumstances and the film s depiction of suburbia including a child whose mother was raped murdered and disposed of in a lake wrapped in phone wire The director described the area he grew up in as a working class neighborhood with a lot of violence everybody got whipped by their parents there was fighting on the way to school on the way home from school at school Derrickson raised the idea of a semi autobiographical horror story as he was processing traumatic childhood experiences in therapy He also investigated The Blows and The Devil s Backbone for their depiction of resilience and kinship among children br br br Casting br br Agents scouted hundreds of child actors for The Black Phone s starring roles They ultimately hired Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw as the first significant casting choices from auditions conducted on Zoom as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic McGraw was considered among four actresses and when a prior commitment to Disney s television series Secrets of Sulphur Springs forced her to pull out the producers postponed filming of The Black Phone by several months to accommodate her schedule Casting for Finney was not as immediate of an undertaking It took months for the filmmakers to survey the actors first through talent agencies in New York and Los Angeles then an open call before they were shown Thames s demo reels Even though Thames lacked acting experience The Black Phone being his film debut he reportedly stood apart from others in his ability to emote and take direction Due to the amount of violence and profanity in the script Derrickson carefully broached the subject to Thames McGraw and their parents in preparation for scenes br By early the starring cast featured Jeremy Davies Ethan Hawke and James Ransone the latter two in their second film with Derrickson after Sinister The director and Cargill did not envision one particular actor as The Grabber in their original character treatments but sent Hawke the script because they had a rapport Hawke was disinclined to play villainous parts as he feared being typecast Yet The Black Phone story resonated with the actor and the idea of The Grabber being concealed by a mask further enticed him Hawke s experience on the set of Sinister was another influence shaping his decision He developed his performance by honing expression in his voice and body Derrickson did not have many discussions with Hawke regarding The Grabber s portrayal because he felt showing him the mask would best yield their desired interpretation br br br Filming br br Principal photography began on February in Wilmington North Carolina under the pseudonym Static A private residence used for interior and exterior shots was the shoot s initial location The production base was confined mostly to EUE Screen Gems s local film studio from sets portraying The Grabber s basement and adjacent neighborhoods Estimates to realize the shoot ran between million the budget partially funded by a million transferable tax credit on in state costs from the North Carolina government Elsewhere regionally shooting occurred in New Hanover Brunswick and Columbus counties Filming for The Black Phone ended on March br Brett Jutkiewicz was The Black Phone s director of photography Jutkiewicz had just finished filming Scream when he received the script from his agent Derrickson approached him in mid December to discuss ideas raised from Jutkiewicz s reading of The Black Phone script They also bonded from discussing Jutkiewicz s work in the satirical horror film Ready or Not which had impressed Derrickson After an interviewing period the producers formally contracted Jutkiewicz that January Derrickson s instruction was to implement a look evoking the s period in which the film is set The production used source material such as New York set s movies not so much to glean textural ideas as to establish the appropriate tone for the setting and storytelling This according to Jutkiewicz meant experimenting with color grading techniques to produce a high contrast muted but not desaturated visual palette To achieve this image quality and to reduce the picture s range of hues filmmakers mixed colors using specialized lookup tables LUT The choice of LUTs was contingent on the brightness of sets for example Jutkiewicz employed a darker LUT to preserve the image palette of dimly lit basement scenes br The camera crew shot much of The Black Phone in Super format an established practice of Derrickson s repertoire using Bolex cameras They prepared by testing the utility of footage in Kodak s color negative film stock the Vision T Vision D and Vision D Lighting determined the film stock deployed for the shooting Jutkiewicz said that he at first struggled working in Super format as he had to reacquaint with old filmmaking methods br br br Visual effects br VFX Legion was responsible for The Black Phone s visual effects in their second project with Derrickson Development of the visual effects began in pre production under the supervision of VFX Legion co founders James David Hattin and Nate Smalley Their work for the film comprised shots of matte and digital compositing effects such as green screening set extensions superimposed practical stunt effects camera transitions computer generated imagery CGI and rig removal Maya Nuke Houdini and Redshift were among the software used to handle rendering and animation tasks VFX Legion was also present on set to critique the shoot and rectify problems with the filmmaking br One of the special effect team s most complex assignments was rendering the stunt of a Grabber victim s violent retreat to the spiritual realm VFX Legion supervisor Ken Johnson managed the scene s filming on set VFX Legion then developed a digital model of the actor from a D scan animated with retopologized graphics and textures allowing them to employ ragdoll physics for fluid movement This was a labor intensive process because the filmmakers wanted the movement of the digital model to project a loss of control and the stunt s combined animation to be slow enough to show that the victim was being forced into a void Another challenging sequence saw VFX Legion modify in home tracking shots with CGI which entailed altering the frame rate of footage to maintain a continuously steady speed br br br Masks br br Designing The Grabber s masks became a core goal in part because Blumhouse Productions planned to showcase them in ads for the film While the script detailed a prototype of two worn leather masks painted with a smiling and a frowning devil this concept evolved when Derrickson proposed the addition of a mouthless mask They convey despair joy and nihility in exaggerated form reminiscent of tragic comic masks of ancient Greek theatre Derrickson and Blumhouse producer Ryan Turek solicited five visual effects companies for the mask making including Callosum Studios a Pittsburgh based studio founded by prosthetic makeup artists Jason Baker and Tom Savini Of the illustrations submitted Callosum s most closely resembled the vision of the producers Savini and Baker were engaged to handle the creation of up to masks for gags stunts specific scenes and pandemic mitigation in a process that lasted a month The approval of sketches took about two weeks followed by the construction of pieces in about a day or two The filmmakers drew on diverse material for reference among them ceramic masks circus masks antique dolls William Hickey s Coney Island Barker the horror film Mr Sardonicus and the exaggerated grin of Conrad Veidt s Gwynplaine in the silent film The Man Who Laughs br Derrickson imagined the mouthless mask after Hawke was hired since he wanted the actor s face to be partially displayed in some of The Black Phone He developed the design further by envisioning scenarios that examined The Grabber s motivations his choice of masks in interactions with Finney et cetera The fully realized concept surfaced from Savini s original sketches at which point the filmmakers began contemplating age consistency and the application of each mask They constructed the pieces from moldings of procured life masks of Hawke s face a task complicated by the COVID pandemic Callosum conducted the face casting sessions in Hawke s home office in New York because the actor was not comfortable traveling They then sculpted masks from their Pittsburgh studio before returning to New York for test fittings The finished pieces were created from a fiberglass resin mixture paneled with felt and foam padding As well the filmmakers constructed replicas for stunts out of lightweight rubber and latex br br br Music br br The Black Phone came to composer Mark Korven s attention once his agent and Blumhouse had correspondence Derrickson outlined the film s pastiche musical approach in early conversations calling for a score drawing on modern and vintage synthesizer heavy sounds Korven s objective was to tie together the music and subtext chiefly themes of fear confinement and the perils of the human condition to highlight The Grabber He developed The Grabber s character motifs with abrasive strings accompaniments and friction noise produced from rubbing mallets on rough surfaces The other characters were of minor focus except for lighter more feminine tones for Gwen centric scenes and a strings arrangement that accompanied the film s resolution br br br Release br br The Black Phone premiered at Fantastic Fest on September The

discussed aspect in the media was the scriptwriting They were inclined to compare The Black Phone to Hill s short story based on tone and style with critics saying the film script augmented ideas faithful to the source material Another point of notice was the script s treatment of a traditional serial killer story in the approach and period setting which Chicago Sun Times stated made for one of the better cinematic nightmares in recent years On the other hand the media differed over the handling of ideas often singling out the film s supernatural elements for further scrutiny with one review from Variety claiming its emphasis undermined tension building in the story Others were unanimous in their opinion that The Black Phone s depicted concept fell short of their expectation Plodding characterization and pacing was ascribed to mistakes in the writing although the Los Angeles Times singled out intense basement set conversational scenes with Finney as the film s most compelling moments The harshest reviews accused The Black Phone of being repetitive tasteless and tortuously overwritten br br br Accolades br br br Sequel and related media br br Hill pitched
