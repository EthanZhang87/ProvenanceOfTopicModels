Upstate New York is a geographic region of New York that lies north and northwest of the New York City metropolitan area of downstate New York Upstate includes the middle and upper Hudson Valley the Capital District the Mohawk Valley region Central New York the Southern Tier the Finger Lakes region Western New York and the North Country Major cities across upstate New York from east to west include the state capital of Albany Utica Binghamton Syracuse Rochester and Buffalo br Before the European colonization of the United States upstate New York was populated by several Native American tribes It was home to the Iroquois Confederacy an indigenous confederation of six tribes known as the Six Nations Henry Hudson made the first recorded European exploration of the region in and the Dutch erected Fort Orange present day Albany in which was the first permanent European settlement in New York The region saw many battles during the American Revolutionary War with the Iroquois split between supporters of the loyalists and supporters of the revolutionaries After the war ended the Treaty of Fort Stanwix kicked off a series of treaties and purchases that saw the Iroquois cede the vast majority of their land in upstate New York to the newly formed United States br The opening of the Erie Canal across upstate New York transformed the economy of the region and the state The canal greatly eased the movement of goods from across the upper Midwest and the cities along the Great Lakes through upstate New York and to the port of New York City As a result upstate New York became a hotbed for manufacturing during the Second Industrial Revolution giving birth to such firms as General Electric IBM Kodak and Xerox The rapid industrialization led to a large influx of immigrants seeking jobs at factories across the region Since the mid th century American deindustrialization has contributed to economic and population decline and the region is largely considered part of the Rust Belt br There are a wide variety of land uses in the region including urban suburban forested preserve and rural landscapes Due to its vast areas of rural land upstate also supports a strong agricultural industry and is notable for its dairy maple syrup and fruit production especially apples as well as winemaking Upstate New York includes a number of notable waterways with the Susquehanna Delaware and Hudson Rivers all originating in the region and is bordered on its northern and western edges by the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes As a result the region is a significant source of hydroelectric power going back to the creation of the world s first hydroelectric dam by Nikola Tesla at Niagara Falls and drinking water with multiple reservoirs serving New York City Upstate New York is home to numerous popular tourist and recreational destinations including Niagara Falls the Adirondack and Catskill Mountains the Thousand Islands the National Baseball Hall of Fame and the Finger Lakes br br br Definition br br There is no clear official boundary between upstate New York and downstate New York The most expansive definition of the upstate New York region excludes only New York City and Long Island which are always considered to be part of downstate New York this usage is common among New York City residents and significantly less farther north This definition is used by the Department of Environmental Conservation A cheeky joke among Manhattanites is that anything north of th Street is upstate br Another usage locates the upstate downstate boundary farther north at the point where New York City s suburbs segue into its exurbs as the exurbs do not generally fall within the Census Bureau defined New York Newark Urban Area This latter boundary places most of the Lower Hudson Valley or Westchester and Rockland counties and about one third of Putnam County downstate while putting the northwestern edge of Rockland County as well as the northernmost quarter of Westchester County including Peekskill upstate Conversely area residents often use Interstate to delineate a boundary between upstate and downstate New York br Yet another usage follows the U S Census definition of the New York metropolitan area prior to which includes all of included Westchester Rockland and Putnam counties This definition was used by the plaintiffs in the federal redistricting case Rodriguez v Pataki br In New York state law the definition of the upstate boundary also varies while Westchester is seemingly always considered downstate under state law some definitions include Rockland and Putnam counties in the downstate region and others also include Orange and Dutchess counties all of these counties are served by Metro North Railroad lines Ulster County and in the largest state defined extent of downstate Columbia County are also sometimes included The division line between the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York places Sullivan County and Dutchess County in the Southern District and Ulster and Columbia counties in the Northern District br Residents of upstate New York typically prefer to identify with subregions such as the Hudson Valley Middle and Upper the Capital District the Mohawk Valley the North Country Western New York or Central New York br Within New York surveys have had difficulty determining a consensus In a poll of New York voters in which respondents were asked to choose among four definitions of where upstate begins three were about equally common selected by between and of respondents each north of New York City north of Westchester County and north of Poughkeepsie in Dutchess County The fourth which also started north of Poughkeepsie but excluded Buffalo as a unique region neither upstate nor downstate drew only An informal poll found the Hudson Valley region is the most heavily disputed area regarding whether it is upstate or downstate br A number of businesses and institutions in the area have upstate as part of their name Examples of this include the State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse the Upstate New York Chapter of the Arthritis Foundation serving of New York s counties and the VA Healthcare Network Upstate New York which includes all of New York State northward and westward from Kingston in Ulster County Other organizations in New York with upstate in their name include the Upstate Collegiate Athletic Association now known as the Liberty League the Upstate Correctional Facility the Upstate New York Club Hockey League the Upstate New York Synod and the Upstate Citizens for Equality br br br History br br br Early history br br Before the arrival of Europeans the area was long inhabited by Iroquoian speaking people mainly west of the Hudson River and around the Great Lakes and Algonquian speaking people mainly east of the Hudson River The conflict between the two peoples continued through the period of early European colonization and the French Dutch and English tended to ally with their trading partners among the indigenous peoples The Haudenosaunee or Iroquois confederacy of the Five later Six Nations was a powerful force in its home territory br The Five Nations territory extended from the Mohawk River Valley through the western part of the state and into current Pennsylvania From this home base they also controlled at various times large swaths of additional territory throughout what is now the northeastern United States The Guswhenta Two Row Wampum Treaty made with the Dutch government in codified relations between the Haudenosaunee and European colonizers and formed the basis of subsequent treaties br In the mid th century during the Beaver Wars the Iroquois were victorious and dominated the tribes of Neutral Indians Wenrohronon and the Erie Indians in western New York Survivors were mostly assimilated into the Seneca people of the Iroquois some are believed to have escaped to South Carolina where they merged with other Indian tribes br The region was important from the first days of both French and Dutch colonization in the seventeenth century The New Netherland colony encompassed the Hudson Valley from Manhattan island north to the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers where Fort Orange later Albany was established in The fort at Schenectady was built in The upper Hudson Valley was the center of much of the colony s fur trade which was highly lucrative serving a demand for furs in Europe br North and west of New Netherland the French established trading posts along the St Lawrence River and as far south as the shores of Onondaga Lake They found both trading and proselytizing difficult among the Haudenosaunee as Samuel de Champlain had alienated the Haudenosaunee during military forays from New France In the s three French Jesuit missionaries to New France St Ren Goupil St Isaac Jogues and St Jean de Lalande were killed near the Mohawk village of Ossernenon which was located at the confluence of the Schoharie and Mohawk rivers where the modern hamlet of Auriesville was later developed They are considered to be the first three U S saints br England seized New Netherland by force in renaming it New York The Dutch recaptured the colony nine years later but ceded it to England under the Treaty of Westminster of br In the eighteenth century the British consolidated their hold on the region William Johnson a Scottish trader established an estate in the Mohawk Valley living among the Mohawk learning their language and forging an alliance with them He was appointed as the British Indian agent to the Iroquois The British also encouraged settlement in the Mohawk Valley by other Europeans including German Palatines beginning in the s br In what became known as the Albany Congress in delegates from seven of the thirteen British North American colonies met at Albany to pursue a treaty with the powerful Mohawk Benjamin Franklin a Pennsylvania delegate proposed a plan for uniting the seven colonies that greatly exceeded the scope of the congress The delegates spent most of their time debating this Albany Plan of union one of the first attempts to form a union of the colonies under one government as far as might be necessary for defense and other general important purposes The delegates approved an amended version but the colonies rejected it br To counter the French militarily the British established forts along Lake Ontario and at portages between the Mohawk Valley and the adjacent Lake Champlain and Lake Ontario watersheds The region became the area for many conflicts of the French and Indian War such as the Battle of Fort Oswego and the Siege of Fort William Henry which was later depicted in the work of James Fenimore Cooper during the Seven Years War br The British conquered New France by with the fall of Quebec France formally ceded New France to the British in the Treaty of Paris of The same year King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of which established the western and northern boundary of the Province of New York at the limits of the Hudson Mohawk and Delaware River watersheds The area between that boundary and the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River including west of the Appalachian Mountains was to be the Indian Reserve br br br American Revolution br br Between and deeply divided colonists waged civil war on each other directly and by proxy through attacks such as the Seneca led Cherry Valley and the Mohawk led Cobleskill massacre In the Sullivan Expedition a campaign by the Continental Army ordered by General George Washington drove thousands of the Haudenosaunee from their villages farms and lands in the region in an effort to both avenge and prevent such attacks br The region was strategically important to the war plans of both the British and the Continental forces British efforts to divide the New England colonies from the rest led to battles including the Battle of Valcour Island and the Battle of Saratoga a significant turning point in the war While New York City remained in the hands of the British during most of the war the upstate region was eventually dominated by the Colonial forces At the end of the war the Continental Army was headquartered in Newburgh Uncertain that the Continental Congress would pay back wages some Continental officers threatened an uprising in what became known as the Newburgh Conspiracy br br br Post revolutionary period br After the American Revolution the Treaty of Paris established the border between New York and British North America The th Parallel became the border with Quebec or Lower Canada The St Lawrence River Lake Ontario the Niagara River and Lake Erie became the border with Upper Canada Great Britain continued to occupy military installations along the American shores of the Great Lakes until including Fort Niagara at the mouth of the Niagara River and Fort Ontario at the mouth of the Oswego River br The government of the new State of New York seized the property of New Yorkers who had remained loyal to the British crown Thousands emigrated to colonies that remained under British rule such as Nova Scotia and the newly established Upper Canada now Ontario Haudenosaunee who had fought with the British also fled The British Crown granted a large tract of land in Upper Canada to their Haudenosaunee allies who established the Grand River settlement br In the federal Treaty of Canandaigua the new United States recognized the title of the remaining Haudenosaunee to the land north and west of the Proclamation Line of Nevertheless New York state officials and private land agents sought through the early th century to extinguish Indian title to these lands via non Federally sanctioned treaties such as the Treaty of Big Tree The Treaties of Buffalo Creek were designed to finally remove the last of the native claims in Western New York as part of the federal Indian Removal program but the purchaser failed to buy most of the land in time and some of the tribes objected to their exclusion Three of the four reservations remain in the region to this day one of the reservations leased out their land to form the city of Salamanca and the coexistence of the predominantly white city and the reservation has been a source of contention since the s br Both before and after the Revolution boundary disputes with other colonies and their successor states also complicated American settlement In conflict with the New York Colony s claims west of the Hudson Valley which placed the entire region in the sprawling Albany County the Pennsylvania Colony claimed much of the Southern Tier until while the Massachusetts Bay Colony claimed all of the region west of Massachusetts to the Great Lakes br The Province of New York also claimed jurisdiction east to the Connecticut River To pursue this claim north of Connecticut and Massachusetts New York granted lands to settlers in what is now Vermont at the same time that New Hampshire made grants of the same lands When Vermont declared independence in the new Republic of Vermont recognized the New Hampshire grants over those of New York New Yorkers who lost land in Vermont came to be known as the Vermont Sufferers and were granted new lands in in the town of Bainbridge New York br The dispute with Massachusetts over lands to the west of Massachusetts was settled in the Treaty of Hartford by dividing the rights to the land The treaty granted sovereignty to the State of New York but granted to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts the pre emptive right to seek title to the land from the Haudenosaunee The eastern boundary of the Massachusetts lands was thus known as the Preemption Line This line runs from the Pennsylvania line due north to Lake Ontario passing through Seneca Lake The line was surveyed a second time due to initial errors The Commonwealth of Massachusetts sold this land in large tracts including the Phelps and Gorham Purchase and the Holland Purchase br Many of the settlers of what then became Central and Western New York came from the New England states The Central New York Military Tract where many of the townships were given the names of classical military and literary figures by Robert Harpur was established to grant land to Revolutionary War veterans Some of Northern New York was founded by the hundreds of Canadian exiles who had fought in the First and Second Canadian Regiments of the Continental Army who were banished from Canada due to their rebellion against the Crown br br br th century br br Battles of the War of were fought on the Niagara Frontier in the Champlain Valley including the Battle of Plattsburgh in the St Lawrence Valley and on Lake Ontario including the Battle of Sackets Harbor The city of Buffalo was razed by the British as well After the war the US government began to construct Fort Montgomery just south of the border at Rouses Point on Lake Champlain Subsequently it was discovered that at that point the actual th parallel was three quarters of a mile south of the surveyed line putting the fort which became known as Fort Blunder in Canada This was not resolved until with the Webster Ashburton Treaty in which Great Britain and the United States decided to leave the border on the meandering line as surveyed br Slavery existed in New Netherland and the Province of New York New York was in the s the largest importer of slaves among the American colonies Slavery did not end with the American Revolution although John Jay introduced an emancipation bill into the State Assembly as early as Sojourner Truth was held as a slave in the Hudson Valley from the time she was born in until she escaped in Through efforts of the New York Manumission Society and others New York began to adopt a policy of gradual emancipation in The law passed in that would finally emancipate slaves did not take effect for ten years giving slaveowners an entire decade to sell their slaves away to other states When the law finally took effect the last slaves in New York State were emancipated on July br Although routes for travel on foot and by canoe had existed across the region for hundreds of years transportation of agricultural goods to market was expensive and slow Influenced by the canals being built in Britain leading citizens of New York began to press for the construction of a canal across the state Governor DeWitt Clinton prevailed upon the legislature to charter and fund construction of a canal from Albany to Buffalo Construction of the Erie Canal began in and was completed in The canal allowed the area to become an important component of the th century industrial expansion in the United States The canal also promoted trade with British North America and settlement of newer states in western territories Later in the century the New York Central Railroad followed the water level route from New York City to the Great Lakes contributing to the industrialization of cities along its route br Several times in the nineteenth century upstate New York served as a staging area and refuge for Canadian rebels against Great Britain as well as Irish American invaders of Canada straining British American relations In and in the aftermath of the Lower Canada Rebellion some Qu b cois rebels escaped south to the North Country while on the Niagara Frontier events of the Upper Canada Rebellion also known as the Patriot War took place In the late s some of the Fenian raids were launched across the Niagara Frontier Fenians also assembled in Malone br Although now largely discredited the report of the Mills Commission charged with investigating the origins of baseball named Cooperstown as the place where baseball was invented in the s or s by Abner Doubleday Cooperstown is the home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum Modern research suggests that the game was actually developed in its modern form in New York City br In the pre Civil War era upstate New York became a major center of radical abolitionist activity and was an important nexus of the Underground Railroad Resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act was particularly heated in the region as evidenced by such events as the Jerry Rescue The American women s rights movement was also born in upstate New York at this time The Seneca Falls Convention the first women s rights convention was held at Seneca Falls in The Rochester Convention the second such convention was held two weeks later in Rochester br Through the nineteenth century upstate New York was a hotbed of religious revivalism A number of sects such as the Shakers and the Oneida Community established themselves in upstate New York during that time This led evangelist Charles Grandison Finney to coin the term the Burned Over District for the region Because of the comparative isolation of the region many of the sects were Nonconformist and because of their non traditional tenets they had numerous difficulties with government and other local people The region is considered to be the cradle of Mormonism The Mormons Seventh day Adventists and Spiritualists are the only st century survivors of the hundreds of sects created during this time some more mainstream churches such as the Wesleyan Church and Free Methodist Church both offshoots of Methodism that originated in political disputes with the mainline Methodist church also survive br In the th century extractive industries changed the landscape Potash was manufactured as the land was cleared for farming Logging was rampant in the Adirondacks Iron was mined in the Adirondacks and the North Country By the s business leaders concerned about the effect of deforestation on the water supply necessary to the Erie Canal advocated for the creation of forest preserves in the Adirondacks and the Catskills The Adirondack Park and Catskill Park were created and strengthened by a series of legislation between and when the forever wild provision of the New York State Constitution was added br br br th century br br During the era immediately following World War II upstate reached what was probably its peak influence in the national economy Major local corporations such as IBM General Electric Kodak Xerox and Carrier had national success producing cutting edge products for business government and consumers and leadership in corporate culture The opening of the New York State Thruway in the mid s gave the region superior access to other eastern markets This regional advantage faded as many local firms relocated certain operations to other states or downsized in the face of foreign competition similar to events in other areas in the American Rust Belt There have however been recent efforts at economic revitalization In April GlobalFoundries a company specializing in the semiconductor industry moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley California to its semiconductor chip manufacturing facility in Malta New York br Since the late th century with the decline of manufacturing and its jobs the area has generally suffered a net population loss most heavily in Western New York By contrast many Amish and Mennonite families are recent arrivals to the area and have helped revive agriculture as part of the economy Beginning in many Mennonite families moved to the Penn Yan area of Yates County from Lancaster County Pennsylvania seeking cheaper farmland Amish communities have also been established in St Lawrence Montgomery Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties and are making farming profitable br Artisans are reviving traditional specialty cheeses and developing growing markets for their products including shipping some items to the New York metropolitan market A Greek style yogurt Chobani is being produced upstate by a recent immigrant who has expanded his operation nationally br Additionally upstate New York continues to boast low crime rates high educational prospects and readily affordable daily essentials earning Syracuse Rochester Albany Schenectady and Buffalo spots in the Forbes magazine list of top ten places to raise a family in the United States br Five of the six Iroquois nations have filed land claims against New York State or have sought settlement of pending claims based on late th century treaties following the American Revolutionary War with the State of New York which did not have constitutional authority to treat with American Indian nations and the United States br br br Geography br br The headwaters of the Delaware Susquehanna Mohawk Hudson and Allegheny rivers are located in the region Several regions upstate are characterized by major mountain ranges large lakes and extensive forests br The Allegheny Plateau extends into west and central New York from the south The Catskill Mountains lie within Lower New York in the southeastern part of the state closer to New York City The Catskills and the Allegheny Plateau are part of the Appalachian chain By contrast Northern New York contains the Adirondack Mountains which are sometimes mistaken as part of the Appalachians but are in fact a southern extension of the Canadian Shield br In the more mountainous eastern parts of upstate New York along the valleys of the Hudson River and the Mohawk River have been historically important travel corridors and remain so today Western New York in the vicinity of Buffalo is very flat as it was once the bottom of a glacial lake The only hills in Niagara County are the Niagara Escarpment which formed the Falls br Upstate New York has a long shared border with the Canadian province of Ontario stretching from Western New York across Northern New York It is primarily divided by water boundaries along Lake Erie the Niagara River Lake Ontario and the St Lawrence River At the conflux of New York Qu bec and Ontario lies the Mohawk Nation of Iroquois To the east across the remainder of the North Country region New York shares a land border with the province of Qu bec br Upstate counties and towns are generally larger in area and smaller in population compared with those downstate although there are exceptions The state s smallest county in population Hamilton County and largest county in area St Lawrence County on the state s northern border are both in upstate New York within the North Country and Thousand Islands regions of northern New York The counties with the largest in population Kings County and smallest in area New York County are both parts of New York City br br br Climate br br Upstate New York is well known for its cold and snowy winters particularly in comparison to the more temperate climate of downstate New York The snowy reputation is especially true for the cities of Buffalo Rochester Oswego and Syracuse and is largely due to lake effect snow from Lake Ontario and Lake Erie The villages of Old Forge and Saranac Lake both in the Adirondacks often vie on winter nights with places like International Falls Minnesota and Fargo North Dakota for the coldest spot in the nation br Many of the features of upstate New York landscapes such as the Finger Lakes and the drumlins that dot the region are the result of glaciers during

the entire rest of the state This would mean if upstate New York was a state it would the th most populated state in the U S while the New York metropolitan area would be the th most populated state in the U S Upstate New York with its larger area has a population density much lower than downstate By area upstate is typified by farmland and forest many large lakes and two major mountain ranges with metro areas dotting the map Residents of English colonial ancestry are common as well as German Irish and Italian with most metropolitan counties having a similar number of residents from each group br The North Country is heavily French Canadian Italian Americans are the largest ethnic group in Oneida County and Schenectady County as well as in some counties in the Hudson Valley that are closest to New York City Irish Americans represent the largest ethnic group from the Capital District Syracuse Binghamton and the rest of the Hudson Valley though the regions also have large Italian American populations Irish population is consistently above in most of upstate New York reaching over in the upper Hudson Valley compared to less than in most of New York City br Buffalo and Utica also contain notably large contingent of residents with Polish and other Slavic ancestries African Americans and Americans of African descent while not as numerous as in New York City make up at least of the residents in cities such as Buffalo Rochester Syracuse and Albany br There is also a significant presence of the indigenous Haudenosaunee or Six Nations in the region who retain enclaves of tribal land the Seneca Nation and Tonawanda Seneca Nation in Western New York the Onondaga nation south of Syracuse and the Oneida nation of Oneida County in Central New York and in the North Country the Mohawk Nation caught between Franklin County Ontario and Qu bec Members of the Six Nations also live across upstate New York outside of tribal lands br br br Economy br br The median household income across New York State was in however most upstate counties fall short of the statewide average As of January the minimum wage in New York State excluding New York City Long Island and Westchester County is per hour with a plan to increase the minimum wage to per hour There are two Fortune companies located in upstate New York Constellation Brands in Victor in Ontario County and Corning Inc Depending on the definition of upstate there are nine or ten foreign trade zones in upstate New York nine are located in counties almost always considered upstate and one is located in Orange County The upstate economy remains behind the economy of the New York Metropolitan Area and downstate represented percent of the job growth for the entire state Between and job growth in Brooklyn alone exceeded that of upstate New York br Upstate New York boasts a sizeable mining sector New York State is among the top third of states in the United States by value of minerals produced much of which is from upstate regions Central New York is a major salt producing area contributing to the state s position as the third largest producer of salt in the U S Additionally New York State ranks first in the production of garnet the state gemstone and is the only state that produces wollastonite Mining of these two minerals within New York takes place entirely within upstate counties Logging is also an important sector in the region In New York State produced million cubic feet of timber of which was sugar maple wood Sawmills producing wood in New York are almost all within the upstate region br Upstate New York also has a substantive outdoor recreation industry The Adirondack Park by far the largest in the state is annually visited by between and million people a greater number than annually visit the Grand Canyon In over jobs in New York State were supported by the outdoor recreation industry and the sector plays an especially important role in rural parts of the state New York State has the largest number of ski resorts in the United States at The majority of these are located in upstate New York and by most definitions of the region it contains more than ski resorts than Michigan the state with the next highest total br br br Agriculture br br A number of agricultural products are grown in upstate New York including dairy corn hay fruits cabbage and potatoes The region has a significant dairy industry and New York State is the largest producer of yogurt cottage cheese and sour cream and third largest producer of dairy overall in the United States Chobani the largest producer of yogurt in the United States is located in upstate New York The region is also a significant producer of wine New York State produces the second most wine of any state the majority of wine produced being from upstate regions of which was produced in the area surrounding the Finger Lakes New York State is also the second largest producer of apples snap peas maple syrup and cabbage in the United States with agricultural output of these goods being highest in upstate counties br br br Manufacturing br br Upstate New York also has a significant manufacturing sector A number of semiconductor manufacturers are located in the region including the headquarters and a manufacturing facility of GlobalFoundries the world s fourth largest semiconductor manufacturer in Malta in Saratoga County Other facilities entering the region include a Micron location in Clay in Onondaga County and a Wolfspeed facility in Marcy in Oneida County In addition to semiconductor manufacturing upstate New York has notable glass production Corning Inc one of the largest glassmakers in the world and the developer of Gorilla Glass is located in Corning New York In the late nineteenth century the region was considered one of the centers of glassmaking in the country earning Corning the name The Crystal City Other manufacturing includes Tesla s Gigafactory in Buffalo br br br Energy br br Upstate New York has a significant energy sector and the region accounts for over half of the energy production in the state The majority of upstate electricity produced comes from nuclear and renewable sources In these sources accounted for of energy produced in the upstate region as defined by the New York State Independent Systems Operator New York State as a whole is the third highest producer of hydroelectric power in the United States the majority of which is produced in upstate The third largest conventional hydroelectric power plant in the United States Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Plant is located in the region Upstate New York also produces all of the state s nuclear energy and all three of New York State s Nuclear Power Plants are located upstate after the closure of the Indian Point Energy Center in Nuclear Power the second largest in state mode of electricity generation is produced at the James A FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant and the Nine Mile Nuclear Power Plant both in Scriba and the R E Ginna Plant in Onatrio NY Other major modes of energy production in the region include wind and natural gas br br br Culture br br The other regions of New York are culturally and economically distinct from the New York City area and in many ways from each other By area most of New York is characterized by agricultural and forested rural communities and by small and medium sized cities and their surrounding suburbs located along major transportation corridors The state s major metropolitan areas outside of New York City are Buffalo Rochester Syracuse and Albany Schenectady Troy each of whose population exceeds br The different regions of New York are influenced by and have affinities with other adjacent regions Western New York has cultural and economic ties to the other Great Lakes states as well as Southern Ontario and is effectively along with Northwestern Pennsylvania an eastward extension of Midwestern United States culture The Capital District the Hudson Valley the Mohawk Valley and the Plattsburgh area have ties to New England The North Country the extreme northern portion of the state also has strong cultural economic linguistic and familial ties to Quebec and Eastern Ontario Thus Plattsburgh has close ties to its neighbors in the Montreal area as well as Vermont Much of New York receives television and radio broadcasts from Canada and there are often other cross border ties both historical and familial A similar relationship can be seen in northern New England br Upstate New York from Western New York east to Utica is linguistically part of the Inland North region of American English dialectology a region which includes Midwestern cities as far west as Chicago and Milwaukee The Hudson and lower Mohawk Valley regions have more in common dialectologically with western New England and New York City The boundary between the use of the words pop and soda to refer to soft drinks falls farther west than the edge of the Inland North running just to around the city of Rochester Buffalo and areas west of Rochester use pop like the rest of the Inland North to the west whereas areas east of Rochester like Syracuse and Binghamton use soda like New England and New York City In Ithaca and Elmira the border is less clear with some people having grown up with pop and some with soda however current trends see Ithaca at least turning to mostly soda br Foodways indigenous to regions of upstate New York include br br Buffalo wings and beef on weck sandwich Buffalo br Cornell

Saratoga Springs it has achieved such universal popularity that it is no longer identified with the region Winemaking is a growing industry in the Finger Lakes as well as in Chautauqua County where Welch s operates one of the oldest extant grape juice factories in the United States In the center of the Finger Lakes region Ithaca is known for the Bo Burger a cheeseburger with a fried egg on top br Two of the most important rock festivals of the th century were held in upstate New York In the Woodstock Festival was held in Bethel New York while in another multiday festival was held at the Watkins Glen International Raceway br Some literary documentary and cinematic depictions of upstate present a sense of small town simple lifestyles such as It s a Wonderful Life set in a small upstate town probably based on Seneca Falls in the s br br br Politics br br Often attributed to the region s semi rural to rural character there is more conservatism in culture and politics than found in the more urban downstate area and the region is the power base of the state s Republican Party Upstate New York does however have several Democratic dominated counties including Erie County Buffalo Monroe County Rochester Onondaga County Syracuse Tompkins County Ithaca and Albany County Albany br As a whole upstate New York is roughly equally divided in federal elections between Democrats and Republicans In John Kerry defeated George W Bush by fewer than votes votes to in the upstate region br br br Relationship with New York City br br New York City is dependent on upstate New York for a variety of services the latter is the source of the city s water supply via the Delaware Aqueduct and the Catskill Aqueduct much of the city s electric power supply comes from state owned hydroelectric plants at Niagara Falls and the St Lawrence River and most of the state s prisons are upstate hence the popular term being sent up the river however the term originally referred to Sing Sing which is up the Hudson River from New York City but being in Ossining in Westchester County is still in the downstate region Conversely the operation of state facilities providing these services
