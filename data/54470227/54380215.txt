receives no response He sits down and cries before walking back to the cottage He summons Gargan and Markham and they drive quickly to the bridge Gargan and Markham attempt multiple times to retrieve Kopechne from the overturned vehicle but are unable to open any of the doors or windows They insist Kennedy report the incident immediately but instead he gets in a rowing boat and Gargan and Markham row him to Edgartown where they go their separate ways br Kennedy walks past the phone booth outside his hotel and up to his room and gets undressed He takes a bath gets dressed and combs his hair He

written by Markham Kennedy travels to the family compound in Hyannisport believing he has contained the situation He is shocked as his father tells him his actions have disgraced the family and is surprised by a damage control team led by Robert McNamara convened to address the legal potential charge of manslaughter and political consequences First they make sure the body is not examined again and that the official record that his licence has expired is changed by a Kennedy friendly official Then they craft a strategy to push the court hearing after the current news cycle dominated by the landing of the first men on the Moon Kennedy attends Kopechne s funeral wearing a neck brace to gain sympathy but this ploy backfires in the press br Kennedy suggests an appeal to the people of Massachusetts on national television which his damage control team heartily endorses They use the family s influence to resolve the court case without a trial where anything he says publicly could be used against him Kennedy receives the minimum sentence by pleading guilty to leaving the scene of an accident two months jail time which the judge suspends based on Kennedy s character and good standing br Gargan who has become increasingly disgusted with Kennedy for not being honest about the facts of the case and attempting to play the victim attempts to resign Kennedy having just been slapped by his father tells Gargan he intends to resign from the Senate and asks him to draft a resignation speech He tells Gargan not to tell anyone br As Kennedy is ready to go on national television with the speech prepared by Ted Sorensen designed to elicit public sympathy Gargan gives Kennedy the resignation speech telling him it is the right thing to do But Kennedy throws it away and Gargan is pressed to hold Kennedy s cue cards for Sorensen s speech Although the public has mixed views the majority interviewed say they would re elect him br The credits explain that Joseph

even know what the name Chappaquiddick refers to which might in itself provide solid justification for making a film about it But the drama of the tragic July accident needed more energetic and incisive treatment than it receives in this sober somewhat slack telling br br In a March interview Byron Allen CEO of Entertainment Studios which distributed the film stated that there are some very powerful people who tried to put pressure on me not to release this movie Boston Herald journalist Howie Carr speculated that this was a reference to Chris Dodd who had been a longtime friend and ally of Kennedy s when he served in the U S Senate and had more recently been president of the Motion Picture Association of America br American journalist writer and film critic Neal Gabler who at the time was writing a biography of Ted Kennedy criticized the film as a mix of conjecture and outright fabrication As one example he stated Contrary to the film s implications Mr Kennedy immediately and forever after felt deep remorse and responsibility for the accident it haunted him Similarly longtime Kennedy aide and speechwriter Bob Shrum criticized the film for trafficking in conspiracy theories stating that Kennedy had never tried to cover up or minimise his responsibility for Kopechne s death br Conservative commentator Mark Steyn called Chappaquiddick an excellent film that shows how the acidic glamour of power corrodes Kennedy and many of those around him He also stated his opinion that one exchange in the film was based on something he Steyn had written previously in the film Kennedy remarks that even acclaimed historical figures such as Moses had personal flaws and his cousin Joe Gargan retorts Moses didn t leave a girl at the bottom of the Red Sea Steyn noted that he had written something very similar in response to a column by Joan Vennochi praising Kennedy after his death br br Chappaquiddick at IMDb br Chappaquiddick at Box Office Mojo br Chappaquiddick at Rotten
