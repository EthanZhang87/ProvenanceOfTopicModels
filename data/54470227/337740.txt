A priest of the Romanian Orthodox Church tells him that his wife s soul is damned to Hell for committing suicide Enraged Vlad desecrates the chapel and renounces the Christian God declaring he will rise from the grave to avenge Elisabeta with all the powers of darkness He then drives his sword into the chapel s stone cross and drinks the blood that pours from it becoming a vampire br In solicitor Jonathan Harker takes the Transylvanian Count Dracula as a client from his colleague R M Renfield who has gone insane and is now an inmate in Dr Jack Seward s asylum Jonathan travels to Dracula s castle in Transylvania to arrange Dracula s real estate acquisitions in London Jonathan meets Dracula who finds a picture of his fianc e Mina Murray and believes she is the reincarnation of Elisabeta Dracula leaves Jonathan to be fed upon by his brides while he sails to England with Transylvanian soil taking up residence at Carfax Abbey br In London Dracula hypnotically seduces and bites Mina s best friend Lucy Westenra with whom Mina is staying while Jonathan is in Transylvania Lucy s deteriorating health and behavioral changes prompt former suitors Quincey Morris and Dr Seward along with her fianc Arthur Holmwood to summon Dr Abraham Van Helsing Seward s mentor who recognizes Lucy as being the victim of a vampire Dracula appearing young and handsome during daylight meets and charms Mina Mina develops feelings for Dracula accompanying him on several outings When Mina receives word from Jonathan who has escaped the castle and recovered at a convent she travels to Romania to

Helsing lead the others to Carfax Abbey where they destroy the Count s boxes of soil Dracula enters the asylum and kills Renfield for warning Mina of his presence He visits Mina who is staying in Seward s quarters and confesses that he murdered Lucy and has been terrorizing Mina s friends Though furious at first Mina admits that she still loves him and remembers Elisabeta s previous life at her insistence Dracula begins transforming her into a vampire The hunters burst into the bedroom and Dracula claims Mina as his bride before escaping As Mina changes Van Helsing hypnotizes her and learns via her connection with Dracula that he is sailing home in his last remaining box The hunters depart for Varna to intercept him but Dracula reads Mina s mind and evades them The hunters split up Van Helsing and Mina travel to the Borgo Pass and the castle while the others try to stop the Romani transporting Dracula br At night Van Helsing and Mina are approached by Dracula s brides Mina

surrounds them with a ring of fire to protect them from the brides then kills the brides the following morning Dracula s carriage arrives at the castle pursued by the hunters A fight between the hunters and Romani ensues Morris is fatally stabbed in the back and Dracula bursts from his coffin at sunset Jonathan slits his throat with a kukri knife while Morris stabs him in the heart Van Helsing and Jonathan allow Mina to retreat with the Count while Morris dies in the arms of Holmwood comforted by his friends br In the chapel where he renounced God Dracula lies dying He and Mina share a kiss as the candles adorning the chapel light up and the cross repairs itself Dracula reverts to his younger self and asks Mina to give him peace Mina thrusts the knife through his heart and as he dies the mark on her forehead disappears freeing her from his curse She then decapitates him and gazes up at a fresco of Vlad and Elisabeta ascending to heaven together finally reunited br br In Stoker s original novel the Count is described through various terms of otherness His foreign image and customs are translated into the monstrous Other leading to an identity for the reader between the foreign and the monstrous Dracula as a foreign Other is set as the marked term The characters of Jonathan Harker and Mina Murray in the novel represent the British Empire which provides the unmarked or normal perspective in Dracula This binary set aligns with Edward Said s claim that the British have had a long tradition of coming to terms with the Orient as one of its deepest and most recurring images of the Other In the book the threat of foreign infiltration is a palpable component to the social context in which it was written According to Deborah S Wilson Dracula produced at the apogee of Britain s Empire projects anxious themes of invasion and colonization upon a foreign culture embodied in Count Dracula himself As the feudal lord of a mysterious Balkan country Dracula himself is described in consistently orientalist terms terms that stress his racial alterity in all but purely negative terms Coppola s film reflects the change in attitude toward the racial Other that occurs over roughly a century by the s as in the film the general story and plot remain the same with certain important details changed to reflect the difference in racial understanding the emotional connection between Mina Murray and Dracula in the film stretches beyond the racial boundaries and allowing a genuine interracial relationship to occur According to John Allen Stevenson the threat of the racial Other was the real horror of Dracula for he is the ultimate social adulterer whose purpose is nothing if it is not to turn good Englishwomen like Mina away from their own kind and customs Meanwhile in the film the interracial relationship between vampire Dracula and human Mina become permissible culminating in the union of the human and the Other br br Coppola s film makes a direct connection between Dracula s vampiric origin and occultism satanism In the opening scene of the film after learning that his wife committed suicide and is denied salvation Dracula denies God and makes a deal with the dark forces This is symbolically verified with Dracula plunging his sword into the crucifix which immediately starts to bleed excessive amounts of blood that Dracula drinks as a sign of bloodpact with the Devil br br Upon release The New York Times Frank Rich suggested that the film drew upon the prevalent fear of HIV AIDS in the s a disease transmissible via contact transfer of blood Coppola according to Rich gives to the viewers a movie that both frightens and arouses them by playing off their unchecked fear of the spread of AIDS as an invasion of the national bloodstream br Van Helsing comments to his medical students that civilization and syphilization advanced together this is viewed as much as a commentary on Coppola s times during the spread of HIV AIDS as it was on Stoker s who may have died of syphilis as speculated in some biographies of Stoker br br Ryder initially brought the script written by James V Hart to the attention of Coppola The director had agreed to meet with her so the two could clear the air after her late withdrawal from The Godfather Part III caused production delays on that film and led her to believe Coppola disliked her According to Ryder I never really thought he would read it He was so consumed with Godfather III As I was leaving I said If you have a chance read this script He glanced down at it politely but when he saw the word Dracula his eyes lit up It was one of his favorite stories from camp Ryder also explained that what attracted me to the script is the fact that it s a very emotional love story which is not really what you think of when you think about Dracula Mina like many women in the late s has a lot of repressed sexuality Everything about women in that era the way those corsets forced them to move was indicative of repression To express passion was freakish Coppola was also attracted to the sensual elements of the screenplay and said that he wanted portions of the picture to resemble an erotic dream To prepare for Bram Stoker s Dracula as the movie would be called Coppola screened Citizen Kane Sergei Eisenstein s Ivan the Terrible and Orson Welles s Chimes at Midnight In the months leading up to its release Hollywood insiders who had seen the movie felt Coppola s film was too odd violent and strange to succeed at the box office and dubbed it Bonfire of the Vampires after the notorious box office bomb The Bonfire of the Vanities br Gary Oldman has stated that he never considered Count Dracula to be a bucket list role for him He said about the main reason why his younger self agreed to the role It was an opportunity to work with Coppola who I consider one of the great American directors That was enough really It was my first big American movie made on a big set with lots of costumes For a young actor that was a tremendous experience Another reason why Oldman wanted to play Dracula was because he wanted to say I ve crossed oceans of time to find you and to him it was worth playing the role just to say that line br Christian Slater was offered the role of Jonathan Harker but he turned it down a decision he later regretted As for casting Keanu Reeves in the role Coppola said of his casting choice We tried to get some kind of matin e idol for the part of Jonathan because it isn t such a great part If we all were to go to the airport Keanu is the one that the girls would just besiege Coppola has stated that Reeves worked harder on his accent than most people realized He tried so hard That was the problem actually he wanted to do it perfectly and in trying to do it perfectly it came off as stilted I tried to get him to just relax with it and not do it so fastidiously So maybe I wasn t as critical of him but that s because I like him personally so much To this day he s a prince in my eyes br br Coppola chose to invest a significant amount of the budget in costumes in order to showcase the actors whom he considered the jewels of the feature He had a team of artists veteran production artist Mentor Huebner future Spider Man Into the Spider Verse co director Peter Ramsey and future Hellboy creator Mike Mignola storyboard the entire film in advance to carefully illustrate each planned shot This process which created around a thousand images He turned the drawings into a choppy animated film an animatic with added music and spliced in scenes from the French version of Beauty and the Beast that Jean Cocteau directed in along with paintings by Gustav Klimt and other symbolist artists He showed the animated film to his designers to give them an idea of the mood and theme he was aiming for Coppola also asked the set costume designers to simply bring him designs which were weird Weird became a code word for Let s not do formula he later recalled Give me something that either comes from the research or that comes from your own nightmares I gave them paintings and I gave them drawings and I talked to them about how I thought the imagery could work br The film s hair and makeup designer Mich le Burke recalls Francis didn t want the typical Dracula that had already been done in Hollywood He wanted something different a new Dracula without the widow s peak cape or pale white skin Burke says she used her Catholic upbringing and angelic imagery for design inspiration as well as the th century attire created by costume designer Eiko Ishioka br br Due to delays and cost overruns on some of Coppola s previous projects such as Apocalypse Now and One from the Heart Coppola was determined to complete Bram Stoker s Dracula on time and on budget To accomplish this he filmed on sound stages to avoid potential troubles caused by inclement weather br Coppola brought in acting coach Greta Seacat to coach Frost and Ryder for their erotic scenes as he felt uncomfortable discussing sexuality with the young actresses However he did ask Oldman to speak seductively off camera to Frost while they were filming a scene in which she writhed alone in her bed in ecstasy She later classified the things Oldman said to her as very unrepeatable Winona Ryder found the intensity of Oldman s acting style too much at times the two fell out early in the filming process and had difficulty working together from then on Coppola stated they got along and then one day they didn t absolutely didn t get along None of us were privy to what had happened Ryder has referred to the trauma of the experience and said that she felt there was a danger while working with Oldman However she has also referred to her friction with Oldman as teen drama stating He Gary was going through a divorce and I think I can say this because he s pretty open about it but he s been sober for a long time now and he s raised three kids and he s a dream He s a good friend of mine now br In Winona Ryder also said that Reeves and Hopkins once refused Coppola s direction to verbally abuse her to make her cry during a scene that required an emotional reaction However Coppola denied that and described the situation as him instructing Oldman in character to whisper improvised words both to her and other actors on set to scare them Ryder agreed with Coppola and a spokesperson for the actress stated that He asked the actors in character to say horrible things to Winona as a technique to help her cry for the scene Although that technique didn t work for her she loves and respects him and considers it a great privilege to have worked with him br br Coppola was insistent that he did not want to use any kind of contemporary special effects techniques such as computer generated imagery when making the movie instead wishing to use antiquated effects techniques from the early history of cinema which he felt would be more appropriate given that the film s period setting coincides with the origin of film He initially hired a standard visual effects team but when they told him that the things he wanted to achieve were impossible without using modern digital technology Coppola disagreed and fired them replacing them with his son Roman Coppola As a result all of the visual effects seen in the film were achieved without the use of optical or computer generated effects but were created using on set and in camera methods For example any sequences that would have typically required the use of compositing were instead achieved by either rear projection with actors placed in front of a screen with an image projected behind them or through multiple exposure by shooting a background slate then rewinding the film through the camera and shooting the foreground slate on the same piece of film all the while using matting techniques to ensure that only the desired areas of film were exposed Forced perspectives were often employed to combine miniature effects or matte paintings with full sized elements or create distorted views of reality such as holding the camera upside down or at odd angles to create the effect of objects defying the laws of physics When filming Dracula s POV Roman took individual images with his camera in an erratic way sometimes only a few random frames per second and then sudden bursts of several frames per second For Lucy s movements she did her performance backwards and the film then processed in reverse br br On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The site s critics consensus reads Overblown in the best sense of the word Francis Ford Coppola s vision of Bram Stoker s Dracula rescues the character from decades of campy interpretations and features some terrific performances to boot Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews br Vincent Canby described the film as having been created with the enthusiasm of a precocious film student who has magically acquired a master s command of his craft Richard Corliss said Coppola brings the old spook story alive Everyone knows that Dracula has a heart Coppola knows that it is more than an organ to drive a stake into To the director the count is a restless spirit who has been condemned for too many years to interment in cruddy movies This luscious film restores the creature s nobility and gives him peace Alan Jones in Radio Times said Eerie romantic and operatic this exquisitely mounted revamp of the undead legend is a supreme artistic achievement as the tired count who has overdosed on immortality Gary Oldman s towering performance holds centre stage and burns itself into the memory br Roger Ebert awarded the film out of stars writing I enjoyed the movie simply for the way it looked and felt Production designers Dante Ferretti and Thomas Sanders have outdone themselves The cinematographer Michael Ballhaus gets into the spirit so completely he always seems to light with shadows Ebert did however voice criticisms over the film s narrative confusions and dead ends Jonathan Rosenbaum said the film suffered from a somewhat dispersed and overcrowded story line but that it remains fascinating and often affecting thanks to all its visual and conceptual energy Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called the film not particularly scary not very sexy and dramatically over the top criticizing the tone and several of the casting decisions Tom Hibbert of Empire was unimpressed Awarding the film out of stars he said Has a film ever promised so much yet delivered so little all we re left with is an overly long bloated adaptation instead of what might have been a gothic masterpiece Geoffrey O Brien of The New York Review of Books also had reservations T he romantic make over of Dracula registers as little more than a marketing device designed to exploit the attractiveness of the movie s youthful cast it rolls on a patina of the feel good uplift endemic in recent Hollywood movies br br Empire s Tom Hibbert criticized Keanu Reeves s casting and was not the only critic to consider the resultant performance to be weak In a career retrospective compiled by Entertainment Weekly Reeves was described as having been out of his depth and frequently blasted off the screen by Gary Oldman Total Film writer Nathan Ditum included Reeves in his countdown of The Worst Movie Miscastings describing him as a dreary milky nothing a black hole of sex and drama Josh Winning also of Total Film said that Reeves s work spoiled the movie He mentioned it in a list of the Performances That Ruined Movies and wrote You can visibly see Keanu attempting not to end every one of his lines with dude The result A performance that looks like the young actor s perpetually constipated Painful for all parties A feature by AskMen called Acting Miscasts That Ruined Movies expressed a similar sentiment It s one thing to cast Keanu Reeves as an esteemed British lawyer but it s quite another to ask him to act alongside Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins The two Oscar nominees ran circles around the poor Canuck exposing his lack of range shoddy accent and abysmal instincts for all to see br Reeves s attempt at London vernacular has been cited as one of the worst accents if not the worst in the history of recorded film Virgin Media journalist Limara Salt in listing the Top worst movie accents wrote Keanu Reeves is consistently terrible at delivering any accent apart from Californian surfer dude but it s his English effort in Dracula that tops the lot Overly posh and entirely ridiculous Reeves s performance is as painful as it is hilarious Salt said that Winona Ryder is equally rubbish an opinion echoed by Glen Levy in Time In his Top Worst Fake British Accents he said that both actors come up short in the accent and some might argue acting department and that their London dialect made for a literal horror show Conversely Marc Savlov writing for The Austin Chronicle opined that Ryder was more impressive than Reeves and suited the role Ryder seemingly the perfect choice for Dracula s obscure object of desire Mina Harker is better by far than Reeves br br Bram Stoker s Dracula opened at number one at the US box office with a November record of beating Back to the Future Part II This record was quickly surpassed by Home Alone Lost in New York The film dropped off in subsequent weeks losing of its audience after its first weekend in release and exiting the top five after three weeks It became a box office hit grossing in the United States and Canada becoming the th highest

action adaptation of Dracula that got Funko POPs previous ones were Nosferatu based on film and Dracula based on film br br The film had a considerable effect on popular culture and vampire representation in media Costume design by Eiko Ishioka created a new image for the Count and for the first time freed him from the black cape and evening wear the character had become associated with since Bela Lugosi s portrayal in The film was also a landmark in vampire horror as it is the only Dracula adaptation to win Oscars br The film is seen as a game changer by many critics which established a tone and style that redefined cinematic vampires It created a host of new vampire film tropes like retractable fangs vampires turning into literal bat men and a steampunk aesthetic Bram Stoker s Dracula its partisans contend is significant in the way that The Exorcist and The Shining were significant in showing that a horror story can be worthy of an A list cast and production values and that a truly imaginative filmmaker can take even a story as hoary as Dracula and give it a new luster br Coppola s film began a cycle of prestige monster movies with big stars and name directors as well as high production values and lavish costumes Mary Shelley s Frankenstein directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Robert De Niro as Frankenstein s Monster Wolf directed by Mike Nichols and starring Jack Nicholson as a werewolf and Mary Reilly directed by Stephen Frears and starring John Malkovich as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Julia Roberts as a maid who develops a crush on the mad doctor and his crooked other self Coppola s film also influenced the next major vampire movie literary adaptation in Interview with the Vampire directed by Neil Jordan was released starring Tom Cruise as Lestat de Lioncourt Brad Pitt as Louis and Kirsten Dunst as Claudia According to Jordan Up to that point Francis Ford Coppola with Bram Stoker s Dracula he introduced opulence and theatricality Normally before that one I always thought of vampire movies as cheap cobbled together brilliant use of minimal resources Francis made it this epic didn t he So when I was given the opportunity to make Interview with the Vampire I thought Oh it would be really great to expand on that epic sense of darkness and to give these characters huge kind of romantic destinies and longings and feelings br The
