Studios rights to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property Nickelodeon announced plans to produce a new film through corporate sibling Paramount Pictures with an expected release date sometime in In late May Paramount and Nickelodeon had brought Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes partners Andrew Form and Brad Fuller on to produce the next film that would reboot the film series For the script the studio originally hired Art Marcum and Matt Holloway to write the film A year later the studio turned to writers Josh Appelbaum and Andr Nemec to rewrite the script In February Jonathan Liebesman began negotiations to direct the film beating out Brett Ratner Later in March Paramount pushed back the film s release date to Christmas Day In early March Bay revealed at Nickelodeon s upfront presentation that the film will be simply titled Ninja Turtles and that the turtles would be from an alien race News of Bay s creative change was met with criticism from within the fan community br In response to the announcement actor Robbie Rist who voiced Michelangelo in the first three films wrote to Bay accusing him of sodomizing the franchise Rist later remarked that he could have been out of line since Bay makes more money than he does In response to the feedback Bay issued a statement asking fans to calm down since a script had not been revealed his team was working closely with the creators and would include all the elements that made them fans to begin with Both Brian Tochi who voiced Leonardo in the first three films and Judith Hoag who played April O Neil in the film have voiced their support towards the creative change Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co creator Peter Laird expressed his thoughts on the change asking fans to take Bay s advice and wait until more of Bay s plan is made available Laird also stated that he felt the ill conceived plan could be a genius notion as it would allow fans to have the multitude of bipedal anthropomorphic turtles that they have been asking for He would point out that while the concept of a turtle planet backstory made for a great run of the mill science fiction story it had no real place in the Ninja Turtles universe br Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co creator Kevin Eastman stated that he had been invited behind the scenes of the film and concluded that he was officially on board with the project and that although he could not say much he believed it to be awesome Via Twitter Corey Feldman who voiced Donatello in the first and third films voiced his support for the film saying that he loves Bay s remakes and he is eager to reprise his role In response to the backlash Liebesman stated that he was glad to hear about the fans response since he and Eastman had been locked in a room working on ideas that from his own perspective as a fan everybody would love While he did not confirm whether or not Bay s comment did represent the film s premise he did stress on the ooze itself and its background in the original comic reminding that the ooze was the product of alien technology In regards to how the Turtles would be rendered Liebesman would not say exactly what visual direction would be taken but he did state that he enjoyed Weta Digital s work in Rise of the Planet of the Apes He also pointed out that the film was not to be exclusively about action but also to focus on brotherhood friendship and responsibility br Bay posted on his website explaining the title change and stressing that nothing had changed regarding the Turtles He also said the reason the title was shortened was a request by Paramount to make the title simple He continued that the Turtles were the same as fans remember and regardless of the title change they still act like teenagers He urged everyone to give everybody who was involved a chance as they had the fans interest at top priority and would not let anybody down Eastman revealed some more information about the film stating that April would not be years old like in the cartoon series he feels Ken Watanabe would make a great Shredder he would like to bring Reyes back as a Foot lieutenant and martial arts wise they are looking at Fist of Legend and The Raid Redemption Eastman called it easily the best Turtle movie yet Kevin Eastman stated that the movie is creating its own story but has to be true to the source material or else they will get murdered br In August an early version of the script dated January titled The Blue Door and written by Appelbaum and Nemec was leaked online It featured major changes to the origins the Turtles hail from another dimension that consists of turtle warriors Splinter is an alien from the same dimension as well Shredder is Colonel Schrader a government agent who is secretly an alien who can grow blades from his body The Foot Clan is just The Foot an elite Black Ops unit led by Col Schrader Casey Jones is an year old security guard amateur ice hockey player that finds the Turtles and is the focus of the film April is also and is having relationship troubles with Casey because she is moving to New York City due to an internship at CBS Raphael is the comic relief instead of Michelangelo and Michelangelo falls in love with a turtle woman from his home planet A cease and desist order was sent by Paramount Pictures to a website that was hosting the script Peter Laird read the script and commented on his blog that all true TMNT fans should be grateful to the new powers that be that they did not allow this wretched thing to go any further In response to The Blue Door Bay stated that the draft had been written before he and Platinum Dunes joined the project and was promptly rejected sometime before The filming started in April in New York The studio pushed back the film s release date until June and a new writer Evan Daugherty was brought on board but Paramount postponed the release date again to August in order to avoid competition with family friendly films released in June as well as one of Paramount and Michael Bay s other releases Transformers Age of Extinction br br br Casting br Megan Fox was cast as April O Neil in February marking her first collaboration with Bay since her remark comparing him to Adolf Hitler Bay had confirmed Fox was back on good terms with him as early as April Jessica Biel had expressed interest in playing the part In regards to Fox s casting Laird commented that he felt there were better choices to play April but that he would prefer not to get too worked up over the issue br Alan Ritchson Pete Ploszek Jeremy Howard and Noel Fisher were cast as Raphael Leonardo Donatello and Michelangelo respectively the following month In early April Will Arnett was cast in a role that was being kept secret until leaked photos revealed that he had been cast as April s cameraman and rival Vern Fenwick Soon after that actor Danny Woodburn joined the cast as Splinter br In early May William Fichtner was cast in the film as a lead with iconic stature in the Turtles mythology marking his third collaboration with Bay following Armageddon and Pearl Harbor His character was revealed to be named Eric Sacks an Anglicised version of Oroku Saki The Shredder At this point in production Sacks was intended to be the film s version of the Shredder but that idea was subsequently abandoned in favour of casting actor Tohoru Masamune as an authentically Japanese incarnation of the character following widespread whitewashing accusations The movie underwent reshoots to change this element of the plot with Sacks being changed to the Shredder s adopted son although the film s tie in video game would retain Sacks as the Shredder br Also in May former Saturday Night Live star Abby Elliott was cast in the film Also Whoopi Goldberg appeared on set portraying Bernadette Thompson a female version of Burne Thompson William Fichtner revealed that Bebop and Rocksteady would not be appearing in the film who appeared later in the sequel Abby Elliott

actors in black and grey motion capture suits complete with life sized turtle shells with each actor wearing armbands and accents of their corresponding turtle s signature color Cinematographer Lula Carvalho who was invited to work in the film during production of the remake of RoboCop described the process as demanding much imagination and participation of the visual effects supervisor given that despite their presence on the set the actors would effectively be replaced by computer generated creatures Production for the film wrapped on August Additional filming occurred in January and April br According to co star Alan Ritchson who played Raphael he expressed displeasure with various production issues during filming At first Ritchson was not sure about playing Raphael because he did not wish to play a motion capture character but the promise of career advancement by producers at Paramount and the thought of pleasing his son a huge fan of the franchise convinced him to accept the part The TMNT actors were then not given the same special treatments as their live action co stars Megan Fox and Will Arnett and often seemed to be mistreated and afterthought by most of the producers including Michael Bay and Paramount Pictures during and after filming of both movies not even allowing many opportunities to do press for the picture and were not invited to the premiere as promised and instructed them to not give press interviews while claiming they the turtles were the ones refusing to give interviews but denying saying they wanted interviews Ritchson personally emailed the late Brad Grey many times about the situation Alan did not want to return as Raphael after having an unhappy experience making the first movie but was bound by his contract to do so and then was promised it would not happen again on the sequel and then will be giving interviews for the film sequel and even made appearances at the film sequel s premieres but nothing much changed

Nickelodeon doing the special effects for The Island the Transformers film series Lemony Snicket s A Series of Unfortunate Events The Spiderwick Chronicles and the animation for the film Rango To make sure the digital turtles had more nuanced facial expressions the technicians employed a new motion capture system that captured the actors faces with two high definition cameras which captured roughly terabyte of data per day Along with a more realistic design the effects artists wanted the Ninja Turtles to be charming intimidating and individually recognizable Thus each had a distinctive body

saying even youngsters may wonder why any hint of charm or fun has scurried away Those new to the franchise may withdraw their head into their neck turtle like br Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film two out of four stars Rougher and slightly funnier than the original but still harmless junk at best Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film one and half stars out of four Not much of an effort is made to differentiate the personalities of the turtles who all frankly look as grotesque as a Terry Gilliam cartoon Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times said Attached to this movie the title no longer sounds zany it looks like a series of keywords br Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said that there is something half hearted about the entire film as if those behind it were involved not because they wanted to make it not because they should make it but just because they could Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C saying too brief thrills only shine a harsher light on the film s laborious pacing and cringeworthy one liners spilling from the maws of the ninja teens br Nancy Churnin of The Dallas Morning News gave the film a B writing The turtles engagingly voiced by Alan Ritchson Noel Fisher Johnny Knoxville and Jeremy Howard look terrific and the best part is that the film has heart Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review writing Liebesman relies on his genre film resume to keep events moving at a brisk clip and the motion capture process employed to facilitate live action integration with cutting edge VFX looks superior onscreen Justin Chang of Variety said the film is neither a particularly good movie nor the pop cultural travesty that some were dreading A A Dowd of The A V Club gave the film a C What the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles lacks is not fidelity but a spirit of genuine boyish fun the sense that anyone involved saw more than a very specific shade of green in the freshly digital scales of these year old characters br Soren Anderson of The Seattle Times gave the film one out of four stars If ever there was a movie that should not have been made this is that movie Drew Hunt of Chicago Reader wrote that the light comedic tone is weighed down by unimaginative pop culture references and half witted one liners Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film two out of five stars saying It s just kind of a mess as unfocused and immature as the four mutant turtles at its core Stuff happens stuff blows up and this is probably a good time to mention that Michael Bay produced the film

speeds tortoise ponderous and hare head spinning br Adam Graham of The Detroit News gave the film a B There s enough turtle power to please kids and fans of the original series Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film two out of four stars The kind of clich d misfit crimefighters versus demented villains scenario that Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird happily parodied when they came up with the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic books way back in the s Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film one and a half stars out of five describing the repartee as ever is weak Even with all the extra layers of digital detail it s still tough to keep these four straight br Cliff Lee of The Globe and Mail gave the film one and a half stars out of four writing for having gone to the trouble of making a self descriptive movie called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles its producers seem ultimately unsure about its most basic concept James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film one and a half stars out of four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles doesn t so much provide brainless enjoyment as it pummels the viewer into submission Shell shocked is a reasonable description of the experience Chris Cabin of Slant Magazine gave the film one out of four stars Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles only leaves one with the dim afterglow of forced normalcy of a film so overworked to ensure mass market appeal that it loses the charming oddness and loose goofiness that has allowed these characters and their frothy appeal to endure br br br Accolades br br br br Video games br Activision
