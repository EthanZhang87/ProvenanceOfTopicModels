The Golden Globe Awards are accolades bestowed for excellence in both American and international film and television It is an annual award ceremony held since to honor artists and professionals and their work The ceremony is normally held every January and has been a major part of the film industry s awards season which culminates each year in the Academy Awards The eligibility period for Golden Globes corresponds to the calendar year from January through December br The Golden Globes were founded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association HFPA an organization representing international journalists who reported on the American entertainment industry Revenue from the ceremony was used by the HFPA to fund entertainment related charities and scholarships such as the Young Artist Awards br br The Hollywood Foreign Press Association HFPA was founded in as the Hollywood Foreign Correspondent Association HFCA by Los Angeles based foreign journalists seeking to develop a better organized process of gathering and distributing cinema news to non U S markets One of the organization s first major endeavors was to establish a ceremony similar to the Academy Awards to honor film achievements The st Golden Globe Awards honoring the best achievements in filmmaking were held in January at the th Century Fox studios Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade including the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel br br In some of the journalists in the HFCA broke away to form the Foreign Press Association of Hollywood FPAH It was the FPAH that instituted the Henrietta Award for World Film Favorite which was subsequently given out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association the new name for the organization when the FPAH and HFCA merged in minus the Henrietta name through for the movie year br The FPAH held its first World Film Favorite Festival on January giving out Henrietta Awards in various categories The award an angel above a globe raised on four tall pillars was named for the president of the FPAH Henry Gris Winners of the Henrietta for World Film Favorite were Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman At the FPAH s second World Film Favorite Festival held January the Henrietta was a large statuette of a naked woman holding a flower Based on an international poll of newspapers magazines and radio stations Alan Ladd and Esther Williams were presented the gold Henrietta for World Favorites while silver Henriettas for Best Young Box Office Personality were presented to Leslie Caron Tony Curtis John Derek Mitzi Gaynor Marilyn Monroe and Patrice Wymore At the third festival held on February John Wayne and Susan Hayward won the gold Henriettas br The HFCA continued to hold their Golden Globe Awards In the HFCA had established a special honorary award to recognize outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry Recognizing its subject as an international figure within the entertainment industry the first award was presented to director and producer Cecil B DeMille The official name of the award thus became the Cecil B DeMille Award br In January the two organizations held a joint ceremony and the following year they merged under the new Hollywood Foreign Press Association name The Henrietta Award was terminated but the HFPA instituted a special award called World Film Favorite a Golden Globe surmounted by an angel Similar to the Henrietta Award for World Film Favorite the winner of the new HFPA Golden Globe was determined by a worldwide poll conducted by Reuters This award sometimes referred to as The Henrietta Award was given out through for the movie year when it was terminated br Roger Moore and Jane Fonda were the last two recipients of the World Film Favorite Award br br The th Golden Globe Awards held in February saw the first Golden Globe in Television Achievement The first three permanent television award categories Best TV Series Best TV Actor and Best TV Actress then made their debuts during the th Golden Globe Awards held in March br Beginning in the trophies commenced to be handed out by one or more persons referred to as Miss Golden Globe a title renamed on January to Golden Globe Ambassador The holders of the position were traditionally the daughters or sometimes the sons of a celebrity and as a point of pride these often continued to be contested among celebrity parents br In the Golden Globe statuette was redesigned but not for the first time in its history The New York firm Society Awards collaborated for a year with the HFPA to produce a statuette that included a unique marble and enhanced the statuette s quality and gold content It was unveiled at a press conference at the Beverly Hilton prior to the show br The Carol Burnett Award was created as a television counterpart to the Cecil B DeMille Award named after its first recipient in actress and comedian Carol Burnett br br Revenues generated from the annual ceremony have enabled the HFPA to donate millions of dollars to entertainment related charities as well as funding scholarships and other programs for future film and television professionals The most prominent beneficiary is the Young Artist Awards presented annually by the Young Artist Foundation established in by Hollywood Foreign Press member Maureen Dragone to recognize and award excellence of young Hollywood performers under the age of and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically or financially challenged br br In the HFPA faced criticism for the lack of Black representation among its members On May the HFPA announced plans for a reform package including a increase in members over the next months as well as new positions term limits and practices to improve its accountability However Time s Up and a group of PR firms criticized the lack of given timelines for filling some of the new management positions arguing that they would not be completed soon enough to have any material impact on the cycle of the upcoming th Golden Globe Awards in January Time s Up further argued that the package largely contains no specifics nor commitments to real accountability or change br On May both Amazon Studios and Netflix announced that they would stop their activities with the HFPA until sufficient actions on reforms are made Other media companies followed suit on May including NBC who announced that it would not televise the th Golden Globe Awards but that it would be open to televising the ceremony in if the HFPA were successful in its efforts to reform WarnerMedia also boycotted the HFPA while Tom Cruise returned the awards he had won for Born on the Fourth of July Jerry Maguire and Magnolia in solidarity br Following these events the HFPA released a timeline for its reforms which would see the process completed by the week of August On October the HFPA released a list of new members that it had recruited under these reforms and named Todd Boehly owner of ceremony producer Dick Clark Productions as its interim CEO The HFPA then announced on October that it still planned to hold the th Golden Globe Awards on January with or without another media partner With the televised absence of the Golden Globe Awards from NBC the Critics Choice Association attempted to shift their Critics Choice Movie Awards ceremony up a week in order to fill the void and increase their overall prestige though it was later delayed due to SARS CoV Omicron variant The th ceremony was conducted as a non televised private presentation with limited guests particularly beneficiaries of the HFPA s philanthropic activities and strict COVID protocol due to Omicron variant br In July the HFPA approved a major restructuring under which Boehly would establish a for profit entity via his holding company Eldridge Industries owner of Dick Clark Productions which has produced the Golden Globes telecast since as well as the entertainment trade publication The Hollywood Reporter that will hold the Golden Globe Awards intellectual property and oversee the professionalization and modernization of the ceremony including increasing the size and diversity of the available voters for the annual awards The HFPA s philanthropic activities were to continue separately as a non profit entity NBC subsequently agreed to a one year contract to air the th Golden Globe Awards on January which were moved to a Tuesday evening to avoid conflicting with the National Football League whose regular season was recently extended into January and the College Football Playoff National Championship which was being hosted at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood br On June the HFPA was wound down and all Golden Globe Awards assets and intellectual property were acquired by DCP whose ownership includes Penske Media Corporation owner of fellow entertainment publications Deadline Hollywood and Variety and Eldridge the financial details of the purchase were not disclosed

ceremony the HFPA removed a requirement that an exclusive press conference be hosted by the organization for each nominated film a practice that had contributed to transparency issues br Ballots to select the nominations are sent to voters in November along with a Reminder List of eligible film and TV programs Each HFPA member then votes for their top five choices in each category numbering them to with being their top choice The nominees in each category are then the five selections that receive the most votes The ranked voting is only used to break ties with number worth points number worth

a tie the winner is the one that had the most votes on the nomination ballot br As of the ceremony the voting body consisted of individuals including representatives of countries international journalists and members that were members of the HFPA br br The broadcast of the Golden Globe Awards broadcast to countries worldwide generally ranks as the third most watched awards show each year behind only the Oscars and the Grammy Awards Since it was televised live in all United States time zones Until Ricky Gervais hosted in the award ceremony was one of two major Hollywood award ceremonies the other being the Screen Actors Guild Awards that did not have a regular host every year a different presenter introduced the ceremony at the beginning of the broadcast Gervais returned to host the th and th Golden Globe Awards the next two years Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted the th st and nd Golden Globe Awards in through The Golden Globe Awards theme song which debuted in was written by Japanese musician and songwriter Yoshiki Hayashi br br Due to threats of writers picketing the event as part of the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike the th Golden Globe Awards ceremony was cancelled and replaced by an hour long press conference to announce the winners While NBC who normally airs the ceremony was initially intended to be the exclusive broadcaster of the press conference the network faced conflicts with the HFPA and Dick Clark Productions over the plan The HFPA subsequently announced that it would not restrict coverage of the press conference by other broadcasters br E several years before the NBCUniversal merger and TV Guide Network who were typically known for red carpet coverage from major awards shows both aired coverage of the press conference as well as CNN NBC declined to air the conference itself the ceremony timeslot was filled by a Dateline NBC preview special an hour long results special hosted by Access Hollywood s Billy Bush and Nancy O Dell and an Access Hollywood post show also hosted by Bush and O Dell br br The HFPA has had a lucrative contract with NBC which began broadcasting the award ceremony locally in Los Angeles in then nationally in However in the Federal Communications Commission claimed the show misled the public as to how the winners were determined allegations included that winners were determined by lobby to motivate winners to show up to the awards ceremony winners were informed if they did not attend another winner would be named The FCC admonished NBC for participating in the scandal Subsequently NBC refused to broadcast the ceremony from until after br Since Dick Clark Productions DCP had produced the ceremony with NBC as a broadcaster DCP s involvement came at a time of instability for the Golden Globes including reduced credibility and having lost its contract with CBS the interim period saw it contract with cable network TBS to air the ceremony Enthusiastic over Clark s commitment the HFPA s contract contained an unusual provision granting Dick Clark Productions the role of producer in perpetuity as long as it continued to maintain broadcast rights with NBC br In Dick Clark Productions reached an extension with NBC through However the deal was negotiated without the HFPA s knowledge The HFPA sued DCP over the deal as well as claims that the company was attempting to sell digital rights that it did not hold the HFPA had wanted a new contract that would grant them a larger share of revenue from the telecast br In April judge Howard Matz upheld the NBC perpetuity clause and ruled in favor of DCP noting that the HFPA had a history of unbusinesslike display s of misplaced priorities and succumbing to bouts of pronounced turmoil and personal feuds in contrast to DCP which had been represented by one experienced executive who was adept at dealing fairly and effectively with the often amateurish conduct of HFPA Matz pointed out examples of the HFPA s enthusiasm over the relationship and their desire to not get cancelled such as having disregarded its own bylaws by approving an extension in without a formal vote The case was taken to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals br In Dick Clark Productions and the HFPA reached a settlement details were not released but DCP committed to continue its role as producer through at least the end of its current contract with NBC and to work with the HFPA to expand the brand with unique and exciting entertainment experiences NBC held a right of first refusal to renew its contract beyond but bidding was to be open to other broadcasters in September NBC agreed to renew its rights to the Golden Globes through maintaining the current broadcast arrangement and the involvement of Dick Clark Productions br In and NBC televised the late Sunday afternoon National Football League NFL playoff game which had historically gone to another NFL broadcaster as a lead in to the Golden Globes Because of the large viewership of NFL playoff games this was intended to boost the Golden Globes TV ratings which dropped between and If the game ever went long NBC planned to still air the Golden Globes in its entirety on a broadcast delay The ceremony was then postponed to February due to the impact of the COVID pandemic on cinema and on television avoiding the NFL season altogether br Per the aforementioned boycott NBC declined to air the ceremony then signed a one year deal to televise the ceremony moving it to a Tuesday evening to avoid conflicting with its coverage of the NFL CBS then signed a new deal to air the ceremony allowing the ceremony to move back to Sunday nights since CBS only airs NFL afternoon games In March CBS announced that it had signed a five year deal to broadcast the Golden Globes br br

controversies The organization had been criticized for the small size of its membership the quality of the members its exclusion of serious cinema journalists and their closeness to the movie industry and stars The Golden Globes under the HFPA were also accused of being bought or bartered with the HFPA seemingly doling out nominations if not wins to studios production companies and stars who wooed HFPA members with gifts press junkets and personal attention br br Former HFPA president Henry Gris resigned from the board in claiming that certain awards are being given more or less as favors with others querying why so many winners were represented by one public relations firm br br The FCC imposed a ban on NBC s broadcast of the Golden Globes after the February ceremony Movie critic Rex Reed in a contemporary article about the broadcast wrote br br NBC s telcast of the Foreign Press Association s th annual Golden Globe Awards had to be seen to be disbelieved The Federal Communications Commission have sent lawyers to have it investigated But award giving pointless as it is is still big business and it also gives viewers a chance to see their favorite stars make fools of themselves in public so the Golden Globes were back minus some of their sponsors who backed out at the last minute br Just last week Newsweek reported denials from the Foreign Press Association that its members give awards to the stars who throw the biggest feeds We are not influenced by a glass of champagne snapped HFPA President Howard Luft Kirk Douglas threw a party last year and what did he win Nothing br br This year there was even a special category called the Cecil B DeMille Humanitarian Award Who won You guessed it Kirk Douglas br The FCC was spurred to action because the public had been misled as to how the awards were actually made Golden Globe broadcast advertisers determined Golden Globe winners and the HFPA pressured nominees to attend the award ceremony by threatening to award the Golden Globe won by a non attendee to a losing nominee who was at the ceremony The ban lasted until br After the ban NBC once again broadcast the awards ceremony but it terminated its contract with the HFPA after the Pia Zadora scandal of br br In Pia Zadora won a Golden Globe in the category New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture for her performance in Butterfly over such competition as Elizabeth McGovern Ragtime and Kathleen Turner Body Heat Accusations were made that the Foreign Press Association members had been bought off Zadora s husband multimillionaire Meshulam Riklis flew voting members to his casino the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas which gave the appearance that they voted for Zadora to repay this Riklis also invited voting members to his house for a lavish lunch and a showing of the film He also spent a great deal on advertising Furthermore Zadora had made her film debut some years earlier as a child performer in Santa Claus Conquers the Martians br br In three days before the Golden Globe Awards telecast publicist Michael Russell filed a million lawsuit alleging that HFPA President Philip Berk terminated Russell and his partner s contract after the broadcast because they raised ethical concerns over payola with him including allegations that HFPA members took bribes for nominations and awards br abuse their positions and engage in unethical and potentially unlawful deals and arrangements which amount to a payola The lawsuit alleged that HFPA members abuse their positions and engage in unethical and potentially unlawful deals and arrangements which amount to a payola scheme scheme The HFPA denied the allegations claiming they were fabrications made up by a disgruntled ex employee The lawsuit was later settled br br The nominations for the Golden Globes drew initial skepticism as the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated The Tourist in its Best Musical Comedy categories even though it was originally advertised as a spy thriller along with being one of the most panned films of the season Host Ricky Gervais even jokingly asked the main star of the film Johnny Depp if he had seen it Depp s co star Angelina Jolie reportedly had personally lobbied HFPA members resulting in a nomination in a category the film did not belong in Rumors then surfaced that Sony the distributor of The Tourist had influenced Globes voters with an all expenses paid trip to Las Vegas culminating in a concert by Cher The lobbying by Sony also resulted in a Best Musical Comedy nod for Cher s badly reviewed movie Burlesque br br In the HFPA received widespread criticism for nominating Asian and Asian American films such as The Farewell Parasite and Minari for Best Foreign Language Film while excluding them from the Best Motion Picture categories The decision to categorize Minari as a foreign language film despite having an exclusively American production team and setting was heavily condemned by many actors and filmmakers of Asian descent While HFPA rules stipulate that a film must have at least English dialogue to be nominated for the Best Drama or Comedy Musical categories critics noted that the films Inglourious Basterds and Babel did not meet the threshold but were still nominated for the Best Motion Picture categories prompting accusations of anti Asian racism br br In the s the HFPA began to face criticism for the ethical standards of its operations including allegations that the organization lacked accountability and that there was a lack of Black representation among its members Calls for reform in response to these issues resulted in the th Golden Globe Awards being boycotted by its broadcaster and other production companies as a result the ceremony was held as a non televised private event A televised
