rights were acquired by Warner Bros Pictures David Heyman who previously worked with Cuar n on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban produced the film with him Gravity was produced entirely in the United Kingdom where British visual effects company Framestore spent more than three years creating most of the film s visual effects which involve over of its minutes br Gravity opened the th Venice International Film Festival on August and had its North American premiere three days later at the Telluride Film Festival Upon its release Gravity was met with widespread critical acclaim with high praise for its direction visuals cinematography acting and score Considered one of the best films of it appeared on numerous critics year end lists and was selected by the American Film Institute in

Actress in an Action Movie for Bullock Bullock also received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role while the film won the Ray Bradbury Award and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation Since its release it has been cited as among the best films of the s and the st century br br The Space Shuttle Explorer commanded by veteran astronaut Matthew Matt Kowalski is in Earth orbit to service the Hubble Space Telescope HST Dr Ryan Stone is aboard on her first space mission to perform a set of hardware upgrades on the Hubble During a spacewalk Mission Control in Houston warns Explorer s crew about a rapidly expanding cloud of space debris accidentally caused by the Russians having shot down a presumed defunct spy satellite see Kessler syndrome and orders the crew to return to Earth immediately Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly after as more communication satellites are disabled by debris br Debris strikes the Explorer and Hubble tearing Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space Kowalski using a Manned Maneuvering Unit MMU rescues Stone and they return to the Explorer discovering that the Shuttle has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew are dead Stone and Kowalski decide to use the MMU to reach the International Space Station ISS which is in orbit about km mi away Kowalski estimating that they have minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again br On their way to the ISS the two discuss Stone s home life and her daughter who died young in an accident As they approach the station they see that the ISS s crew has evacuated using one of its two Soyuz spacecraft the remaining Soyuz spacecraft exhibiting damage with its parachute having been deployed in space rendering it unable to return to Earth Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Tiangong space station km mi away in order to board the Shenzhou spacecraft to return safely to Earth Out of air and fuel the two try to grab onto the ISS the duo s tether snags on one of the station s solar panels Stone s leg gets entangled in the Soyuz s parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski s suit but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both Despite Stone s protests Kowalski detaches himself from the tether to save her from drifting away with him Stone is pulled back towards the ISS while Kowalski floats away br Stone enters the space station via the airlock of the Pirs module She cannot re establish communication with Kowalski or Earth and concludes that she is now the sole survivor Inside the station a fire breaks out forcing her to rush to the Soyuz As she maneuvers the Soyuz away from the ISS the tangled parachute tethers snag preventing the spacecraft from leaving Stone performs a spacewalk to cut the cables succeeding just as the debris field returns destroying the station Stone angles the Soyuz towards Tiangong but soon discovers that the Soyuz s engine has no fuel br After an attempt at radio communication with an Inuit on Earth Stone resigns herself to her fate and shuts off the cabin s oxygen supply to commit suicide As she begins to lose consciousness she experiences a hallucination of Kowalski entering the capsule and telling her to rig the Soyuz s soft landing rockets to propel the capsule towards Tiangong Stone regains the will to go on restoring the spacecraft s oxygen flow and rigging the landing rockets to propel the capsule towards Tiangong br Unable to dock with Tiangong Stone ejects herself from the Soyuz and uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel to the rapidly deorbiting Tiangong Stone manages to enter Tiangong s Shenzhou capsule just as the station enters the upper atmosphere undocking the capsule just in time br The Shenzhou capsule re enters the atmosphere successfully despite damage during its descent and lands in a lake Radio communication from Houston informs Stone that she has been tracked on radar and that rescue crews are on their way Stone opens the hatch but is unable to exit due to water rushing in She takes a deep breath and holds it until the capsule sinks allowing her to swim through the hatch She sheds her Sokol space suit that is weighing her down and crawls onto the beach before standing up triumphantly and walking away br br Sandra Bullock as Dr Ryan Stone a medical engineer and mission specialist from Lake Zurich Illinois who is on her first space mission According to Cuar n Stone is a character who lives in her own bubble and in the film she s trapped in her space suit Bullock s role was extremely demanding and daunting She called the experience lonely and said there was frustrating painful isolation on set but in the best way and described her working day on the shoot as a morose headspace She was cast in just a few months after finalizing her divorce from Jesse James The Hollywood Reporter estimated that Bullock would earn at least million based on theatrical returns alone for the film br George Clooney as Lieutenant Matthew Matt Kowalski the commander of the team Kowalski is a veteran astronaut planning to retire after the Explorer expedition He enjoys telling stories about himself and joking with his team and is determined to protect the lives of his fellow astronauts br Ed Harris voice as Mission Control in Houston Texas br Orto Ignatiussen voice as Aningaaq a Greenlandic Inuk fisherman who intercepts one of Stone s transmissions Aningaaq also appears in an eponymous short written and directed by Gravity co writer Jon s Cuar n which depicts the conversation between him and Stone from his perspective br Phaldut Sharma voice as Shariff Dasari the flight engineer on board the Explorer br Amy Warren voice as the captain of Explorer br Basher Savage voice as the captain of the International Space Station br br Although Gravity is often considered to be a science fiction film Cuar n told the BBC that he does not consider it such rather seeing it as a drama of a woman in space According to him the main theme of the film was adversity and he uses the debris as a metaphor for this br Despite being set in space the film uses motifs from shipwreck and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience in the aftermath of a catastrophe Cuar n uses the Stone character to illustrate clarity of mind persistence training and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy s law The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes in the facts of Stone s daughter s accidental and meaningless death and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds without future certainties and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them br The impact of scenes is heightened by alternating between objective and subjective perspectives the warm face of the Earth and the depths of dark space the chaos and unpredictability of the debris field and silence in the vacuum of space with the background score giving the desired effect The film uses very long uninterrupted shots throughout to draw the audience into the action but contrasts these with claustrophobic shots within space suits and capsules br Human evolution and the resilience of life may also be seen as key themes of Gravity The film opens with the exploration of space the vanguard of human civilization and ends with an allegory of the dawn of mankind when Ryan Stone fights her way out of the water after the crash landing passing a frog grabs the soil and slowly regains her capacity to stand upright and walk Director Cuar n said She s in these murky waters almost like an amniotic fluid or a primordial soup in which you see amphibians swimming She crawls out of the water not unlike early creatures in evolution And then she goes on all fours And after going on all fours she s a bit curved until she is completely erect It was the evolution of life in one quick shot Earlier imagery depicting the formation of life includes a scene after Stone enters the space station airlock and rests in an embryonic position surrounded by a rope strongly resembling an umbilical cord The film also suggests themes of humanity s ubiquitous strategy of existential resilience that across cultures individuals must postulate meaning beyond material existence wherever none can be perceived br Some commentators have noted possible religious themes in the film For instance Robert Barron in The Catholic Register summarizes the tension between Gravity s technology and religious symbolism He said The technology which this film legitimately celebrates can t save us and it can t provide the means by which we establish real contact with each other The Ganges in the sun the Saint Christopher icon the statue of Budai and above all a visit from a denizen of heaven signal that there is a dimension of reality that lies beyond what technology can master or access the reality of God br br As a child Alfonso Cuar n had an affinity for space programs dreamed of becoming an astronaut and would watch live Moon landings on television He was years old when Apollo landed on the Moon in and was profoundly influenced by Neil Armstrong At that time his grandmother bought a new television in order to be able to see the Moon landing He watched space films such as A Trip to the Moon and was further drawn to films featuring the technology of space exploration and trying to honor the laws of physics such as Marooned and Woman in the Moon br In funding ran out on a project entitled A Boy and His Shoe written by Cuar n and his son Jon s They wrote a first draft of what would become Gravity in three weeks After they finished the screenplay Cuar n attempted to develop his project at Universal Pictures where it stayed in development hell When co chairmen Marc Shmuger and David Linde were ousted from Universal in Cuar n asked for the project to be released and then Warner Bros Pictures chief Jeff Robinov stepped in After the rights to the project were sold it began development at Warner Bros Three years later when the movie was still unfinished Robinov was let go br In author Tess Gerritsen filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros for breach of contract alleging that the film Gravity is an adaptation of her novel of the same name The suit was dismissed twice in br br Cuar n co wrote the screenplay with his son Jon s However Cuar n never intended to make a space film Before conceiving the story he started out with a theme adversity He would discuss with Jon s survival scenarios in hostile isolated locations such as the desert Jon s wrote a desert film Desierto which was released in Finally he decided to take it to an extreme place where there s nothing I had this image of an astronaut spinning into space away from human communication The metaphor was already so obvious br br For the female role Cuar n was in search of a lead that could carry the film in a manner akin to Tom Hanks s character in Cast Away being the only person onscreen for a large part of the movie and he began looking at a wide range of actors for the role In Angelina Jolie who had rejected a sequel to Wanted was in contact with Warner Bros to star in the film Scheduling conflicts involving Jolie s Bosnian war film In the Land of Blood and Honey and a possible sequel to Salt led Jolie to end her involvement with Gravity leaving Warner Bros with doubts that the film would get made The studio approached her for a second time to reconsider her former decision but Jolie again declined br In mid Marion Cotillard screen tested for the part but instead went on to accept a role in another sci fi film Inception and the comedy drama Little White Lies Scheduling conflicts with the television series Gossip Girl in Manhattan and the film The Town in Boston prevented actress Blake Lively from getting the part In September Cuar n received approval from Warner Bros to offer the role without a screen test to Natalie Portman who was praised for her performance in Black Swan at that time Portman rejected the project because of scheduling conflicts Other stars considered to some degree included Naomi Watts Carey Mulligan Scarlett Johansson Sienna Miller Abbie Cornish Rebecca Hall and Olivia Wilde Warner Bros then approached Sandra Bullock for the role and she was cast in October br In March Robert Downey Jr had entered discussions to be cast in the male lead role but he left the project that November to star in How to Talk to Girls a project in development with Shawn Levy attached to direct In December with Bullock signed for the co lead role George Clooney replaced Downey br br Made on a production budget of million Gravity was shot digitally using Arri Alexa Classics cameras equipped with wide Arri Master Prime lenses Most of the film is computer generated In the majority of shots the only elements captured with a camera are the faces The final scene which takes place on Earth was shot on an Arri camera using mm film to provide the sequence with a visual contrast to the rest of the film CGI elements were shot at Pinewood and Shepperton Studios in the United Kingdom The landing scene was filmed at Lake Powell Arizona where the astronauts landing scene in Planet of the Apes was also filmed br Principal photography began in London on May The film contains shots with an average length of seconds fewer and longer shots than in most films of its length Although the first trailer had audible explosions and other sounds these scenes are silent in the finished film Cuar n said They put in explosions in the trailer As we know there is no sound in space In the film we don t do that The soundtrack in the film s space scenes consists of the musical score and sounds astronauts would hear in their suits or in the space vehicles br For most of Bullock s shots she was placed inside a large mechanical rig with thousands of LED bulbs to simulate outer space Getting into the lightbox rig took a significant amount of time and so Bullock stayed in it for up to hours a day communicating through a headset Costume Designer Jany Temime said the spacesuits were fictitious no space suit opens up at the front but we had to do that in order for her to get out So I had to redesign it and readapt all the functions of the suit for front opening Cuar n said his biggest challenge was to make the set feel as inviting and non claustrophobic as possible including having a large celebration each day when Bullock arrived Shooting long scenes in a simulated zero g environment was a challenge and so they used computer generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock s character for interior space station scenes Shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed which caused the production period to last for four and a half years Cuar n had initially assumed it would take about a year to complete the film after completing the script The lightbox was named one of s best inventions by Time magazine and is suggested as a breakthrough in entertainment technology comparable to the motion capture technology of Avatar the battle scene software of Lord of the Rings and the bullet time effect of The Matrix br Warner Bros started screening the movie to test audiences well before it was finished with crude animation instead of finished special effects Initial feedback asked for monsters or aliens Cuar n refused It was only at the Comic Con where the opening sequence was successfully showcased the studio was finally convinced the project could succeed br br Cuar n wanted to do long takes in part because the producers wanted to film it like an IMAX style Discovery Channel documentary However the long takes are deceptive as invisible cuts were utilised to stitch shots together during editing As with his previous films Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage as the starting point of his work on Gravity Instead he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the film Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible to feel as deep as possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling br The minute opening scene was challenging for the team to shoot Cuar n asked Lubezki to start the film with a brightly lit Earth adding shadows and dusk as the threat grows stronger The light was constantly changing from one frame to the other with the actors spinning around the shuttle the shuttle itself spinning and the Earth spinning as well as orbiting around the Sun all simultaneously It took many months to design it and years to shoot it When the team designed the sequence Lubezki had in mind one of his favorite cinematographers Vittorio Storaro and how he utilized lighting in his films br br Visual effects were supervised by Tim Webber at the British VFX company Framestore which was responsible for creating most of the film s visual effects except for shots Framestore was also heavily involved in the art direction and along with The Third Floor the previsualization Tim Webber stated that percent of the film consisted of CGI compared to James Cameron s Avatar which was percent CGI To simulate the authenticity and reflection of unfiltered light in space a manually controlled lighting system consisting of million individually controlled LED lights was built The D imagery was designed and supervised by Chris Parks The majority of the D was created by stereo rendering the CGI at Framestore The remaining footage was converted into D in post production principally at Prime Focus London with additional conversion work by Framestore br br Steven Price composed the incidental music for Gravity In early September a minute preview of the soundtrack was released online A soundtrack album was released digitally on September and in physical formats on October by WaterTower Music Songs featured in the film include br br Angels Are Hard to Find by Hank Williams Jr br Mera Joota Hai Japani by Shailendra and Shankar Jaikishan br Sinigit

North American premiere three days later at the Telluride Film Festival It was released in the US on October and in the UK on November The film s US release coincided with the beginning of World Space Week which was observed from October to The film was originally scheduled to be released in the US on November before being rescheduled for a release to allow the completion of extensive post

special edition Blu ray was released on March The release includes a Silent Space Version of the film which omits the score composed by Steven Price br br Gravity emerged as one of the most successful sci fi films of all time and the biggest box office hit of both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney s careers It became the highest grossing feature film in October history surpassing the animated Puss in Boots and holding the record until s Joker Bullock s previous highest grossing film was Speed million while Clooney s benchmark was Ocean s Eleven million br Preliminary reports predicted the film would open with around million in the US and Canada The film earned million from its Thursday night showings and reached million on Friday Gravity topped the box office and broke the record held by Paranormal Activity as the highest earning October and autumn openings grossing million from theaters The film also surpassed Batman Robin for having Clooney s highest opening weekend and The Heat for having Bullock s highest opening weekend respectively percent of the film s opening weekend gross came from its D showings which grossed million from theaters million percent of the receipts came from IMAX D showings the highest percentage for a film opening of more than million The film stayed at number one at the box office during its second and third weekends IMAX alone generated million from

should have limited the poll to D showings instead of both D and D screenings The Hollywood Reporter said it was playing like an A film br Matt Zoller Seitz writing on RogerEbert com gave the film four out of four stars calling it a huge and technically dazzling film and that the film s panoramas of astronauts tumbling against starfields and floating through space station interiors are at once informative and lovely Justin Chang writing for Variety said that the film restores a sense of wonder terror and possibility to the big screen that should inspire awe among critics and audiences worldwide Richard Corliss of Time praised Cuar n for playing daringly and dexterously with point of view at one moment you re inside Ryan s helmet as she surveys the bleak silence then in a subtle shift you re outside to gauge her reaction The D effects added in post production provide their own extraterrestrial startle a hailstorm of debris hurtles at you as do a space traveler s thoughts at the realization of being truly alone in the universe br Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film five out of five stars writing a brilliant and inspired movie cyclorama a glorious imaginary creation that engulfs you utterly Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph also awarded the film five out of five stars br Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film four out of four stars stating that the film was more than a movie It s some kind of miracle A O Scott writing for The New York Times highlighted the use of D which he said surpasses even what James Cameron accomplished in the flight sequences of Avatar Scott also said that the film in a little more than minutes rewrites the rules of cinema as we have known them Quentin Tarantino said it was one of his top ten films of Empire Time and Total Film ranked the film as the best of br Critics have compared Gravity with other notable films set in space Lindsey Weber of Vulture com said the choice of Ed Harris for the voice of Mission Control is a reference to Apollo Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter suggests the way a weightless Stone goes floating about in nothing but her underwear references Alien Other critics made connections with A Space Odyssey James Cameron praised the film and stated I think it s the best space photography ever done I think it s the best space film ever done and it s the movie I ve been hungry to see for an awful long time Empire Online AskMen and The Huffington Post also considered Gravity to be one of the best space films ever made While The Huffington Post s Lauren Duca later included Gravity on the site s list of Movies from the Last Years That Are Super Overrated another of the site s film critics Christopher Rosen placed it at the top of his list of Best Movies of Gravity was included on the top ten lists of critics and topped the list of of them br br Gravity received a leading nominations at the th Academy Awards with American Hustle including Best Picture

Gravity received a leading nominations at the th British Academy Film Awards including Best Film Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress in a Leading Role Cuar n was the most nominated person at the awards he was nominated for five awards including his nominations as producer for Best Film awards and editor Despite not winning Best Film Gravity won a leading awards including Outstanding British Film Best Director Best Original Music Best Cinematography Best Sound and Best Visual Effects br Gravity also won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation br br Cuar n has stated that Gravity is not always scientifically accurate and that some liberties were needed to sustain the story Despite this the film has been praised for the realism of its premises and its overall adherence to physical principles although several inaccuracies and exaggerations were still noted According to NASA Astronaut Michael J Massimino who took part in Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions STS and STS nothing was out of place nothing was missing There was a one of a kind wirecutter we used on one of my spacewalks and sure enough they had that wirecutter in the movie br br Astronaut Buzz Aldrin called the visual effects remarkable and he hoped that the film would stimulate the public to find an interest in space again after decades of diminishing investments into advancements in the field I was so extravagantly impressed by the portrayal of the reality of zero gravity Going through the space station was done just the way that I ve seen people do it in reality The spinning is going to happen maybe not quite that vigorous but certainly we ve been fortunate that people haven t been in those situations yet I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business especially in activities outside the spacecraft Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the D IMAX medium to date Rather than using the medium as a gimmick Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people But the question that most people want me to answer is how realistic was it The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly is a testament to the verisimilitude of the movie When a bad science fiction movie comes out no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing br br Former astronaut Chris Hadfield was critical of Gravity s portrayal of astronauts particularly its depiction of Bullock s character saying When she s faced with a problem she s panicking and has no idea what to do George Clooney is driving around like some sort of space cowboy and he s the only one who has any idea what s going on I think it set back a little girl s vision of what a woman astronaut can be to an entire generation In contrast Vanessa Reich Shackelford from Westcoast Women in Engineering Science and Technology while considering the character of Dr Ryan Stone wrote I came to realize that writers Alfonso also director and Jon s Cuar n had created one of the most positive representation of a woman in STEM on screen so far br br Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson astronomer and skeptic Phil Plait and veteran NASA astronaut and spacewalker Scott E Parazynski have offered comments about some of the most glaring inaccuracies The Dissolve characterized these complaints as absurd problems only an astrophysicist would find br In the movie an impact in one orbital plane is shown to affect characters present at a different orbital plane Also these characters are depicted as being able to travel to a third orbital plane relatively easily In reality the debris field created by a destroyed communications satellite would likely not impact the Hubble Space Telescope which is where the shuttle Explorer is at the beginning of the film Likewise the significant differences between orbital parameters of the Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station would have made it impossible to travel between the two spacecraft which is what the movie has the heroes do using only Kowalski s MMU without precise preparation planning calculation the appropriate technology and a large quantity of fuel at the time br Further examples of differences from reality include br br Several observers including Plait and Tyson said that in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS Stone would simply need to tug the tether gently to pull Kowalski toward her According to the film s science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost however the pair are still decelerating with Stone s leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz The cords stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers and that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them br By the time Tiangong was launched in the Space Shuttle had been retired from service br Stone is shown not wearing liquid cooled ventilation garments or even socks which are always worn under the EVA suit to protect against extreme temperatures in space Neither was she shown wearing space diapers Unlike real space suits Stone can open her suit in the front by herself br Stone s tears first roll down her face in micro gravity and are later seen floating off her face After being pushed from her eye by her eyelid the surface tension is not sufficient for the tears to continue adhering to her jawline However the film correctly portrays the spherical nature of drops of liquid in a micro gravity environment br Kowalski s use of the MMU as his personal jet pack zipping around the spacewalking scene was criticized by Time s Jeffery Kluger as being unrealistic NASA s spacewalks are strictly choreographed in advance br
