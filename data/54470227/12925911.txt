as an attempt to revitalize the horror genre He called it a loving hate letter to the genre continuing br br it s a serious critique of what we love and what we don t about horror movies I love being scared I love that mixture of thrill of horror that objectification identification thing of wanting definitely for the people to be all right but at the same time hoping they ll go somewhere dark and face something awful The things that I don t like are kids acting like idiots the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had swung a little too far in that direction br Concerning the sheer number of creatures to be designed and made for the film AFX Studio s David LeRoy Anderson estimated that close to a thousand people were turned into one of around different monster types The task necessitated renting a much larger facility to use as a workspace as a crew of around people were recruited The producers told them to commence work on December ahead of the official January start date They only completed the work by the March production date because as Anderson stated We had nearly seventy people at peak but in effect we had a hundred and forty people because everybody had at least two jobs it was crazy but people had an incredible time none of us are ever going to forget it and we re never all going to be in the same room again br The underground complex elevators and the control room were all sets but for several wide shots the British Columbia Institute of Technology s Aerospace building was used Production designer Martin Whist referred to Stanley Kubrick and commented It s very high tech industrial and it s a brand new building never been shot in before I wanted the elevators to be without any controls to almost feel like a glamorized freight elevator The lobby I wanted to look slightly utilitarian contemporary and institutional sharp and almost characterless br br A tie in of the film with the video game Left Dead had been planned with the game seeing downloadable content based on the movie s settings However due to MGM s financial problems the game content was cancelled but Valve allowed the studio to use monsters from Left Dead to populate the monster cells at the end of the film br br The Cabin in the Woods was slated for wide release on February

industry news outlets reporting plans for a Halloween release On July Lionsgate announced that they had acquired the distribution rights to the film and set a release date of April Goddard described the deal as a dream stating there s no question that Lionsgate is the right home for Cabin you look at all the films that inspired Cabin most of them were released by Lionsgate in the first place In an interview with Creative Screenwriting Goddard focused on the advantages of the delayed release saying Lionsgate came along and they were the best possible home for that movie Had the bankruptcy not happened we wouldn t have been in the right fit with the right people Yes it took two years longer than we wish it would ve taken but Lionsgate didn t make us change a frame and believed in what we were trying to do If I had complained too much when MGM went bankrupt we could have hurt ourselves We just held firm that we believed in the movie and that we would find the right home and time and it did It s hard but you have to be very patient in Hollywood br A surprise early screening of the film was held at the Butt Numb A Thon in December attracting highly positive reactions The film later

achieved an average score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of C on an A to F scale br Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three out of four stars saying that The Cabin in the Woods has been constructed almost as a puzzle for horror fans to solve Which conventions are being toyed with Which authors and films are being referred to Is the film itself an act of criticism Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film out of stars calling it fiendishly funny Travers praised Kristen Connolly and Fran Kranz for their performances and wrote By turning splatter formula on its empty head Cabin shows you can unleash a fire breathing horror film without leaving your brain or your heart on the killing floor br Cinema Blend s Editor in Chief Katey Rich gave the film out of stars and wrote br br Even when the story sticks firmly in standard horror territory this particular group of attractive kids is especially fun to spend time with You ll have to see it and you really have to see it if you love horror hate horror or have any interest in seeing how the genre can function as a playground for something completely fresh Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford are involved though in roles that are more fun to discover as you go along they do get a lot of the best jokes though and their scenes show a lot of Goddard s skill in handling the rhythm of a scene br Jenkins and Whitford were also admired by The A V Club Whitford and Jenkins clearly delight in the verbose script and by Wired whose reviewer granting of stars called Cabin a smart sendup of horror movies and mythology with a peculiar relish that testifies to the moviemakers love of genre film a smart sarcastic and deliriously fun journey into the belly of the horror beast He cited the witty banter creative twists and clippy quippy dialog that lifted Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer to cult status br Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post giving the movie of stars wrote br br A fiendishly clever brand of meta level genius propels The Cabin in the Woods a pulpy deceivingly insightful send up of horror movies that elicits just as many knowing chuckles as horrified gasps It comes not only to praise the slasher zombie and gore fests of yore but to critique them elaborating on their grammatical elements and archetypal figures even while searching for ways to put them to novel use The danger in such a loftily ironic approach is that everything in the film appears with ready made quotation marks around it But by then the audience will have picked up on the infectiously goofy vibe of an enterprise that from its first sprightly moments clearly has no intention of taking itself too seriously br Eric Goldman writing for IGN called the movie an incredibly clever and fun take on classic horror movie tropes SF Gate said The cliches come at an onslaught pace in a wonderfully conceived story that gives a bigger than life and fascinating explanation for why so many horror movie cliches exist in the first place By the time the ride is over director Drew Goddard and co writers Goddard and Joss Whedon will change course three or four times nodding and winking but never losing momentum Of the screenplay by Goddard and Whedon a CNN reviewer praised these horror hipsters acidic postmodern designs on one of the movie industry s hoariest least respected staples the dialogue is always a notch or three smarter and snappier than you d expect br Keith Phipps of The A V Club addressed the difficult challenge of putting across a satirical film with a serious body count Cabin touches on everything from The Evil Dead and Friday the th to the mechanized mutilations of the Saw series while digging deeper into the Lovecraftian roots of horror in an attempt to reveal what makes the genre work It s an exercise in metafiction that while providing grisly fun never distances viewers And it s entertaining while asking the same question of viewers and characters alike Why come to a place you knew all along was going to be so dark and dangerous br In a more mixed review Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly calling herself a wised up viewer gave the film a B grade and said The movie s biggest surprise may be that the story we think we know from modern scary cinema that horror is a fun cosmic game not much else here turns out to be pretty much the whole enchilada She shrugged off the talents of Whitford and Jenkins These two experienced actors provide the film s adult level entertainment br Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times believed that the film is an inside joke and also said The laughs in the film come easily the screams not so much David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter remarked It s just too bad the movie is never much more than a hollow exercise in self reflexive cleverness that s not nearly as ingenious as it seems to think br A O Scott of The New York Times said Novelty and genre traditionalism often fight to a draw Too much overt cleverness has a way of spoiling dumb reliable thrills And despite the evident ingenuity and strenuous labor that went into it The Cabin in the Woods does not quite work Scott added br br Some of the pleasure of the first and best part of The Cabin in the Woods comes from trying to see just over the narrative horizon and figure out what these incompatible sets of clich s have to do with each other Two distinct kinds of movie are being yoked by violence together and the performers inhabit their familiar roles with unusual wit br br On April author Peter Gallagher filed a copyright infringement lawsuit in California federal court against the makers of the film Gallagher claimed that due to the similarities between the film and his novel The Little White Trip A Night in the Pines Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard had used his work without permission The lawsuit demanded million in damages Whedon and Goddard were named as defendants along with the production company Mutant Enemy Productions and distributor Lionsgate The case was dismissed five months later br br The Cabin in the Woods
