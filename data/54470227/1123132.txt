and spawned the media franchise of the same name Fright Night was followed by a sequel Fright Night Part in and a remake of the same name in br br br Plot br year old Charley Brewster is a fan of a late night horror television program called Fright Night hosted by former movie vampire hunter Peter Vincent One evening Charley discovers that his new next door neighbor Jerry Dandrige is a vampire responsible for the disappearances of several victims After telling his mother Charley asks his girlfriend Amy Peterson and his friend Evil Ed Thompson for help before contacting the authorities Detective Lennox goes with Charley to Jerry s house to question him but his roommate Billy Cole tells them that Jerry is away on business Charley reveals his suspicions about Jerry s vampirism and Lennox leaves furious That night Charley is shocked to see Jerry inside his house having been invited in by Charley s mother Later Jerry visits Charley and offers him a choice ignore his vampiric activities or else Charley refuses brandishing a crucifix at Jerry When Jerry tries to push him out the window to his death Charley stabs Jerry s hand with a pencil Jerry destroys Charley s car in retaliation and threatens Charley over the telephone br Charley turns to Peter Vincent for help but Peter dismisses Charley as an obsessed fan Amy fearing for Charley s sanity and safety hires the destitute Peter to prove that Jerry is not a vampire by having him drink what they claim is holy water but it is only tap water Jerry has claimed to Peter that drinking actual holy water would be against his religious convictions Peter discovers Charley is right about Jerry s true nature after glancing at his pocket mirror and noticing Jerry s lack of a reflection causing him to accidentally drop the mirror Peter then flees but Jerry learns of his discovery after finding a shard of mirrored glass on the floor br Jerry hunts down Ed and turns him into a vampire then Ed proceeds to visit Peter and tries to attack him only to be warded off when burned by a crucifix to the forehead Meanwhile Jerry chases Charley and Amy into a nightclub While Charley tries to call the police Jerry hypnotizes and abducts Amy who resembles Jerry s lost love and bites her With nowhere left to turn Charley attempts to gain Peter s help once more A frightened Peter initially refuses but then reluctantly resumes his vampire killer role Entering Jerry s house the two are able to repel Jerry using a crucifix though only Charley s works since he has faith in its spiritual power Billy appears and knocks Charley over the banister while Peter flees to Charley s house There he is surprised by Ed who attacks him in the form of a wolf only to be pierced through the heart with a broken table leg held by Peter Removing the stake from Ed s body Peter goes to rescue Charley and battle Jerry br Charley is locked in with Amy who is slowly transforming into a vampire Peter frees him before she awakens and says the process can be reversed if they destroy Jerry before dawn Billy confronts Charley and Peter and is revealed to be undead They destroy Billy who melts into goo and sand Peter is able to lure the overconfident Jerry in front of a window using a crucifix which now works due to his renewed faith in its abilities As the sun rises Jerry transforms into a bat and attacks Peter and Charley before fleeing to his coffin in the basement Charley and Peter pursue Jerry the latter breaks open Jerry s coffin and tries to stake him through the heart while Charley fights off Amy who has almost completed her transformation By breaking the blacked out windows in the basement Peter and Charley expose Jerry to the sunlight destroying him and returning Amy to her human form br A few nights later Peter returns to his Fright Night TV series and announces a hiatus from vampires presenting a film about alien invaders instead Charley and Amy watch the program as they embrace in bed Charley gets up to turn off the TV and glimpses glowing red eyes in Jerry s now vacant house but dismisses them As Charley and Amy resume kissing in bed the glowing eyes return before Ed laughs and says Oh you re so cool Brewster br br br Cast br br Nick Savage and Ernie Holmes portray the bouncers killed by Jerry Playboy Playmate Heidi Sorenson also appears as a prostitute one of Jerry s victims br br br Production br br br Development br While writing the script for Cloak Dagger Tom Holland amused himself when he conceived the idea of a horror movie fan becoming convinced that his next door neighbor was a vampire but he did not initially think this premise was enough to sustain a story What s he gonna do Holland asked because everybody s gonna think he s mad The story percolated in his mind for a year and finally one day while discussing it with John Byers then the head of story department at Columbia Pictures he finally figured out what the boy would do Of course he s gonna go to Vincent Price In that era many local TV stations in the United States had horror hosts such as Zacherle Svengoolie and the nationally syndicated Elvira so Holland decided it would be natural for the boy to seek aid from his local host The minute I had Peter Vincent I had the story Charley Brewster was the engine but Peter Vincent was the heart Once he d conceived that character Holland knocked out the first draft of the script in three weeks And I was laughing the entire time literally on the floor kicking my feet in the air in hysterics br Holland wrote the film for himself to direct in part because he was so disheartened by the film that was ultimately made from his previous screenplay Scream for Help and he had developed enough clout from the successes of his screenplays for Class of Psycho II and Cloak Dagger that the head of Columbia Pictures said Let s take a chance on the hot screenwriter kid not figuring that Fright Night would be as successful as it ultimately became br br br Casting br The Peter Vincent character was named after horror icons Peter Cushing and Vincent Price and Holland specifically wrote the part for Price but at this point in his career Price had been so badly typecast that he had stopped accepting roles in horror movies Guy McElwaine then the head of Columbia Pictures suggested Roddy McDowall for the part McDowall had already starred in the Holland penned film Class of so Holland was immediately receptive to the suggestion He understood the part commented Holland and he also understood what he could do with it and he really wanted it McDowall was particularly interested in the genesis of the character In the film I perform as being in my late s or early s in the film clips of my old movies all the way up to my s when I m the washed up has been McDowall adding that the role interested him because I d never played anything that old Holland and McDowall built a lasting friendship and McDowall eventually invited Holland to a dinner party where he introduced him to Vincent Price who was flattered that the part was an homage to him and commented that the film was wonderful and he thought Roddy did a wonderful job br Chris Sarandon s agent gave him a copy of the script and he replied there s no way I can do a horror movie but he decided to give the script a once over and was immediately captivated by it I thought this is one of the best scripts I ve read in a long time Sarandon said beautifully constructed it was obvious that this was a labor of love it was clear that the writer director s approach to it was one of wanting to have fun with the genre without making fun of it the characters were beautifully drawn Sarandon was worried about being typecast as a villain but the script resonated with him because the story was deeper than just an average monster movie Forgetting about vampirism what this film is about on one level is an older man trying to take a younger man s girl away from him commented Holland Although he liked the screenplay Sarandon was still leery of working with a first time director so he flew to Los Angeles to meet Tom Holland and producer Herb Jaffe Holland and he had an immediate rapport and went on to make several more films together and Sarandon was awed that Holland had the film so completely mapped out that he literally described the movie shot by shot all the way through page by page scene by scene It was basically the way he shot it br Jonathan Stark was not a fan of vampire films but he also liked the script The Billy Cole character was written as a hulking giant so Stark padded himself with extra clothing when he went in to audition At auditions he read the scene in which he is being questioned by the detective which was written to be played straight I m thinking if I m sitting there being evil Stark commented the lieutenant s gonna get suspicious Why not throw him off the trail by being funny Holland liked his take on the character and Stark was told that he had the part but because he came in to read at the start of the audition process months passed before filming commenced and Stark worried that he had lost the role The gap worked to his advantage however because it gave him time to hit the gym and bulk up so he would not have to wear padding in the film br William Ragsdale had auditioned to portray Rocky Dennis in Mask but he lost the role to Eric Stoltz Casting director Jackie Burch remembered his audition though and thought he would be right to portray Charley Brewster Ragsdale auditioned several times and ultimately received the news that he had landed the part on Halloween night beating out several other future stars like Charlie Sheen br Due to a mix up Stephen Geoffreys had an awkward audition for Anthony Michael Hall s role in Weird Science and he made an indelible impression on Jackie Burch who suggested him for Fright Night Although he was not a horror movie fan Geoffreys loved the script so he called his agent and emphatically declared that he would love to audition for Charley Brewster No Steve his agent replied you re wanted for the part of Evil Ed Geoffreys was simultaneously baffled and heartbroken What do they see in me that they think I should be this well anyway it worked out br The most difficult role to cast was Amy Peterson There wasn t the perfect girl next door until Amanda Bearse walked in Holland commented br br br Pre production br Once his cast was in place Holland got input from each of the actors and made numerous revisions to the script Some were slight and others were major such as the ending which originally featured Peter Vincent transforming into a vampire as he returned to host Fright Night The September draft of the screenplay which is circulating online is very close to the final cut of the film but a few more changes were still to come br The cast and crew were given the luxury of having two weeks of rehearsal time in late November prior to filming Holland blocked out the scenes on a soundstage and the cast performed the entire film like it was a stage play Having begun his career as a classically trained actor Holland encouraged the cast to write biographies of their characters so they would completely understand their motivations and be able to draw on that information while filming their scenes All of the kinks in the story performances were ironed out during the rehearsal period so when time to film came Holland only shot two or three takes of each scene and then moved on br As originally written Jerry Dandrige was more villainous so Sarandon tried to find various ways to humanize the vampire including suggesting the implication that the Amy character was the reincarnation of his long lost love I wanted to give the audience something to hold onto in terms of understanding that this was someone who was at one time and still is in certain respects a thinking feeling human being Sarandon said This is a man who has been hunted for all his post human existence but who has fallen in love a number of times and who in a sense longs for a normal existence Sarandon also did research into bats and discovered that most of the world s bat populations are frugivores so he concluded Jerry had a lot of fruit bat in his DNA This explains why his character is frequently munching on apples which Sarandon decided his character was using to cleanse his palate after draining blood from his victims br Stark and Sarandon had not picked up on Holland s intended gay subtext when they were developing their characters I didn t have any sense of it as being anything other than Renfield and Dracula Chris Sarandon recalled I think there was sort of an asexual quality to the relationship that was sort of borderline homoerotic but not in the sense that it was creepy For the scene in which Jerry pulls down the window shade and it looks as though Billy is about to perform oral sex on him Stark remembered I m cleaning his hand and Tom Holland said No get down on your knees Okay Tom Then when I saw the film I thought Oooooh okay br McDowall also did a lot of work on his character and made a conscious decision to pattern his performance after the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz My part is that of an old ham actor I mean a dreadful actor He realizes it but doesn t admit it He had a moderate success in an isolated film here and there but all very bad product This poor sonofabitch just played the same character all the time which was awful And then he disappeared from sight years beforehand He s been peddling these movies to late night TV various syndicated markets he d go six months in Iowa six months in Podunk McDowall commented to Fangoria He s got such a sad life he s sort of cowardly and then he finds his strength as a human being Despite the pathetic character he was portraying McDowall was a pillar for the cast and crew He was a kind of Yoda on the set commented Sarandon Recalled Ragsdale He had his videocamera on his shoulder and he was shooting like family movies the whole time br Sarandon recalled that Holland collaborated with choreographer Dorain Grusman in shooting a disco dance scene to have Bearse s character physically changing so that she goes from this rather dewey innocent looking girl to this femme fatale she kind of grows up right before your eyes The scene also established Amy discovering Jerry actually was a vampire br br br Filming br Principal photography commenced on December and wrapped on February At the time of production Fright Night was Columbia s lowest budgeted film and they did not have high expectations for it so they were focusing all of their attention on the John Travolta Jamie Lee Curtis film Perfect which they were certain was going to be a blockbuster They never even came to the set Holland said I was left alone It was totally my film without studio interference br A few mishaps did occur during filming including an incident in which Ragsdale broke his ankle while running down a staircase The schedule had to be reorganized but filming continued Nobody panicked In fact I think that the thing I ll remember most about this movie is everyone s spirit and humor The cast and crew seemed to meld with a singular vision of making the best movie possible Early in production Holland invited Fangoria writer Abbie Bernstein to visit the set as often as she liked and she took him up on his offer Of the wrap party in March Bernstein wrote It s fun and pleasant but it lacks the intense camaraderie of the set br br br Make up and visual effects br Richard Edlund was the head of visual effects and his team had just completed work on Ghostbusters which worked to the advantage of Fright Night They had made all of their mistakes with how to do the matte shots and everything on Ghostbusters with their huge budget Holland commented so they really knew how to do the special effects as inexpensively and efficiently as it could be done at the time br The most excruciating part of the makeup process for the cast was the contact lenses In those days the lenses were hard plastic which Steve Johnson hand painted throwing some glitter into the mix lacquered and sanded The cast could only wear them for a maximum of minutes because they were virtually blind in them and they were thick and painful and dried out their eyes A set was made for Stark to wear when he was in his final pursuit of Peter and Charley but he kept tripping on the stairs Holland told him to take one out and he was then able to perform the scene Three sets were made for Amanda Bearse but one of them caused her agonizing pain which she initially tried to endure When it finally became too much to bear she took the contacts out and the crew realized they had forgotten to buff them For the scene in Mrs Brewster s bedroom Geoffreys kept his contacts in for nearly minutes resulting in scratches on his eyeballs for months afterward br For the transformation sequences up to hours were needed to prepare Sarandon s makeup Sarandon was uncomfortable spending that long sitting in a chair doing nothing and since he had experience doing his own makeup for his work on the stage he volunteered to help He did some of the stippling and while the makeup men were applying prosthetics to his face and head he worked on the finger extensions Sarandon has often joked that the rubber fingers caused difficulties whenever he had to urinate so costume supervisor Mort Schwartz constantly offered to help him I said to Morry Thank you no I ll just use a coat hanger Co star Ragsdale recalled one instance when Sarandon spent an entire day in the makeup chair and when he was finally fully transformed into the monster a producer informed him that they were not going to be able to shoot the scene that day And Chris said Okay and turned around and went and took it off it was amazing Ragsdale exclaimed I would have gone through the roof but he didn t His will had been broken by that point br The makeup for Evil Ed s wolf transformation took hours While he had the wolf head on the crew began pouring what they thought was methylcellulose into his mouth to create the illusion of saliva but when Geoffreys began to complain about the taste Mark Bryan Wilson realized they had been using prosthetic adhesive which was gluing his mouth shut br On Christmas Eve during the shooting of a scene where he is running down a staircase Ragsdale accidentally tripped and broke his ankle resulting in the film being temporarily put on a hold until he could recover Rod Martin a trainer for the Los Angeles Raiders came in every day to wrap the foot for me and the shooting schedule was rearranged to put off the action sequences until it mended said Ragsdale Many scenes were shot with his foot in a cast including the scene in which Jerry comes to Charley s room to attack him For shots in which Charley s feet were visible the costumers slit Ragsdale s shoes in several places slipped them on and then covered the portions of white cast that peeked through the slits with black cloth For the scene in which Jerry is carrying Charley by the throat with one hand Sarandon was simultaneously pushing Ragsdale along on a furniture dolly br The shot of Jerry pulling the pencil out of his hand was achieved by having a spring loaded collapsible pencil glued to his palm and an eraser tip loosely attached to the back of his hand When he turns his hand and pulls the spring loaded piece from his palm out of shot a monofilament wire jerked away the tip so when he turns it back it appears as though he has pulled it straight through his hand So we go to the editing room FX man Steve Johnson recalled of an early cut and Tom had put a reaction in the middle of it ruined the entire shot br The crew attempted to achieve the illusion of the cross scar vanishing from Evil Ed s forehead live on set but the effect was a resounding failure In that predigital age Edlund s crew was able to alter the film using optical photography to achieve the effect br Filming of the sequence with the bat was difficult for effects veteran Randall Cook who kept winding up on film while puppeteering the creature Further complications ensued when the bat tries to bite Roddy McDowall s character and he forces a bone into its mouth getting the puppet to bite was difficult and then McDowall jerked the bone too hard and broke the bat s skull The bat was quickly patched but the required repairs forced them to wait two days to shoot more close ups br One of the props used in the film was an early or possibly the first example of a vampire killing kit br br br Soundtrack br br The original track soundtrack album was released on LP and cassette in by Private I Records A promotional music video for the title song by J Geils Band was made which used many clips from the film and received minor airplay on MTV An instrumental version of Brad Fiedel s Come to Me was prominently featured throughout the movie but the version on the album includes lyrics sung by Fiedel instrumental versions were later issued on the CD with Fiedel s score a different version which includes an additional verse was recorded by Deborah Holland for the end credits of Fright Night Part The album was officially reissued in December on CD format by

vampire br Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three stars out of four and wrote Fright Night is not a distinguished movie but it has a lot of fun being undistinguished Variety praised Sarandon s performance writing that he is terrific as the vampire quite affable and debonair until his fingernails start to grow and his eyes get that glow Colin Greenland gave a negative review for White Dwarf stating We may be justified in suspecting that a film which has such contempt for its characters has contempt for its audience too br br br Accolades br br br Home media br The original

Night producer Herb Jaffe retained the screen rights to the characters and pushed for a sequel to be made The resulting film Fright Night Part was released in December br Although he was unhappy that the budget was drastically slashed Holland was interested but Sarandon and he were both tied up making Child s Play and could not commit to the film though director Tommy Lee Wallace sought out Holland for advice and Sarandon visited the set while they were shooting Stephen Geoffreys was approached to reprise the role of Evil Ed but he did not like the script and he was offered the lead in EVIL which was scheduled to shoot at the same time so he opted to take that part instead Bearse read an early draft of the script that included the Amy character but she was busy with her TV series Married with Children so a new girlfriend portrayed by Traci Lind was written for Charley Brewster In the end only Ragsdale and McDowall reprised their roles and a new set of villains was devised br br br Remake br In May DreamWorks first announced that it would be overseeing a remake of Fright Night which came to fruition and was released in with the same title Fright Night The script penned by Buffy the Vampire Slayer alumna Marti Noxon loosely followed the plot of the original film Charley Anton Yelchin and his mother Toni Collette are transplanted from Corvalis Iowa to a Las Vegas suburb Amy Imogen Poots is feistier and sexually aggressive Evil Ed Christopher Mintz Plasse has endured a falling out with Charley prior to the start of the film Peter Vincent David Tennant is a horror magician modeled after Criss Angel the Billy Cole character was omitted and Jerry Dandrige Colin Farrell is no longer the lovelorn vampire He was described by Evil Ed as the fucking shark from Jaws and has different intentions for his victims br Sarandon was offered a role in the remake and chose to pass on the torch by doing a cameo as a man who is eaten by Jerry Dandrige Sarandon pointed out It s not the original and they didn t set out to make the original but the cast and crew of the remake were all huge fans Farrell had watched the film countless times during his youth and publicly stated I heard they were remaking Fright Night and went Ah god remake Hollywood so dull And I read the script and really hoped I didn t like it and I did Recalled Sarandon of his first encounter with Farrell He walked in and he literally was almost shaking he was so excited at the prospect of meeting his childhood idol He gave me a beautiful bottle of wine and a DVD set of the Carl Dreyer Vampyr It was a really graceful and wonderful introduction br During a reunion panel discussion at Monsterpalooza in the cast of the original film discussed the remake at length Bearse commented as a stand alone horror movie it was very well done It didn t lessen the appeal of the original It was just more of a one note film Geoffreys only watched the first minutes and then turned it off Stark and Ragsdale went to a screening and discovered they were the only two people in attendance Ragsdale liked an early draft of the screenplay but he was not particularly enamored with the final result and was perplexed that there was kind of a nastiness to the Evil Ed character The discussion dragged on for so long that the audience roared with laughter when Sarandon sarcastically interrupted Ragsdale to declare I m sure there are some other questions about the original Fright Night br When asked his thoughts in creator Tom Holland replied Kudos to them on every level for their professionalism but they forgot the humor and the heart They should have called it something other than Fright Night because it had no more than a passing resemblance to the original What they did to Jerry Dandrige and Peter Vincent was criminal Smiling he added Outside of that it was wonderful br br br Potential direct sequel br From all accounts McDowall relished playing Peter Vincent and was eager to bring Holland back to the franchise so he had set up a meeting for Holland and himself with Carolco Pictures chairman Jos Men ndez to discuss making Fright Night Part However before that meeting could occur Men ndez and his wife were murdered by their sons Lyle and Erik This stopped another sequel and also interfered with the release of Fright Night Part which attained extremely limited theatrical distribution before being dumped on home video by Carolco s subsidiary Live Entertainment br In January Tom Holland announced that he was writing a Fright Night novel noting that by he would obtain the rights to the franchise after which he plans to develop a third movie br In October Holland said that he was writing a direct sequel to the original Fright Night with the working title of Fright Night Resurrection He said I m bringing back everybody I can I m calling it Resurrection because we ve got to resurrect Billy Cole and Jerry Dandridge Holland went on to say Part of the issue with the attempts at sequels and remakes is that the movie itself was kind of a singular idea and a follow up needed to be more than just set in the same world it needed to draw from the same set of inspirations and follow a similar thematic thread br br br In other media br br br Comic books br Between and NOW Comics published Fright Night comic books The original film was adapted as the first two issues of the series Fright Night Part was adapted as a stand alone graphic novel which was not canonical with the series and the rest of the issues consisted of original stories following the
