Later is set for release in br br A highly contagious aggression inducing virus called the rage virus is unleashed in Great Britain after an infected chimpanzee is freed from its cage in a laboratory in Cambridge by a group of animal rights activists Within seconds of exposure after freeing the enraged chimp one of the activists succumbs to the virus and immediately infects another Over the following hours and days it spreads rapidly and becomes an epidemic resulting in total societal collapse br Twenty eight days after the initial outbreak bicycle courier Jim who had an accident and fell into a coma prior to the outbreak awakens in St Thomas Hospital in London which has been completely deserted with visible signs of catastrophe After wandering the streets of London and entering a church Jim is chased by infected humans before being rescued by survivors Selena and Mark who take Jim to their place of refuge in a streetside store At Jim s request the group travel on foot to his parents house in Deptford where he learns that they died by suicide leaving a note in which they prayed he did not wake up The group decide it is too late to return to their place of refuge and stay the night While the others are asleep Jim lights a candle to reminisce over photos and memories of his family in so doing accidentally attracting the infected with the light Shortly thereafter Mark gets an open wound on his arm which is exposed to infected blood during an attack prompting Selena to immediately kill him before he can turn br Jim and Selena encounter cab driver Frank and his daughter Hannah at Balfron Tower from whom they learn of a military broadcast offering protection at a blockade in Manchester With supplies dwindling Frank asks Jim and Selena to accompany him and Hannah to the blockade which they accept The group travels to Manchester in Frank s cab but upon arriving they find the blockade deserted As the group struggles to plot their next move Frank is infected when a drop of blood falls into his eye The soldiers arrive shortly afterwards and shoot Frank dead br The remaining survivors are brought to a fortified mansion under the command of Major Henry West However the safety promised by the soldiers turns out to be a ruse when West reveals to Jim that the broadcast was intended to lure female survivors into sexual slavery Major West has Jim and Sergeant Farrell taken out to be shot after they refuse to go along with his plan but Jim escapes after Farrell creates a distraction While hiding in a pile of bodies Jim sees a jet contrail in the sky showing proof of outside survivors for the first time After luring West away from the mansion Jim releases Private Mailer an infected soldier kept chained for observations resulting in the death or infection of all of West s men Jim Selena and Hannah attempt to leave in Frank s cab but West who sneaked into the back seat shoots Jim Hannah retaliates by putting the cab in reverse allowing Mailer to pull West through the rear window and kill him while the three survivors drive off br Another twenty eight days later Jim recovers at a remote cottage in Cumbria where the infected are shown lying openly in the roads emaciated and dying of starvation As a Finnish fighter jet flies overhead Jim Selena and Hannah unfurl a huge cloth banner spelling the word HELLO The three

Stoppani and Jukka Hiltunen portray the animal liberation activists while David Schneider portrays a scientist at the laboratory Christopher Dunne and Emma Hitching appear as Jim s parents Toby Sedgwick plays an infected priest encountered by Jim br On the DVD commentary Boyle explains that with the aim of preserving the suspension of disbelief relatively unknown actors were cast in the film Cillian Murphy had starred primarily in small independent films while Naomie Harris had acted on British television as a child and Megan Burns had only one previous film credit However Christopher Eccleston and Brendan Gleeson were well known character actors br br Early influences on Garland included the George Romero films Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead which he loved as a child but said that he had largely forgotten about the zombie genre until he played the video game Resident Evil which reminded him how much he loved zombies after having not really encountered zombies for quite a while Boyle liked Garland s screenplay for a proposed zombie film having directed the film adaptation of Garland s novel The Beach br Producer Andrew Macdonald had access to funding from the National Lottery and pitched it to Universal Pictures who declined to support it Budget constraints proved to be an issue with Christopher Eccleston having to take an emergency pay cut br On the DVD commentary Boyle and Garland frequently call it a post apocalyptic and horror film commenting on scenes that were quotation of George A Romero s Dead trilogy During the initial marketing of the film Boyle tried to distance the film from such labels Boyle identified John Wyndham s The Day of the Triffids as Garland s original inspiration for the story br Five months after the film was released in Europe video game publisher NovaLogic hosted a graffiti competition in a cross promotion with the game Devastation The connection was mainly due to the similar theme of a devastated world The prizes consisted of signed screenplays and posters along with DVDs For the zombies Boyle took inspiration from real life diseases like Ebola along with aspects of rabies James McAvoy auditioned for a role as a zombie br br The film features scenes set in normally bustling parts of London such as Westminster Bridge Piccadilly Circus Horse Guards Parade and Oxford Street To depict these locations as desolate the film crew closed off sections of street for minutes at a time usually in early morning before sunrise on Sundays They typically had around minutes after dawn to shoot the locations devoid of traffic and members of the public Portions of the film were shot on a Canon XL digital video DV camera DV cameras are much smaller and more manoeuvrable than traditional film cameras which would have been impractical on such brief shoots The scenes of the M motorway devoid of traffic were also filmed within limited periods A mobile police roadblock slowed traffic sufficiently to leave a long section of carriageway empty while the scene was filmed The section of the motorway depicted in the film is near Milton Keynes Buckinghamshire around miles southeast of Manchester br For the London scene in which Jim walks by the overturned double decker bus the film crew placed the bus on its side and removed it when the shot was finished all within minutes The crew had asked permission to place the bus outside Downing Street but Westminster City Council ordered them to place it elsewhere When they arrived at am and nobody from the council was present they placed it outside Downing Street anyway br The September th attacks took place during filming Boyle notes the parallel between the missing persons flyers seen at the beginning of the film and similar flyers posted in New York City in the wake of the attacks Boyle said his crew probably would not have been granted permission to close off Whitehall for filming after the terrorist attacks The production team hired an optometrist to supervise with the red contact lenses needed for cast members playing the infected br The mansion used in the film was Trafalgar Park near Salisbury Many rooms including the Cipriani painted music room and the main hall were filmed with minimal set decoration The scenes set upstairs were filmed downstairs as the mansion s owner resided upstairs The old ruins used as the setting for an idyllic interlude in their journey to Manchester were those of Waverley Abbey Surrey The end scenes of the film with Jim Selena and Hannah living in a rural cottage were filmed around Ennerdale in Cumbria br At a certain point Macdonald announced to the crew that the production had run out of money Filming ceased without a closing sequence being shot After pitching several different ideas for an ending and the original ending which featured Jim s death tested badly with audiences the studio granted more funding to film the ending scene that was eventually used The crew organised for a real jet to fly overhead for them to film as this was cheaper than approximately for a computer generated one br br The DVD extras include three alternative endings all of which conclude with Jim dying One of these was filmed which involved Jim dying of his gunshot wounds In another the outbreak is revealed to be a dream The third a more radical departure was presented only in storyboards instead of Frank being killed by soldiers after being infected the other survivors tie him up and discover a research laboratory at the blockade where Jim undergoes a blood transfusion in order to save Frank The U S cinematic release included one of the alternative endings after the film s credits in response to intense online debates over whether or not it was a more appropriate conclusion than the official ending br br The film s score was composed by John Murphy and was released in a score song compilation in The score features electric guitar and atmospheric electronic production It also features notable tracks from Brian Eno Grandaddy and Blue States br A heavily edited version of the track East Hastings by the post rock band Godspeed You Black Emperor appears in the film but the track is excluded from the soundtrack because Boyle could only obtain the rights to use it in the film br Days Later The Soundtrack Album was released on June A modified version of the soundtrack In The House In A Heartbeat was used as the character Big Daddy s theme in the film Kick Ass The same song was played in the advertisement campaign of Louis Vuitton L Invitation au Voyage In the song was remixed to include the theme of The Terminator by Brad Fiedel for the second trailer of Terminator Dark Fate and also eventually again remixed and used in the video game Metro Exodus br br Days Later was a considerable success at the box office and became highly profitable on a budget of about million In the UK it took in million while in the US it became a surprise hit

critics for Time Out magazine ranked it the th best British film ever br br Days Later had an impact on horror films and was credited with starting a revival for the zombie genre along with the Resident Evil franchise The remake of Dawn of the Dead for example was influenced by Days Later Days Later was followed by other infection films such as Shaun of the Dead Black Sheep Planet Terror Dead Snow and Zombieland as well as books such as World War Z Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and Warm Bodies and zombie themed graphic novels and television shows such as The Walking Dead The zombie revival trend lasted for more than a decade after Days Later before eventually declining in popularity by the late s br During the COVID pandemic images of a national lockdown in the United Kingdom and stay at home orders elsewhere were compared to the opening sequence of Days Later In Megan Burns said of the film When I joined the cast of Days Later I had no idea of how big a cultural impact it would have and what a game changer it would be to the zombie genre Even now after all these years or perhaps especially now with the current situation people want to talk about the film and that s
