Star Trek Beyond was released on Digital HD on October and on Ultra HD Blu ray Blu ray and DVD on November br br br Reception br br br Box office br Star Trek Beyond underperformed financially at the box office Scott Mendelson of Forbes observed that one factor contributing to the film s underperformance was its untimely release in a crowded summer in which it was surrounded by other films like Ghostbusters Jason Bourne and Suicide Squad He also noted that had Paramount released the film for the Star Trek s th anniversary on September the film could have benefited from that occasion as demonstrated in October when MGM released the James Bond film Skyfall which went on to gross over billion for that series th anniversary br Star Trek Beyond grossed million in the United States and Canada and million in other countries for a worldwide total of million against a production budget of million It had a global opening of million and an IMAX opening of million on IMAX screens Industry analyst Danny Cox had previously estimated that in order for the film to break even it would have to earn million worldwide and ended losing an estimated million br br br North America br In the United States and Canada the film was projected to gross million from theaters in its opening weekend It opened alongside Ice Age Collision Course and Lights Out but critics noted that the film did

mild in comparison to other sequels of and is still considered a hit It dropped precipitously by on its second Friday and was overtaken by newcomer spy film Jason Bourne earning million By comparison Star Trek dropped on its first Friday while Star Trek into Darkness fell However this was not the worst Friday to Friday drop for a Star Trek film as Star Trek Nemesis plunged on its second Friday due to negative word of mouth and heavy competition from The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers br By the second and third weekend following the film s release box office revenue continued to drop significantly due to the release of competing films like Jason Bourne and Suicide Squad br br br Outside North America br Internationally the film received a scattered release pattern and was released

results in the UK and Russia it grossed an estimated weekend of million on screens besting Star Trek Into Darkness million debut In its second weekend it fell drastically by earning million As a result it slipped into sixth place at the box office After fluctuating up and down the charts it finally topped the international box office in its seventh weekend due to a robust debut in China and

solid it was edged out by the family film The BFG Its million million opening from theaters is the lowest among the rebooted series and a decline from the million million opening posted by Star Trek Into Darkness if previews are deducted The Guardian cited J J Abrams s departure as the director and fans unenthusiastic response to Idris Elba as the villain in comparison to Benedict Cumberbatch in Star Trek Into Darkness as some possible reasons why the film failed to generate lucrative revenue The site also projected a total gross of around million million for the film br It opened in China on

scale down from the first two films A br Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film stars out of and said Even with its big screen pyrotechnics and its feature length running time Star Trek Beyond plays like an extended version of one of the better episodes from the original series and I mean that in the best possible way Scott Collura of IGN awarded the film describing it as being terrific a fun and exciting entry in the series that balances subtle fan service while also feeling fresh and modern Star Trek Beyond is the perfect way to celebrate the series th anniversary David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said the screenplay by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung injects a welcome strain of humor that s true to the original Gene Roddenberry creation delivering nostalgia without stiff veneration and went on by saying While Beyond won t unseat s thrilling The Wrath of Khan as the gold standard for Star Trek movies it s a highly entertaining entry guaranteed to give the franchise continuing life Owen Gleiberman of Variety in an otherwise positive review described the film being a very familiar old fangled no mystery structure and that s because it s basically the Star Trek version of an interplanetary action film with a plot that doesn t take you to many new frontiers Furthermore he called Star Trek Beyond a somewhat diverting place holder but one hopes that the next Star Trek movie will have what it takes to boldly go where no Star Trek movie has gone before Mark Hugues of Forbes said Star Trek Beyond is the third best Star Trek film of all time creating the sort of emotional connection and familiar powerful characterizations we loved in the original series while delivering top notch action and the best Star Trek movie villain since First Contact s Borg Queen br The film was also met by critics who were less taken with the film James Berardinelli of Reelviews gave stars out of writing Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie although not an especially good one The action sequences are frenetic kinetic and at times incoherent This isn t unexpected it s Lin s trademark But the plot credited to Simon Pegg Doug Jung is pure Trek Unfortunately it s also instantly forgettable Dave Robinson of outlet Crash Landed writes that Star Trek Beyond fails to push beyond its own roots and becomes just another very safe sci fi popcorn movie in an increasingly crowded market that will likely have you leaving the theatre feeling exactly as you entered Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C and wrote w ith Beyond it feels like just another summer tentpole with not enough going on underneath the tent br George Takei the actor who played Hikaru Sulu in The Original Series criticised the decision by the writers to make the character gay The actor said I m delighted that there s a gay character unfortunately it s a twisting of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry s creation into which he put so much thought I think it s really unfortunate Takei claimed this would make Sulu appear to have been closeted and he requested instead for a new character to be introduced Simon Pegg responded by saying the move was intended as a tribute to George Takei s status as an LGBT activist br br br Accolades br br br Sequel br br While promoting Beyond Abrams revealed that a fourth film in the reboot series would see Chris Hemsworth reprising his role of George Kirk father of Pine s James T Kirk from the prologue of the first reboot film Paramount Pictures officially announced the fourth film in July with J D
