recorder the doorknob on the locked basement door where Malcolm s office is located the shirt that Anna wears at the restaurant Kyra s mother s dress at the wake and the shawl wrapped around the sleeping Anna br All the clothes Malcolm wears are items he wore or touched the evening before his death including his overcoat his blue rowing sweatshirt and the different layers of his suit Though the filmmakers were careful about clues of Malcolm s true state the camera zooms slowly towards his face when Cole says I see dead people The filmmakers initially feared this would be too much of a
