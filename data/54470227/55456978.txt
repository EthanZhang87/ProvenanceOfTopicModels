average assigned the season a score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews br In a positive review RogerEbert com s Nick Allen praised the series saying Expertly plotted by creators Carlton Cuse and Graham Roland Tom Clancy s Jack Ryan is all the more impactful for its restraint and scope offering excellent character based drama that s concerned with much more than just its namesake Similarly favorable The Gazette s Terry Terrones awarded the series a grade of A and directed specific approval towards Krasinski s performance saying This version of Jack Ryan is relatable but also admirable because the actor portraying him can balance so many aspects of the character with ease Krasinski plays him so naturally I couldn t tell where he ended and Ryan began In

confident and thorough That s enough to get the job done br In a more mixed assessment TVLine s Dave Nemetz gave the series a grade of C and offered the series restrained commendation saying Amazon s awkwardly titled Tom Clancy s Jack Ryan is at its best when things are exploding delivering a number of impressively high octane action sequences on a scale rarely seen on television The rest of the series though is disappointingly mediocre and its choice of leading man may be a major stumbling block In a negative critique Vanity Fair s Sonia Saraiya chastised the show saying Tom Clancy s Jack Ryan is hysterical Hysterical as in histrionic hysterical as in somehow funny hysterical as in you wish its team had worked harder to take the temperature of the world around us before sending this highly charged and obscenely blinkered James Bond manqu into the world Equally dismissive Paste s Amy Amatangelo criticized the series saying But more often than not the show plods along with no real sense of urgency I often had to restrain myself from scrolling through my phone I was that bored while I was watching Those indoctrinated into the Jack Ryan canon via the books or the movies will find the eight episode series is faithful to the spirit of all that preceded it I m just not sure we needed it at all br The series has been criticized for a scene in the episode Black in which a character uses the word tranny LGBT activist Eliel Cruz alleged that the scene treats a major cause of violence against trans women as a throwaway joke Similarly the series has also received criticism in French publications for its depiction of the country specifically in the episodes French Connection and Black where various scenes have been condemned St phanie Guerrin of Le Parisien expressed her concern for the dialogue spoken by and about the French saying This series of dangerously caricatural comments leaves one wondering Le Point s Bastien Haugel specifically took grievance in an otherwise positive review with the portrayal of a French policeman who espoused anti Muslim views calling it dangerously caricatural br br br Season br Previews of season two in which Ryan ends up on a mission to Venezuela to bring stability to a country on the brink of collapse has been criticized by the government of Venezuela for allegedly promoting an invasion of the country by the United States Venezuela s Minister of Cultural Affairs Ernesto Villegas described previews of the show as Crass war propaganda disguised as entertainment Venezuelan actor Francisco Denis who plays Ubarri a senior Venezuelan government official in the new season responded to his government s criticism by highlighting the fictional character of the series I don t think the CIA needs a show like this to intervene or not in a country he said Denis did regret that the series has included mistakes such as the fictitious meeting of the Venezuelan president with the CIA which in his opinion would never occur under the current administrations or presenting the most powerful man in the country as basking in luxury br On Rotten Tomatoes the season holds an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating
