death in shaping the magazine s editorial tone and standards br Although its reviews and events listings often focused on the cultural life of New York City The New Yorker gained a reputation for publishing serious fiction essays and journalism for a national and international audience featuring works by notable authors such as Truman Capote Vladimir Nabokov and Alice Munro In the late th and early st centuries The New Yorker adapted to the digital era maintaining its traditional print operations while expanding its online presence including making its archives available on the Internet

along with The Atlantic and Harper s Magazine ranked highest in college educated readership among major American media outlets It has won eight Pulitzer Prizes since the first year magazines became eligible for the prize br br The New Yorker was founded by Harold Ross and his wife Jane Grant a New York Times reporter and debuted on February Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably corny humor publications such as Judge where he had worked or the old Life Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H Fleischmann who founded the General Baking Company to establish the F R Publishing Company The magazine s first offices were at West th Street in Manhattan Ross edited the magazine until his death in During the early occasionally precarious years of its existence the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication Ross declared in a prospectus for the magazine It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque br Although the magazine never lost its touches of humor it soon established itself as a preeminent forum for serious fiction essays and journalism Shortly after the end of World War II John Hersey s essay Hiroshima filled an entire issue The magazine has published short stories by many of the most respected writers of the th and st centuries including Ann Beattie Sally Benson Maeve Brennan Truman Capote Rachel Carson John Cheever Roald Dahl Mavis Gallant Geoffrey Hellman Ernest Hemingway Stephen King Ruth McKenney John McNulty Joseph Mitchell Alice Munro Haruki Murakami Vladimir Nabokov John O Hara Dorothy Parker S J Perelman Philip Roth George Saunders J D Salinger Irwin Shaw James Thurber John Updike Eudora Welty and E B White Publication of Shirley Jackson s The Lottery drew more mail than any other story in the magazine s history In its early decades the magazine sometimes published two or even three short stories in an issue but in later years the pace has remained steady at one story per issue br The nonfiction feature articles usually the bulk of an issue cover an eclectic array of topics Subjects have included eccentric evangelist Creflo Dollar the different ways in which humans perceive the passage of time and M nchausen syndrome by proxy br The magazine is known for its editorial traditions Under the rubric Profiles it has published articles about prominent people such as Ernest Hemingway Henry R Luce and Marlon Brando Hollywood restaurateur Michael Romanoff magician Ricky Jay and mathematicians David and Gregory Chudnovsky Other enduring features have been Goings on About Town a listing of cultural and entertainment events in New York and The Talk of the Town a feuilleton or miscellany of brief pieces frequently humorous whimsical or eccentric vignettes of life in New York in a breezily light style although latterly the section often begins with a serious commentary For many years newspaper snippets containing amusing errors unintended meanings or badly mixed metaphors Block That Metaphor have been used as filler items accompanied by a witty retort There is no masthead listing the editors and staff Despite some changes the magazine has kept much of its traditional appearance over the decades in typography layout covers and artwork The magazine was acquired by Advance Publications the media company owned by Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr in for million when it was earning less than million a year br Ross was succeeded as editor by William Shawn followed by Robert Gottlieb and Tina Brown The current editor of The New Yorker is David Remnick who succeeded Brown in July br Among the important nonfiction authors who began writing for the magazine during Shawn s editorship were Dwight Macdonald Kenneth Tynan and Hannah Arendt whose Eichmann in Jerusalem reportage appeared in the magazine before it was published as a book br Brown s tenure attracted more controversy than Gottlieb s or even Shawn s thanks to her high profile Shawn by contrast had been an extremely shy introverted figure and to the changes she made to a magazine with a similar look for the previous half century She introduced color to the editorial pages several years before The New York Times and included photography with less type on each page and a generally more modern layout More substantively she increased the coverage of current events and topics such as celebrities and business tycoons and placed short pieces throughout Goings on About Town including a racy column about nightlife in Manhattan A letters to the editor page was introduced and authors bylines were added to their Talk of the Town pieces br Since the late s The New Yorker has used the Internet to publish current and archived material and maintains a website with some content from the

Brooklynite to The Chicagoan to and Paris s The Boulevardier to br Kurt Vonnegut said that The New Yorker has been an effective instrument for getting a large audience to appreciate modern literature Tom Wolfe wrote of the magazine The New Yorker style was one of leisurely meandering understatement droll when in the humorous mode tautological and litotical when in the serious mode constantly amplified qualified adumbrated upon nuanced and renuanced until the magazine s pale gray pages became High Baroque triumphs of the relative clause and appository modifier br Joseph Rosenblum reviewing Ben Yagoda s About Town a history of the magazine from to wrote The New Yorker did create its own universe As one longtime reader wrote to Yagoda this was a place where Peter DeVries sic was forever lifting a glass of Piesporter where Niccol Tucci in a plum velvet dinner jacket flirted in Italian with Muriel Spark where Nabokov sipped tawny port from a prismatic goblet while a Red Admirable perched on his pinky and where John Updike tripped over the master s Swiss shoes excusing himself charmingly br br New Yorker articles have been regular sources for motion pictures Both fiction and nonfiction pieces have been adapted for the big screen including the unreleased Coyote vs Acme based on Ian Frazier s article of the same name Spiderhead based on George Saunders s story Escape from Spiderhead Flash of Genius based on a true account of the invention of the intermittent windshield wiper by John Seabrook Away from Her adapted from Alice Munro s short story The Bear Came over the

Meet Me in St Louis both adapted from Sally Benson s short stories br br In its November issue the magazine endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time choosing Democratic nominee John Kerry over incumbent Republican George W Bush br br The New Yorker has featured cartoons usually gag cartoons since it began publication in For years its cartoon editor was Lee Lorenz who first began cartooning in and became a New Yorker contract contributor in After serving as the magazine s art editor from to when he was replaced by Fran oise Mouly he continued in the position of cartoon editor until His book The Art of the New Yorker Knopf was the first comprehensive survey of all aspects of the magazine s graphics In Robert Mankoff took over as cartoon editor and edited at least collections of New Yorker cartoons Mankoff also usually contributed a short article to each book describing some aspect of the cartooning process or the methods used to select cartoons for the magazine He left the magazine in br The New Yorker s stable of cartoonists has included many important talents in American humor including Charles Addams Peter Arno Charles Barsotti George Booth Roz Chast Tom Cheney Sam Cobean Leo Cullum Richard Decker Pia Guerra J B Handelsman Helen E Hokinson Pete Holmes Ed Koren Reginald Marsh Mary Petty George Price Charles Saxon Burr Shafer Otto Soglow William Steig Saul Steinberg James Stevenson James Thurber and Gahan Wilson br Many early New Yorker cartoonists did not caption their cartoons In his book The Years with Ross Thurber describes the newspaper s weekly art meeting where cartoons submitted over the previous week were brought up from the mail room to be looked over by Ross the editorial department and a number of staff writers Cartoons were often rejected or sent back to artists with requested amendments while others were accepted and captions were written for them Some artists hired their own writers Helen Hokinson hired James Reid Parker in Brendan Gill relates in his book Here at The New Yorker that at one point in the early s the quality of the artwork submitted to the magazine seemed to improve It later was found out that the office boy a teenaged Truman Capote had been acting as a volunteer art editor dropping pieces he did not like down the far end of his desk br Several of the magazine s cartoons have reached a higher plateau of fame One cartoon drawn by Carl Rose and captioned by E B White shows a mother telling her daughter It s broccoli dear The daughter responds I say it s spinach and I say the hell with it The phrase I say it s spinach entered the vernacular and three years later the Broadway musical Face the Music included Irving Berlin s song I Say It s Spinach And the Hell with It The catchphrase back to the drawing board originated with the Peter Arno cartoon showing an engineer walking away from a crashed plane saying Well back to the old drawing board br The most reprinted is Peter Steiner s drawing of two dogs at a computer with one saying On the Internet nobody knows you re a dog According to Mankoff Steiner and the magazine have split more than in fees paid for the licensing and reprinting of this single cartoon with more than half going to Steiner br Over seven decades many hardcover compilations of New Yorker cartoons have been published and in Mankoff edited The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker a page collection with of the magazine s best cartoons published during years plus a double CD set with all cartoons ever published in the magazine This features a search function allowing readers to search for cartoons by cartoonist s name or year of publication The newer group of cartoonists in recent years includes Pat Byrnes J C Duffy Liana Finck Emily Flake Robert Leighton Michael Maslin Julia Suits and P C Vey Will McPhail cited his beginnings as just ripping off Calvin and Hobbes Bill Watterson and doing little dot eyes The notion that some New Yorker cartoons have punchlines so oblique as to be impenetrable became a subplot in the Seinfeld episode The Cartoon as well as a playful jab in The Simpsons episode The Sweetest Apu br In April the magazine began using the last page of each issue for The New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest Captionless cartoons by The New Yorker s regular cartoonists are printed each week Captions are submitted by readers and three are chosen as finalists Readers then vote on the winner Anyone age or older can enter or vote Each contest winner receives a print of the cartoon with the winning caption signed by the artist who drew the cartoon In after Bob Mankoff left the magazine Emma Allen became the youngest and first female cartoon editor in the magazine s history br br Since the magazine has published occasional stories of comics journalism alternately called sketchbook reports by such cartoonists as Marisa Acocella Marchetto Barry Blitt Sue Coe Robert Crumb and Aline Kominsky Crumb Jules Feiffer Ben Katchor Carol Lay Gary Panter Art Spiegelman Mark Alan Stamaty and Ronald Wimberly br br In April The New Yorker launched a crossword puzzle series with a weekday crossword published every Monday Subsequently it launched a second weekend crossword that appears on Fridays and relaunched cryptic puzzles that were run in the magazine in the late s In June it began publishing new cryptics weekly In July The New Yorker introduced Name Drop a trivia game which is posted online weekdays In March The New Yorker moved to publishing online crosswords every weekday with decreasing difficulty Monday through Thursday and themed puzzles on Fridays The puzzles are written by a rotating stable of constructors They integrate cartoons into the solving experience The Christmas issue featured a crossword puzzle by Patrick Berry that had cartoons as clues with the answers being captions for the cartoons In December Liz Maynes Aminzade was named The New Yorker s first puzzles and games editor br br The magazine s first cover illustration a dandy peering at a butterfly through a monocle was drawn by Rea Irvin the magazine s first art editor based on an caricature of the then Count d Orsay that appeared as an illustration in the th edition of the Encyclop dia Britannica The gentleman on the original cover now known as Eustace Tilley is a character created for The New Yorker by Corey Ford The hero of a series titled The Making of a Magazine which began on the inside front cover of the August issue that first summer Tilley was a younger man than the figure on the original cover His top hat was of a newer style without the curved brim He wore a morning coat and striped formal trousers Ford borrowed Eustace Tilley s last name from an aunt he had always found it vaguely humorous Eustace was selected by Ford for euphony br The character has become a kind of mascot for The New Yorker frequently appearing in its pages and on promotional materials Traditionally Irvin s original Tilley cover illustration is used every year on the issue closest to the anniversary date of February though on several occasions a newly drawn variation has been substituted br br The magazine is known for its illustrated and often topical covers br br Saul Steinberg created covers and internal drawings and illustrations for the magazine His most famous work is probably its March cover an illustration most often called View of the World from th Avenue and sometimes called A Parochial New Yorker s View of the World or A New Yorker s View of the World which depicts a map of the world as seen by self absorbed New Yorkers br The illustration is split in two with the bottom half of the image showing Manhattan s th Avenue th Avenue and the Hudson River appropriately labeled and the top half depicting the rest of the world The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a square with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing Jersey the names of five cities Los Angeles Washington D C Las Vegas Kansas City and Chicago and three states Texas Utah and Nebraska scattered among a few rocks for the U S beyond New Jersey The Pacific Ocean perhaps half again as wide as the Hudson separates the U S from three flattened land masses labeled China Japan and Russia br The illustration humorously depicting New Yorkers self image of their place in the world or perhaps outsiders view of New Yorkers self image inspired many similar works including the poster for the film Moscow on the Hudson that movie poster led to a lawsuit Steinberg v Columbia Pictures Industries Inc F Supp S D N Y which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright that Steinberg held on his work br The cover was later satirized by Barry Blitt for the cover of The New Yorker on October The cover featured Sarah Palin looking out of her window seeing only Alaska with Russia in the far background br The March cover of The Economist How China sees the World is also an homage to the original image depicting the viewpoint from Beijing s Chang an Avenue instead of Manhattan br br Hired by Tina Brown in Art Spiegelman worked for The New Yorker for ten years but resigned a few months after the September terrorist attacks The cover created by Spiegelman and Fran oise Mouly for the September issue of The New Yorker received wide acclaim and was voted as being among the top ten magazine covers of the past years by the American Society of Magazine Editors which commented br br New Yorker Covers Editor Fran oise Mouly repositioned Art Spiegelman s silhouettes inspired by Ad Reinhardt s black on black paintings so that the North Tower s antenna breaks the W of the magazine s logo Spiegelman wanted to see the emptiness and find the awful awe filled image of all that disappeared on The silhouetted Twin Towers were printed in a fifth black ink on a field of black made up of the standard four color printing inks An overprinted clear varnish helps create the ghost images that linger insisting on their presence through the blackness br At first glance the cover appears to be totally black but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the World Trade Center towers in a slightly darker shade of black In some situations the ghost images become visible only when the magazine is tilted toward a light source In September Spiegelman reprised the image on the cover of his book In the Shadow of No Towers in which he relates his experience of the Twin Towers attack and its psychological aftereffects br br In the December issue the magazine printed a cover by Maira Kalman and Rick Meyerowitz showing a map of New York in which various neighborhoods were labeled with humorous names reminiscent of Middle Eastern and Central Asian place names and referencing the neighborhood s real name or characteristics e g Fuhgeddabouditstan Botoxia The cover had some cultural resonance in the wake of September and became a popular print and poster br br For the Valentine s Day issue the magazine cover by Art Spiegelman depicted a black woman and a Hasidic Jewish man kissing referencing the Crown Heights riot of The cover was criticized by both black and Jewish observers Jack Salzman and Cornel West called the reaction to the cover the magazine s first national controversy br br The Politics of Fear a cartoon by Barry Blitt featured on the cover of the July issue depicts then presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama in the turban and shalwar kameez typical of many Muslims fist bumping with his wife Michelle portrayed with an Afro and wearing camouflage trousers with an assault rifle slung over her back They are standing in the Oval Office with a portrait of Osama bin Laden hanging on the wall and an American flag burning in the fireplace in the background br Many New Yorker readers saw the image as a lampoon of The Politics of Fear as was its title Some Obama supporters as well as his presumptive Republican opponent John McCain accused the magazine of publishing an incendiary cartoon whose irony could be lost on some readers Editor David Remnick felt the image s obvious excesses rebuffed the concern that it could be misunderstood even by those unfamiliar with the magazine The intent of the cover he said is to satirize the vicious and racist attacks and rumors and misconceptions about the Obamas that have been floating around in the blogosphere and are reflected in public opinion polls What we set out to do was to throw all these images together which are all over the top and to shine a kind of harsh light on them to satirize them br In an interview on Larry King Live shortly after the magazine issue began circulating Obama said Well I know it was The New Yorker s attempt at satire I don t think they were entirely successful with it Obama also pointed to his own efforts to debunk the allegations the cover depicted through a website his campaign set up saying that the allegations were actually an insult against Muslim Americans br Later that week The Daily Show s Jon Stewart continued The New Yorker cover s argument about Obama stereotypes with a piece showcasing a montage of clips containing such stereotypes culled from various legitimate news sources Stewart and Stephen Colbert parodied The New Yorker s Obama cover on the October cover of Entertainment Weekly magazine with Stewart as Barack and Colbert as Michelle photographed for the magazine in New York City on September br New Yorker covers are sometimes unrelated to the contents of the magazine or only tangentially related The article about Obama in the July issue did not discuss the attacks and rumors but rather Obama s political career The magazine later endorsed Obama for president br This parody was most likely inspired by Fox News host E D Hill s paraphrasing of an anonymous internet comment in asking whether a gesture made by Obama and his wife Michelle was a terrorist fist jab Later Hill s contract was not renewed br br The New Yorker chose an image of Bert and Ernie by artist Jack Hunter titled Moment of Joy as the cover of the July issue which covered the Supreme Court decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and California Proposition The Sesame Street characters have long been rumored in urban legend to be homosexual partners though Sesame Workshop has repeatedly denied this saying they are merely puppets and have no sexual orientation Reaction was mixed Online magazine Slate criticized the cover which shows Ernie leaning on Bert s shoulder as they watch a television with the Supreme Court justices on the screen saying it s a terrible way to commemorate a major civil rights victory for gay and lesbian couples The Huffington Post meanwhile said it was one of the magazine s most awesome covers of all time br br The cover of the October issue titled The Race for Office depicts several top U S politicians Donald Trump Mitch McConnell Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden running the titular race for office with walkers Many have questioned the mental and physical states of these and other older politicians particularly those who have decided to run for reelection While many acknowledged the cover as satirizing this issue others criticized the ableism and ageism of mocking older people and people who use walkers The New Yorker said the cover portrays the irony and absurdity of the advanced age politicians currently vying for our top offices br br The New Yorker s signature display typeface used for its nameplate and headlines and the masthead above The Talk of the Town section is Irvin named after its creator the designer illustrator Rea Irvin The body text of all articles in The New Yorker is set in Adobe Caslon br One uncommonly formal feature of the magazine s in house style is the placement of diaeresis marks in words with repeating vowels such as re lected pre minent and co perate in which the two vowel letters indicate separate vowel sounds The magazine also continues to use a few spellings that are otherwise little used in American English such as fuelled focussed venders teen ager traveller marvellous carrousel and cannister br The magazine also spells out the names of numerical amounts such as two million three hundred thousand dollars instead of million even for very large figures br br In The New Yorker ran an article about Edna St Vincent Millay that contained multiple factual errors and her mother threatened to sue the publication for libel Consequently the magazine developed extensive fact checking procedures which became integral to its reputation as early as the s In the Columbia Journalism Review said that no publication has been more consistently identified with its rigorous fact checking As of it employs fact checkers br At least two defamation lawsuits have been filed over articles published in the magazine though neither were won by the plaintiff Two articles by Janet Malcolm about Sigmund Freud s legacy led to a lawsuit from writer Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson who claimed that Malcolm had fabricated quotes attributed to him After years of proceedings and appeals a jury found in Malcolm s favor in In David Grann wrote an article for the magazine about art expert Peter Paul Biro that scrutinized and expressed skepticism about Biro s stated methods to identify forgeries Biro sued The New Yorker for defamation alongside multiple other news outlets that reported on the article but the case was summarily dismissed br br Despite its title The New Yorker is read nationwide with percent of its circulation in the top U S metropolitan areas According to Mediamark Research Inc the average age of The New Yorker readers in was compared to in and in The average household income of The New Yorker readers in was the average income in was and the average income in was br Politically the magazine s readership holds generally liberal views According to a Pew Research Center survey of The New Yorker s readers have left of center political values and of them hold consistently liberal political values br br In Mrs Parker and the Vicious Circle a
