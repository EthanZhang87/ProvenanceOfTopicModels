Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark Iron Man The benefactor of the Avengers who is a self described genius billionaire playboy and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making Co director Joe Russo explained that Stark senses this greater threat approaching so he is doing everything in his power to keep the Earth safe Downey added that Stark has smaller goals than in previous films br Chris Hemsworth as Thor An Avenger and the king of Asgard based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name Joe Russo stated that Thor s storyline picks up after the events of Thor Ragnarok which finds him in a very profound very interesting place with real emotional motivation At the recommendation of Hemsworth writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely consulted Thor Ragnarok director Taika Waititi and screenwriter Eric Pearson to help carry over the comedic and tragic elements of the re toned Thor from that film Joe Russo said that Thor has the driving hero s arc of the movie which stands in direct opposition to Thanos argument and would have been the main protagonist of the film had Thor killed Thanos br Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner Hulk An Avenger and genius scientist who because of exposure to gamma radiation typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated Banner spends the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers and impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared but also because he realizes that Banner only wants Hulk for fighting I think he s had enough of saving Banner s ass Russo added that this was really reflective of the journey from Ragnarok where these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control Banner s appearance in the film continues a story arc for the character that was established in Thor Ragnarok and concludes in Avengers Endgame with the difference between Hulk and Banner starting to blur a little bit Ruffalo described Hulk in Infinity War as having the mental capacity of a five year old br Chris Evans as Steve Rogers Captain America The fugitive leader of the non regulation faction of Avengers A World War II veteran he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world

of the comic book identity Nomad in the film and receives new vibranium gauntlets from Shuri to replace his old shield An early draft of the film had Rogers first appearing at the end of the film to save Vision from Corvus Glaive in Wakanda Markus and McFeely were called insane for waiting that long to introduce Rogers into the film and ultimately conceded it was not a satisfying approach br Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff Black Widow A highly trained spy member of Rogers faction of Avengers and former agent of S H I E L D Johansson said that Romanoff s situation following Captain America Civil War has been a dark time I wouldn t say that my character has been particularly hopeful but I think she s hardened even more than she probably was before br Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Stephen Strange A former neurosurgeon who after a car accident that led to a journey of healing discovered the hidden world of magic and alternate dimensions and became a Master of the Mystic Arts

radioactive spider Downey helped coach Holland through his death scene which was not as drawn out in the script br Chadwick Boseman as T Challa Black Panther The king of the African nation of Wakanda

being in direct conflict with Thanos quest which raises the stakes br Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff A member of Rogers faction of Avengers who can harness magic and engage in hypnosis and

on the Norse mythological deity of the same name Hiddleston knew about Loki s death in Infinity War prior to production of Thor Ragnarok after meeting the Russos in May with his death being the first scene of the film that the Russos had conceptualized Hiddleston s knowledge of Loki s fate in Infinity War influenced his portrayal in Ragnarok On Loki s final moments Hiddleston believed it was very

Titan who seeks all six Infinity Stones to destroy half of all life for the sake of re balanc ing the universe Producer Kevin Feige added that Thanos believes the universe is becoming over populated which led to the destruction of his home moon Titan and is something he vowed not to let happen again and also said you could almost go so far as to say he is the main character of the film McFeely shared this sentiment describing the film as his hero journey in addition to being the film s protagonist stating Part of that is the things that mean the most to him We wanted to show that It wasn t just power it wasn t just an ideal it was people Brolin likened Thanos to the Quasimodo of this time and the novel Perfume since Thanos was born deformed and considered a freak on Titan while Joe Russo would reference The Godfather for Brolin at times which Brolin felt helped to emotionalize the whole thing Brolin further added that he preferred playing Thanos over Cable in Deadpool because of

voicing for the character Brolin performed motion capture on set br Chris Pratt as Peter Quill Star Lord The half human half Celestial leader of the Guardians who was abducted from Earth as a child

finally feels like Marvel has made the movie it always wanted to and the one we ve always wanted to see CinemaBlend s Eric Eisenberg said the footage left him literally shaking with the film looking like it could be one of the most epic blockbusters ever created Haleigh Foutch for Collider described it as dark and dramatic and utterly epic It s clear Marvel is trying to do something different here to pay off a decade s worth of narrative and world building While it s impossible to tell from two minutes work of footage it certainly looks like that gamble paid off The D footage was also shown at the San Diego Comic Con After the two convention presentations Avengers Infinity War generated over new conversations on social media from July to the third most during that time period behind Thor Ragnarok and Justice League according to Comscore and its PreAct service Infinity War stayed in third the following week with over new social media conversations behind Ragnarok and It By the week of October Infinity War had generated over total social media conversations br To promote the film s first teaser trailer Marvel released a compilation video of some of its previous trailers since Iron Man paired with fan reaction videos to those trailers The first teaser for Avengers Infinity War debuted on Good Morning America on November Josh Spiegel of The Hollywood Reporter said The most important part of the trailer is how it carefully deliberately introduces the notion that the Infinity War films are going to function as a passing of the torch from one set of Avengers to a newer group Scott Mendelson writing for Forbes noted that even though the trailer was not much different from the convention footage screened earlier in the year it was damn impressive Additionally the trailer had an excellent effect using the Avengers Initiative speech by Nick Fury and the Avengers theme by Alan Silvestri from The Avengers Conversely to Mendelson Alexander commented on the different marketing strategy for the film between the convention footage scenes and the trailer scenes feeling the two couldn t be more different She said the convention footage intended to please the crowd who were jittery with anticipation was released between Guardians of the Galaxy Vol and Thor Ragnarok and heavily focused Thor and the Guardians while the trailer designed to explain the film to general audiences heavily features Black Panther and Wakanda which Alexander said could not have been done before the additional marketing for Black Panther that happened after the conventions provided additional context Gael Cooper of CNET observed that the trailer was viewed nearly times in its first minutes after it was posted on YouTube but questioned if the trailer broke the site after

on March which earned over million views on YouTube in less than three hours after it was released Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post was not overly enthused about another superhero film having special effects heavy villains or the sight of yet another mysterious object hanging over the Manhattan skyline but felt the trailer made her realize that I m actually looking forward to seeing the characters of the MCU get to know each other Spiegel agreed with Rosenberg about the potential for character interactions but felt it was gimmicky to have so many crossover style introductions or combinations of heroes in a movie like this The second trailer was viewed million times in the first hours the third most viewed trailer in that time period behind the first trailer for the film and It while also becoming the biggest release for a second trailer surpassing Beauty and the Beast million views A week before the film s release the Burj Khalifa in Dubai was lit up each night for the

Hollywood Reporter praised the writers and directors ability to balance the large cast of characters saying they under the supervision of Marvel Films maestro Kevin Feige acknowledge the traffic jam of egos and play it for laughs Owen Gleiberman of Variety concurred stating Infinity War is a brashly entertaining jamboree structured to show off each hero or heroine and give them just enough to do and to update their mythologies without making it all feel like homework Rolling Stone s Peter Travers said the film is too much of a good thing and wrote The Russo brothers have clearly never learned the concept that less is more They ve used the premise of an Avengers reunion to put on a fireworks explosion of action and laughs that won t quit Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times called it Marvel s biggest and most ambitious movie yet but concluded it s certainly not the best However there s plenty of action humor and heart and some genuinely effective dramatic moments Roeper went on to praise the film s cast and Josh Brolin in particular whom he called the film s most interesting performance Gleiberman called Brolin s motion capture performance supremely effective and said Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit eyed manipulative glower so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal McCarthy wrote Brolin s calm considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain Gleiberman also praised the film s action sequences saying Infinity War brims with tensely spectacular combat sequences even if the question of who s going to win each one has that extravagantly arbitrary could Mighty Mouse beat up Superman quality McCarthy called the scale of the action astonishing and Travers wrote Avengers Infinity War leaves viewers up in the air feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time aching for a closure that never comes Josh Spiegel also of The Hollywood Reporter said the film takes a cue from the ending of The Empire Strikes Back in its super sized finale this is the equivalent of Han Solo frozen in the carbonite on steroids br A O Scott of The New York Times criticized the film s reliance on other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe saying Considered on its own as a single nearly hour minute movie Avengers Infinity War makes very little sense but conceded that it was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation Richard Brody of The New Yorker agreed stating The insubstantiality of the film isn t due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C G I gimmickry but instead to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe Stephanie Zacharek of Time said It isn t really a beginning but more of a middle or an end with a new piece of yarn attached You need to have seen and internalized every one of the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to fully get it Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called it a brisk propulsive occasionally rousing and borderline gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close but called its ultimate bid for catharsis unsuccessful since the Marvel assembly line is not stopped from chugging ahead with its signature polished mechanized efficiency Scott also criticized the action sequences calling them tedious and predictable and surely the most expensive parts of the movie but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination Likewise Zacharek said There s no pacing in Avengers Infinity War It s all sensation and no pulse Everything is big all of the time br br br Audience response br Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave

the subscribers it was set to occur on July Notice of the impending ban made the subreddit s subscribers increase to over including both of the Russos who subscribed Ahead of the ban Brolin posted a

Russo was the largest in Reddit s history Those banned then gathered in the new subreddit r inthesoulstone One Reddit user who participated described the ban as embodying the spirit of the Internet
