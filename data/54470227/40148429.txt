head coach Bill Belichick and MVP quarterback Tom Brady Philadelphia also finished the regular season with an NFC best record but entered the playoffs as underdogs after starting quarterback Carson Wentz suffered a season ending injury late in the regular season prior to his injury Wentz was the media and fan favorite to win MVP after leading his team to an start Backup quarterback Nick Foles was the Eagles starting quarterback for the rest of the season With Foles the Eagles advanced to their third Super Bowl appearance having previously lost to the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XV and to the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX br Several records were set during Super Bowl LII including most yards gained in any NFL game by both teams combined and fewest punts from both teams in a Super Bowl one The game was settled after the Eagles converted a fumble recovery deep within Patriots territory to a field goal with remaining to extend their lead to eight points and Brady s Hail Mary pass fell incomplete as time expired Foles who completed of pass attempts for yards and three touchdowns with one interception and also caught a one yard touchdown pass on a trick play was named Super Bowl MVP

which also involved the Eagles The game is considered one of the greatest Super Bowl games of all time br Eagles head coach Doug Pederson s game plan which was filled with over a dozen short yardage plays led to the Eagles going two for two on fourth down conversions and is regarded as highly influential in professional football Fourth down conversion attempts in the NFL increased as a whole nearly from to br br br Background br br br Host city selection br br On October the league announced that three venues were vying to host Super Bowl LII br br U S Bank Stadium in Minneapolis Minnesota Minneapolis hosted Super Bowl XXVI in at the Hubert H Humphrey Metrodome which was demolished after the season and replaced in by U S Bank Stadium br Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis Indiana The stadium hosted Super Bowl XLVI in br Mercedes Benz Superdome in New Orleans Louisiana The city has hosted Super Bowls including seven at the Superdome most recently Super Bowl XLVII in br On May the league s owners picked Minneapolis at their meeting in Atlanta Georgia br br br Teams br The NFC was represented by the number one playoff seed Philadelphia Eagles while the AFC was represented by the number one playoff seed New England Patriots marking the fourth time in the previous five years that the Super Bowl had featured the top team from each conference br br br Philadelphia Eagles br br The Eagles finished the regular season with a record of the same as New England Minnesota and Pittsburgh but the various tie breaking provisions gave them the NFC s top seed in the NFL playoffs It was a substantial improvement for the team under second year head coach Doug Pederson the Eagles finished the previous season with a record In the season the team scored points third in the NFL while giving up just fourth points br The offense was led by Pro Bowl quarterback Carson Wentz In just his second season he recorded a passer rating of throwing for yards and touchdowns with only seven interceptions His top target was Pro Bowl tight end Zach Ertz who caught passes for yards and eight touchdowns Other contributors were two receivers acquired from off season free agency Alshon Jeffery who caught passes for yards and nine scores and Torrey Smith who had receptions for yards Meanwhile third year receiver Nelson Agholor had the best season of his career hauling in passes for yards and eight touchdowns a higher total in each category than in his previous two seasons combined The Eagles rushing attack also benefited from two recently acquired players LeGarrette Blount and Jay Ajayi Blount an off season signing who won a Super Bowl with the Patriots gained rushing yards and two touchdowns while Ajayi picked up by a mid season trade with the Miami Dolphins rushed for yards and caught passes for yards combined with the two teams Philadelphia also had a superb offensive line led by two Pro Bowl selections Tackle Lane Johnson and Guard Brandon Brooks along with all pro center Jason Kelce br The Eagles defense allowed the fourth fewest yards in the league Defensive tackle Fletcher Cox made the Pro Bowl for the third time in his career recording sacks and two fumble recoveries and he had plenty of help around him such as former Patriots defensive end Chris Long who had five sacks and forced four fumbles and defensive end Brandon Graham who led the team with sacks Middle linebacker Nigel Bradham led the team in combined tackles with The Eagles secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Malcolm Jenkins who had combined tackles and two interceptions along with cornerback Patrick Robinson who led the team with four interceptions br Philadelphia had stormed to the top of the NFC by winning of their first games but suffered a major setback on December when Wentz went down with a season ending ACL tear and was replaced by journeyman backup quarterback Nick Foles who was playing for his third team in as many years and his second stint with the Eagles After Wentz s injury many analysts wrote off the remainder of the Eagles season as they believed they would not recover from his loss Surprising analysts Foles was able to lead the team to victory in that game as well as the next two The Eagles rested Foles and were led by third string quarterback Nate Sudfeld for their meaningless game against the Cowboys in Week a game they lost but in the Eagles two playoff games Foles threw for a combined total of yards three touchdowns and no interceptions replicating the excellent performance of Wentz to carry the Eagles to the NFC title The Eagles were not favored to win in any of their playoff games including Super Bowl LII and became the first number one seed to be an underdog in a Divisional Playoff game since seeding began in The team embraced their role as underdogs and were frequently seen wearing dog masks after each playoff victory as were their fans br br br New England Patriots br br The Patriots entered the NFL season as defending Super Bowl champions For the th time in their seasons under head coach Bill Belichick they recorded a double digit win season finishing the regular season with a record of and by virtue of tie breaking procedures earning the AFC s number one overall seed The previous season s top wide receiver Julian Edelman went down in the preseason with a season ending injury Early season defensive struggles left the team with a record after four weeks and the worst overall defense in the league at that point The defense came together as a unit and tightened up over the rest of the season however with the Patriots going after week Their sole loss in the latter part of the season came in Week to the Miami Dolphins a division rival though they were without star tight end Rob Gronkowski due to a one game suspension for an unnecessary roughness call the prior week The Patriots defense was improved by several late season free agent signings including Eric Lee a defensive end previously from the Buffalo Bills whom the Patriots signed in Week and James Harrison a perennial All Pro for the Pittsburgh Steelers whom the Patriots picked up off waivers after Christmas In just six games for New England Lee recorded sacks a safety and an interception In his only regular season game with the Patriots Harrison recorded two sacks br During the regular season New England s offense led the league in yards gained and ranked second in points scored The year old Brady finished his th season with a league leading passing yards touchdowns and just eight interceptions earning him his th selection to the Pro Bowl and his third league MVP award One change that helped make up for the loss of Edelman was the acquisition of receiver Brandin Cooks who caught passes for yards and seven touchdowns Brady was also aided by the healthy return of Gronkowski who had played just eight games in the previous season finishing this year with catches for yards and eight scores Receiver Danny Amendola added receptions for yards as well as another yards returning punts With the loss of their previous season s rushing leader LeGarrette Blount to free agency Dion Lewis stepped up to take the lead rushing for yards and six touchdowns despite starting only eight games He also caught passes for yards and two touchdowns and added yards and another touchdown returning kickoffs Rex Burkhead chipped in all purpose yards receptions and eight touchdowns In passing situations the team relied heavily on running back James White who caught passes for yards and rushed for on the ground These backs were aided by the blocking of fullback James Develin who earned his first Pro Bowl selection On special teams kicker Stephen Gostkowski ranked second in the NFL with points and fourth in field goals made with while veteran special team ace Matthew Slater earned his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl selection br The Patriots defense ranked only th in yards allowed but ranked fifth in fewest points giving up only Defensive end Trey Flowers led the team with sacks while also forcing two fumbles Linebacker Kyle Van Noy had tackles and sacks The Patriots also had a superb secondary led by cornerbacks Malcolm Butler two interceptions three forced fumbles and Stephon Gilmore two interceptions solo tackles as well as safeties Devin McCourty combined tackles one interception one fumble recovery Patrick Chung tackles one interception two fumble recoveries and Duron Harmon four interceptions br br br Playoffs br br In the playoffs the Patriots earned a first round bye and home field advantage due to their status as the AFC s first overall seed In the divisional round they defeated the Tennessee Titans as Brady passed for yards and three touchdowns In that game the defense amassed eight quarterback sacks of Marcus Mariota and held the Titans running game to yards rushing They defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game rallying from behind to win the game after the Jaguars jumped out to an early lead and whose league best defense stymied Brady and the rest of the offense for most of the first half Down in the fourth quarter the Patriots comeback was sealed by two Brady led drives both resulting in touchdown passes to Danny Amendola as well as a key defensive stop by Stephon Gilmore whose acrobatic block of a Blake Bortles pass ended Jacksonville s last chance to score Rob Gronkowski was injured in the game with a concussion leaving his status for the Super Bowl in doubt Amendola was the breakout star for the Patriots during their two playoff wins leading the team with receiving yards and serving as Brady s primary target br Philadelphia also earned a first round bye and home field advantage as the NFC s first overall seed They started off the divisional round by narrowly defeating the Atlanta Falcons stopping the Falcons on four consecutive plays after the Falcons had a first down and goal situation on the Eagles yard line during their final drive They then soundly defeated the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Championship Game Despite the Vikings scoring on their opening drive the Eagles defense held them to three punts two turnovers on downs two interceptions and one lost fumble in their remaining drives of the game Meanwhile Foles had a great game in which he completed of passes for yards and three touchdowns br br br Pre game notes br This game was a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX Only one player Patriots starting quarterback Tom Brady remained on either roster from that contest Bill Belichick the Patriots head coach in that contest also remained in that position Two Eagles running back LeGarrette Blount and defensive lineman Chris Long had been Patriots in s Super Bowl LI The Eagles were against the Brady Belichick era Patriots prior to this game preseason notwithstanding including Super Bowl XXXIX their one win being a win at Gillette Stadium in December during their relatively weak season where after falling behind they proceeded to rally for points and hold them down to only two more touchdowns on their end to win allowing them to finally get their first revenge for eleven years prior br The Patriots were the designated home team for Super Bowl LII because the AFC team is the designated home team in even numbered years and the NFC team in odd numbered years As the designated home team the Patriots chose to wear their road white jerseys with navy blue pants becoming the sixth team to wear their white jerseys as the home team and the third team to wear white in back to back Super Bowls following the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowls XII and XIII and again in Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII The Eagles therefore wore their standard home uniform of midnight green jerseys with white pants the same two uniforms were worn when they faced off in Super Bowl XXXIX but with the Eagles as the home team Twelve of the previous Super Bowls had been won by teams wearing white jerseys The last team to win a Super Bowl while wearing their home uniforms was the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV who coincidentally had also worn green jerseys br Gambling establishments had the Patriots as point favorites

and protest against police brutality corporate greed and racist practices people blocked the Green Line train for minutes before the game and protesters blocked an entrance to the stadium s security perimeter br Under a agreement the Patriots and Eagles owners split the tickets and the league controlled the game presentation and entertainment in the stadium The Patriots practiced at the Minnesota Vikings facilities in Eden Prairie while the Eagles used the University of Minnesota The Eagles got the Vikings locker room and sideline The Vikings had advanced to the NFC Championship Game before losing to the Eagles until that point the possibility of the Vikings advancing to the Super Bowl and thus becoming the first team to play the game in its home stadium was plausible Had that happened
