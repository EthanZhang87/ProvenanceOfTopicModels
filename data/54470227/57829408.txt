infuse new energy and vision into this st awards presentation and we are excited about a broad based creative relationship with these two artists Academy President John Bailey said in a press release announcing the decision Furthermore AMPAS CEO Dawn Hudson added We re thrilled to work with someone as passionate about the Academy as Donna Gigliotti an Oscar winner and multiple nominee She and the now famous Glenn Weiss are committed to making the most of the innovations we ve embraced for our st Oscars In response co producer Gigliotti expressed gratitude saying I m grateful to the Academy and ABC for entrusting me with this very special opportunity I m sure it will prove to be a humbling exhilarating and completely unique experience Thankfully I will have Glenn Weiss by my side every step

co excited to be co producing this year s show with Donna Gigliotti br Two months later Gigliotti and Weiss initially selected actor and comedian Kevin Hart to host the ceremony However he resigned from his position shortly after his selection after it was revealed that Hart made jokes that contained anti gay slurs and language He also added he did not want to be a distraction to the ceremony in light of the controversy The following February broadcaster ABC Entertainment chief Karey Burke announced that the festivities would proceed without a host During an interview at the Television Critics Association press tour Burke stated The main goal which I was told was the Academy promised ABC last year after a very lengthy telecast to keep the show to three hours Producers wisely decided to not to have a host and to go back to having the presenters and movies be the stars and that be the best way to keep the show at a brisk three hours br Other people participated in the production of the ceremony Production designer David Korins designed a new stage for the show Randy Thomas served as announcer for the ceremony Musician Rickey Minor was hired as music director and conductor Queen Adam Lambert performed a medley of the songs We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions as part of the program s opening number br br br Proposed Popular Film category br Due to the declining viewership of the recent Academy Awards ceremonies AMPAS sought new ideas to revamp the show while renewing interest with the nominated films In August the organization announced plans to add a new category honoring achievement in Popular Film The proposal was met with criticism because the award s implied focus on blockbuster suggested that artistic films and other non mainstream pictures were not popular with audiences Furthermore many viewed the creation of this new category to be a ploy to boost ratings and that it could hamper critically successful mainstream films from being nominated for Best Picture despite the insistence of AMPAS that such movies could be eligible for both categories In light of the backlash the Academy announced the following month that it would postpone implementation of the new category in order to seek additional input AMPAS president John Bailey later admitted that the proposed category was intended to help improve viewership and noted that the concept of a separate award for commercial film dates back to the inaugural awards ceremony which had separate categories for Outstanding Picture and Best Unique and Artistic Picture br br br Unsuccessful efforts to shorten the ceremony br In an effort to shorten the ceremony it was reported that only two of the nominees for Best Original Song All the Stars and Shallow would be performed live After a negative reaction from audiences and industry musicians including Lin Manuel Miranda and members of the music branch the Academy backtracked and announced that all five Best Original Song nominees would be performed during the ceremony All the Stars would not be performed however with Variety reporting that there were logistics and timing issues with its performers br On February AMPAS announced that the presentation of four awards categories Best Cinematography Best Live Action Short Film Best Film Editing and Best Makeup and Hairstyling would occur during commercial breaks They said that these presentations would be streamed so viewers could watch them live online and that the winners acceptance speeches would be replayed later in the broadcast The decision received extensive backlash from audiences and from filmmakers including Guillermo del Toro Christopher Nolan Martin Scorsese Quentin Tarantino Damien Chazelle Spike Lee Joe Dante and Alfonso Cuar n the latter of whom was nominated and won in one of the aforementioned categories Four days later the Academy reversed the decision and announced that all categories would be presented live br br br Box office performance of Best Picture nominees br When the nominations were announced seven of the eight films nominated for Best Picture had earned a combined gross of billion at the American and Canadian box offices at the time Black Panther was the highest grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with million in domestic box office receipts A Star is Born came in second with million this was followed by Bohemian Rhapsody million BlacKkKlansman million Green Book million Vice million and The Favourite million Box office figures for Roma were unavailable due to distributor Netflix s policy of refusing to release such figures br br br Critical reviews and ratings br Some media outlets received the broadcast positively Chuck Barney of The Mercury News commented After months of bad buzz and embarrassing missteps the st Academy Awards appeared to be on their way to an epic fail He also remarked The show as usual had some rocky moments but overall it was a lively well paced and entertaining affair Television critic Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe wrote The hostless Oscar ceremony felt a little more streamlined and energetic than usual as we were spared yet another predictable opening goof on the nominated movies a monologue pretending to make fun of the stars and short quips across the night that never quite land The Hollywood Reporter television critic Daniel Fienberg quipped Sunday s Oscars telecast definitely confirmed that under the right circumstances a host isn t a necessity In addition he said The show was not overwhelmed by montages or stunts or tributes and it also wasn t weighed down by elaborately prepared presenter schtick br Others were more critical of the show Kelly Lawler of USA Today wrote The Oscar telecast lacked energy and comedy and was treacherously dull And maybe that could have been avoided if the Academy had done what it has almost always done and procured a host She also observed that the awards were more like a press conference with movie clips in the middle Television critic Hank Stuever of The Washington Post commented They kept all the speeches but lost any trace of the unpredictable magic They opened with Queen the actual band fronted by their usual Freddie Mercury replacement Adam Lambert and a promise that We Will Rock You but we all know better The Oscar telecast has never rocked anyone He ended his review stating It s painful year after year to watch show business struggle to find a better way to put on a satisfying show br The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of million people over its length which was a increase from the previous year s ceremony The show also earned higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with of households watching the ceremony In addition it garnered a higher demo rating with a rating among viewers in that demographic br br br In Memoriam br The annual In Memoriam segment was presented by Academy president John Bailey The Los Angeles
