Western New York WNY is the westernmost region of the U S state of New York The eastern boundary of the region is not consistently defined by state agencies or those who call themselves Western New Yorkers Almost all sources agree WNY includes the cities of Buffalo Niagara Falls Jamestown and the surrounding suburbs as well as the outlying rural areas of the Great Lakes lowlands and Niagara Frontier and Chautauqua Alleghany or the western Southern Tier Many would also place Rochester and the Genesee Valley in the region while some would also include the western Finger Lakes within the region Others would describe the latter three areas as being in a separate Finger Lakes region br The State of New York sometimes defines the WNY region as including just five counties Allegany Cattaraugus Chautauqua Erie and Niagara The state s Empire State Development Corporation and state health authorities have both mapped the region this way The state has also used this regional boundary to set policy during the COVID pandemic br More commonly WNY has been defined to include at least Genesee Orleans and Wyoming counties as well Almost all descriptions of WNY in the Buffalo media market define it as this county area Most organizations that use WNY in their name including the WNY College Consortium the WNY Genealogical Society WNY PRISM the Psychological Association of WNY and the WNY Land Conservancy describe themselves as working in these counties br Others such as Clarion Publications the publisher of the WNY Travel Guide and WesternNY com have used the term Western New York to describe a much larger area consisting of counties In addition to those counties mentioned they add Chemung Livingston Monroe Ontario Schuyler Seneca Steuben Wayne and Yates as well br The rest of this article uses that definition The counties have a land area of square miles km They include the area of the Holland Purchase and the Phelps and Gorham Purchase br The area is primarily served by Buffalo and Rochester media markets although there is considerable overlap between these two markets as well as other American and Canadian media markets particularly from nearby Toronto In terms of the combined statistical areas used by the United States Census Bureau Western New York consists of the Buffalo Cheektowaga Olean NY area the Rochester Batavia Seneca Falls NY area and the Elmira Corning NY area br Western New York is in some contexts considered a sub region of Upstate New York when that term is used to describe all of New York State outside Long Island and the New York City metropolitan area in most cases however New Yorkers identify by specific regionalities such as Western New York or Central New York in preference to the vague and broader term Upstate New York br br br Subregions br br Western New York is generally considered to have subregions br br Greater Niagara br Chautauqua Allegheny br Genesee br Western Finger Lakes sometimes considered part of Central New York br The Greater Niagara Region or the Niagara Frontier comprises Niagara and Erie counties and parts of Genesee and Wyoming counties It is named for its major features the Niagara river and Niagara Falls Buffalo is its largest urban center br The Chautauqua Allegheny Region also known as Southwestern New York or the Western Southern Tier comprises Chautauqua Cattaraugus and Allegany counties The region is mountainous The largest urban center is Jamestown and Lake Chautauqua and Allegany State Park are major geographical features br The third region the Genesee Region comprises Monroe Livingston Wayne Orleans Ontario and Yates counties and parts of Genessee and Wyoming counties Rochester is its largest urban center Letchworth State Park is a major geographical feature br The fourth region is that of the western Finger Lakes Region composed of parts of Seneca Steuben Schuyler and Chemung counties While parts of the Finger Lakes are considered within Western New York as either a region or quadrant the eastern portions are typically considered a part of Central New York br The Genesee region and Western Finger Lakes region are often combined and described as the Finger Lakes region br Western New York also includes several Seneca Nation enclaves br br br Population br br If it were counted as a single area the population of Western New York would number just over million and would rank as the th largest metropolitan area of the United States between the Pittsburgh metropolitan area and the Sacramento California metropolitan area However the U S Census Bureau has classified the Buffalo and Rochester areas as two different metropolitan areas If it were counted as a state the population of Western New York would rank as the th most populated

Western New York has a humid continental climate heavily influenced by both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario Winters are long and cold often lasting from around mid November to early April There are often snows before and after that period as well Western New York is known for its lake effect snows which can result in highly localized sometimes intense and even historic snow events Lake effect storms are a result of cold air picking up water vapor as it blows over warm lake waters Lake effect snows are usually most active between November and February and typically diminish when Lake Erie freezes over Generally the heaviest amount of snow in Western New York during the winter falls near the southern end of Erie County as well as in Cattaraugus Chautauqua and Wyoming counties Spring and fall in Western New York are usually short and changeable The presence of the lakes allows for fruit growing and wine production along areas adjacent to both lakes which retard the development of damaging spring and fall frost thereby extending the growing season Lost in its famed winters Western New York summers are among the sunniest in the Northeast Canada and are generally very pleasant Thanks in part to breezes blowing over Lakes Erie and Ontario which are usually cooler than the air temperature in the summer most of Western New York enjoy generally cooler and more comfortable summers than other regions in the same climatic zone br br br Transportation br br br Major highways br Interstate System br br Interstate also known as the New York State Thruway br Interstate in the Southern

International Airport Buffalo Niagara International Airport is the most patronized airport facility in Western New York While it primarily serves as the regional airport for the Buffalo Niagara Falls Metropolitan Area the facility doubles as a gateway to Canada and a good portion of its passengers are Canadian The second major airport in Western New York Greater Rochester International Airport does not see as much traffic as Buffalo Niagara International Airport Still located just three nautical miles southwest of Downtown Rochester the facility provides convenient access to airline service for many residents of the Rochester Metropolitan Area br br br Railroad service br br The northern part of Western New York features four railroad stations in service on the Empire Corridor Rochester Buffalo Depew Buffalo Exchange Street and Niagara Falls The Buffalo Exchange Street and Niagara Falls stations do not see as much rail service as the other two Western New York stations due to the fact that west of Depew Station Amtrak s Lake Shore Limited leaves the Empire Corridor en route to the Midwest For a period of time there were proposals to service these four stations with high speed rail A major objective of implementing high speed rail service was to better connect Western New York as well as the rest of Upstate New York with New York City However little of substance has come of these proposals br Service to other parts of Western New York ended from the mid s to The Erie Lackawanna s Phoebe Snow served on a southeastern trajectory from Buffalo to Elmira Binghamton Scranton and Hoboken service ended in The E L s Lake Cities originated in Chicago passing through Western New York s Jamestown then through the rest of the Southern Tier Orange County and terminating at Hoboken NJ service ended on January The Pennsylvania Railroad s Buffalo Day Express was another route serving Western New York traveling south to Baltimore via Olean and Harrisburg this train was discontinued in but an unnamed Penn Central PC successor lasted through April when AMTRAK assumed most of the remaining U S rail passenger service but declined to serve the Baltimore Harrisburg Buffalo route of the former PRR PC br The Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad and WNY P both operate freight service in the region A few shortline railroads also offer rail service including the New York and Lake Erie Railroad and the Arcade and Attica Railroad br br br Bus service br br The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority runs regular bus service throughout the Buffalo Niagara Falls metropolitan area The Rochester Genesee Regional Transportation Authority serves Rochester and surrounding counties and the Chautauqua Area Regional Transit System serves Chautauqua County First Transit contracts with the Seneca Nation of Indians the Olean Area Transit System and Access Allegany to provide public transportation to most of the Southern Tier br In addition to the public transportation authorities which provide limited intercity connections several commercial intercity bus services also operate Coach USA operates a loop service between Buffalo Jamestown and Olean the bus connects to a route to New York City in Olean and to Megabus service to Toronto and New York City in Buffalo Fullington Trailways operates a daily rural route between Buffalo and various locations in Pennsylvania New York Trailways also serves Buffalo and Rochester connecting to various locations as does Greyhound Bus Lines One discount Chinatown service operates in Western New York Ocean Travel runs an overnight express service between Buffalo Rochester and New York City br br br History br br In its early history Western New York was settled by native cultures including the Hopewell The territory of Western New York until the th century was held by the Neutral Nation in the northern Niagara region and the Wenrohronon and Erie Indians around the Allegheny River The Seneca nation and their allies in the Iroquois Confederacy eliminated those tribes in wars during the Beaver Wars between and with any survivors being assimilated into the Senecas in the case of the Erie and Neutral or Huron in the case of the Wenro The Neutral territory is currently held by Tuscaroras who moved up from the Carolinas while refugees from the Erie tribes moved south to the Carolinas br French forces settled in parts of what is now Western New York through much of the th century beginning with tienne Br l s pass through of the region in and Joseph de La Roche Daillon s missionary journeys in the s some relics of their presence including Fort Niagara and a portage road that follows modern New York State Route between Lake Erie and Chautauqua Lake are still visible in the region br Western New York s land was acquired from the Iroquois through the Nanfan Treaty which ceded the territory to England at the end of the Beaver Wars in At the time four of the British colonies Pennsylvania New York Massachusetts and Connecticut laid claim to the unsettled territory as did New France until the Seven Years War Most of Western New York was officially off limits to all of the colonies as a result of the establishment of an Indian Reserve over the area following the Seven Years War By the s only New York and Massachusetts still maintained their claims to the territory which was separated from mainland New York by a Preemption Line br Under federal policy designed to extinguish the states Revolutionary War debts the states were required to extinguish their western land claims Massachusetts extinguished its claim to the territory in exchange for receiving the profits from its sale to settlers New York was the only colony not to extinguish its western claim and by way of the Treaty of Hartford the land with the exception of a small triangle that was ceded to Pennsylvania in officially became Western New York Had New York extinguished its claim it would have likely become part of the Northwest Territory established the next year and formed part of a new state Native title with the exception of several reservations was extinguished in the Treaty of Canandaigua in while the Phelps and Gorham Purchase and Holland Purchase opened the territory for settling During the War of Western New York was part of the borderland frontier between the United States and British Canada and became the scene of various military actions br The two major Western New York cities Buffalo and Rochester benefited greatly from the opening of the Erie Canal With its strategic position at the western end of the Erie Canal the eastern end of Lake Erie and proximity to Niagara Falls and Canada Buffalo emerged as a major port Niagara Falls provided Buffalo with a ready supply of power so much so that one of its enduring nicknames is The City of Light Buffalo experienced steady growth during the th century and at one point was one of the most populated cities in the United States According to some Rochester was America s First Boomtown and was a key player in the flour industry hence its initial nickname Flour City Its growth was attributed to both the completion of the Erie Canal and its resulting significance in the flour industry Olean was originally planned to be a similar major hub but it proved to be at a major disadvantage located near the headwaters of the Allegheny River a factor its planners had hoped would make the city a gateway to the Midwest the river was too shallow to support large boat travel or shipping on a consistent basis As a region Western New York played a significant role in the American economy during the th century Large scale immigration from Ireland Italy Poland Great Britain and Germany soon followed into the region br The New Religious Movement known as Spiritualism was among several that arose in the early th century burned over district of Western New York Its major center is Lily Dale one of the largest spiritualism communities in the United States The original house of the Fox sisters was relocated to Lily Dale in Joseph Smith Jr founder of the Latter Day Saint movement reported receiving the Book of Mormon in Palmyra Wayne County The women s civic organization Zonta was founded in Buffalo in br In the late th century this area became part of the Rust Belt of the United States being a focal point for the transportation of grain steel and coal The opening of the Welland Canal in effectively rendered the narrower Erie Canal obsolete further exacerbating economic problems in the region The area saw an economic decline during the period of deindustrialization leaving many empty steel mills including those of Bethlehem Steel which was the nd largest steel mill in the world The plant located in Lackawanna New York provided nearly jobs to the local economy Republic Steel also had a large integrated steel mill located in South Buffalo General Motors in Tonawanda is the largest vehicle engine plant in the world which still is a major contributor to the Buffalo area economy Ford Motor Company also maintains a large manufacturing facility in Woodlawn New York which is just south of Buffalo br br br Culture br br Western New York is culturally a Great Lakes Interior Northeastern area with a dose of Appalachia in the Southern Tier an overlapping region of the state Buffalo appears to have similarities to other Great Lakes cities areas while having Northeastern proclivities The similarities with Chicago and Milwaukee run the list from sharing a common industrial base traditionally built around steel and automobile manufacturing The cities were both developed during the same period in American history so the street patterns architecture and ethnic communities share a similar appearance Linguistically Western New York is part of the Inland North region of American English which means it is subject to the Northern Cities vowel shift a distinct variant of that accent Buffalo English is heard in many parts of the region br Finally most Western New York sports fans support the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres Team loyalties of sports fans in the rest of upstate New York are more divided Most baseball fans support the Cleveland Guardians New York Yankees and New York Mets although the Toronto Blue Jays have seen an increase in support due to the influx of Canadians in the area as well as the region s proximity to Toronto the Blue Jays increased on field success in the mid s and the affiliation with the longstanding minor league Buffalo Bisons The Pittsburgh Pirates have some following in southwestern New York and teams with national fanbases such as the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs also have followings The region has no clear favorite professional basketball franchise with the Brooklyn Nets Cleveland Cavaliers New York Knicks and Toronto Raptors all claiming parts of the region as part of their regional broadcasting territories Western New York puts more emphasis on college basketball where the Big Division I programs Canisius Niagara St Bonaventure and UB all have strong followings and rivalries while most attention has been centered around the men s college basketball teams the recent success of UB and St Bonaventure s women s teams has led to increased attention to women s basketball in the region The college basketball scene once had enough clout to help drive Buffalo s NBA team the s era Buffalo Braves out of the city Syracuse University sports being the closest major conference school to the region also has a sizable following in western New York particularly in basketball College football interest is minimal with no team having a major following not even UB who has struggled to maintain its Division I football program despite modest success For hockey other than the Buffalo Sabres the region is also home to a number of Toronto Maple Leafs New York Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins supporters br br br Food br br br Region wide br Friday night fish fry is also regionally popular a holdover from when Catholics were forbidden to eat meat on Fridays It is usually skinless cod although most restaurants in the area claim they use the higher quality haddock and is frequently beer battered deep fried and served with French fries and cole slaw Numerous restaurants in Western New York have a Friday fish fry special The fish fry retains particular popularity during Lent when Catholics are still barred from eating meat on Friday br Italian American food is a specialty in western New York Most towns in the region have pizzerias The Texas hot introduced by Greek immigrants in the s has a strong following in the region and several hot dog stands offer the dish Longstanding Texas hot stands include Ted s Hot Dogs in Buffalo Rigas Texas Hot in Wellsville and Johnny s Lunch in Jamestown the Colera family is also tied to several other Jamestown stands such as AJ Texas Hots which launched in and Michael s which operated from to br The region produces many agricultural products including milk maple syrup apples cherries potatoes sweet corn strawberries raspberries peaches and grapes As with the rest of Upstate New York dairy farming is an important part of the economy New York State is a leading producer among the states of dairy maple and wine br br br Buffalo area br Perhaps the best known food specialty of Western New York is Buffalo chicken wings known locally simply as wings or chicken wings The two best known places to get wings are Duff s and the Anchor Bar which have a strong local rivalry in Buffalo and both are expanding outside the city br At the Erie County Fair known as the Hamburg Fair in Hamburg New York Frank and Charles Menches sold a ground beef sandwich which is one of the earliest claims of the invention of the hamburger br Beef on Weck is a regional favorite and a local invention in which sliced warm roast beef is piled high on a Kummelweck roll topped with caraway seeds and large grained salt au jus and horseradish are often added to the sandwich br Butter lambs are a popular tradition in Buffalo during the Lenten season leading into Easter The Broadway Market a market in Buffalo is famous for this product br br br Rochester area br The Rochester area is known for the Garbage Plate It was created and continues to be served by Nick Tahou Hots on West Main Street The name Garbage Plate is trademarked by Nick Tahou s but other Rochester restaurants serve the same or similar dish under other names usually containing the word plate The Rochester Red Wings baseball team concessions at Frontier Field for example offer the Home Plate br A component of the garbage plate and many other local dishes is a topping known in Rochester as hot sauce The term in this context does not refer to a pepper sauce but to a spiced sauce containing bits of meat br Another food associated with the Rochester area is the white hot a hot dog with a slight variation of ingredients that appears without the distinctive pink color of most hot dogs when ordering a hot dog in Rochester it is common to be asked to clarify whether it should be red or white br br br Economy br br In urban areas in Western New York education business light manufacturing and tourism have replaced heavy manufacturing which left the area at the end of World War II Rochester and Buffalo were especially hard hit with the exodus of manufacturing jobs to other areas of the United States and nations like China and Mexico Niagara Falls was also hard hit and has shed half of its population since its peak in Today major corporations in Western New York include Kodak Wegmans Bausch Lomb Xerox M T Bank KeyBank and Moog among many others General Motors continues to operate three facilities in the region Rochester Components Operations formerly known as Rochester Division produces fuel system components Lockport Operations formerly Harrison Thermal Systems produces cooling system components and was awarded million for additional and future products in Finally Tonawanda Power Train originally opened in as a Chevrolet engine plant and continues producing and cylinder engines in the Buffalo area br Outside of the cities agriculture has always been a major factor in the economy especially dairy farming br Ski country runs through Western New York Glenwood and Ellicottville both have multiple ski resorts within their boundaries Ellicottville in particular has seen massive gentrification from the development of the large ski resorts within the town boundaries and has attempted to build on that growth by branding itself as a year round destination with numerous festivals At their peak in the s over a dozen ski resorts were in Western New York most of them in Cattaraugus County br In Niagara County viticulture or wine culture is also becoming a driver of the economy In order to take advantage of this the state has created the Niagara Wine Trail To a certain extent viticulture is also prominent in Chautauqua County where Welch s has a long history the western Finger Lakes also have a wine industry br American Rock Salt the largest operating salt mine in the United States is located in Livingston County br During the late s then Governor George Pataki signed an agreement granting the Seneca Nation of New York the right to acquire and build three full scale casino gaming operations The three casinos Seneca Niagara Casino in Niagara Falls Seneca Allegany Casino in Salamanca and the controversial Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino in Buffalo are the only casinos that operate over all of Western New York as part of the agreement for which the Senecas pay a portion of revenues to the state of New York which in turn returns part of that money to the host municipalities Twice over the course of the compact s history have the Senecas stopped paying their exclusivity payments once in a dispute over whether video lottery terminals constituted the breach of the agreement and again in after the Senecas claimed they are no longer required to pay the exclusivity payments but still maintain exclusivity under the language of the agreement br The three native tribes in the region Seneca Nation Tonawanda Band and Tuscarora also have a large influence in the convenience store sector The tribes have long maintained that they are exempt from state excise taxes on gasoline and tobacco products which allows native owned convenience stores to provide lower prices than their non native counterparts Gasoline tax advantages were most pronounced in the s when low overall gas prices made the tax advantage far more noticeable In the s and s a mail order tobacco industry thrived on Seneca reservations an industry that has mostly been cut off since then Increasing regulations now prohibit Senecas from receiving or selling name brand cigarettes without taxes sending tobacco products by mail Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act or private delivery or accepting credit cards for remote purchases the Senecas still sell native produced tobacco products in brick and mortar stores on the reservations Large tobacco farms can be seen in much of the Cattaraugus Reservation to meet the demand for native grown tax exempt tobacco br br br Colleges and universities br br br Major businesses br Western New York is home

Park The Bills are the only team to reach the Super Bowl in four consecutive seasons in NFL history br The Buffalo Sabres also have a strong following in Western New York and are consistently ranked among the highest rated local TV hockey markets and the highest rated markets for NBC NBCSN regular season games Primarily because of the strong regional interest in the team in MSG Western New York

team in Major League Soccer occasionally considered the fifth major league on the American sporting landscape although Rochester had been mentioned in the past as a candidate for a new expansion franchise and previously hosted the Rochester Lancers in MLS s predecessor the NASL The speculation of Rochester getting an MLS team was due to the relative success of the Rochester Rhinos However the Rhinos later a downturn in attendance due to a number of factors leading to the team going dormant in and re emerging as Rochester NY FC in a lower division of soccer in Such speculation has also decreased in the st century in part because of MLS s refusal to put teams in metropolitan areas without any other major league teams and greatly increased competition for MLS expansion franchises The
