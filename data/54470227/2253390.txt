suggests an exit exists Holly thinking she sees sunlight runs ahead but she falls down a hole and breaks her leg As the others help Holly Sarah wanders off and observes a pale humanoid creature drinking at a pool before it scampers away Later the group comes across a den of animal bones and is suddenly attacked by a creature they name a crawler Holly is killed when a crawler attacks and

vision of her dead daughter Jessica and smiles as the shrieks of crawlers grow closer br br br Cast br br br Production br When Neil Marshall s film Dog Soldiers was a moderate success the director received numerous requests to direct other horror films The director was initially wary of being typecast as a horror film director although he eventually agreed to make The Descent emphasizing They are very different films br br br Casting br Filmmakers originally planned for the cast to be both male and female but Neil Marshall s business partner realized that horror films rarely have all female casts Defying convention Marshall cast all women and to avoid making them clich d he solicited basic advice from his female friends He explained the difference The women discuss how they feel about the situation which the soldiers in Dog Soldiers would never have done He also gave the characters different accents to enable the audience to tell them apart and to establish a more cosmopolitan feel than the British marketing of Dog Soldiers br The cast included Shauna Macdonald as Sarah Natalie Mendoza as Juno Alex Reid as Beth Saskia Mulder as Rebecca MyAnna Buring as Sam Nora Jane Noone as Holly Oliver Milburn as Paul and Molly Kayll as Jessica Craig Conway portrayed one of the film s crawlers Scar br br br Filming br While The Descent is set in North America the film was shot entirely in the United Kingdom Exterior scenes were filmed in Scotland and interior scenes were filmed in sets built at Pinewood Studios near London The cave was built at Pinewood because filmmakers considered it too dangerous and time consuming to shoot in an actual cave Set pieces were reused with care and filmmakers sought to limit lighting to the sources the characters bring with them into the cave such as helmet lights br Marshall cited the films The Texas Chain Saw Massacre The Thing and Deliverance as influences in establishing tension in The Descent The director elaborated We really wanted to ramp up the tension slowly unlike all the American horror films you see now They take it up to in the first few minutes and then simply can t keep it up We wanted to show all these terrible things in the cave dark drowning claustrophobia Then when it couldn t get any worse make it worse Marshall also said at the rd Venice International Film Festival that he was inspired by Italian horror films of the past in particular those by Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci br Simon Bowles designed the maze of caves for The Descent Reviews credited Bowles e g Bowles beautifully designed cave sets conjure a world of subterranean darkness br The film had twenty one cave sets built by Rod Vass and his company Armordillo Ltd using a unique system of polyurethane sprayed rock that was developed for this production br Production of The Descent competed with a big budget American film that had a similar premise The Cave The Descent was originally scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom by November or February but The Cave began filming six months before its competitor The filmmakers of The Descent decided to release their film before The Cave so they fast tracked production to be completed by the end of February br br br Editing br The Descent was released in North America with approximately one minute cut from the end In the American cut Sarah escapes from the cave and sees Juno but the film does not cut back to the cave The August issue of Entertainment Weekly reported that the ending was trimmed because American viewers did not like its uber hopeless finale Lionsgate marketing chief Tim Palen said It s a visceral ride and by the time you get to the ending you re drained Director Neil Marshall had a number of endings in mind when he shot the film so he was open to making a switch Marshall compared the change to the ending of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre saying Just because she gets away does that make it a happy ending The ending is featured on DVD as an unrated cut in the United States br br br Creature design br In the film the women encounter underground creatures referred to as crawlers by the production crew Marshall described the crawlers as cavemen who have stayed underground The director explained They ve evolved in this environment over thousands of years They ve adapted perfectly to thrive in the cave They ve lost their eyesight they have acute hearing and smell and function perfectly in the pitch black They re expert climbers so they can go up any rock face and that is their world Filmmakers kept the crawler design hidden from the actresses until they were revealed in the scenes in which the characters encountered the creatures to allow for natural tension br br br Conception br Director Neil Marshall first chose to have a dark cave as the setting for his horror film The Descent then decided to add the element of the crawlers describing them as something that could get the women something human but not quite The crawlers were depicted as cavemen who for some reason never left the caves and yet managed to evolve in the dark The director included mothers and children in the colony of creatures defining his vision It is a colony and I thought that was far more believable than making them the classic monsters If they had been all male it would have made no sense so I wanted to create a more realistic context for them I wanted to have this very feral very primal species living underground but I wanted to make them human I didn t want to make them aliens because humans are the scariest things br The crawlers were designed by Paul Hyett a makeup and prosthetics creator Production designer Simon Bowles said that the crawler design had started out as wide eyed and more creature like but the design shifted toward a more human appearance Crawlers originally had pure white skin but the look was adjusted to seem grubbier The skin was originally phosphorescent in appearance but the effect was too bright and reflective in the darkened set so the adjustment was made for them to blend in shadows The director barred the film s cast from seeing the actors in full crawler make up until their first appearance on screen Actress Natalie Mendoza said of the effect When the moment came I nearly wet my pants I was running around afterwards laughing in this hysterical way and trying to hide the fact that I was pretty freaked out Even after that scene we never really felt comfortable with them br The crawlers reappear in The Descent Part a sequel by Jon Harris with the first film s director Neil Marshall as executive producer For the sequel Hyett improved the camouflaging ability of the crawlers skin tones to deliver better scares According to Hyett Jon wanted them more viciously feral inbred scarred and deformed with rows of sharklike teeth for ripping flesh A charnel house was designed for the crawlers as well as a set that the crew called the Crawler Crapper br br br Description br Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald described the crawlers as blind snarling cave dwellers looking much like Gollum s bigger kin Douglas Tseng of The Straits Times also noted that the crawlers looked similar to Gollum being a cross between the creature and the vampiric Reapers from Blade II David Germain of the Associated Press noted of the crawlers They have evolved to suit their environment eyes blind because of the darkness in which they dwell skin slimy and gray ears batlike to channel their super hearing The crawlers are sexually dimorphic with males being completely bald whilst females sport thick dark hair on their heads They are nocturnal hunters which surface from their caves to hunt for prey and bring the spoils of their hunts to their caverns br br br Marketing br The skull of women motif used in some advertising material is based on Philippe Halsman s In Voluptas Mors photograph br The film s marketing campaign in the United Kingdom was disrupted by the London bombings in July Advertisements on London s public transport system including the bus that had exploded had included posters that carried the quote Outright terror bold and brilliant and depicted a terrified woman screaming in a tunnel The film s theatrical distributor in the UK Path recalled the posters from their placement in the London Underground and reworked the campaign to exclude the word terror from advertised reviews of The Descent Path also distributed the new versions to TV and radio stations The distributor s marketing chief Anna Butler said of the new approach We changed tack to concentrate on the women involved all standing together and fighting back That seemed to chime with the prevailing mood of defiance that set in the weekend after the bombs Neil Marshall stated in a review Shauna was pretty upset about it it was on newspapers all across the county and cites the attacks as harming the film s box office as people were still trapped underground in reality so no one really wanted to go see a film about people trapped underground br br br Release br br br Reception br When it was released in July this claustrophobic story of six women who stumble across something nasty on a caving trip got arguably the best reviews of any Brit pic this year br The Descent premiered at the Edinburgh horror film festival Dead by Dawn on July The film opened commercially to the public in the UK on July showing on screens and earned million The film received limited releases in other European countries The London bombings in the same month were reported to have affected the box office performance of The Descent On its debut weekend in the US The Descent opened with a three day gross of million and finished with Total worldwide box office

reviews br Roger Ebert s editor Jim Emerson reviewed the film for Ebert s column whilst Ebert was on leave due to surgery giving it four out of four stars He wrote This is the fresh exciting summer movie I ve been wanting for months Or for years it seems br Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described The Descent as one of the better horror entertainments of the last few years calling it indisputably and pleasurably nerve jangling Dargis applauded the claustrophobic atmosphere of the film though she perceived sexual overtones in the all female cast with their laboured breathing and sweaty clothing Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald thought that the film devolved into a guessing game of who would survive though he praised Marshall s nightmare imagery for generating scares that work better than other horror films Rodriguez also noted the attempt to add dimension to the female characters but felt that the actresses were unable to perform br Top ten lists br br st Bravo s Even

conducted a poll with several authors directors actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films The Descent placed at number on their top list br Lawrence Toppman of The Charlotte Observer thought a weakness of The Descent was the failure of the writer to explain the evolution of the creature though he said Their clicking and howling used for echolocation and communication makes them more alien this otherness gives humans permission to mutilate them without seeming too disgusting to be sympathetic Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune thought that the crawlers should have been left out of the film believing Watching those gray slithering beings chasing and biting the women makes it hard to maintain any suspension of disbelief br br
