reviews are positive with an average rating of The website s consensus reads The Others is a spooky thriller that reminds us that a movie doesn t need expensive special effects to be creepy Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews br A O Scott of The New York Times stated The Others is a flawed if interesting vehicle The anxious indeterminacy of the first section proves hard to sustain and as Mr Amen bar moves away from elegant minimalism the story begins to become cluttered and confusing rather than spare and enigmatic Scott highlighted Kidman s performance writing that she embodies this unstable amalgam with a conviction that is in itself terrifying The icy reserve that sometimes stands in the way of her expressive gifts here becomes the foundation of her most emotionally layered performance to date br Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four praising that Alejandro Amen bar has the patience to create a languorous dreamy atmosphere and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation and not just a standard issue horror movie hysteric However he noted that in drawing out his effects Amen bar is a little too confident that style can substitute for substance br Neil Smith of the BBC awarded the film four out of five stars writing Shot in oppressive sepia amid near darkness Grace s children having a rare ailment that precludes exposure to sunlight Amen bar racks up the tension to unbearable levels Time Out praised the film as confident and controlled Absence makes the heart beat faster the absence of light the corporeal absence of loved ones Shrewdly cast Kidman is pitch perfect It s a clammy ingenious film one of the best studio movies of the year br Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times cited Kidman s performance as the film s greatest strength writing that she has thrown herself into her role as if it were Lady Macbeth on the London stage with formidable results Though Kidman doesn t hesitate to make Grace high strung and as tightly wound as they come she also projects vulnerability and courage when they re called for It s an intense involving performance and it dominates and energizes a film that would be lost without it br Although the film deals primarily with the spiritual interaction of ghosts with each other rather than with living humans William Skidelsky of The Observer has suggested that it was inspired by the novella The Turn of the Screw written by Henry James br br br Accolades br br br Home media br On May Buena Vista Home Entertainment released a disc collector s edition DVD On September Lionsgate released the film on Blu ray In July The
