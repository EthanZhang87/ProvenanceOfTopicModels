specifically the criticisms that the film had too much blood focused too much on shocking the audience and was a remake In response lvarez decided to make Don t Breathe an original story that contained less blood and focused more on suspense over shocking audiences He wanted to avoid making a film dealing with the supernatural as he felt that was too trendy br br Choosing to make the antagonist blind was a result of deliberately taking abilities away from him lvarez explained Sometimes you naturally give them powers and make them more menacing than a normal person so we thought what if we do the other way around and take his eyes out and make him a blind person br lvarez has called the film an exercise in reversal noting that the film deliberately subverts tropes such as the fact that the house in question is a nice house on a scary street as opposed to the opposite or that the movie is a home invasion story told from the point of view of the invaders br br On May Daniel
