he was gone for two hours They then discover that they now lack reflections and have received a Handbook for the Recently Deceased which leads them to realize they drowned in the river and are now ghosts confined to their house br It is later sold to the Deetz family who hail from New York City Its patriarch Charles is a former real estate developer his second wife Delia is a br sculptor and conceptual artist and his teenage goth daughter Lydia from his first marriage is an aspiring photographer Under the guidance of interior designer Otho Fenlock the family renovates the house into a new wave work of postmodern art br Consulting the Handbook the Maitlands travel to an otherworldly waiting room populated by other distressed souls discovering that the afterlife is structured according to a complex bureaucracy involving vouchers and caseworkers The Maitlands own caseworker Juno tells them they must remain in the house for the next years on pain of a dire fate If they want the Deetzes out of the house it is up to the Maitlands to scare them away Although they are invisible to most of the Deetzes Lydia is able to see the Maitlands she attributes her paranormal intuition to her strange and unusual nature Against Juno s advice the Maitlands contact the miscreant Betelgeuse her former assistant and a now freelance bio exorcist to scare the Deetzes away However he quickly offends the couple with his crude and morbid demeanor and they reconsider hiring him but too late to stop him from tormenting the Deetzes br Winter River s charm and the supernatural events inspire Charles to pitch his boss Maxie Dean on transforming the town into a tourist hot spot but Maxie wants proof of the ghosts Using the Handbook for the Recently Deceased Otho conducts what appears to be a s ance and summons the Maitlands using their wedding clothes but they begin to age and decay as an exorcism has been inadvertently performed instead Horrified Lydia summons Betelgeuse for help but he will only help her if she marries him marrying a human would enable Betelgeuse to freely cause chaos in the mortal world Betelgeuse saves the Maitlands disposes of Maxie his wife and Otho then prepares his wedding with Lydia The Maitlands intervene before the ceremony is completed with Barbara riding a sandworm that swallows Betelgeuse whole through the house br The Deetzes and Maitlands agree to live in harmony within the house with the latter forming a stronger bond with Lydia who occasionally persuades them to unleash their ghostly powers Elsewhere Betelgeuse is now stuck in the afterlife waiting room he runs afoul of a witch doctor who shrinks his head in retaliation br br br Cast br br br Production br br br Writing br After the financial success of Pee wee s Big Adventure Burton became a bankable director and began working on a script for Batman with Sam Hamm While Warner Bros was willing to pay for the script s development it was less willing to green light Batman Burton had become disheartened by the lack of imagination and originality in the scripts he had been sent particularly Hot to Trot br Michael McDowell and Larry Wilson formed a partnership Pecos Productions with entertainment attorney Michael Bender and Beetlejuice was their first original project After developing the story McDowell and Wilson decided they would write the first draft of the screenplay together while Wilson would only take Story By credit as well as his Producer credit br Burton had gotten to know and worked with McDowell and Wilson who co wrote the script for The Jar an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents that Burton directed Burton read their first draft of Beetlejuice liked it but had other projects that kept him from becoming involved at that time br The original script is far less comedic and much darker the Maitlands car crash is depicted graphically with Barbara s arm crushed and the couple screaming for help as they slowly drown A reference to this remains Barbara remarks that her arm feels frozen upon returning home as a ghost Instead of possessing the Deetzes and forcing them to dance during dinner the Maitlands cause a vine patterned carpet to come to life and attack them by tangling them to their chairs br The character of Betelgeuse envisioned in the first draft as a winged demon who takes on the form of a short Middle Eastern man is also intent on killing the Deetzes rather than scaring them and wants sex from Lydia instead of marriage In this version of the script Betelgeuse need only be exhumed from his grave to be summoned after which he is free to wreak havoc he can be summoned but not controlled by saying his name three times and wanders the world freely tormenting different characters in different manifestations br In another version of the script the film concludes with the Maitlands Deetzes and Otho conducting an exorcism ritual that destroys Betelgeuse and the Maitlands transforming into miniature versions of themselves and moving into Adam s model of their home which they refurbish to look like their house before the Deetzes moved in br Co author and producer Larry Wilson has talked about the reaction to the first draft by a prominent executive at Universal where Wilson was employed at the time br br I won t name names here but I worked at Universal Studios at the time I was director of development for the director Walter Hill I had a very good relationship with a very prominent executive at Universal He liked me and he liked what I was doing with Walter and the material I was bringing in br I gave him Beetlejuice to read and I gave it to him on a Friday and on Monday his assistant called me and said well he wants to meet with you My initial reaction was wow He d read it He must have loved it or he wouldn t have wanted to see me so soon But I went into his office and he literally said what are you doing with your career br br This piece of weirdness this is what you re going to go out into the world with You re developing into a very good executive You ve got great taste in material Why are you going to squander all that for this piece of shit was basically what he was saying It goes to show right Shortly after that we sold it to the Geffen Company br Skaaren s rewrite shifted the film s tone eliminating the graphic nature of the Maitlands deaths and further developing the concept created by McDowell and Wilson that the Afterlife is a complex bureaucracy Skaaren s rewrite also added to McDowell and Wilson s depiction of the limbo that keeps Barbara and Adam trapped inside their home in the original script it takes the form of a massive void filled with giant clock gears that shred the fabric of time and space as they move Skaaren had Barbara and Adam encounter different limbos every time they leave their home including the clock world and the sandworm world identified as Saturn s moon Titan Skaaren also introduced the leitmotif of music accompanying Barbara and Adam s ghostly hijinks although his script specified R B tunes instead of Harry Belafonte and was to have concluded with Lydia dancing to When a Man Loves a Woman br Skaaren s first draft retained some of McDowell s Betelgeuse s more sinister characteristics but toned the character down to make him a troublesome pervert rather than blatantly murderous Betelgeuse s true form was that of the Middle Eastern man and much of his dialogue was written in African American Vernacular English This version concluded with the Deetzes returning to New York and leaving Lydia in the care of the Maitlands who with Lydia s help transform their home s exterior into a stereotypical haunted house while returning the interior to its previous state It also featured deleted scenes such as the real estate agent Jane trying to convince the Deetzes to allow her to sell the house for them having sold it to them in the first place Charles and Delia decline and a revelation of how Betelgeuse had died centuries earlier he attempted to hang himself while drunk having been rejected by a woman only to mess it up and die slowly by choking to death rather than quickly by snapping his neck and wound up working for Juno before striking out on his own as a freelance bio exorcist br Retrospectively McDowell was impressed with how many people made the connection between the film s title and the star Betelgeuse br br br Casting br Burton s original choice for Betelgeuse was Sammy Davis Jr The producers also considered Dudley Moore and Sam Kinison for the role but Geffen suggested Keaton Burton was unfamiliar with Keaton s work but was quickly convinced Several actresses auditioned for the role of Lydia Deetz including Sarah Jessica Parker Brooke Shields Lori Loughlin Diane Lane Justine Bateman Molly Ringwald Juliette Lewis and Jennifer Connelly Alyssa Milano was the runner up for the role Burton cast Ryder upon seeing her in Lucas Anjelica Huston was originally cast as Delia Deetz but dropped out because of illness O Hara quickly signed on while Burton claimed it took a lot of time to convince other cast members to sign as they didn t know what to think of the weird script br br br Filming br Beetlejuice s budget was million with just million given over to visual effects work Considering the scale and scope of the effects which included stop motion replacement animation prosthetic makeup puppetry and blue screen it was always Burton s intention to make the style similar to that of the B movies he grew up with as a child He said that he wanted to make the effects look cheap and purposely fake looking Burton wanted to hire Anton Furst as production designer after being impressed with his work on The Company of Wolves and Full Metal Jacket but Furst was committed to High Spirits a choice he later regretted He hired Bo Welch his future collaborator on Edward Scissorhands and Batman Returns The test screenings were met with positive feedback and prompted Burton to film an epilogue featuring Betelgeuse foolishly angering a witch doctor Warner Bros disliked the title Beetlejuice and wanted to call the film House Ghosts As a joke Burton suggested the name Scared Sheetless and was horrified when the studio actually considered using it While the setting is the fictional village of Winter River Connecticut all outdoor scenes were filmed in East Corinth a village
