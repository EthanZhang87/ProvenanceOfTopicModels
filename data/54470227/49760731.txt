Neville Page br Writers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods revealed that they considered pitching A Quiet Place as a movie taking place within the Cloverfield universe In an interview with Ben Pearson for Film Beck revealed it was Paramount Pictures that nixed the idea br br It was weird timing though because when we were writing the script Cloverfield Lane was at Paramount We were actually talking to an executive there about this film and it felt from pitch form that there might be crossover but when we finally took the final script in to Paramount they saw it as a totally different movie What was really incredible about the process that we feel very grateful for is the studio embraced this weird movie with no dialogue with open arms They never thought about branding it as a Cloverfield film I think in part because conceptually it was able to stand on its own br Although the film Overlord was initially reported to be the fourth film in the series during its production Abrams eventually announced the film to be a standalone release br In October T J Miller stated on Instagram that the then upcoming film Underwater also featuring Cloverfield Lane star John Gallagher Jr had connections to the Cloververse though both actors would be portraying different characters than they previously portrayed in the franchise However the released version of the film contained no overt references to
