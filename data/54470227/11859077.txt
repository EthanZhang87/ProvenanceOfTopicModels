id: 11859077
The Wallkill Valley Rail Trail is a mile km rail trail and linear park that runs along the former Wallkill Valley Railroad rail corridor in Ulster County New York United States It stretches from Gardiner through New Paltz Rosendale and Ulster to the Kingston city line just south of a demolished concrete Conrail railroad bridge that was located on a team track siding several blocks south of the also demolished Kingston New York Central Railroad passenger station The trail is separated from the Walden Wallkill Rail Trail by two state prisons in Shawangunk though there have been plans to bypass these facilities and to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with other regional rail trails The northern section of the trail forms part of the Empire State Trail br Plans to create the rail trail began as early as when New Paltz considered uses for the then defunct Wallkill Valley rail corridor the railroad had ceased regular traffic in and by had begun to remove its tracks In a local land trust the Wallkill Valley Land Trust purchased the mile km section of the former rail corridor between New Paltz and Gardiner and conveyed the New Paltz section to the town and village of New Paltz with permanent land protection agreements held by the Wallkill Valley Land Trust The trail was formally opened between New Paltz and Gardiner in though Gardiner did not purchase its section from the Wallkill Valley Land Trust until again with a land protection agreement placed on it The length of the trail was effectively doubled by an Ulster County unpaid tax foreclosure land seizure in The Wallkill Valley Land Trust in partnership with Open Space Institute acquired the additional property from Ulster County and began several capital campaigns to open up public access The extension included the Rosendale trestle a foot m bridge across Rondout Creek There are several other bridges that carry the trail though none are as long br The trail serves hikers joggers bikers horseback riders and cross country skiers It passes through several historic districts such as Huguenot Street in New Paltz and the Binnewater Historic District and Snyder Estate in Rosendale The trail also traverses U S Route concurrent with State Route and state routes and Several natural features are visible from clear points along the trail such as the Shawangunk Ridge to the west and the Plattekill Creek between New Paltz and Gardiner The trail passes through dense vegetation and is frequented by many types of animals and overwintering birds br br br History br br Stretching miles km from Montgomery to Kingston the Wallkill Valley Railroad operated from until its last regular freight run on December During the s its owner Conrail began to salvage the former corridor s steel rails and sell off sections of the rail bed State law mandated that in such sales offers must be made first to the state then to the involved counties and municipalities The state bought a mile km portion of rail bed between Shawangunk and Gardiner in November for the construction of the Shawangunk Correctional Facility in the hamlet of Wallkill br While Montgomery and Shawangunk purchased their sections of the railroad and miles and km respectively in eventually creating the mile km Walden Wallkill Rail Trail the towns of New Paltz Gardiner and Rosendale initially declined to purchase their sections of the rail line The town of Shawangunk has been evaluating plans to bypass the state prison to connect the Walden Wallkill and Wallkill Valley trails since and such a connection was listed as a project in a county wide transportation plan The latest proposal involves diverting the trail along Birch Road The Wallkill Valley Rail Trail was the seventeenth rail trail created in New York state and became a National Recreation Trail in br br br New Paltz and Gardiner br br Converting the former corridor to a rail trail was first considered in a environmental report commissioned by the town of New Paltz The study considered repurposing the corridor as a road for cars but determined that the right of way lend ing itself to multiple and simultaneous people oriented transit was ideally suited for use as a trail for hiking strolling running cycling and cross country skiing In New Paltz invited a local non profit the Wallkill Valley Land Trust to acquire the portion of the rail line between New Paltz and Gardiner The Wallkill Valley Land Trust in turn requested assistance from The Trust for Public Land and the purchase was completed on January br While the town and village of New Paltz immediately purchased their sections from the Wallkill Valley Land Trust with conservation easements on them roughly and miles and km respectively Gardiner did not purchase its mile km section until much later again at that time the Wallkill Valley Land Trust stewards held the conservation easements Portions of the New Paltz Gardiner section were informally open since June but the formal opening ceremony of the full mile km trail between New Paltz and Gardiner took place on October br br The Gardiner section was in such a state of disrepair in that the Wallkill Valley Land Trust almost closed it Gardiner received a grant from the New York State Office of Parks Recreation and Historic Preservation in December and the purchase was completed in The state provided an additional to maintain the trail br Purchasing the section allowed Gardiner to fix the drainage problems that had deteriorated the surface of the trail and to ban the use of motor vehicles Though the section was worth the Wallkill Valley Land Trust sold it to Gardiner for br In and the Tea Party movement held protests along the Gardiner section of the trail In November New Paltz received grants from the Greenway Conservancy a state organization to fund several rail trail related projects This included to create a link between the New Paltz section of the trail and the Hudson Valley Rail Trail in nearby Lloyd which was in turn being extended eastward to the Poughkeepsie Bridge the connection with the bridge was completed in October The Wallkill Valley Railroad had considered such a connection after the bridge opened in but never built one The grants also included to create feet m of ADA accessible trail to connect the parking area of a local park named after Sojourner Truth with the rail trail The town had intended to connect the parking area with the trail since the late s but concerns over traffic as well as state requirements had added to the time and cost of the path it was completed by June The connections are part of a county wide plan to create a bicycle path along NY to link regional rail trails br br br Rosendale br br The Rosendale portion of the rail bed runs miles km from Rosendale through Ulster to Kingston and contains the foot long m Rosendale trestle The trestle rises feet m above Rondout Creek and State Route and also spans the former Delaware and Hudson Canal At the time of its construction it was the highest span bridge in the United States br Conrail sold the Rosendale section including the bridge in to a private area businessman John E Rahl for one dollar Rahl maintained that the purchase granted him the right to restore rail service on the whole Wallkill line and to joint ownership of Conrail Between and Rahl installed planking and guard rails on the southern half of the bridge which was then opened to the public He intended to allow bungee jumping off the bridge and did so until a January court order held that it violated zoning laws Douglas Hase an entrepreneur who had run both bungee jumping and hot air ballooning companies tried unsuccessfully in and to get a variance for such a venture br br After Rahl failed to pay in property taxes over a period of three years Ulster County foreclosed on the acre ha property on April The Wallkill Valley Land Trust and Open Space Institute placed a bid on the land parcels comprising the Rosendale section on April and agreed to pay all outstanding taxes before receiving full ownership on July with the intention of adding it to the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail Following an engineering survey the bridge was closed to the public in June for repairs Renovations were completed in allowing for the bridge to be opened to the public br Canopy Development a green development company from Northampton Massachusetts owns a portion of the former rail bed in Rosendale It has agreed to establish a right of way rerouting the trail to allow public access Another obstruction between Rosendale and Ulster is a private swimming pool which will be bypassed The Mohonk Preserve and Open Space Conservancy were given a state grant in March to maintain the portion of the trail by Kingston By the end of summer the last outstanding trail segment along the Rosendale Kingston extension was opened to the public completing the entire mile rail trail br A regional business association has proposed a link between the trail in Rosendale and a series of regional rail trails The proposal would create a mile km network of rail trails across the towns of Marbletown Rochester and Wawarsing Several involved towns have been working toward accomplishing such a connection br br br Route br br The trail begins at Denniston Road in the southern part of the town of Gardiner Movement farther south is impossible because the corridor south of Denniston Road is fenced off by barbed wire After roughly miles km it crosses Sand Hill Road before approaching the hamlet of Gardiner at the mile km mark Once in the hamlet the trail intersects U S Route concurrent with State Route br Located within the hamlet are a defunct former dairy creamery and the site of the former Gardiner railroad station Built in and opened the following year the creamery was one of the dairies that transported its products to New York City by way of the Wallkill Valley Railroad It was originally the property of the Borden family but closed in the s and has since been renovated as an apartment complex The former Gardiner railroad station ceased operations when the rail line closed It became a sporting goods store by a video store by the early s and an antique store by The station burned down on October br The trail crosses Phillies Bridge Road mile km north of the hamlet with an overpass carrying the trail over Forest Glen Road mile km farther The road overlies the Catskill Aqueduct and Delaware Aqueduct Originally supported by trestles and a stone foundation the overpass was rebuilt in during the construction of the Catskill Aqueduct The reconstruction removed the trestles and added a concrete foundation Though a local legend holds that the bridge was originally built in response to the death of a prominent woman at the Forest Glen railroad crossing it is more likely that it was built to maintain the rail line at a consistent grade A little over mile km from the bridge is the site of the former Forest Glen station The trail crosses Bridge Creek Road and Old Ford Road about and mile and km from the Forest Glen bridge respectively before entering the town of New Paltz br br Shortly after entering New Paltz the trail crosses a bridge over Plattekill Creek The masonry for the bridge was completed by late June and trestle work was done by July Originally made of wood the bridge was accidentally set on fire in by ashes or sparks from a passing train This prompted the railroad to coat its rail ties with tin while replacing its wooden bridges with ones made of stone The bridge s original abutments were made of Shawangunk conglomerate It was rebuilt in and crosses the Plattekill Creek at a height of feet m The Shawangunk Ridge is visible from the bridge br Plains Road is shortly after the bridge and the trail continues for mile km before crossing Cedar Lane It crosses Plains Road again after another miles km reaching the Sojourner Truth park in the village of New Paltz The trail is connected to the park via a small footbridge constructed in by the Alexandria Minnesota based construction company Contech It has a weight limit of short tons t and is able to withstand earthquakes br At the edge of the park the trail crosses Water Street and enters the Water Street Market a restored area of boutiques galleries and caf s It then crosses State Route and passes La Stazione the former railroad station The refurbished depot had been originally built in rebuilt after a fire and sold to private interests in The building was in a state of disrepair by the early s but renovated in and converted to an Italian restaurant in Over the next mile km the trail passes North Front Street Broadhead Avenue and Mulberry Street After another mile km the trail traverses Huguenot Street a historic district containing colonial era stone houses Some of the houses date to the late s br br About mile km from Huguenot Street the trail reaches the foot m Springtown bridge spanning the Wallkill River The bridge was originally made of wood and completed by the middle of December but was rebuilt between and using iron by Clarke Reeves Co It was rated by the superintendent of the Wallkill Valley Railroad to be safe for rail traffic as fast as miles per hour km h The bridge s decking and benches were put in place in by volunteers and members of the nearby Hutterite community in the hamlet of Rifton The design of the bridge s railings was influenced by equestrians to better accommodate horses Immediately after the bridge is Springtown Road br The trail continues west of the Wallkill River Roughly miles km from the Springtown bridge the trail crosses Cragswood Road Another mile km farther it reaches the New Paltz Rosendale boundary line continuing another miles km on formerly private property to Mountain Road in the hamlet of Rosendale Restorations to the Rosendale trestle were completed and the bridge was opened to the public in June This added miles km over the Rondout Creek to Kingston crossing Interstate and terminating by State Route The extension passes through the town of Ulster and includes four small bridges between Rosendale and Kingston br br br Recreation br The road between the former railroad station and Water Street Market was the first site of a new town crosswalk system that opened on March Under the new system pedestrians can use flags placed in roadside containers to signal traffic The trail connects with the Sojourner Truth park which has had access to the Wallkill River for kayaking and canoeing since April The Minnewaska Preserve and Mohonk Preserve featuring miles km of combined walkways can be reached through New Paltz br The trail connects to the Binnewater Historic District in Rosendale The district was the location of several local quarries which opened throughout the region after the discovery of rocks capable of producing Rosendale cement in the nearby hamlet of High Falls At its peak the district was producing barrels a year and employed people br Though the Binnewater rail station was once part of the historic district it was located too close to Binnewater Road and was hit repeatedly by trucks until it fell apart in May The station was subsequently demolished by the county highway department Another historic district the Snyder Estate runs along the Rosendale section The Snyder Estate is a former mining site once used by all four major regional cement producers The Rosendale trestle has been the site of numerous picnics barbecues and at least one wedding One person has tried bungee jumping off the bridge without a restraining cord br Several shale outcrops are visible along the trail with views of the Shawangunk Ridge to the west the skytop tower of the Mohonk Mountain House is visible on one of the cliffs Parking for the trail is provided at a municipal lot on Farmers Turnpike in Gardiner In New Paltz there are parking lots at the Sojourner Truth park off Springtown Road at the Huguenot Historical Society and at a Board of Cooperative Educational Services BOCES conference center The trail runs parallel to state routes and there are two park and rides on Route a spot lot in New Paltz and a spot lot in Rosendale There are two bicycle shops along the trail in both Gardiner and New Paltz br br The trail connects to the Binnewater Historic
