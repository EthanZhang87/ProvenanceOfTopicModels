Mikael Blomkvist A co owner for Swedish magazine Millennium Blomkvist is devoted to exposing the corruptions and malfeasance of government attracting infamy for his tendency to go too far br Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander Salander is a computer hacker who has survived severe emotional and sexual abuse The character was a vulnerable victim turned vigilante with the take no prisoners attitude of Lara Croft and the cool unsentimental intellect of Spock Fincher felt that Salander s eccentric persona was enthralling and stated there s a kind of wish fulfillment to her in the way that she takes care of things the way she will only put up with so much but there are other sides to her as well br Christopher Plummer as Henrik Vanger Vanger is a wealthy businessman who launches an extensive investigation into his family s affairs Despite calling the Vanger family dysfunctional Plummer said of the character I love the character of the old man and I sympathize with him He s really the nicest old guy in the whole book Everybody is a bit suspect and still are at the end Old Vanger has a nice straight line and he gets his wish Plummer wanted to imbue the character with irony an element he found to be absent from the novel s Henrik I think that the old man would have it he opined because he s a very sophisticated old guy used to a great deal of power So in dealing with people he would be very good he would be quite jokey and know how to seduce them Julian Sands portrays a young Henrik Vanger br Stellan Skarsg rd as Martin Vanger Martin is the current CEO of Vanger Industries Skarsg rd was allured by the character s dual nature and was fascinated that he got to portray him in two totally different ways Regarding Martin s very complex and complicated personality the Swedish actor said He can be extremely charming but he also can seem to be a completely different person at different points in the film While consulting with Fincher the director wanted Skarsg rd to play Martin without reference to the book br Steven Berkoff as Dirch Frode Head Legal Counsel for Vanger Industries br Robin Wright as Erika Berger Blomkvist s business partner and editor in chief of Millennium magazine She s also Blomkvist s occasional lover br Yorick van Wageningen as Nils Bjurman As Salander s legal guardian he uses his position to sexually abuse her Fincher wanted the character to be worse than a typical antagonist although he did not want to emulate the stereotypical mustache twirling pervert The director considered Van Wageningen to be the embodiment of a versatile actor one who was a full fledged human being and a brilliant actor He was able to bring his performance from a logical place in Bjurman s mind and find the seething morass of darkness inside Fincher stated Bjurman s multifaceted psyche was the main reason Van Wageningen wanted to play the role The Dutch actor said This character goes through a lot and I wasn t quite sure I wanted to go through all that I started out half way between the elation of getting to work with David Fincher and the dread of this character but I was able to use both of those things We both thought the most interesting route would be for Bjurman to seem half affable The challenge was not in finding the freak violence in the guy but finding the humanity of him br Joely Richardson as Harriet Vanger Henrik s long lost grandniece who went into hiding posing as her cousin Anita In performing her tricky character Richardson recalled that Fincher wanted her to embrace a darker edgier persona without sugarcoating and not resolved or healed Even if you were starting to move towards the direction of resolved or healed he still wanted it edgy and dark There are no straightforward emotions in the world of this film Moa Garpendal portrays a young Harriet Vanger br Goran Vi nji as Dragan Armansky head of Milton Security Salander s employer br Donald Sumpter as Detective Morell David Dencik

lodie Yung as Miriam Wu Salander s occasional lover br Joel Kinnaman as Christer Malm br br br Production br br br Conception and writing br The success of Stieg Larsson s novel created Hollywood interest in adapting the book as became apparent in when Sony s Michael Lynton and Amy Pascal pursued the idea of developing an American version unrelated to the Swedish film adaptation released that year By December two major developments occurred for the project Steven Zaillian who had recently completed the script for Moneyball became the screenwriter while producer Scott Rudin finalized a partnership allocating full copyrights to Sony Zaillian who was unfamiliar with the novel got a copy from Rudin The screenwriter recalled They sent it to me and said We want to do this We will think of it as one thing for now It s possible that it can be two and three but let s concentrate on this one After reading the book the screenwriter did no research on the subject br Fincher who was requested with partner Cean Chaffin by Sony executives to read the novel br was astounded by the series size and success As they began to read the duo noticed that it had a tendency to take readers on a lot of side trips from detailed explanations of surveillance techniques to angry attacks on corrupt Swedish industrialists professed The Hollywood Reporter s Gregg Kilday Fincher recalled of the encounter The ballistic ripping yarn thriller aspect of it is kind of a red herring in a weird way It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together but it is their relationship you keep coming back to I was just wondering what pages Zaillian would get rid of Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay the director avoided interfering After a conversation Fincher was comfortable they were headed in the same direction br br The writing process consumed approximately six months including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel Zaillian noted that as time progressed the writing accelerated As soon as you start making decisions he explained you start cutting off all of the other possibilities of things that could happen So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do Given the book s sizable length Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher s desired running time Even so Zaillan took significant departures from the book To Zaillian there was always a low grade anxiety but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease he continued I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could and push that out of my mind I didn t change anything just for the sake of changing it There s a lot right about the book but that part I thought we could do it a different way and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it br Zaillian discussed many of the themes in Larsson s Millennium series with Fincher taking the pair deeper into the novel s darker subjects such as the psychological dissimilarities between rapists and murderers Fincher was familiar with the concept from projects such as Seven and Zodiac Zaillian commented A rapist or at least our rapist is about exercising his power over somebody A serial killer is about destruction they get off on destroying something It s not about having power over something it s about eliminating it What thrills them is slightly different The duo wanted to expose the novels pivotal themes particularly misogyny We were committed to the tack that this is a movie about violence against women about specific kinds of degradation and you can t shy away from that But at the same time you have to walk a razor thin line so that the audience can viscerally feel the need for revenge but also see the power of the ideas being expressed Instead of the typical three act structure they reluctantly chose a five act structure which Fincher pointed out is very similar to a lot of TV cop dramas br br br Casting br Craig competed with George Clooney Johnny Depp Viggo Mortensen and Brad Pitt as candidates for the role of Blomkvist Initial concerns over schedule conflicts with the production of Cowboys Aliens and Skyfall prompted Craig to postpone the casting process Given the uncertainty surrounding Skyfall following Metro Goldwyn Mayer s bankruptcy Sony Pictures Entertainment and DreamWorks worked out a schedule and Craig agreed to take the part The British actor was required to gain weight and adopted a neutral accent to befit Stockholm s worldly cultural fabric Having read the book amid its initial craze Craig commented It s one of those books you just don t put down There s just this immediate feeling that bad things are going to happen and I think that s part of why they ve been so readable for people br Casting of Salander was complicated by the raft of prominent candidates such as Emily Browning Eva Green Anne Hathaway Scarlett Johansson Keira Knightley Jennifer Lawrence Carey Mulligan Elliot Page Natalie Portman L a Seydoux Vanessa Hudgens Sophie Lowe Sarah Snook Kristen Stewart Olivia Thirlby Mia Wasikowska Emma Watson Evan Rachel Wood and Yolandi Visser Lowe Mara Seydoux and Snook were the final four candidates Despite the hype some eventually withdrew from consideration due to the time commitment and low pay Mara had worked with Fincher in his film The Social Network Fincher while fond of the actress youthful appearance found it difficult at first to mold her to match Salander s antisocial demeanor which was a vast contrast from her earlier role as the personable Erica Mara went through multiple changes in her appearance to become Salander Her hair was dyed black and cut into various jagged points giving the appearance that she cut it herself In addition to her transgressive appearance which was described as a mash up of brazen Seventies punk and spooky Eighties goth with a dash of S M temptress by Lynn Hirschberg of W Mara participated in a formal screening and was filmed by Fincher on a subway in Los Angeles in an effort to persuade the executives of Sony Pictures that she was a credible choice br br br Filming br br Fincher and Zaillian s central objective was to maintain the novel s setting To portray Larsson s vision of Sweden and the interaction of light on its landscape Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company s RED MX digital camera chosen to help evoke Larsson s tone The idea according to Cronenweth was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective So there may be shadows there may be flaws but it s reality You allow silhouettes and darkness but at the same time we also wanted shots to counter that so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image Sweden s climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood Cronenweth commented It s always an element in the background and it was very important that you feel it as an audience member The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low cool colored light that is super soft and non direct To get acquainted with Swedish culture Burt set out on a month long expedition across the country He said of the process It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture the landscape the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations but the metaphysics of them and how the way people live comes out through design br Principal photography began in Stockholm Sweden in September Production mostly took place at multiple locations in the city s central business district including at the Stockholm Court House One challenge was realizing the Vanger estate They picked an eighteenth century French architecture mansion Hofsta located approximately miles km southwest of Stockholm Filmmakers wanted to use a typical manor from Sm land that was solemn formal and very Old Money The Swedish are very good at the modern and the minimal but they also have these wonderful country homes that can be juxtaposed against the modern city yet both speak to money Principal photography relocated in October to Uppsala On Queen Street the facade of the area was renovated to mimic the Hotel Alder after an old photograph of a building obtained by Fincher From December onward production moved to Zurich Switzerland where locations were established at Dolder Grand Hotel and the Zurich Airport Because of the beautiful environment of the city Fincher found it difficult to film in the area Principal photography concluded in Oslo Norway where production took place at Oslo Airport Gardermoen Recorded for over fifteen hours twelve extras were sought for background roles Filming also took place in the United Kingdom and the United States br In one sequence the character Martin Vanger plays the song Orinoco Flow by Enya before beginning his torture of Mikael Blomkvist David Fincher the director said that he believed that Martin doesn t like to kill he doesn t like to hear the screams without hearing his favorite music so therefore the character should play a song during the scene Daniel Craig the actor who played Blomkvist selected Orinoco Flow on his iPod as a candidate song Fincher said And we all almost pissed ourselves we were laughing so hard No actually it s worse than that He said Orinoco Flow Everybody looked at each other like what is he talking about And he said You know Sail away sail away And I thought this guy is going to make Blomkvist as metro as we need br br br Title sequence br br Tim Miller creative director for the title sequence wanted to develop an abstract narrative that reflected the pivotal moments in the novel as well as the character development of Lisbeth Salander It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly given that Salander s occupation was a distinctive part of her personality His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard We were going to treat the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys Miller explained Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys Among Miller s many vignettes was The Hacker Inside which revealed the character s inner disposition and melted them away The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more cyberpunk appearance than the final product In creating the cyber look for Salander Miller said Every time I would show David a design he would say More Tandy It s the shitty little computers from Radio Shack the Tandy computers They probably had vacuum tubes in them really old technology And David would go More Tandy until we ended up with something that looked like we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together br Fincher wanted the vignette to be a personal nightmare for Salander replaying her darkest moments Early on we knew it was supposed to feel like a nightmare Miller professed who commented that early on in the process Fincher wanted to use an artwork as a template for the sequence After browsing through various paintings to no avail Fincher chose a painting that depicted the artist covered in black paint standing in the middle of a gallery Many of Miller s sketches contained a liquid like component and were rewritten to produce the gooey element that was so desired David said let s just put liquid in all of them and it will be this primordial dream ooze that s a part of every vignette Miller recalled It ties everything together other than the black on black br The title sequence includes abundant references to the novel and exposes several political themes Salander s tattoos such as her phoenix and dragon tattoos were incorporated The multiple flower representations signified the biological life cycle as well as Henrik who received a pressed flower each year on his birthday One had flowers coming out of this black ooze said Fincher it blossoms and then it dies And then a different flower as that one is dying is rising from the middle of it It was supposed to represent this cycle of the killer sending flowers Ultimately the vignette becomes very conceptual because Miller and his team took a whole thought and cut it up into multiple different shots that are mixed in with other shots In one instance Blomkvist is strangled by strips of newspaper a metaphor for the establishment squelching his exposes br In the Hot Hands vignette a pair of rough distorted hands that embrace Salander s face and melt it represent all that s bad in men The hands that embrace Blomkvist s face and shatter it represent wealth and power Themes of domestic violence become apparent as a woman s face shatters after a merciless beating this also ties in the brutal beating of Salander s mother by her father an event revealed in the sequel The Girl Who Played with Fire br A cover of Led Zeppelin s Immigrant Song plays throughout the title sequence The rendition was produced by soundtrack composers Atticus Ross and Nine Inch Nails member Trent Reznor and features vocals from Yeah Yeah Yeahs lead singer Karen O Fincher suggested the song but Reznor agreed only at his request Led Zeppelin licensed the song only for use in the film s trailer and title sequence Fincher stated that he sees title sequences as an opportunity to set the stage for the film or to get an audience to let go of its preconceptions br Software packages that were primarily used are ds Max for modeling lighting rendering Softimage for rigging and animation Digital Fusion for compositing Real Flow for fluid dynamics Sony Vegas for editorial ZBrush and Mudbox for organic modeling and VRAY for rendering br br br Soundtrack br br Fincher recruited Reznor and Ross to produce the score aside from their successful collaboration on The Social Network the duo had worked together on albums from Nine Inch Nails later discography They dedicated much of the year to work on the film as they felt it would appeal to a broad audience Akin to his efforts in The Social Network Reznor experiments with acoustics and blends them with elements of electronic music resulting in a forbidding atmosphere We wanted to create the sound of coldness emotionally and also physically he asserted We wanted to take lots of acoustic instruments and transplant them into a very inorganic setting and dress the set around them with electronics br Even before viewing the script Reznor and Ross opted to use a redolent approach to creating the film s score After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions the duo spent six weeks composing We composed music we felt might belong stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist and then we d run it by Fincher to see where his head s at and he responded positively He was filming at this time last year and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like and he was inserting our music at that point rather than using temp music which is how it usually takes place apparently Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task We weren t working on a finished thing so everything keeps moving around scenes are changing in length and even the order of things are shuffled around and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of Everything is in flux and approach it as such Hopefully it ll work out in the end br br br Release br br br Pre release br br A screening for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo took place on November as part of a critics only event hosted

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br David Denby of The New Yorker asserted that the austere but captivating installment presented a glancing chilled view of a world where succinct moments of loyalty coexisted with constant trials of betrayal To USA Today columnist Claudia Puig Fincher captures the menace and grim despair in the frosty Scandinavian landscape by carefully approaching its most gruesome features Puig noted a surfeit of stylistic flourishes and intriguing changes in the narrative compared to the original film In his three and a half star review Chris Knight of the National Post argued that it epitomized a so called paradoxical position that was both immensely enjoyable and completely unnecessary Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald said that the fabulously sinister entertainment surpassed the original film in every way The film took two and a half stars from Rolling Stone commentator Peter Travers who concluded Fincher s Girl is gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark A O Scott writing for The New York Times admired the moments of brilliantly orchestrated anxiety and confusion but felt that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was vulnerable to the lumbering proceduralism that he saw in its literary counterpart as evident with the long stretches of drab hackneyed exposition that flatten the atmosphere The Wall Street Journal s Joe Morgenstern praised Cronenweth s cinematography which he thought provided for glossy alterations in the film s darkness Stockholm glitters in nighttime exteriors and its subway shines in a spectacular spasm of action involving a backpack Rex Reed of The New York Observer professed that despite its occasional incomprehensibility the movie was technically superb and superbly acted br The performances were a frequent topic in the critiques Mara s performance in particular was admired by commentators A revelation in the eyes of Entertainment Weekly s Owen Gleiberman he proclaimed that her character was more important than her ability to solve a crime Her hypnotic portrayal was noted by Justin Chang of Variety as well as Salon critic Andrew O Hehir who wrote Rooney Mara is a revelation as Lisbeth Salander the damaged aggressive computer geek and feminist revenge angel playing the character as far more feral and vulnerable than Noomi Rapace s borderline stereotype sexpot Goth girl Scott Tobias of The A V Club enjoyed the chemistry between Mara and Craig as did David Germain of the Associated Press Mara and Craig make an indomitable screen pair he nominally leading their intense search into decades old serial killings she surging ahead plowing through obstacles with flashes of phenomenal intellect and eruptions of physical fury Although Puig found Mara inferior to Rapace in playing Salander with regard to Craig s performance he said that the actor shone This was supported by Morgenstern who avouched that Craig nonetheless finds welcome humor in Mikael s impassive affect Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times said the film was given a more assured quality than the original because of Fincher s direction and the lead performances although he believed this did not always work to the film s advantage preferring the original version s less confident surface where emotions were closer to the surface br br br Accolades br In addition to numerous awards The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was included on several year end lists by film commentators and publications It was named the best film of by MTV and James Berardinelli of ReelViews The former wrote The director follows up the excellent Social Network with another tour de force injecting the murder mystery that introduces us to outcast hacker Lisbeth Salander and embattled journalist with style intensity and relentless suspense Mara is a revelation and the film s daunting minute runtime breezes by thanks to one heart racing scene after the next Dark and tough to watch at times but a triumph all around The film came second in indieWire s list of Drew Taylor s Favorite Films Of while reaching the top ten of seven other publications including the St Louis Post Dispatch San Francisco Chronicle and the New Orleans Times Picayune The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was declared one of the best films of the year by the American Film Institute as

to the script being written by Steven Zaillian By July Andrew Kevin Walker was hired to re write the script The following year Fincher stated that a script for The Girl Who Played with Fire had been written and that it was extremely different from the book and that despite the long delay he was confident that the film would be made given that the studio already has spent millions of dollars on the rights and the script Mara was less optimistic about the production of the sequels despite expressing her interest in appearing in them br By November it was announced that Sony was proceeding
