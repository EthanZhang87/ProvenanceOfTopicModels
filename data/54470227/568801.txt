audiences have been critical of elements of Bay s filmmaking style such as the overuse of Dutch angles extreme patriotism overly broad and sophomoric humor excessive product placement oversaturated orange and teal color grading reusing footage from his previous films and his preference of action and spectacle over story and characters with his film s excessive use of explosions often being
