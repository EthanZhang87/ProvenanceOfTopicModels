Lewton and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers None of the other passengers except Clear believes Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take off Afterwards the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents Weine and Schreck who are both suspicious of Alex br Thirty nine days later after attending a memorial service for the victims an unusual chain reaction causes Tod to be accidentally hanged in his shower that night While his death is ruled a suicide Alex sneaks into the funeral home along with Clear to examine Tod s corpse The home s mortician William Bludworth reveals that the survivors who escaped from the impending circumstance have disrupted Death s plan who is now claiming the lives of those who were meant to die from the accident Alex and Clear are discussing their next move when the rest of the survivors arrive outside the caf where Terry is run over and killed by a speeding bus br After watching a news report on the cause of the explosion Alex

and producers Billy Hitchcock is named after Alfred Hitchcock the Browning family and Tod Waggner are named after Tod Browning Larry Murnau is a reference to Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Blake Dreyer to Carl Theodor Dreyer Valerie Lewton to Val Lewton Agent Schreck to Max Schreck Terry Chaney to Lon Chaney Christa Marsh recalls Fredric March Agent Weine of Robert Wiene and George Waggner is directly named after Universal Horror film producer George Waggner br br The original idea was written by Jeffrey Reddick as a spec script for The X Files in order to get a TV agent I was actually flying home to Kentucky and I read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said Don t take the flight tomorrow I have a really bad feeling about it She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed said Reddick I thought that s creepy what if she was supposed to die on that flight Building on his idea Reddick wrote a script and got an agent but instead of submitting the script to The X Files he acted on the suggestion of a colleague at New Line Cinema to write it as a feature film br New Line Cinema bought Reddick s treatment and hired him to write the original draft of the script which featured Death as an unseen force The survivors were originally adults but New Line made Reddick changed them to teenagers after the success of Scream After the script was finished New Line Cinema submitted the script to directors including writing partners James Wong and Glen Morgan Both writers were willing to make it into a film although they rewrote the script to comply with their standards I believe that at one time or another we ve all experienced a sense of prescience We have a hunch a feeling and then that hunch proves true Wong said We want to do for planes and air travel what Jaws did for sharks and swimming Expanding on his decision to write and direct the film Wong stated br br One thing we were all in agreement on from the start is that we didn t want to do a slasher movie I became very excited when we decided to make the world at large in the service of death our antagonist Everyday objects and occurrences then take on ominous proportions and it becomes less about whether or not our characters are going to die and more about how they will die and how they can delay their deaths The entertainment value is in the ride not in the outcome and by placing the premise of the film on the inevitability of death we play a certain philosophical note br Morgan said br br The main thing they wanted about Death coming to get people is that you never saw a kind of a Michael Myers figure You never saw a killer And they liked that idea and they said Okay Go write it Once we had a basic story I started cataloging the strange coincidences in my own life For example I was in the Vancouver airport waiting for a flight when John Denver came on over the loudspeaker I remember saying to myself Hey he just died in a plane crash that s a little weird We wrote that version of that experience into the script br Producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide Perry Productions helped with the film s budget because both were similarly fascinated about the idea of an invisible force executing its victims Perry a fan of The X Files claimed that he responded to Wong and Morgan s work for one specific reason dread New Line Cinema accepted financing and distributing rights for the film after Reddick came to them personally br br One of the most important things we were looking for in casting was the actors ability to play the subtleties the little things that a character doesn t say or do that create the edge the things that get under your skin and spook you Morgan said about the auditions br Reddick originally envisioned Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst for the lead roles br Alex Browning the last role cast went to Canadian actor Devon Sawa who previously starred in the film Idle Hands Sawa said that when he read the script on a plane he found himself peeking out the window at the engine every couple of minutes Then he went down and met Glen and Jim and he thought they were amazing and already had some great ideas However Morgan and Wong were undecided about casting him for the part so they requested him to perform again as they reviewed his previous works Morgan was astounded by Sawa s performance in Idle Hands and Sawa was hired Of the script Sawa said There s not a lot of good stuff for my age You get a lot of scripts and all but they re teen ensembles and they re just crap And then I got Flight it s just awesome br Sawa described his role as in the beginning Alex was kinda loopy and cotter and you know probably not the most popular guy in school I think he might have been a dork you know doing their stuff and they had their own thing going and they re after the two beautiful girls in school but there s no chance of that happening I guess after the plane goes down his world completely changes Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible Wong said He doesn t appear as if he s supremely self assured He s more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero Perry was amazed by Sawa s vulnerability in acting describing him as a very distinctive actor He s very loose and he s kind of a cut up when he s not on camera but the moment the camera s on I d never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment br Ali Larter who starred in the film Varsity Blues was cast as female lead Clear Rivers The film shows how easy it is to turn on someone to blame someone when you re scared Larter said It s also about trusting your intuitions and yourself She defined her part as that girl who has a lot of loss in her life and has fallen for herself and had made a life within that She s an artist she lives by herself and she s kinda holding to her grip for what the world has given her br Seann William Scott famous for portraying Steve Stifler in the film American Pie was hired as class clown Billy Hitchcock Scott admired the film and felt that it s as dark and eerie as any Twilight Zone He laughed at his role saying that he is lacking some social skills he doesn t have quite a few friends and he s like the tag along Scott was surprised when in the script his character was written as fat The writers eventually changed it for Scott br Dawson s Creek star Kerr Smith was cast as jock Carter Horton Smith identified Carter as your typical high school bully whose life depends on anger and mentioned the fact that Carter feared Alex not having control of his own life br Kristen Cloke Morgan s wife was cast as teacher Valerie Lewton I have incredible respect for them said Cloke Jim s the kind of director who knows exactly what he wants As an actor I can find a way to get there if I know specifically what I m going for and Jim gives me that The fact that he won t move on until he s got exactly what he wants creates a safe environment which allows me to experiment and try different things Cloke described her part as strong and sassy in control After the crash she comes unglued probably more than any of the kids and it s a quick drastic change I had to understand the psychology of a person who can turn on a dime like that br Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad Donella were cast as students Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner respectively When I first read the script the thing that struck me most was that the characters were well written and the relationships between them were strong and believable Detmer said That s important because you have to care about these people in order to be worried about what might happen to them Detmer defined Terry as very put together and seems content to defer to Carter to not make waves But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her On the other hand Donella observed how similar his role was to himself I believe in fate I think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you re taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan br Tony Todd who played Candyman in the film Candyman was cast as mortician William Bludworth Morgan initially wanted Todd for the role because he felt his deep voice would give the film an eerie tone br Additional cast members included Daniel Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith as FBI agents Weine and Schreck Brendan Fehr Christine Chatelain and Lisa Marie Caruk as students George Waggner Blake Dreyer and Christa Marsh Barbara Tyson and Robert Wisden as Barbara and Ken Browning Alex s parents and Forbes Angus as teacher Larry Murnau br br With Final Destination cast filming took place on Long Island for the plane scene and Vancouver Island for the additional scenes The cast members were filming other projects during production so filming schedules had to be moved repeatedly for all of the cast to appear Sawa restrained his appearance in The Guilty during production and even commented that he had to share a trailer with Bill Pullman because it was bigger and would make him look more famous Smith who was a regular in Dawson s Creek had to hold episodes for the film br According to Detmer her death scene being rammed by a speeding bus was filmed first because it was easy but much anticipated All death scenes were filmed using lifecasts of the actual actors The death scenes the memorial the forest scene and the scenes in Paris were all filmed in Victoria Additional scenes were filmed in Toronto and San Francisco For the airport the crew used Vancouver International Airport as a stand in for John F Kennedy International Airport the airport mentioned in the film br br The plan behind the scenes was to create an intriguing visual signature To serve the subtleties of the script and to help personify death production designer John Willet developed the concept of skewing the sets What I ve tried to do with the sets themselves with their design and with various color choices is to make things just a little unnatural Willet explained Nothing that calls attention to itself but instead creates a sense of uneasiness the unsettling feeling that something s not quite right To achieve this mystique Willet designed two versions of virtually every set one version was used before the crash and the other sets were used for scenes after the jet explodes br On the skewed sets I force the perspective either vertically or horizontally Willet explained Nothing is square and although you can t put your finger on it it just makes you feel like something is not right Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design In the real world the colors are bright and rich Willet said In the skewed world they re washed out and faded Nothing is obvious and it s only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic br The plane scene during which passengers die in mid air was created inside a very large sound stage The three ton hydraulic gimbal was operated automatically We spent two months building this central set piece that weighs about pounds and holds people special effects supervisor Terry Sonderhoff explained Used for filming the onboard sequences it could be shifted on the gimbal to create a pitching movement of up to degrees side to side and degrees front to back realistically conveying the horror of airborne engine failure Sawa said that the screams of the cast inside the gimbal made it appear more real Wong said You walk into the studio and there s a huge gimbal with a plane on top and you think What have I done I was afraid we were gonna have extras vomiting br A miniature model of the Boeing airplane was created for the explosion scene The model one of the most detailed miniature scenes in the film was about feet long and feet wide and the landing gear was made from all machined metals According to visual effects supervisor Ariel Velasco Shaw the miniature had to be launched about feet up into the air to make it look like a real Boeing exploded into a fireball If blowing up a four foot plane the explosion must be a minimum of eight feet in the air To film the explosion in detail the crew used three cameras running frames per second and one camera running frames per second if they had filmed using a real time camera the succession of the explosion would not be filmed in a particular order br The train scene in which Carter s car is smashed by the train was one of the most difficult scenes to shoot The car used for the crash was a replica of the original severed in half prior to filming According to Sonderhoff in order to ensure the safety of the actors they had to make sure that there was no real sheet metal in the car br For the death scenes the crew used several lifecasts of the actors and chocolate syrup for fake blood Creating the Rube Goldberg effect for Ms Lewton s death scene was the most difficult to plan according to the crew Perry said that it was very hard to generate an atmosphere of dread to create suspense out of scenes that are common br br No official album accompanied the motion picture However six songs are featured in the film the most prominent of which is Rocky Mountain High by John Denver which is heavily highlighted throughout the film reminding the survivors that Denver died in a plane crash The song is heard either before an accident or a character s demise and is also played by a street performer Alessandro Juliani in French Other songs featured in the film include Hundred Grand by Pete Atherton during the Flight memorial scene Into the Void by Nine Inch Nails during the caf scene All the Candles in the World by Jane Siberry during Carter s car scene as well as And When I Die performed by Joe during the end credits br br Final Destination The Complete Original Motion Picture Score was released on March The film s score was conducted by Daytime Emmy Award winning composer Shirley Walker Wong and Morgan initially wanted Walker to score the film after having previously worked with her on their sci fi television series Space Above and Beyond Walker said Morgan and Wong are great believers in melody and having music for the characters and situations they find themselves in Of course the atmosphere had to be there also especially for a film with as much suspense building as this film has br The score is mostly low key with the exception of the suspense and death scenes It was performed by a union orchestra obliging New Line Cinema to grant the film its own score Walker described her score as very theme driven conservative music that covers the range from bizarre animal noises with stronger visceral impact to stirring emotional music with well defined melodies that evolve through the storytelling The Main Title piece used for the opening credits was rare for opening a film aimed at a youth audience at the time What a treat for me to get to write a piece that calls you into the movie and lets you know something bad is going to happen from the get go Walker said According to Walker Main Title consumed most of her time due to its dark theme and counter melody which carries throughout the score br The score was positively received by critics Judge Harold Jervais of DVD Verdict wrote how the sound effects dialogue and Walker s wonderfully creepy and effective score are mixed together to form a very pleasing almost organic like whole Mike Long of DVD Review said that Shirley Walker s eerie score comes across powerfully with a wide spatial integration Derek Germano of The Cinema Laser wrote that Walker s creepy musical score is really a winner and is one of the things that will help to make Final Destination a minor genre classic a few years down the road br br The film premiered on March in theaters across the United States and Canada earning

side Stephen Holden of The New York Times said that even by the crude standards of teenage horror Final Destination is dramatically flat Kevin Maynard of Mr Showbiz described the film as crude and witless Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote that your own final destination just might be the box office to demand your money back br Jay Carr of The Boston Globe commented that it starts by cheating death and ends by cheating us Lisa Alspector of the Chicago Reader described the film as disturbing if less sophisticated than the best SF science fiction horror TV Luke Thompson of the Dallas Observer found it a waste of a decent premise Ernest Hardy of LA Weekly said that the film fails because it takes itself both too seriously and not seriously enough Barbara Shulgasser of the Chicago Tribune said that it met the low standards of a mediocre TV movie Walter Addiego of the San Francisco Examiner thought it was stupid silly and gory br The film gathered positive reviews from several top critics Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times enjoyed the film and gave it three out of four stars stating that Final Destination will no doubt be a hit and inspire the obligatory sequels Like the original Scream this movie is too good to be the end of the road I have visions of my own He also pointed out the similarities between the circumstances of the plane crash depicted in the movie and the real life crash of TWA Flight in traveling from New York to Paris and carrying students which he described as being in the worst possible taste Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film saying it was playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film saying it generates a respectable amount of suspense and takes a few unexpected turns while covering familiar territory while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said it was a terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun found the film fitfully thrilling Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide called the film serviceable enough if you come to it with sufficiently modest expectations Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle stated the film was a flawed but often entertaining teen horror flick br Despite the film s generally mixed reception critics praised Sawa s performance as Alex David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews remarked Sawa s personable turn as the hero is matched by a uniformly effective supporting cast rife with familiar faces i e Seann William Scott Brendan Fehr Tony Todd etc while Leydon stated that Sawa is credible as the second sighted Alex unlike many other actors cast teen protagonists he actually looks like he might still be attending high school but the supporting players are an uneven bunch LaSalle praised Sawa and Ali Larter s pairing saying that Larter and Sawa who becomes more scruffy and wild eyed as the film progresses make an appealing pair br br The film had a major impact on the horror film audience earning the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film in Sawa won the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor the same year and
