highly of the serious dialogue in the episode noting that if there s been a consistent element to Paul Lieberstein s work on this show it s that he understands what makes the main characters tick and is able to use that for real emotional resonance When the show wants to give Jim or Pam or Dwight or now Andy a quiet emotional moment it s usually still able to do so very well and that includes most of Andy and Darryl s interaction here in Lotto He was however more critical of the episode s humor noting that many of the gags had been done before The A V Club reviewer Myles McNutt called the episode superior to the previous episode commenting that While perhaps not monumentally better than last week s outing and damaged by a weak B story Lotto had a greater sense of purpose that holds greater value to the season as it moves forward He also complimented the writers for not focusing too much on Andy He ultimately gave the episode a B br Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a seven

inspiring speech from Andy to Darryl Despite the lackluster rating Forcella wrote that the episode had its fair share of hilarious moments Screencrave reviewer Jeffrey Hyatt awarded the episode a six out of ten and wrote that the episode was not an A plus episode but the show still delivered some kick ass dialogue that had me laughing out loud br Critical reception to Jim Dwight Kevin and Erin in the warehouse was more mixed Sepinwall criticized the warehouse subplot for selling them the characters out for the sake of a joke Forcella who gave the majority of the episode a positive review was
