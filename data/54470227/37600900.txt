Anti abortion movements also self styled as pro life movements are involved in the abortion debate advocating against the practice of abortion and its legality Many anti abortion movements began as countermovements in response to the legalization of elective abortions br br br Historical br In the th century United States Anthony Comstock launched an anti vice crusade that included opposition to contraception and abortion He successfully got the US congress to pass laws later known as the Comstock laws that included provisions that made it illegal to send materials used for abortion through the mail These laws have been referenced by modern anti abortion campaigners in the US and cited in court cases to stop the mailing of abortion medication br br br Europe br br In Europe abortion law varies by country and has been legalized through parliamentary acts in some countries and constitutionally banned or heavily restricted in others In Western Europe this has had the effect at once of both more closely regulating the use of abortion and at the same time mediating and reducing the impact anti abortion campaigns have had on the law br br br France br br The first specifically anti abortion organization in France Laissez les vivre SOS futures m res was created in during the debate that was to lead to the Veil Law in Its main spokesman was the geneticist J r me Lejeune Since the French anti abortion movement has organized an annual March for Life br The abortion laws of France have not been entirely repealed leading to ambiguity in the nation s policies By Simone Veil the minister for health introduced legislation that specifically in cases of distress tolerated abortion up to ten weeks Abortions after this date are only cleared by the government if the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or will result in the birth of a child with a severe and incurable disease After twelve weeks abortion except for therapeutic abortion under the terms of Article of the Criminal Code is a crime punishable by months to years in prison a fine of between and Francs and loss of professional license br Catholics and right wing political groups continue to protest abortion The far right party National Rally formerly National Front has attempted unsuccessfully to decrease funding for abortions br br br Ireland br br There are several major anti abortion groups in the Republic of Ireland including Pro Life Campaign Youth Defence and the Iona Institute The Thirty sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland provided for legal abortion in Ireland but several anti abortion parties still campaign including Aont and the National Party br br br Liechtenstein br br In Liechtenstein an application to legalize abortions was rejected by a slim majority in a referendum in The opponents which included Prince Alois got votes more and eventually settled at percent compared with percent br Prince Alois had announced the use of his veto in advance if necessary to prevent the introduction of abortion br br br Russia br br Abortion is legal in Russia as an elective procedure up to the th week of pregnancy and in special circumstances at later stages The abortion issue gained renewed attention in in a debate that The New York Times says has begun to sound like the debate in the United States Parliament passed and President Dmitri Medvedev signed several restrictions on abortion into law to combat a falling birthrate and plunging population The restrictions include requiring abortion providers to devote of advertising costs to describing the dangers of abortion to a woman s health and make it illegal to describe abortion as a safe medical procedure Medvedev s wife Svetlana Medvedeva has taken up the anti abortion cause in Russia in a weeklong national campaign against abortion called Give Me Life and a Day of Family Love and Faithfulness by her Foundation for Social and Cultural Initiatives in conjunction with the Russian Orthodox Church br br br Spain br br In Spain over one million demonstrators took part in a march in Madrid in October to protest plans by the government of Jos Luis Zapatero to legalize elective abortions and eliminate parental consent restrictions br br br United Kingdom br br In the United Kingdom the most prominent anti abortion organization is the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children It was formed at the time of the passage of the Abortion Act which liberalized abortion law The group campaigns against abortion often using questionable claims and supports protests at pregnancy clinics The Abortion Act of had a significant effect in Britain excluding Northern Ireland The Act states that if at least two doctors deem the reasons for abortion to be in alignment with the Act it can legally be performed This still means that the punishment for women who obtain abortions contrary to the Act are faced with potential life imprisonment Doctors too can be prosecuted if they are found administering abortions without reasonable cause The Abortion Act of did not apply in Northern Ireland Women living there who sought abortions either had to travel to Britain to receive an abortion or potentially face criminal charges for purchasing abortion pills illegally br To this day anti abortion activists routinely stand outside many abortion clinics their goal is to discourage women from entering the clinics This is through two processes known as prayer vigils which are sometimes quiet and other times said aloud to actively dissuade and pavement counseling where activists approach women entering clinics in order to persuade them to continue with their pregnancies This is a practice held in low regard by many as it causes anxiety and distress br br br Middle East br br br Israel br br In Israel the major anti abortion organization is Efrat Efrat activists primarily raise funds to relieve the financial and social pressures on pregnant women so that they will not terminate their pregnancies However this activity is only carried out in the Jewish sector in Israeli society as Efrat officially views abortion among Jews as a demographic threat to the Jewish people br br br Americas br br br United States br br The United States anti abortion movement formed as a response to the landmark Roe v Wade and Doe v Bolton U S Supreme Court decisions with many anti abortion organizations having emerged since then There is also a smaller consistent life ethic movement favoring a philosophy which opposes all forms of killing including abortion war euthanasia and capital punishment br The current movement is in part a continuation of previous debates on abortion that led to the practice being banned in all states by the late th century The initial movement was led by physicians but also included politicians and feminists Among physicians advances in medical knowledge played a significant role in influencing anti abortion opinion Quickening which had previously been thought to be the point at which the soul entered a human was discovered to be a relatively unimportant step in fetal development caused many medical professionals to rethink their positions on early term abortions Ideologically the Hippocratic Oath and the medical mentality of that age to defend the value of human life as an absolute also played a significant role in molding opinions about abortion br Meanwhile many th century feminists tended to regard abortion as an undesirable necessity forced upon women by thoughtless men The free love wing of the feminist movement refused to advocate abortion and treated the practice as an example of the hideous extremes to which modern marriage was driving women Marital rape and the seduction of unmarried women were societal ills which feminists believed caused the need to abort as men did not respect women s right to abstinence br Anti abortion groups like Students for Life of America and Susan B Anthony Pro Life America are at times associated with conservatism Other groups such as Focus on the Family are considered a part of the Christian right They call themselves pro life because they are often united in their belief that a fetus is a person that has legal rights Since the U S Supreme Court decision Dobbs v Jackson Women s Health Organization some of these organizations have turned their attention to banning abortions at the state and local level and asking the U S Supreme Court to recognize fetal personhood under the Constitution br br br Canada br br A Conservative MP Cathay Wagantall introduced a bill in seeking to ban abortions for the purpose of choosing a child s sex Abortion in Canada is legal at all stages of pregnancy and funded in part by the Canada Health Act In the Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper barred the members of Parliament from discussing the matter in the Commons Harper s move was linked to his repeated declarations that he wouldn t allow the abortion debate to be re opened Since the s at least forty three private member bills that are against abortion have been sent to the House of Commons yet none of them have been passed Canadian anti abortion discourse increasingly aims at changing cultural values more than legislation is explicitly framed as pro woman largely avoids appealing to religious grounds and relies on a new abortion harms women argument that has supplanted and transformed traditional fetal personhood arguments br Since Catholics and allies have held national anti abortion March for Life rallies at Parliament Hill Two have gathered over protesters In addition to the national protests anti abortionists protest abortion clinics across the nation in attempts to stop abortions from continuing br br br Australia br br A number of anti abortion organizations exist in Australia including Cherish Life Right to Life Australia and Australian Christian Lobby These organizations undertake various campaigning activities including political campaign fundraising br A large portion of Australian law surrounding abortion was originally derived from the British law Until British law stated that an induced abortion is unlawful in all situations save the probable exception of situations where it is necessary to save the life of the mother Australia partook of this law until Britain changed it in towards a more liberal standpoint br All states and territories except Western Australia have laws prohibiting anti abortion campaigners from harassing visitors and staff of abortion clinics by setting exclusion zones around abortion clinics br br br Religion br br br Christianity br br br Evangelical Christianity br In Evangelical Christianity international organizations like Focus on the Family are involved in the anti abortion movement br br br See also br br American film br Anti abortion violence br Crisis pregnancy center br Dublin Declaration on Maternal Healthcare br Fetal rights br Forced abortion br
