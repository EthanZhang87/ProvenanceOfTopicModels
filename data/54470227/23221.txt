br br br Jennifer Saginor br Jennifer Saginor author of her memoir Playground A Childhood Lost Inside the Playboy Mansion experienced the infamous Playboy mansion at the age of six years old for the first time Her father Mark Saginor was Hugh Hefner s physician otherwise known as Dr Feelgood Mr Saginor was the primary reason that Jennifer was introduced to the mansion at such a young age due to his residency there While her parents were still together Jennifer and her sister would spend a good amount of time at the mansion with their father having a plethora of adult experiences sprung on them at a young age Her mother fought trying to prevent her daughters from stepping foot into that mansion She went as far as getting a divorce with Dr Feelgood hoping for full custody as well as court orders br br After Jennifer s parents divorce Mr Saginor spent significantly more time at the mansion than prior bringing his children along with him No matter how often her mother would forbid them from going Jennifer would lie about her whereabouts to spend time at the playhouse Jennifer yearned for her father s love and affection so she would insist on going to the mansion with him Unfortunately for Jennifer this would lead to years of processing her broken childhood which she is continuing to work on in present times br A specific story that Jennifer references in her memoir is again at the age of six when she ventures to the mansion for the first time meeting Hugh Hefner and is left to her own devices by her father As she walked through the mansion surrounded by half naked strangers she ran into the butler who showed her to the pool Once getting to the pool Jennifer discovered a secret tunnel under the water leading to an underground Jacuzzi in a separate section of the house Here she walked in on John Belushi having sexual intercourse with one of the Playboy Bunnies She was six years old at the time but describes her response to this experience as I am no longer six I have grown to full maturity in a matter of seconds Jennifer s experiences display just one of the hidden stories of the Playboy Mansion that haven t been addressed or brought to light for the masses

a joint interview with her daughter for People magazine In the interview they discuss the vastly different experiences and perspectives they had living in the mansion br In the documentary Theodore spoke about the pressure she felt to engage in sexual acts not only with Hefner but also with other men and women who frequented the house She also alleged that she was forced to be a drug mule for Hefner stating that he forced her to retrieve drugs including cocaine for his personal use Many other former bunnies called out Theodore saying that she was chasing fame and alleging that her accusations were false due to the fact that she didn t speak out for years The backlash that Theodore faced was in part due to the fact that after their split she remained on good terms with Hefner She ended up marrying a close friend of Hefner She also returned to the mansion many times after her split with Hefner and when she eventually divorced her husband it was Hefner who gave her money for a divorce lawyer Their close friendship even after their romantic relationship ended led many to question the validity of Theodore s story In the documentary Theodore acknowledges how she waited to speak out due to blocking out traumatic memories and believing that she didn t have a voice The documentary gave her and other former bunnies a chance to share their experiences In response to
