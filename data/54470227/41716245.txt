she kills Bugsy and attempts to kill Sam Eventually luring her into the basement Sam knocks her out with his contraptions Amelia awakens and tries to strangle Sam When he lovingly caresses her face

Dramatic Art NIDA where she studied acting alongside Davis and graduated in She then worked primarily as an actor in the film industry for over two decades She eventually lost her passion for acting by the end of the s and sent a written proposal to Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier asking if she could assist on the film set of his drama film Dogville to learn from him He accepted her proposal and she considers the experience her film school citing the importance of stubbornness as the key lesson she learned br Prior to The Babadook Kent completed a short film Monster and an episode of the television series Two Twisted She explained in May that the origins of Babadook could be found in Monster which she calls baby Babadook br She began writing the screenplay in around She said she sought to tell a story about facing up to the darkness within ourselves the fear of going mad and an exploration of parenting from a real perspective Regarding parenting she further explained in October Now I m not saying we all want to go and kill our kids but a lot of women struggle And it is a very taboo subject to say that motherhood is anything but a perfect experience for women About the characters she said It was really important for me that they were loving and loveable people I don t mean likeable I mean that we really felt for them She completed five drafts of the script br Kent drew from her experience on the set of Dogville for the assembling of her production team as she observed that von Trier was surrounded by a well known family of people Kent sought her own family of collaborators to work with for the long term Unable to find all of the suitable people within the Australian film industry Kent hired Polish director of photography DOP Radek Ladczuk for whom Babadook was his first ever English language film and American illustrator Alexander Juhasz In terms of influences Kent cited s s and s horror including Les Yeux Sans Visage Carnival of Souls The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Halloween The Thing and The Shining as well as Vampyr Nosferatu and Let The Right One In br Although the process was challenging and she was forced to reduce their total budget producer Kristina Ceyton managed to secure funding of around A million from government bodies Screen Australia and the SAFC however they still required an additional budget for the construction of the film sets To attain the funds for the sets Kent and Causeway Films producer Kristina Ceyton launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in June with a target of US Their funding goal was reached on September through pledges from backers raising Kent said that the crowdfunding closed a crucial gap in which to cover design and special effects expenses to build a special visual world br Casting the child lead for the film involved casting director Nikki Barrett viewing around audition tapes of young boys before selecting smaller groups and individuals for in person improvisation Six year old Noah Wiseman was selected as a standout with Kent saying he had a certain innocence about him that older boys did not have possibly as he is the son of a child psychologist br br The film was primarily shot in Adelaide South Australia with most of the interior shots filmed on a sound stage in the city as funding was from the South Australian state government this was a requirement that Kent needed to meet However Kent explained to Den of Geek that she is not patriotic and didn t want the film to be particularly Australian br br Kent claimed in an interview that to contribute to the universality of the film s appearance a Victorian terrace style house was specifically built for the film as there are very few houses designed in such a style in Adelaide However exterior shots were of an existing terraced house in North Adelaide A script reading was not done since Noah Wiseman was only six years old at the time and Kent focused instead on bonding playing games and lots of time spent with the actors so they could become more familiar with one another Pre production occurred in Adelaide and lasted three weeks and during this time Kent conveyed a kiddie version of the narrative to Wiseman in which young Samuel is the hero Kent took Wiseman to Adelaide Zoo to explain the story and said Wiseman was aware it was a scary film and that he knew how important his role was br Kent originally wanted to film solely in black and white as she wanted to create a heightened feel that is still believable She was also influenced by pre s B grade horror films as they were very theatrical in addition to being visually beautiful and terrifying Kent later lost interest in the black and white idea and worked closely with production designer Alex Holmes and Radek to create a very cool very claustrophobic interior environment with meticulously designed sets The film s final colour scheme was achieved without the use of gels on the camera lenses or any alterations during the post filming stage Kent cited David Lynch and Roman Polanski as key influences during the filming stage br Kent described the filming process as stressful because of Wiseman s age She explained So I really had to be focused We needed double the time we had Wiseman s mother was on set and a very protective loving environment was created Kent explained after the release of the film that Wiseman was protected throughout the entire project During the reverse shots where Amelia was abusing Sam verbally we had Essie Davis yell at an adult stand in on his knees I didn t want to destroy a childhood to make this film that wouldn t be fair Kent s friendship with Davis was a boon during filming and Kent praised her former classmate in the media To her credit she s Davis very receptive likes to be directed and is a joy to work with br br In terms of the Babadook monster and the scary effects of the film Kent was adamant from the outset of production that a low fi and handmade approach would be used She cites the influence of Georges M li s Jean Epstein s The Fall of the House of Usher and H xan Kent used stop motion effects for the monster and a large amount of smoothing was completed in post production Kent explained to Empire There s been some criticism of the lo fi approach of the effects and that makes me laugh because it was always intentional I wanted the film to be all in camera She has also said that The Man in the Beaver Hat from the lost film London After Midnight was an inspiration for the design of the Babadook br br The soundtrack was composed by Jed Kurzel The score was officially released for the first time by Waxwork Records in on black with red haze vinyl The record sleeve features a recreation of the pop up book from the film br br The film s

as an LGBT film Despite the absence of overt references to LGBT culture in the film fans and journalists generated interpretations of queer subtext in the film dubbed Babadiscourse that were often tongue in cheek but occasionally more serious highlighting the character s dramatic persona grotesque costume and chaotic effect within a traditional family structure In June The Babadook trended on Twitter and was displayed as a symbol during that year s Pride Month The social media response became so strong that theatres in Los Angeles took the opportunity to hold screenings of the film for charity Michael Bronski said to the Los Angeles Times In this moment who better than the Babadook to represent not only queer desire but queer antagonism queer in your faceness queer queerness and

just kept him alive I thought ah you bastard He doesn t want to die so he s finding ways to become relevant br br Writing for The Daily Beast Tim Teeman contends that grief is the real monster in The Babadook and that the film is about the aftermath of death how its remnants destroy long after the dead body has been buried or burned Teeman writes that he was gripped by the metaphorical imperative of Kent s film with the Babadook monster representing the shape of grief all enveloping shape shifting black Teeman states that the film s ending underscored the thrum of grief and loss at the movie s heart and concludes that it informs the audience that grief has its place and the best that humans can do is marshal it br Collider also proposed that the monster seems to symbolize Amelia and Sam s shared grief trauma over losing Oskar and that Amelia s efforts to suppress this led to it becoming stronger The writers suggest that healing from serious traumas in real life does not happen overnight but takes a lot of mental and emotional processing The Babadook warns of the dangers of trying to ignore or stuff our traumas below the surface this is the most dangerous place to put them because that s where we lose control of them and they gain control over us br br Treehouse of Horror XXXIII br br The Babadook at IMDb br The Babadook at AllMovie br The Babadook at Rotten Tomatoes br
