Regina ri JEYE n is the capital city of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan The city is the second largest in the province after Saskatoon and is a commercial centre for southern Saskatchewan As of the census Regina had a city population of and a metropolitan area population of It is governed by Regina City Council The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No br Regina was previously the seat of government of the North West Territories of which the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta originally formed part and of the District of Assiniboia The site was previously called Wascana from Cree romanized Oskana Buffalo Bones but was renamed to Regina Latin for Queen in in honour of Queen Victoria This decision was made by Queen Victoria s daughter Princess Louise who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada the Marquess of Lorne br Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run off Wascana Creek Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate m ft long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake Regina s importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in Wascana Centre created around the focal point of Wascana Lake remains one of Regina s attractions and contains the Provincial Legislative Building both campuses of the University of Regina First Nations University of Canada the Royal Saskatchewan Museum the Regina Conservatory in the original Regina College buildings the Saskatchewan Science Centre the MacKenzie Art Gallery and the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts br Residential neighbourhoods include precincts beyond the historic city centre are historically or socially noteworthy neighbourhoods namely Lakeview and The Crescents both of which lie directly south of downtown Immediately to the north of the central business district is the old warehouse district increasingly the focus of shopping nightclubs and residential development as in other western cities of North America the periphery contains shopping malls and big box stores br In the Regina Cyclone destroyed much of the town in the s the Regina Riot brought further attention and in the midst of the s drought and Great Depression which hit the Canadian Prairies particularly hard with their economic focus on dry land grain farming The CCF now the NDP a major left wing political party in Canada formulated its foundational Regina Manifesto of in Regina In Saskatchewan s agricultural and mineral resources came into new demand and Saskatchewan was described as entering a new period of strong economic growth br br br History br br br Early history br Regina was established as the territorial seat of government in when Edgar Dewdney the lieutenant governor of the North West Territories insisted on the site over the better developed Battleford Troy and Fort Qu Appelle the latter some km mi to the east one on rolling plains and the other in the Qu Appelle Valley between two lakes These communities were considered better locations for what was anticipated to be a metropole for the Canadian plains These locations had ample access to water and resided on treed rolling parklands Pile of Bones as the site for Regina was then called or in Cree Oskana k asast ki was by contrast located in arid and featureless grassland br Lieutenant Governor Dewdney had acquired land adjacent to the route of the future CPR line at Pile of Bones which was distinguished only by collections of bison bones near a small spring run off creek some few kilometres downstream from its origin in the midst of what are now wheat fields There was an obvious conflict of interest in Dewdney s choosing the site of Pile of Bones as the territorial seat of government and it was a national scandal at the time But until when responsible government was accomplished in the Territories the lieutenant governor and council governed by fiat and there was little legitimate means of challenging such decisions outside the federal capital of Ottawa There the Territories were remote and of little concern Princess Louise Duchess of Argyll wife of the then Governor General of Canada named the new community Regina in honour of her mother Queen Victoria br Commercial considerations prevailed and the town s authentic development soon began as a collection of wooden shanties and tent shacks clustered around the site designated by the CPR for its future station some km mi to the east of where Dewdney had reserved substantial landholdings for himself and where he sited the Territorial now the Saskatchewan Government House br br Regina attained national prominence in during the North West Rebellion when troops were mostly able to be transported by train on the CPR from eastern Canada as far as Qu Appelle Station before marching to the battlefield in the further Northwest Qu Appelle having been the major debarkation and distribution centre until when the completion of the Qu Appelle Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway linked Regina with Saskatoon and Prince Albert Subsequently the rebellion s leader Louis Riel was tried and hanged in Regina giving the infant community increased and at the time not unwelcome national attention in connection with a figure who was generally at the time considered an unalloyed villain in anglophone Canada The episode including Riel s imprisonment trial and execution brought the new Regina Leader later the Leader Post to national prominence br Regina was incorporated as a city on June with the MLA who introduced the charter bill James Hawkes declaring Regina has the brightest future before it of any place in the North West Territories Several years later the city was proclaimed the capital of the province of Saskatchewan on May by the first provincial government led by Premier Walter Scott the monumental Saskatchewan Legislative Building was built between and br br The Regina Cyclone was a tornado that devastated the city on June and remains the deadliest tornado in Canadian history with a total of fatalities the population of the city having been in Green funnel clouds formed and touched down south of the city tearing a swath through the residential area between Wascana Lake and Victoria Avenue continuing through the downtown business district rail yards warehouse district and northern residential area br From to Regina used Single transferable vote STV a form of proportional representation to elect its councillors Councillors were elected in one at large district Each voter cast just a single vote using a ranked transferable ballot br Regina grew rapidly until the beginning of the Great Depression in though only to a small fraction of the originally anticipated population explosion as population centre of the new province By this time Saskatchewan was considered the third province of Canada in both population and economic indicators Thereafter Saskatchewan never recovered its early promise and Regina s growth slowed and at times reversed br In Regina hosted the first national convention Co operative Commonwealth Federation predecessor of the NDP At the convention the CCF adopted a programme known as the Regina Manifesto which set out the new party s goals In Regina gained notoriety for the Regina Riot an incident of the On to Ottawa Trek See The Depression the CCF and the Regina Riot Beginning in the s Regina became known as a centre of considerable political activism and experimentation as its people sought to adjust to new reduced economic realities including the co operative movement and medicare br br br Modern history present br br The disappearance of the Simpson s Eaton s and Army Navy retail department stores in or near the central business district and Simpsons Sears to the north on Broad Street left only the Hudson s Bay Company as a large department store in Regina centre This with the proliferation of shopping malls beginning in the s and big box stores in the s on the periphery together with a corresponding drift of entertainment venues and all but one downtown cinema to the city outskirts had depleted the city centre The former Hudson s Bay Company department store previously the site of the Regina Theatre though long vacant after that burned to the ground has been converted into offices Globe Theatre located in the old Post Office building at th Avenue and Scarth Street Casino Regina and its show lounge in the former CPR train station the Cornwall Centre and downtown restaurants now draw people downtown again br Many buildings of significance and value were lost during the period from through approximately Knox United Church was demolished in the Romanesque Revival city hall in the failed shopping mall which replaced it is now office space for the Government of Canada and the Supreme Court of the North West Territories building at Hamilton Street and Victoria Avenue in br br In Wascana Centre Authority was established to govern the sprawling year old ha acres urban park and legislative grounds A year plan was developed by World Trade Centre Architect Minoru Yamasaki and landscape architect Thomas Church as part of developing a new University of Saskatchewan campus in the southeast end of the park The master plan has been subsequently revised every five to seven years since most recently in Wascana Centre has made Regina as enjoyable and fulfilling for residents as it had long been the metropole for farmers and residents of small neighbouring towns Despite the setting improbable though it always was compared with other more likely sites for the capitol the efforts results were favourable br The long imperilled Government House was saved in after decades of neglect and returned to viceregal use the former Anglican diocesan property at Broad Street and College Avenue is being redeveloped with strict covenants to maintain the integrity of the diocesan buildings and St Chad s School and the former Sacred Heart Academy building immediately adjacent to the Roman Catholic Cathedral has been converted into townhouses br Recently older buildings have been put to new uses including the old Normal School on the Regina College campus of the University of Regina now the Canada Saskatchewan Production Studios and the old Post Office on the Scarth Street Mall The Warehouse District immediately adjacent to the central business district to the north of the CPR line has become a desirable commercial and residential precinct as historic warehouses have been converted to retail nightclubs and residential use br br br Geography br The city is situated on a broad flat treeless plain There is an abundance of parks and greenspaces all of its trees some shrubs and other plants were hand planted As in other prairie cities American elms were planted in front yards in residential neighbourhoods and on boulevards along major traffic arteries and are the dominant species in the urban forest br In recent years the pattern of primary and high school grounds being acreages of prairie sports grounds has been re thought and such grounds have been landscaped with artificial hills and parks Newer residential subdivisions in the northwest and southeast have instead of spring runoff storm sewers decorative landscaped lagoons br The streetscape is now endangered by Dutch elm disease which has spread through North America from the eastern seaboard and has now reached the Canadian prairies for the time being it is controlled by pest management programs and species not susceptible to the disease are being planted the disease has the potential to wipe out Regina s elm population br br br Climate br

reorganised itself from small family farm landholdings of a quarter section acres ha the original standard land grant to homesteaders to the multi section a section being acres ha landholdings that are increasingly necessary for economic viability br Some of these towns have enjoyed something of a renaissance as a result of the excellent roads that for many decades seemed likely to doom them they and to some extent the nearby city of Moose Jaw are now undergoing a mild resurgence as commuter satellites for Regina Qu Appelle at one time intended to be the metropole for the original District of Assiniboia in the North West Territories as they then were saw during the s s and s Regina cottagers pass through en route to the Qu Appelle Valley Highway which bypassed Qu Appelle
