geographical proximity and frequent playoff confrontations The Battle of the Hudson River with the New York Rangers is so called as the Devils arenas in the New York metropolitan area were always less than ten miles and across the Hudson River from Madison Square Garden New Jersey s proximity with Pennsylvania also led to a rivalry with the Philadelphia Flyers the Battle of the Jersey Turnpike The Flyers have a large following in South Jersey and train in Voorhees Township Both teams had the most titles of the Atlantic Division prior to the realignment with nine to the Devils and six to the Flyers br br br Style of play br The Devils have been known as a defense first team since head coach Jacques Lemaire s first tenure although the Devils have twice led the Eastern Conference in goals scored once leading the NHL in goals scored goals for in Lemaire gave the Devils their defensive mantra when he implemented a system commonly called the neutral zone trap This system is designed to force teams to turn over the puck in the neutral zone leading to a counterattack This style of play led the team to be chastised by the media and hockey purists for making the NHL boring Nevertheless the Devils were successful using this style of play and Devils head coach Larry Robinson asserted that the Montreal Canadiens teams he played on in the s who also won the Cup many times used a form of the trap though it did not have a name br Under head coach Brent Sutter the team adopted less of a trap and more of a transitional aggressive forechecking style of play which also emphasized puck possession and instilled the cycle to start the season This led to many high scoring games early in the season for New Jersey The Devils went on to score goals in the season the most the team had scored in eight seasons However with the return of Lemaire as head coach the Devils resumed a more defense oriented playing style scoring just goals and allowing only an NHL best in the season earning Martin Brodeur his fifth William M Jennings Trophy br Lemaire has since re entered retirement and was replaced by former Florida head coach Peter DeBoer on July The team showed greater offensive prowess during the season employing a more aggressive forecheck centered on Ilya Kovalchuk Under DeBoer s system according to Lamoriello the Devils defenseman were often sent into the offensive zone
