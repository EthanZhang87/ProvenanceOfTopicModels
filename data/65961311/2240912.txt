Stalock br br br Venue br br The draft was originally scheduled to be held on June hosted by the Ottawa Senators at the Corel Centre their home rink However the NHL lockout was still ongoing causing the draft to be postponed The lockout ended on July with the approval of a new NHL collective bargaining agreement CBA The CBA set the new date of the draft as July The Corel Centre was still available but cannot be used on such short notice The draft was instead held at the Westin Hotel in Ottawa Ontario The Senators were compensated by hosting the draft instead br As a result of the rearrangement the draft was not open to the public for the first time since Nor was it possible for large numbers of drafted players to attend only the twenty highest prospects on the NHL Central Scouting rankings were present br br br Procedures br The order of draft picks was usually determined by team performance in the previous season with teams picking in the same order in each round modified by any trading of draft picks However the lockout had led to the complete cancellation of the NHL season so there were no final positions to base the draft order on The new CBA modified the draft procedures accordingly br The order of picks in the first round was determined by a weighted lottery In the second round this order was reversed so the team with the th pick would also receive the st pick whilst the team with first overall pick would not pick again until the th pick last pick in the second round The order would continue alternating in each subsequent round producing a snaking order Teams were permitted to trade their draft picks as usual which led to some modifications to the order br The new CBA reduced the draft length to seven rounds compared to the nine rounds used previously As a result players were selected br br br Lottery br The lottery was held on July the same day that the new CBA was approved The top rated prospect in this draft was Sidney Crosby and it was widely assumed that he would be the first overall pick by whichever team won the lottery so it became known colloquially as the Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes br Teams were weighted based on playoff appearances in the last three completed seasons and and first overall picks in the last four drafts and Three lottery balls each were assigned to teams which had not qualified for any of those playoffs and received no first overall picks in that period Teams which had one playoff appearance or first overall pick in those years were given two lottery balls All other teams received one lottery ball br Three balls br br Buffalo Sabres Columbus Blue Jackets New York Rangers Pittsburgh Penguins br Two balls br br Mighty Ducks of Anaheim Atlanta Thrashers Calgary Flames Carolina

Florida Panthers Montreal Canadiens New Jersey Devils New York Islanders Ottawa Senators Philadelphia Flyers San Jose Sharks St Louis Blues Tampa Bay Lightning Toronto Maple Leafs Vancouver Canucks
