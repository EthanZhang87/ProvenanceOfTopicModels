became Major Junior hockey Tier II Junior A became the top tier of hockey in the CAHA and became Junior A hockey br br br Junior A br Junior A Junior AAA in Qu bec Tier in British Columbia hockey is

League Tier II is represented by the North American Hockey League There are several Tier III and independently sanctioned leagues throughout the country Some US based teams play in Canadian leagues outside of the USA Hockey framework br br br Tier I br The United States Hockey League USHL is currently the only Tier I league in the country consisting of teams in the central and midwestern United States The USHL provides an alternative to the Canadian Hockey League which pays its major junior hockey players a stipend for players who wish to maintain NCAA eligibility for later in their career br While playing in the USHL all player expenses are paid for by the team no membership or equipment fees are charged Unlike major junior teams free college stipend does not exist Historically professional leagues have drafted less directly from USHL teams although this trend has shifted in recent years coinciding with the USNTDP moving to the USHL in In the NHL Entry Draft of the players drafted out of the USHL played for the USNTDP Those draft picks were more than any of the three leagues in the Canadian Hockey League and included first round picks of which came from the USNTDP and second round picks br For most of its existence the USHL was considered inferior in quality of play to the major junior levels But it continued to improve and as of about percent of NHL players had played USHL in their career Between and percent of USHL players continued into NCAA hockey br br br Tier II br Currently the North American Hockey League is the only USA Hockey sanctioned Tier II league in the United States The NAHL consists of teams spread across the western two thirds of the United States with a significant concentration of teams in the central and southwestern parts of the United States although the league began to expand to east coast as of In October the Tier III United States Premier Hockey League a league predominately located on the east coast applied to USA Hockey for approval of a Tier II league to begin in the season however the league was denied that December and decided to operate its Tier II league independently br The NAHL like the USHL provides young players an alternative to major junior hockey although the skill level is considered significantly lower than major junior hockey and typically filled with those who would not or did not make the roster of a Tier I team Unlike Tier I the NAHL does not pay for all players expenses such as room and board but there is no tuition cost to the player as in Tier III br br br Tier III br In addition to paying for room and board players at the Tier III level pay a fee or tuition commonly ranging from to This is for all accounts and purposes an amateur level although some players go directly to NCAA Division I schools Most Tier III players are looking to increase their skills in hopes to move up to Tier II or I while other players go directly to NCAA Division III ACHA and CHF schools br Prior to July USA Hockey split Tier III into Junior A and B divisions USA Hockey currently has one sanctioned Tier III league the North American Hockey League br br br Independent leagues br Some Junior ice hockey leagues operate outside the framework of governing bodies such as Hockey Canada and USA Hockey typically due to disagreements with governing bodies over player recruitment policies and finances These leagues are sometimes referred to as unsanctioned rogue or outlaw leagues due to their lack of sanctioning or oversight from an outside governing body br Since the Greater Metro Junior A Hockey League has operated as an independent league in Ontario Quebec and Alberta The league widely recruits players from outside of North America br In late the United States Premier Hockey League an organization composed of several USA Hockey Tier III Junior as well as many youth hockey leagues applied for a Tier II league The Tier II status was denied in December but the USPHL moved forward with the new league anyway creating the National Collegiate Development Conference In response the USPHL has removed all their junior level leagues the NCDC and the Tier III level Premier and Elite Divisions from USA Hockey sanctioning since the season br In the Eastern Hockey League which was operating two Tier III leagues also left USA Hockey sanctioning br In the Junior A British Columbia Hockey League BCHL withdrew its membership with Hockey Canada and became an independent league In the Vancouver Island Junior Hockey League VIJHL announced that it would also withdraw from the Hockey Canada framework and become an independent farm league for the BCHL beginning in the season br br br Europe br br In Europe Junior teams are usually associated with a professional team and are used by professional teams to develop their own prospects One example of this is the J SuperElit league in Sweden or the Minor Hockey League in Russia br The lack of an amateur draft in Europe means that the onus is on the teams to sign the most talented young players they can get and the presence of an affiliated junior team provides a place for young players who are not yet ready for the rigours of the professional game to develop However not all players on a European junior team are necessarily property of their professional club and may elect to sign elsewhere br At the World Hockey Summit in nations in Europe expressed concern about the number of junior players leaving to play in North America despite the improved talent level and the increasing popularity of the IIHF Ice Hockey World Junior Championships Slavomir Lener a director with the Czech Ice Hockey Association felt that Junior aged players were enticed to play in North America before maturation with a negative effect on the development of the player and the European system He stated that of the Czech Republic players who went to North American Junior hockey only of them played more than NHL games He sought to establish a European system that was competitive enough to deter players from entering into the CHL Import Draft br br br See also br Super Series Canada versus Russia challenge br Canadian Hockey
