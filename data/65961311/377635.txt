Sportsnet is a Canadian English language discretionary sports specialty channel owned by Rogers Sports Media It was established in as CTV Sportsnet a joint venture between CTV Liberty Media and Rogers Media CTV parent Bell Globemedia then was required to divest its stake in the network following its acquisition of competing network TSN Rogers then became the sole owner of Sportsnet in after it bought the remaining minority stake that was held by Fox br The Sportsnet license comprises four hour programming services Sportsnet was originally licensed by the Canadian Radio television and Telecommunications Commission CRTC as a category A service operating as a group of regional sports networks offering programming tailored to each feed s region in contrast to TSN which was licensed at the time to operate as a national sports service and could only offer limited regional opt outs Since the service has operated under deregulated category C licensing which allows Sportsnet to operate multiple feeds with no restrictions on alternate programming In each region only the local Sportsnet channel is available on analogue cable but all four channels are available nationally via digital cable subject to blackouts for some out of market teams br The four Sportsnet feeds air some common programming and simulcast major national events but are capable of airing programming autonomously most prominently regional programming Sportsnet is the national cable rightsholder of the National Hockey League and also holds full regional rights to three and partial regional rights to one of the league s Canadian franchises It is also the national rightsholder of Major League Baseball in Canada although most of ESPN s MLB broadcasts are sub licensed to rival network TSN and the exclusive broadcaster of the co owned Toronto Blue Jays It splits regional coverage of the NHL s Toronto Maple Leafs and national coverage of the NBA s Toronto Raptors with TSN Rogers Communications and TSN s parent company Bell Canada own a joint majority stake in the teams parent company br The Sportsnet brand has since been extended beyond the original regional channels now encompassing the national channels Sportsnet Sportsnet One and its regional part time companion channels and Sportsnet World Sportsnet Radio stations in Toronto Vancouver and Calgary and Sportsnet Magazine With these brand extensions Rogers now generally uses Sportsnet by itself to denote its sports media properties as a whole and on air promotions for programs being carried nationally by these four regional feeds often list all four channels separately or refer to the Sportsnet regional or main channels to avoid any ambiguity However standalone mentions of Sportsnet in reference to a specific channel can still generally be assumed to be referring to the four regional channels or the specific regional channel available locally on analogue cable br br br History br Sportsnet was approved by the CRTC in September under the tentative name S with Baton Broadcasting Inc later renamed to CTV Inc holding a controlling interest in the network and minority stakes held by Rogers Media and Liberty Media in turn a spin off of TCI an American cable television group The network proposed a structure with an emphasis on regional programming operating four feeds to serve different areas of the country br The network launched on October as CTV Sportsnet under the ownership of CTV Rogers and Liberty the latter which owned some of the Fox Sports Net operations that Fox ran in the United States after which the channel was named br The new network gained credibility before it went on the air having acquired national cable rights to the National Hockey League from long time holder TSN From until Sportsnet aired NHL games to a national audience throughout the regular season and covered first round playoff series not involving Canadian teams Its first live sports event was an NHL opening night telecast between the Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers The national cable rights to the NHL returned to TSN in though Sportsnet retained regional broadcast rights for most Canadian NHL teams br br br Acquisition by Rogers br When CTV purchased NetStar the former parent company of TSN in the CRTC ordered CTV to sell either TSN or its stake in Sportsnet CTV ultimately chose to retain TSN and sell its stake in Sportsnet The other shareholders had first right of refusal as Rogers was the only interested party it acquired CTV s stake in the summer of and soon after renamed it Rogers Sportsnet During part of the transition period during which time the channel was known as Sportsnet CTV was allowed to control programming on both networks and some cross affiliation and programs that were going to be tape delayed on TSN most notably figure skating were given to Sportsnet In Rogers then bought the remaining percent stake from Fox br While Sportsnet had been based there from the beginning TSN s operations would move to CTV s suburban Toronto complex Channel Nine Court following the acquisition This led to some peculiarities related to the fact that the two rival sports channels were only separated by a parking lot leading to jokes and references from both networks On April Rogers Sportsnet moved its broadcast operations from Channel Nine Court to the Rogers Building a cluster of buildings in the Mount Pleasant Jarvis Street area of Downtown Toronto br br br Expansion br In Rogers began to extend the Sportsnet brand beyond the original regional networks with the August launch of Rogers Sportsnet One a national companion channel promising hours of live events per year The channel was also accompanied by additional part time feeds to serve as overflow channels for its regional NHL coverage br br In January Rogers sports radio stations CJCL Toronto The Fan and CFAC Calgary The Fan were rebranded as Sportsnet Radio Fan and Sportsnet Radio Fan respectively Critics speculated that the Sportsnet Radio branding was intended to increase synergy with its television counterparts upon rumors that TSN would be launching a sports radio network of its own br In July Rogers announced that it would be rebranding its premium international sports channel Setanta Sports Canada as Sportsnet World on October a move that would allow the channel better opportunities for cross promotion with other Sportsnet services As part of the transition Setanta Sports sold its minority ownership interest in the channel to MLM Management br On September Rogers published the first issue of Sportsnet Magazine a bi weekly sports magazine positioned for Canadian sports fans covering professional sports from a Canadian perspective Sports writer Stephen Brunt left his position at The Globe and Mail newspaper to become the magazine s back page columnist br br br Fuelled By Fans re launch br On October Rogers Sportsnet underwent a major rebranding introducing a revamped logo and visual appearance designed in conjunction with Troika Design Group and a new image campaign Fuelled By Fans Additionally the network s official name was shortened to just Sportsnet The new logo does not incorporate the previous player emblem that had been used in the network s branding since its original launch as research performed by Rogers indicated that its association with Sportsnet did not resonate well with viewers The redesign of Sportsnet was overseen by Dean Bender who served as the network s creative director upon its original launch as CTV Sportsnet br br br br On August Rogers announced that it would acquire the television assets of Score Media owners of The Score Television Network a competing sports network which primarily airs sports news and highlights alongside event coverage in a transaction valued at million The acquisition itself closed on October at which point Score Media s digital assets including its website and mobile apps were spun off into another company theScore Inc in which Rogers Media would retain a interest Score Media s TV properties were immediately placed into a blind trust under trustee Peter Viner pending final CRTC approval Rogers plans to continue running the network as a sports news service br The acquisition and Rogers proposed amendments which included a reduction in the frequency of sports updates during live events were approved by the CRTC on April the same day The Score also began to air more Sportsnet produced programming including a simulcast of CJCL s afternoon show Tim Sid and Hockey Central Playoff Extra However the CRTC rejected the use of a proposed winter sports competition the Sportsnet Winter Games for its tangible benefits requirements br On June Rogers announced that The Score would be rebranded as a Sportsnet channel the channel changed its name to Sportsnet on July As of Sportsnet is available in million Canadian homes br On October Scott Moore Rogers head of Sportsnet and NHL
