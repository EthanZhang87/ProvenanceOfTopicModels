the OHL and WHL having teams in both Canada and the United States Each league plays individual regular season schedules and playoffs The annual CHL championship is determined by the Memorial Cup tournament held in May br The CHL is generally considered the world s top junior hockey league for developing professional players and is a key supplier of new players and officials for the many North American professional hockey leagues such as the National Hockey League American Hockey League and the ECHL If a CHL player does not sign a professional contract many also opt to play for U Sports formerly Canadian Interuniversity Sport CIS and go to school due to CHL sponsored scholarship programs However due to the use of paying player stipends and allowing junior players that have signed entry level contracts with the NHL all CHL teams are considered professional by the NCAA thus any player who plays a game at the Major Junior level loses their eligibility to play for universities in the United States br The CHL also seeks to raise the profile of the junior game by hosting annual events such as the Memorial Cup the CHL NHL Top Prospects Game and the CHL Canada Russia Series The organization also provides many scholarships and bursaries for its players who exemplify extraordinary efforts and community involvement These programs are supported by the many corporate sponsors br

Canadian Major Junior Hockey League CMJHL composed of the three league under one umbrella The new organization wanted standard contracts for all players consistent dollar amounts for development fees paid by professional leagues to sign junior players and for the National Hockey League and the World Hockey Association to work together on a common drafting program to eliminate bidding wars The CMJHL sought to represent players directly instead of agents and proposed an escalating development fee schedule if professional teams wanted to sign a player while he was still eligible for junior hockey The league also proposed to allow some players under professional contracts to continue playing in junior hockey Ontario s commissioner Tubby Schmalz defended the validity of the constitution
