British Columbia commonly abbreviated as BC is the westernmost province of Canada Situated between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains the province has a diverse geography with rugged landscapes that include rocky coastlines sandy beaches forests lakes mountains inland deserts and grassy plains British Columbia borders the province of Alberta to the east the territories of Yukon and Northwest Territories to the north the U S states of Washington Idaho and Montana to the south and Alaska to the northwest With an estimated population of over million as of it is Canada s third most populous province The capital of British Columbia is Victoria while the province s largest city is Vancouver Vancouver and its suburbs together make up the third largest metropolitan area in Canada with the census recording million people in Metro Vancouver British Columbia is Canada s third largest province in terms of total area after Quebec and Ontario br The first known human inhabitants of the area settled in British Columbia at least years ago Such groups include the Coast Salish Tsilhqot in and Haida peoples among many others One of the earliest British settlements in the area was Fort Victoria established in which gave rise to the city of Victoria the capital of the Colony of Vancouver Island The Colony of British Columbia was subsequently founded by Richard Clement Moody and by the Royal Engineers Columbia Detachment in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush Moody selected the site for and founded the mainland colony s capital New Westminster The colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia were incorporated in subsequent to which Victoria became the united colony s capital In British Columbia entered Confederation as the sixth province of Canada in enactment of the British Columbia Terms of Union br British Columbia is a diverse and cosmopolitan province drawing on a plethora of cultural influences from its British Canadian European and Asian diasporas as well as the Indigenous population Though the province s ethnic majority originates from the British Isles many British Columbians also trace their ancestors to continental Europe East Asia and South Asia Indigenous Canadians constitute about percent of the province s total population Christianity is the largest religion in the region though the majority of the population is non religious English is the common language of the province although Punjabi Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese also have a large presence in the Metro Vancouver region The Franco Columbian community is an officially recognized linguistic minority and around one percent of British Columbians claim French as their mother tongue British Columbia is home to at least distinct Indigenous languages br Major sectors of British Columbia s economy include forestry mining filmmaking and video production tourism real estate construction wholesale and retail Its main exports include lumber and timber pulp and paper products copper coal and natural gas British Columbia exhibits high property values and is a significant centre for maritime trade the Port of Vancouver is the largest port in Canada and the most diversified port in North America Although less than percent of the province s territory is arable land significant agriculture exists in the Fraser Valley and Okanagan due to the warmer climate British Columbia is home to of all publicly listed companies in Canada br br br Origin of the name br The province s name was chosen by Queen Victoria when the Colony of British Columbia i e the Mainland became a British colony in It refers to the Columbia District the British name for the territory drained by the Columbia River in southeastern British Columbia which was the namesake of the pre Oregon Treaty Columbia Department of the Hudson s Bay Company Queen Victoria chose British Columbia to distinguish what was the British sector of the Columbia District from the United States American Columbia or Southern Columbia which became the Oregon Territory on August as a result of the treaty br Ultimately the Columbia in the name British Columbia is derived from the name of the Columbia Rediviva an American ship which lent its name to the Columbia River and later the wider region the Columbia in the name Columbia Rediviva came from the name Columbia for the New World or parts thereof a reference to Christopher Columbus br The governments of Canada and British Columbia recognize Colombie Britannique as the French name for the province br br br Geography br br British Columbia is bordered to the west by the Pacific Ocean and the American state of Alaska to the north by Yukon and the Northwest Territories to the east by the province of Alberta and to the south by the American states of Washington Idaho and Montana The southern border of British Columbia was established by the Oregon Treaty although its history is tied with lands as far south as California British Columbia s land area is square kilometres sq mi British Columbia s rugged coastline stretches for more than kilometres mi and includes deep mountainous fjords and about islands most of which are uninhabited It is the only province in Canada that borders the Pacific Ocean br British Columbia s capital is Victoria located at the southeastern tip of Vancouver Island Only a narrow strip of Vancouver Island from Campbell River to Victoria is significantly populated Much of the western part of Vancouver Island and the rest of the coast is covered by temperate rainforest br The province s most populous city is Vancouver which is at the confluence of the Fraser River and Georgia Strait in the mainland s southwest corner an area often called the Lower Mainland By land area Abbotsford is the largest city Vanderhoof is near the geographic centre of the province br br The Coast Mountains and the Inside Passage s many inlets provide some of British Columbia s renowned and spectacular scenery which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and ecotourism industry percent of the province is mountainous more than m ft above sea level percent is forested and only about percent is arable br The province s mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the Pacific Ocean Terrain ranges from dry inland forests and semi arid valleys to the range and canyon districts of the Central and Southern Interior to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the Northern Interior High mountain regions both north and south have subalpine flora and subalpine climate br The Okanagan wine area extending from Vernon to Osoyoos at the United States border is one of several wine and cider producing regions in Canada Other wine regions in British Columbia include the Cowichan Valley on Vancouver Island and the Fraser Valley br The Southern Interior cities of Kamloops and Penticton have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in Canada while higher elevations are cold and snowy although their temperatures are often exceeded north of the Fraser Canyon close to the confluence of the Fraser and Thompson rivers where the terrain is rugged and covered with desert type flora Semi desert grassland is found in large areas of the Interior Plateau with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones br The northern mostly mountainous two thirds of the province is largely unpopulated and undeveloped except for the area east of the Rockies where the Peace River Country contains BC s portion of the Canadian Prairies centred at the city of Dawson Creek br British Columbia is considered part of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion along with the American states of Alaska Idaho western Montana Oregon Washington and northern California br br br Climate br br Because of the many mountain ranges and rugged coastline British Columbia s climate varies dramatically across the province br Coastal southern British Columbia has a mild and rainy climate influenced by the North Pacific Current Most of the region is classified as oceanic though pockets of warm summer Mediterranean climate also exist in the far southern parts of the coast Precipitation averages above mm in in almost all of the coastal region and Hucuktlis Lake on Vancouver Island receives an average of mm in of rain annually br Due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges the climate of some of the interior valleys of the province such as the Thompson parts of the Fraser Canyon the southern Cariboo and parts of the Okanagan is semi arid with certain locations receiving less than millimetres in in annual precipitation The annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to C F the mildest anywhere in Canada br The valleys of the Southern Interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow while those in the Cariboo in the Central Interior are colder because of increased altitude and latitude but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in Canada Outside of the driest valleys the Southern and Central Interior generally have a humid continental climate with widely variable precipitation For example the average daily low in Prince George roughly in the middle of the province in January is C F Small towns in the southern interior with high elevation such as Princeton are typically colder and snowier than cities in the valleys br Heavy snowfall occurs in all elevated mountainous terrain providing bases for skiers in both south and central British Columbia Annual snowfall on highway mountain passes in the southern interior rivals some of the snowiest cities in Canada and freezing rain and fog are sometimes present on such roads as well This can result in hazardous driving conditions as people are usually travelling between warmer areas such as Vancouver or Kamloops and may be unaware that the conditions may be slippery and cold br br Winters are generally severe in the Northern Interior which is generally in the subarctic climate zone but even there milder air can penetrate far inland The coldest temperature in British Columbia was recorded in Smith River where it dropped to C F on January one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in North America Atlin in the province s far northwest along with the adjoining Southern Lakes region of Yukon get midwinter thaws caused by the Chinook effect which is also common and much warmer in more southerly parts of the Interior br During winter on the coast rainfall sometimes relentless heavy rain dominates because of consistent barrages of cyclonic low pressure systems from the North Pacific Average snowfall on the coast during a normal winter is between and centimetres and in but on occasion and not every winter heavy snowfalls with more than centimetres in and well below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas typically for short periods and can take temperatures below C F even at sea level Arctic outflow winds can occasionally result in wind chill temperatures at or even below C F While winters are very wet coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer under the influence of stable anti cyclonic high pressure br Southern Interior valleys are hot in summer for example in Osoyoos the July maximum temperature averages C F making it the hottest month of any location in Canada this hot weather sometimes spreads towards the coast or to the far north of the province Temperatures often exceed C F in the lower elevations of valleys in the Interior during mid summer with the record high of C F being held in Lytton on June during a record breaking heat wave that year br br The extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires from dry lightning or man made causes Many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during the winter months in contrast to abundant summer sunshine Annual sunshine hours vary from near Cranbrook and Victoria to less than in Prince Rupert on the North Coast just south of Southeast Alaska br The exception to British Columbia s wet and cloudy winters is during the El Ni o phase During El Ni o events the jet stream is much farther south across North America making the province s winters milder and drier than normal Winters are much wetter and cooler during the opposite phase La Ni a br br br Parks and protected areas br br There are designations of parks and protected areas in the province that reflect the different administration and creation of these areas in a modern context There are ecological reserves provincial marine parks provincial heritage sites National Historic Sites of Canada national parks and national park reserves percent of the province s area km or sq mi is considered protected under one of the different designations that includes over distinct areas br British Columbia contains seven of Canada s national parks and National Park Reserves br br Glacier National Park br Gulf Islands National Park Reserve br Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site br Kootenay National Park br Mount Revelstoke National Park br Pacific Rim National Park Reserve br Yoho National Park br British Columbia contains a large number of provincial parks run by BC Parks under the aegis of the Ministry of Environment British Columbia s provincial parks system is the second largest parks system in Canada the largest being Canada s National Parks system br Another tier of parks in British Columbia are regional parks which are maintained and run by the province s regional districts The Ministry of Forests operates forest recreation sites br In addition to these areas over square kilometres sq mi of arable land are protected by the Agricultural Land Reserve br br br Fauna br br Much of the province is undeveloped so populations of many mammalian species that have become rare in much of the United States still flourish in British Columbia Watching animals of various sorts including a very wide range of birds has long been popular Bears grizzly black including the Kermode bear or spirit bear live here as do deer elk moose caribou big horn sheep mountain goats marmots beavers muskrats coyotes wolves mustelids such as wolverines badgers and fishers cougars eagles ospreys herons Canada geese swans loons hawks owls ravens harlequin ducks and many other sorts of ducks Smaller birds robins jays grosbeaks chickadees and so on also abound Murrelets are known from Frederick Island a small island off the coast of Haida Gwaii br Many healthy populations of fish are present including salmonids such as several species of salmon trout steelhead and char Besides salmon and trout sport fishers in BC also catch halibut bass and sturgeon On the coast harbour seals and river otters are common Cetacean species native to the coast include the orca humpback whale grey whale harbour porpoise Dall s porpoise Pacific white sided dolphin and minke whale br br Some endangered species in British Columbia are Vancouver Island marmot spotted owl American white pelican and badgers br br br Forests br White spruce or Engelmann spruce and their hybrids occur in of the biogeoclimatic zones of British Columbia Common types of trees present in BC s forests include western redcedar yellow cedar Rocky Mountain juniper lodgepole pine ponderosa or yellow pine whitebark pine limber pine western white pine western larch tamarack alpine larch white spruce Engelmann spruce Sitka spruce black spruce grand fir Amabilis fir subalpine fir western hemlock mountain hemlock Douglas fir western yew Pacific dogwood bigleaf maple Douglas maple vine maple arbutus black hawthorn cascara Garry oak Pacific crab apple choke cherry pin cherry bitter cherry red alder mountain alder paper birch water birch black cottonwood balsam poplar trembling aspen br br br Traditional plant foods br br First Nations peoples of British Columbia used plants for food and to produce material goods like fuel and building products Plant foods included berries and roots like camas br br br Ecozones br Environment Canada subdivides British Columbia into six ecozones br br Pacific Marine br Pacific Maritime br Boreal Cordillera br Montane Cordillera br Taiga Plains br Boreal Plains Ecozones br br br History br br br Indigenous societies br br The area now known as British Columbia is home to First Nations groups that have a deep history with a significant number of indigenous languages There are more than First Nations in BC Prior to contact with non Aboriginal people human history is known from oral histories archaeological investigations and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period br The arrival of Paleoindians from Beringia took place between and years ago Hunter gatherer families were the main social structure from to years ago The nomadic population lived in non permanent structures foraging for nuts berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs Around years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally Coast Salish peoples had complex land management practices linked to ecosystem health and resilience Forest gardens on Canada s northwest coast included crabapple hazelnut cranberry wild plum and wild cherry species Thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary lifestyle These indigenous populations evolved over the next years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs br To the northwest of the province are the peoples of the Na Dene languages which include the Athapaskan speaking peoples and the Tlingit who live on the islands of southern Alaska and northern British Columbia The Na Dene language group is believed to be linked to the Yeniseian languages of Siberia the Dene of the western Arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from Asia to North America The Interior of British Columbia is home to the Salishan language groups such as the Shuswap Secwepemc Okanagan and Athabaskan language groups primarily the Dakelh Carrier and the Tsilhqot in The inlets and valleys of the British Columbia coast shelter large distinctive populations such as the Haida Kwakwaka wakw and Nuu chah nulth sustained by the region s abundant salmon and shellfish These peoples developed complex cultures dependent on the western red cedar that included wooden houses seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved potlatch items and totem poles br Contact with Europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases the people had no immunity to The population dramatically collapsed culminating in the smallpox outbreak in Victoria that spread throughout the coast European settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of British Columbia Colonial officials deemed colonists could make better use of the land than the First Nations people and thus the land should be owned by the colonists To ensure colonists would be able to settle properly and make use of the land First Nations were forcibly relocated onto reserves which were often too small to support their way of life By the s British Columbia had over reserves br br br Fur trade and colonial era br br Lands now known as British Columbia were added to the British Empire during the th century Colonies originally begun with the support of the Hudson s Bay Company Vancouver Island the mainland were amalgamated then entered Confederation as British Columbia in as part of the Dominion of Canada br During the s smallpox killed at least percent of the Pacific Northwest First Nations This devastating epidemic was the first in a series the Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic killed about half to two thirds of the native population of what became British Columbia br br The arrival of Europeans began around the mid th century as fur traders entered the area to harvest sea otters While it is thought Sir Francis Drake may have explored the British Columbian coast in it was Juan P rez who completed the first documented voyage which took place in Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra explored the coast in In doing so P rez and Quadra reasserted the Spanish claim for the Pacific coast first made by Vasco N ez de Balboa in br The explorations of James Cook in and George Vancouver in and established British jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the Columbia River In Sir Alexander Mackenzie was the first European to journey across North America overland to the Pacific Ocean inscribing a stone marking his accomplishment on the shoreline of Dean Channel near Bella Coola His expedition theoretically established British sovereignty inland and a succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the Canadian Prairies and the Pacific Mackenzie and other explorers notably John Finlay Simon Fraser Samuel Black and David Thompson were primarily concerned with extending the fur trade rather than political considerations In by the third of a series of agreements known as the Nootka Conventions Spain conceded its claims of exclusivity in the Pacific This opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers including Britain but because of the Napoleonic Wars there was little British action on its claims in the region until later br The establishment of trading posts by the North West Company and the Hudson s Bay Company HBC effectively established a permanent British presence in the region The Columbia District was broadly defined as being south of north latitude the southern limit of Russian America north of Mexican controlled California and west of the Rocky Mountains It was by the Anglo American Convention of under the joint occupancy and use of citizens of the United States and subjects of Britain which is to say the fur companies This co occupancy was ended with the Oregon Treaty of br The major supply route was the York Factory Express between Hudson Bay and Fort Vancouver Some of the early outposts grew into settlements communities and cities Among the places in British Columbia that began as fur trading posts are Fort St John established Hudson s Hope Fort Nelson Fort St James Prince George Kamloops Fort Langley Fort Victoria Yale and Nanaimo Fur company posts that became cities in what is now the United States include Vancouver Washington Fort Vancouver formerly the capital of Hudson s Bay operations in the Columbia District Colville Washington and Walla Walla Washington old Fort Nez Perc s br br With the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in modern day British Columbia existed in three fur trading departments The bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the New Caledonia district administered from Fort St James The interior south of the Thompson River watershed and north of the Columbia was organized into the Columbia District administered from Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia River The northeast corner of the province east of the Rockies known as the Peace River Block was attached to the much larger Athabasca District headquartered in Fort Chipewyan in present day Alberta br Until these districts were a wholly unorganized area of British North America under the de facto jurisdiction of HBC administrators however unlike Rupert s Land to the north and east the territory was not a concession to the company Rather it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the First Nations inhabitants All that was changed with the westward extension of American exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty especially in the southern Columbia Basin within present day Washington and Oregon In the Oregon Treaty divided the territory along the th parallel to the Strait of Georgia with the area south of this boundary excluding Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands transferred to sole American sovereignty The Colony of Vancouver Island was created in with Victoria designated as the capital New Caledonia as the whole of the mainland rather than just its north central Interior came to be called continued to be an unorganized territory of British North America administered by individual HBC trading post managers br br br Colony of British Columbia br br With the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in an influx of Americans into New Caledonia prompted the colonial office to designate the mainland as the Colony of British Columbia When news of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush reached London Richard Clement Moody was hand picked by the Colonial Office under Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton to establish British order and to transform the newly established Colony of British Columbia into the British Empire s bulwark in the farthest west and found a second England on the shores of the Pacific Lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of British culture not just a police force he sought men who possessed courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world and he decided to send Moody whom the government considered to be the English gentleman and British Officer to lead the Royal Engineers Columbia Detachment br Moody and his family arrived in British Columbia in December commanding the Royal Engineers Columbia Detachment He was sworn in as the first lieutenant governor of British Columbia and appointed Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for British Columbia On the advice of Lytton Moody hired Robert Burnaby as his personal secretary br br In British Columbia Moody wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for British dominance styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe Subsequent to the enactment of the Pre emption Act of Moody settled the Lower Mainland He selected the site and founded the new capital New Westminster He selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port He was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to Blackwood br br The entrance to the Frazer is very striking Extending miles to the right left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities yet fr the Background of Superb Mountains Swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you Everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the Queen of England s dominions on the Pacific mainland My imagination converted the silent marshes into Cuyp like pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset The water of the deep clear Frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away br br Lord Lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town and the efforts of Moody s engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of Governor James Douglas whom Sir Thomas Frederick Elliot described as like any other fraud made it impossible for Moody s design to be fulfilled br Moody and the Royal Engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become Kingsway connecting New Westminster to False Creek the North Road between Port Moody and New Westminster and the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park He named Burnaby Lake after his private secretary Robert Burnaby and named Port Coquitlam s foot Mary Hill after his wife As part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included Stanley Park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an American invasion The Pre emption Act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including hectares acres by Moody himself For this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbing Moody designed the first coat of arms of British Columbia Port Moody is named after him It was established at the end of a trail that connected New Westminster with Burrard Inlet to defend New Westminster from potential attack from the US br By the Cariboo Gold Rush attracting an additional miners was underway and Douglas hastened construction of the Great North Road commonly known now as the Cariboo Wagon Road up the Fraser Canyon to the prospecting region around Barkerville By the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of British colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture With this increased stability objections to the colony s absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalized led by the influential editor of the New Westminster British Columbian and future premier John Robson A series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by Douglas and the colonial office until Douglas was eased out of office in Finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor br br br Later gold rushes br A series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed the largest being the Cariboo Gold Rush in forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of far flung boom communities like Barkerville and Lillooet which sprang up overnight The Vancouver Island colony was facing financial crises of its own and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in when the colony of British Columbia was amalgamated with the Colony of Vancouver Island to form the Colony of British Columbia which was in turn succeeded by the present day province of British Columbia following the Canadian Confederation of br br br Rapid growth and development s to s br br The Confederation League led the chorus pressing for the colony to join Canada which had been created out of three British North American colonies in the Province of Canada Nova Scotia and New Brunswick With the agreement by the Canadian government to extend the Canadian Pacific Railway to British Columbia and assume the colony s debt British Columbia became the sixth province to join Confederation on July The Treaty of Washington sent the Pig War San Juan Islands Border dispute to arbitration in and in the province s territory shrank again after the Alaska boundary dispute settled the vague boundary of the Alaska Panhandle br Population in British Columbia continued to expand as the mining forestry agriculture and fishing sectors were developed Mining activity was notable throughout the Mainland that a common epithet it even after provincehood was the Gold Colony Agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile Fraser Valley Cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the Thompson Rivers the Cariboo the Chilcotin and the Okanagan Forestry drew workers to the temperate rainforests of the coast which was also the locus of a growing fishery br The completion of the railway in contributed to the economy facilitating the transportation of the region s considerable resources to the east The milltown of Granville also known as Gastown was selected as the terminus This prompted the incorporation of the city of Vancouver in The completion of the Port of Vancouver spurred rapid growth and in less than fifty years the city surpassed Winnipeg Manitoba as the largest in Western Canada The early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use specifically its settlement and development were paramount This included expropriation from First Nations people of their land control over its resources as well as the ability to trade in some resources such as fishing br Establishing a labour force to develop the province was problematic and British Columbia was a destination of immigration from Europe China Japan and India The influx of a non European population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups resulting in agitation and an attempt to restrict the ability of Asian people to immigrate to British Columbia through the imposition of the Chinese head tax This resentment culminated in mob attacks against Chinese and Japanese immigrants in Vancouver in and br br br th century br br In World War I the province responded strongly to the call to assist the British Empire against its German foes in French and Belgian battlefields About of the province s residents the highest per capita rate in Canada responded to the military s need About men from the province died in combat br In a second transcontinental rail line the Grand Trunk Pacific was completed This opened up the North Coast and Bulkley Valley region to new economic opportunities What had previously been an almost exclusively fur trading and subsistence economy soon became an area for forestry farming and mining This sector attracted workers from Asia and Europe leading to a diverse but conflict ridden society The early th century saw significant interaction between immigrants First Nations and economic forces There was a rise in the labour movement marked by strikes and conflicts such as the docker s strike at Ballantyne Pier and the On to Ottawa Trek These events underscored tensions between workers and big business often mediated by the Communist Party Racial and ethnic relations were strained with legislation reflecting the era s racial prejudices notably against Asian immigrants and First Nations The early and mid th century was marred by incidents like the Komagata Maru incident highlighting anti Asian sentiment br The interwar period and World War II introduced significant changes including prohibition and its eventual repeal and the internment of Japanese Canadians The post war era saw coalition governments and a booming economy spearheaded by infrastructure projects and industrial expansion The Social Credit Party under W A C Bennett dominated BC politics initiating major projects and laying the groundwork for future economic growth The s and s brought economic challenges and political shifts culminating in the Expo world s fair and the end of Social Credit dominance This period also saw significant social movements such as Operation Solidarity There was a transition to New Democratic Party governance in the s focusing on environmental conservation and economic struggles In its second term especially the NDP government faced political scandals such as the fast ferry scandal that ultimately contributed to its downfall br br br st century br br In the provincial election Gordon Campbell s Liberals defeated the NDP gaining out of total seats in the provincial legislature Campbell instituted reforms and removed some of the NDP s policies along with selling off the previous government s fast ferries lowering income taxes and instituting the controversial long term lease of BC Rail to Canadian National Railway Campbell led his party to victory in the provincial election against a substantially strengthened NDP opposition and won a third term in the provincial election br The province won a bid to host the Winter Olympics in Vancouver and Whistler In Vancouver s residents had voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid percent of residents voted in favour of hosting After the Olympic joy faded Campbell s popularity fell His management style implementation of the Harmonized Sales Tax HST despite election promises not to introduce it and cancellation of the BC Rail corruption trial led to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support he resigned in November In early former deputy premier Christy Clark became leader of the Liberals Early Clark government actions included raising the minimum wage creating a new statutory holiday in February called Family Day and pushing the development of BC s liquefied natural gas industry In the lead up to the election the Liberals lagged behind the NDP by a double digit gap in the polls but were able to achieve a surprise victory winning a majority and making Clark the first woman to lead a party to victory in BC Her government went on to balance the budget implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines In the election the NDP formed a minority government with the support of the Green Party through a confidence and supply agreement In July NDP leader John Horgan was sworn in as a premier Clark resigned and Andrew Wilkinson became leader of the BC Liberals In the British Columbia general election the NDP won seats and formed a majority government Wilkinson resigned as the leader of the BC Liberals br British Columbia has been significantly affected by demographic changes within Canada and around the world Vancouver was a major destination for many immigrants from Hong Kong who left the former UK colony prior to its handover to China Trends of urbanization mean the Greater Vancouver area now includes percent of the province s population followed by Greater Victoria with percent These two metropolitan regions have dominated the demographics of BC br By housing prices in Vancouver were the second least affordable in the world Many experts point to evidence of money laundering from China as a contributing factor The high price of residential real estate has led to the implementation of an empty homes tax a housing speculation and vacancy tax and a foreign buyers tax on housing The net number of people coming to BC from other provinces in was almost four times larger than in and BC was the largest net recipient of interprovincial migrants in Canada In British Columbia experienced a net population loss of a substantial percentage of which were people who moved to Alberta br By the COVID pandemic had had a major effect on the province with over deaths and confirmed cases However the COVID vaccine reduced the spread with percent of people in BC over the age of five having been fully vaccinated The unmarked gravesites of hundreds of Indigenous children were discovered at three

language Of these gave singular responses to the question regarding their first language The languages most commonly reported were the following br br While these languages all reflect the last centuries of colonialism and recent immigration British Columbia is home to Indigenous languages They are spoken by about people in total with people fluent in their Indigenous languages They are members of the province s First Nations One of the main Indigenous languages in BC is Kwak wala the language of the Kwakwaka wakw First Nations br br br Economy br br BC s economy is diverse with service producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the province s GDP It is the terminus of two transcontinental railways and the site of major marine cargo and passenger terminals Though less than percent of its vast square kilometres sq mi land is arable the province is agriculturally rich particularly in the Fraser and Okanagan valleys because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys Its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction principally logging farming and mining Vancouver the province s largest city serves as the headquarters of many western based natural resource companies It also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average While the coast of British Columbia and some valleys in the south central part of the province have mild weather the majority of its land mass experiences a cold winter temperate climate similar to the rest of Canada The Northern Interior region has a subarctic climate with very cold winters The climate of Vancouver is by far the mildest winter climate of the major Canadian cities with nighttime January temperatures averaging above the freezing point br British Columbia has a history of being a resource dominated economy centred on the forestry industry but also with fluctuating importance in mining Employment in the resource sector has fallen steadily as a percentage of employment and new jobs are mostly in the construction and retail service sectors It now has the highest percentage of service industry jobs in the west constituting percent of industry compared to percent Western Canadian average The largest section of this employment is in finance insurance real estate and corporate management however many areas outside of metropolitan areas are still heavily reliant on resource extraction With its film industry known as Hollywood North the Vancouver region is the third largest feature film production location in North America after Los Angeles and New York City br The economic history of British Columbia is replete with tales of dramatic upswings and downswings and this boom and bust pattern has influenced the politics culture and business climate of the province Economic activity related to mining in particular has widely fluctuated with changes in commodity prices over time with documented costs to community health br In British Columbia had the third largest GDP in Canada with a GDP of billion and a GDP per capita of British Columbia s debt to GDP ratio is edging up to percent in fiscal year and it is expected to reach percent by British Columbia s economy experienced strong growth in recent years with a total growth rate

elected by the plurality voting system though from to there was significant debate about switching to a single transferable vote system called BC STV The government of the day appoints ministers for various portfolios what are officially part of the Executive Council of whom the premier is chair br br The province is currently governed by the British Columbia New Democratic Party BC NDP under Premier David Eby The provincial election saw the Liberal Party take seats the NDP take and the British Columbia Green Party take No party met the minimum of seats for a majority therefore leading to the first minority government since Following the election the Greens entered into negotiations with both the Liberals and NDP eventually announcing they would support an NDP minority government Previously the right of centre British Columbia Liberal Party governed the province for years between and and won the largest landslide election in British Columbia history in with of seats The legislature became more evenly divided between the Liberals and NDP following the Liberal seats of and Liberal seats of provincial elections The NDP and its predecessor the Co operative Commonwealth Federation CCF have been the main opposition force to right wing parties since the s and have ruled with majority governments in and The Green Party plays a larger role in the politics of British Columbia than Green parties do in most other jurisdictions in Canada After a breakthrough election in percent the party s vote share declined percent percent percent before increasing again to a record high of percent at the election br The British Columbia Liberal Party is not related to the federal Liberal Party and does not share the same ideology Instead the BC Liberal party is a rather diverse coalition made up of the remnants of the Social Credit Party many federal Liberals federal Conservatives and those who would otherwise support right of centre or free enterprise parties In Kevin Falcon was elected leader of the BC Liberals promising to rename the party in an effort to distance themselves from their federal counterparts In the party rebranded as BC United Historically there have commonly been third parties present in the legislature including the Liberals themselves from to the BC Green Party is the current third party in British Columbia with three seats in the legislature br Prior to the rise of the Liberal Party British Columbia s main political party was the BC Social Credit Party which governed the province for years While sharing some ideology with the subsequent Liberal government they were more right wing although they undertook nationalization of various important monopolies notably BC Hydro and BC Ferries br br British Columbia is known for having politically active labour unions who have traditionally supported the NDP or its predecessor the CCF br British Columbia s political history is typified by scandal and a cast of colourful characters beginning with various colonial era land scandals and abuses of power by early officials such as those that led to McGowan s War in Notable scandals in Social Credit years included the Robert Bonner Affair and the Fantasy Gardens scandal which forced Premier Bill Vander Zalm to resign and ended the Social Credit era NDP scandals included Bingogate which brought down NDP Premier Mike Harcourt and the alleged scandal named Casinogate which drove NDP Premier Glen Clark to resign A variety of scandals plagued the Liberal government including Premier Gordon Campbell s arrest for drunk driving in Maui and the resignation of various cabinet ministers because of conflict of interest allegations A raid on the Parliament Buildings on December in Victoria including the Premier s Office resulted in charges only for ministerial aides although key cabinet members from the time resigned Campbell eventually resigned in late due to opposition to his government s plan to introduce a Harmonized Sales Tax HST and was replaced by Christy Clark as premier in the BC Liberal leadership election br British Columbia is underrepresented in the Senate of Canada leading Premier Christy Clark to refuse to cooperate with the federal government s reforms for senate appointments to be made based on the recommendations of an advisory board that would use non partisan criteria Hours after that plan was unveiled in Ottawa on December Clark issued a statement that it did not address what s been wrong with the Senate since the beginning br The imbalance in representation in that House is apparent when considering population size The six senators from BC constitute only one for every people vs one for every in Prince Edward Island which has four senators Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have much smaller populations than BC yet each has ten senators according to a Global News summary Correcting this imbalance would require a constitutional amendment but that is unlikely to be supported by the Atlantic provinces br br br Official symbols br br The government of British Columbia has designated several official symbols br br Flag Flag of British Columbia br Coat of arms Coat

Pacific salmon br Tartan emblem British Columbia Tartan br br br Transportation br Transportation played a huge role in British Columbia s history The Rocky Mountains and the ranges west of them constituted a significant obstacle to overland travel until the completion of the transcontinental railway in The Peace River Canyon through the Rocky Mountains was the route the earliest explorers and fur traders used Fur trade routes were only marginally used for access to British Columbia through the mountains Travel from the rest of Canada before meant the difficulty of overland travel via the United States around Cape Horn or overseas from Asia Nearly all travel and freight to and from the region occurred via the Pacific Ocean primarily through the ports of Victoria and New Westminster br Until the s rail was the only means of overland travel to and from the rest of Canada travellers using motor vehicles needed to journey through the United States With the construction of the Inter Provincial Highway in now known as the Crowsnest Pass Highway and later the Trans Canada Highway road transportation evolved into the preferred mode of overland travel to and from the rest of the country br As of the number of electric vehicles sold in British Columbia as a percentage of total vehicle sales was the highest of any Canadian province or U S state br br br Roads and highways br br Because of its size and rugged varying topography British Columbia requires thousands of kilometres of provincial highways to connect its communities British Columbia s roads systems were notoriously poorly maintained and dangerous until a concentrated program of improvement was initiated in the s and s There are now freeways in Greater Victoria the Lower Mainland and Central Interior of the province Much of the rest of the province where traffic volumes are generally low is accessible by well maintained generally high mobility two lane arterial highways with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas and usually only a few stop controlled intersections outside the main urban areas br br A couple of busy intercity corridors outside Greater Vancouver feature more heavily signalized limited mobility arterial highways that are mostly four lane and often divided by portable median traffic barriers Highway on Vancouver Island and Highway through the Okanagan Valley are medium to high volume roadways with variable posted speeds that range from km h mph to maximums just slightly lower than the principal grade separated highways Numerous traffic lights operate in place of interchanges on both arterials as long term cost cutting measures Signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along inter urban sections where traffic volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of high mobility alternative routes or bypasses The building and maintenance of provincial highways is the responsibility of the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure br There are only five major routes to the rest of Canada From south to north they are BC Highway through the Crowsnest Pass the Vermilion Pass Highway in both British Columbia and Alberta the Kicking Horse Pass the latter being used by the Trans Canada Highway entering Alberta through Banff National Park the Yellowhead Highway through Jasper National Park and Highway through Dawson Creek There are also several highway crossings to the adjoining American states of Washington Idaho and Montana The longest highway is Highway running kilometres mi from the British Columbia Washington border at Osoyoos north to Watson Lake Yukon and which includes the British Columbia portion of the Alaska Highway br br br Public transit br br Prior to surface public transit in the Vancouver and Victoria metropolitan areas was administered by BC Hydro the provincially owned electricity utility Subsequently the province established BC Transit to oversee and operate all municipal transportation systems In the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority now TransLink a separate authority for routes within the Greater Vancouver Regional District was established Some smaller island communities such as Gabriola Island and formerly Pender Island operate routes independent of BC Transit or TransLink BC Transit has recently expanded to provide intercity routes particularly in the Northern region of British Columbia Other intercity routes were introduced connecting southern communities in preparation of the cancellation of Greyhound Canada s pullout from Western Canada though options for intercity bus travel are still extremely limited br Public transit in British Columbia consists mainly of diesel buses although Vancouver is also serviced by a fleet of trolley buses Several experimental buses are being tested such as hybrid buses that have both gasoline and electric engines Additionally there are CNG fuelled buses being tested and used in Nanaimo and Kamloops systems British Columbia also tested a fleet of Hydrogen fuelled buses for the Vancouver Whistler Winter Olympics in TransLink operates SkyTrain an automated metro system serving the cities of Vancouver Burnaby New Westminster Surrey Richmond Coquitlam and Port Moody In the Canada Line SkyTrain was completed linking Vancouver International Airport and the city of Richmond to downtown Vancouver bringing the total to three operating metro lines br A new extension to Coquitlam and Port Moody the Evergreen Extension of the Millennium Line was completed in December Construction of an extension of the Millennium Line westwards through Vancouver to Arbutus Street began in February with future plans to extend the line farther west from Arbutus station to the University of British Columbia Fare gates have been added to all existing stations though in the past SkyTrain used a proof of payment honour system In the capital city of Victoria BC Transit and the provincial government s infrastructure ministry are working together to create a bus rapid transit from the Westshore communities to downtown Victoria In Kamloops there is a bus rapid transit GPS trial underway to see how bus rapid transit affects smaller cities rather than larger ones like Victoria and Vancouver br br br Rail br br Rail development expanded greatly in the decades after the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed in and was the chief mode of long distance surface transportation until the expansion and improvement of the provincial highways system began in the s Two major routes through the Yellowhead Pass competed with the Canadian Pacific Railway the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway terminating at Prince Rupert and the Canadian Northern Railway terminating at Vancouver br The British Columbia Electric Railway provided rail services in Victoria and Vancouver between the nineteenth century and mid twentieth century br The Pacific Great Eastern line supplemented this service providing a north south route between interior resource communities and the coast The Pacific Great Eastern later known as British Columbia Railway and now owned by Canadian National Railway connects Fort St James Fort Nelson and Tumbler Ridge with North Vancouver The E N Railway rebranded as the Island Rail Corridor formerly served the commercial and passenger train markets of Vancouver Island Service along the route is now minimal Vancouver Island was also host to the last logging railway in North America until its closure in br Current passenger services in British Columbia are limited Via Rail operates long distance trains per week on two lines Local services are limited to two regions with TransLink providing rapid transit and commuter services in the Lower Mainland and by the Seton Lake Indian Band South of Lillooet with the Kaoham Shuttle Amtrak runs international passenger service between Vancouver Seattle and intermediate points br Several heritage railways operate within the province including the White Pass and Yukon Route that runs between Alaska and the Yukon via British Columbia br br br Water br br BC Ferries was established as a provincial crown corporation in to provide passenger and vehicle ferry service between Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland as a cheaper and more reliable alternative to the service operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway and other private operators It now operates routes among the islands of British Columbia as well as between the islands and the mainland Ferry service to Washington is offered by the Washington State Ferries between Sidney and Anacortes and Black Ball Transport between Victoria and Port Angeles Washington Ferry service over inland lakes and rivers is provided by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure Various other coastal ferries are operated privately br Commercial ocean transport is of vital importance Major ports are at Vancouver Roberts Bank near Tsawwassen Prince Rupert and Victoria br Vancouver Victoria and Prince Rupert are also major ports of

transformation masks and canoes as well as textile arts like Chilkat weaving and button blankets Traditional Indigenous art of the Pacific Northwest is typically distinguished by the formline style which is defined as continuous flowing curvilinear lines that turn swell and diminish in a prescribed manner They are used for figure outlines internal design elements and in abstract compositions br Western styles and forms were introduced to the region through the establishment of British North American settlements in the late th century Notable English Canadian artists of th and early th century British Columbia include architect Francis Rattenbury designer James Blomfield and painter Emily Carr br Vancouver s art scene was dominated by lyrical abstraction and surrealist landscape painting in the mid th century through such artists as B C Binning Jack Shadbolt Gordon A Smith Takao Tanabe Don Jarvis and Toni Onley In the following decades the city would undergo more artistic diversification with the emergence of conceptual art communication art video art and performance art br The Vancouver School of conceptual photography encompasses a cohort of Vancouver based artists
