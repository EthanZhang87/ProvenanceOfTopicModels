Communications sold The Hockey News to Transcontinental Inc in Five years later Steve Dryden was brought in to replace the departing Bob McKenzie as editor Like with the previous change in the editor Dryden s tenure brought with it many new special editions of the publication including Future Watch People of Power and Influence and Season in Review Although many changes were undertaken from the nascent days of the publication until The Hockey News had remained at its base a tabloid newspaper the entire duration of that period In the move was made to being a full colour publication complete with full bleeds and stapled pages This restructuring was overseen by Jason Kay who replaced Dryden in and remains the brand s editor in chief to this day These changes were built upon when in The

Over the years The Hockey News became known at The Bible of Hockey a name stemming from the fact that it was the unquestioned source for information regarding the hockey world especially prior to the ubiquitousness of the internet and the evolution of sports only cable networks Even in modern times The Hockey News is considered the go to source for hockey information owing to the fact that it is all hockey all the time and is in circulation year round even during the summer months when other publications see a lull in hockey coverage Unlike other Canadian publications which cover hockey The Hockey News has no connection with the NHL allowing for more editorial latitude They are particularly well recognized for their coverage of prospects younger players who ve yet to make it to the
