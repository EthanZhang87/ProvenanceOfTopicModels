The Ice Hockey World Championships are an annual international men s ice hockey tournament organized by the International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF First officially held at the Summer Olympics br The IIHF was created in while the European Championships the precursor to the World Championships were first held in The tournament held at the Summer Olympics is recognized as the first Ice Hockey World Championship From to the Olympic hockey tournament was also considered the World Championship for that year br The first World Championship that was held as an individual event was in in which twelve nations participated In ten teams played a series of round robin format qualifying rounds to determine which nations participated in the medal round Medals were awarded based on the final standings of the teams in the medal round In thirteen nations took part and were split into two groups The top seven teams Pool A played for the World Championship The other six Pool B played for ranking purposes This basic format would be used until although small variations were made During a congress in the IIHF introduced a playoff system As the IIHF grew more teams began to participate at the World Championships so more pools later renamed divisions were introduced br The modern format for the World Championship features teams in the championship group teams in Division I teams in Division II and teams in Division III If there are more than teams the rest compete in Division IV The teams in the championship play a preliminary round then the top eight teams play in the playoff medal round and the winning team is crowned World Champion Over the years the tournament has gone through several rule changes In body checking in all three zones in a rink was allowed helmets and goaltender masks became mandatory in the early s and in the IIHF began using the shootout The current IIHF rules differ slightly from the rules used in the NHL From the Olympics until the World Championships only athletes designated as amateur were allowed to compete in the tournament Because of this players from the National Hockey League and its senior minor league teams were not allowed to compete while the Soviet Union was allowed to use permanent full time players who were positioned as regular workers of an aircraft industry or tractor industry employer that sponsored what would be presented as an after hours amateur social sports society team for their workers In after an agreement to allow just a small number of its professionals to participate was rescinded by the IIHF Canada withdrew from the tournament Starting in professional athletes were allowed to compete in the tournament and Canada re entered The IIHF requires that players are citizens of the country they represent and allow players to switch national teams provided that they play in their new nation for a certain period of time br Canada was the tournament s first dominant team winning the tournament times from to

nation s breakup in the Soviet Union was the dominant team winning championships out of During that period only three other nations won medals Canada Czechoslovakia and Sweden Russia first participated in and the Czech Republic and Slovakia began competing in In the s the competition became more open as the Big Six teams Canada the Czech Republic Finland Russia Sweden and the United States have become more evenly matched br As this tournament takes place during the same period as the later stages of the NHL s Stanley Cup playoffs many of that league s top players are not available to participate for their national teams or have only become available after their NHL teams have been eliminated after playing games North American teams and especially the United States have been criticized for not taking this tournament seriously For example USA Hockey often sent teams made up of younger NHL players alongside college players not using top level stars even when they are available br The World Championship held in Prague and Ostrava Czech Republic was the most successful to date in terms of overall attendance it was visited by people and average attendance was at br br br Background br br The International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF the sport s governing body was created on May under the name Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace LIHG In organized ice hockey was still relatively new the first organized indoor ice hockey game took place on March at Montreal s Victoria Skating Rink In four clubs from Montreal formed the Amateur Hockey Association of

The United States and Czechoslovakia won the silver and bronze medals respectively Following the Olympic Congress in Lausanne the first Winter Olympics were held in in Chamonix France though they were

World Championship Canada won the gold medal at both the and Winter Olympics In the Swedish and Swiss teams won their first medals silver and bronze respectively and a German team participated for the first time finishing ninth br br br Canadian dominance br br The first World Championship that was held as an individual event was in It was held in Chamonix France Vienna Austria and Berlin Germany

won Gold for Canada at the Winter Olympics At the World Championships in Prague Czechoslovakia the United States won the gold medal becoming the first non Canadian team to win the competition As of it is the only gold medal the United States has won at a non Olympic tournament br Two days before the Winter Olympics in Germany Canadian officials protested that two players on the British team James Foster and Alex Archer had played in Canada but transferred without permission to play for clubs in the English National League The IIHF agreed with Canada but Britain threatened to withdraw if the two could not compete Canada withdrew the protest before the games started Britain became the first non Canadian team to win Olympic gold with the United States taking bronze Canada won the remainder of the World Championship tournaments held in the s The World Championships marked the first time that a team from Finland competed in the tournament World War II forced the cancellation of the and Winter Olympics and the World Championships from to br br Following World War II Czechoslovakia s team was quickly improving They won the World Championships although a Canadian team had not participated in the event In they became the third nation to win a World Championship tournament that Canada participated in During the run up to the Winter Olympics in St Moritz Switzerland a conflict broke out with the two American hockey bodies the American Hockey Association AHA a forerunner to USA Hockey and the Amateur Athletic Union AAU The AAU refused to support the AHA s team because they believed that AHA players were openly paid salaries and at the time the Olympics were strictly for amateur players A compromise was reached that the AHA team would be allowed to compete but would be considered unofficial and unable to win a medal By the end of the tournament the AHA team finished fourth in the standings Both Czechoslovakia and the RCAF Flyers of Canada won seven games and tied when they played each other The gold medal winner was determined by goal average Canada won the gold because they had an average of compared to Czechoslovakia s average of br At the Winter Olympics in Oslo Norway the Edmonton Mercurys won Canada s second consecutive Olympic gold medal and their th World Championship in competitions It was the last time that a Canadian team would win an Olympic gold medal in hockey for years At the tournament reigning champion Canada did not attend while the team from Czechoslovakia withdrew because of the death of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia leaving only Sweden West Germany and Switzerland competing in the top division Sweden finished the tournament undefeated and won their first World Championship br br br Canada Soviet Union rivalry br br The World Championships has been described by the IIHF as the start of the modern era of international hockey The tournament saw the first participation of the Soviet Union in international competition The Soviet Union had organized its first ice hockey league in having previously focused on bandy Led by coach Arkady Chernyshev the Soviet national team finished their first six games undefeated Canada represented by the East York Lyndhursts was also undefeated and in the final game of the tournament the two teams met for the first time in international competition The Soviet Union won the game becoming the fifth team to win a World Championship tournament The World Championship was held in West Germany and the two teams again met in the final game of the tournament The game was so high profile in Canada that announcer Foster Hewitt flew to West Germany to provide play by play coverage Both teams were undefeated and Canada represented by the Penticton Vees defeated the Soviets to reclaim the World Championship At the Winter Olympics in Cortina d Ampezzo Italy Canada s Kitchener Waterloo Dutchmen lost to both the Soviets and the United States in the medal round and won the bronze The Soviets went undefeated and won their first Olympic ice hockey gold medal It would be seven years until the Soviet Union won another World Championship br The World Championships were held in Moscow Canada and the United States did not participate in protest of the Soviet occupation of Hungary Most of the games were held in the Luzhniki Sports Palace but the Soviet officials decided to hold the final game in a nearby outdoor soccer stadium The game was attended by at least people which stood as a World Championship attendance record until In the final game Sweden edged the Soviet Union to finish with six wins and one tie the Soviet Union had five wins and two ties and won the gold medal Canada returned to the World Championship in and won two consecutive titles with the Soviets winning silver both times At the Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley California Canada the Soviet Union Czechoslovakia and Sweden were the top four teams heading into the Games All four were defeated by the American team which won all seven games en route to its first Olympic gold medal br In Czechoslovakia defeated the Soviet Union and tied Canada to make it a three way race for gold In the final game Canada defeated the Soviets to win their nineteenth gold medal The Trail Smoke Eaters became the final club team to represent Canada The following year Canada implemented a national team program led by Father David Bauer Canada would not win another world championship gold until In the World Championships were held in North America for the first time The tournament was held in Denver United States and was boycotted by the Soviet and Czechoslovak teams Sweden defeated Canada for the first time in the history of the competition and won their third gold medal br br br Soviet dominance br br At the World Championships in Stockholm the Soviet Union won the gold medal beginning a streak of nine consecutive World Championship golds The Winter Olympics in Innsbruck Austria marked the first time that Canada failed to win an Olympic medal in hockey The Soviet Union won all seven of their games and the gold medal but Canada finished the tournament with five wins and two losses putting them in a three way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia Prior to the tie breaking procedure was based on goal difference from games against teams in the medal round and under that system Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovaks The procedure had been changed to count all games and that meant the Canadians finished fourth However the Olympics also counted as the World Championships and under IIHF rules Canada should have won a World Championship bronze In April the IIHF admitted that a mistake had occurred and announced that they had reviewed the decision and would award the Canadian team a World Championship bronze medal However two months later the IIHF over turned their decision and rejected an appeal in September br The Soviets dominated the remainder of the decade Following the team went undefeated in Olympic and World Championship competition for four years Their streak was broken by Czechoslovakia at the Winter Olympics Despite the loss the Soviets still won gold It was the last time that the Olympics were also counted as the World Championships In the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia played the most emotionally charged games in the history of international hockey The rights to host the tournament had originally been awarded to Czechoslovakia but they were forced to decline the rights following the Soviet led Warsaw Pact invasion of the nation in August The tournament was held in Stockholm Sweden and with these international tensions the Czechoslovak team was determined to defeat the Soviets They won both of their games and but despite these wins the Czechoslovaks lost both of their games to Sweden and won bronze br br With European teams using their best players who are de facto professionals the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association CAHA felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive and pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues At the IIHF Congress in the IIHF voted to allow Canada to use nine non NHL professional players at the World Championships The rights to host the tournament were awarded to Canada for the first time in Montreal and Winnipeg However the decision to allow the use of professionals was reversed in January IOC president Avery Brundage was opposed to the idea of amateur and professional players competing together and said that ice hockey s status as an Olympic sport would be in jeopardy if the change was made In response Canada withdrew from International ice hockey competition Canada s ice hockey team did not participate in the and Winter Olympics Canada also waived their rights to host the World Championship so it was held in Stockholm Sweden instead br Led by goaltender Vladislav Tretiak and forwards Valeri Kharlamov Alexander Yakushev Vladimir Petrov and Boris Mikhailov the Soviet Union won gold at the and World Championships and the Winter Olympics marked the first time that both the Olympics and World Championships were held in the same year as separate events At the World Championships in Prague the Czechoslovak team ended the Soviet team s streak and won their first gold since The Soviet team quickly returned to their winning ways winning and World Championships However during the latter tournament the Czechoslovak team defeated the Soviets It was one of the biggest margins the Soviet team had ever lost by in an official game The World Championships were held in Katowice Poland On the opening day of the tournament Poland defeated the Soviet Union thanks to a hat trick from forward Wieslaw Jobczyk and the goaltending of Andrzej Tkacz It was one of the biggest upsets in international hockey history two months earlier at the Winter Olympics Poland had lost to the Soviets The Soviets lost two more games and won the silver and Czechoslovakia won gold Poland finished seventh and was relegated to Pool B the division in which teams play for ranking purposes and not the championship now known as Division I br br br First years of open competition br G nther Sabetzki became president of the IIHF in and helped to resolve the dispute with the CAHA The IIHF agreed to allow open competition of all players in the World Championships and moved the competition to later in the season so players not involved in the NHL playoffs could participate However NHL players were still not allowed to play in the Olympics because of both the unwillingness of the NHL to take a break mid season and the IOC s strict amateur only policy The IIHF also agreed to endorse the Canada Cup a competition meant to bring together the best players from the top hockey playing countries br The World Ice Hockey Championships in Katowice were the first to feature professionals although in the end only the United States made use of the new rule recalling eight pros from the NHL s Minnesota North Stars and the WHA s Minnesota Fighting Saints The first fully open World Championship was held in in Vienna Austria and saw the first participation of active Canadian NHL players including two time NHL MVP Phil Esposito Sweden and Finland also augmented their rosters with a few NHL and WHA players Many of the players on the Canadian team were not prepared for the tournament and were unfamiliar with the international game The team finished fourth losing both games to the Soviet Union by a combined score of Czechoslovakia won gold becoming the third team after Canada and the Soviet Union to win consecutive championships br As a result of these events full world championship status was given to the IIHF World Under Championship which had been held annually since as an unofficial invitational tournament Colloquially known as the World Junior Ice Hockey Championship the event was structured after the World Championships but limited to players under the age of The World Under Championship was established in and typically held in April It usually does not involve some of the top North American based players because they are involved in junior league playoffs at the time br Starting in the Soviet team won five consecutive World Championships and had an unbeaten streak that br lasted from through the Winter Olympics and until During that period Canada remained competitive winning three bronze medals World Championship tournaments were br not held in or the Olympic years br The World Championships in Vienna were over shadowed by several controversies At the beginning of the tournament the roster of the West German team included Miroslav Sikora a Polish German forward who had previously played for Poland at the World Under Championship Sikora became a naturalized citizen of West Germany and played in the first three games scoring a goal in a win over Finland Following the game Finland launched a protest demanding that the result be over turned because the West Germans had used an br ineligible player At the time players were not allowed to switch nationalities under any circumstances and the IIHF agreed to overturn the result and award the two points to Finland This angered West German officials who filed a protest in an Austrian court The court agreed with the West Germans overturning the IIHF decision and allowing them to keep their points The result affected the final standings because had the IIHF s decision stood Finland would have advanced to the medal round instead of Sweden However the Finns finished out of the medal round and Sweden won their first gold medal since The tournament format also became controversial because the Soviet Union finished undefeated in the preliminary round but the Swedish team which had lost three games in the preliminary round won on goal differential because of a win over Canada in the medal round br br br Fall of the Iron Curtain br br Before players that lived in the Soviet Union Czechoslovakia and other nations behind the Iron Curtain were not allowed to leave and play in the NHL In March Sergei Pryakhin became the first member of the Soviet national team who was permitted to play for a non Soviet team Several Soviet players including Igor Larionov and Viacheslav Fetisov wanted to leave and play in the NHL Soviet officials agreed to allow players to leave if they played one final tournament with the national team Players agreed to this and the Soviet Union won its st World Championship Shortly after Soviet players began to flood into the NHL Many of the Soviet Union s top players left including the entire Green Unit Larionov Fetisov Vladimir Krutov Sergei Makarov and Alexei Kasatonov The following year the Soviet team won their final title at the World Championships In Swedish forward Mats Sundin the first European player to be drafted first overall in the NHL led his team to the gold medal The Soviets won bronze the last medal the team would ever win br The Soviet Union dissolved in December Nine former Soviet republics became part of the IIHF and began competing in international competitions including Belarus Kazakhstan Latvia which returned after a year long absence due to having been occupied by the Soviet Union and Ukraine the largest Russia succeeded the USSR With this flood of new teams the IIHF expanded the number of spots from eight to twelve From to only four teams won a World Championship medal the Soviet Union Czechoslovakia failing to win a medal only three times Sweden and Canada The Soviets won a medal in every tournament they participated in to At the World Championships Sweden won their second consecutive gold Finland won the silver medal the nation s first ever World Championship medal the Finnish team had previously won a silver at the Winter Olympics br br br present br Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January The IIHF recognized the Czech Republic s team as the successor to Czechoslovakia and it retained its position in the top division while Slovakia s team began in the lowest division Pool C in and was forced to work its way up Following this the next decade was dominated by the so called Big Six Canada the Czech Republic Finland Russia Sweden and the United States From to five different teams won the World Championship At the World Championships Russia won its first title as an independent nation and the Czech Republic won its first medal bronze In the Canadian team finished the preliminary round undefeated and defeated Finland in the final to win their first World Championship since The following year in Sweden the Finnish team won its first ever World Championship Led by their top line of Saku Koivu Ville Peltonen and Jere Lehtinen the Finns defeated rival Sweden in the gold medal game At the Pool B championships Slovakia led by Peter astn won Pool B and was promoted to the top division where it has remained ever since In the Czech Republic won its first World Championship as a separate country During this period the United States was the only one of the Big Six not to win the World Championship although they did win the World Cup of Hockey and their bronze at that year s World Championship was their first medal since In the mid s several new teams such as Slovakia Latvia Belarus Kazakhstan and Ukraine were quickly improving and older nations such as Austria France Italy Norway and Switzerland were at risk of being relegated to Pool B The IIHF feared that it would lose advertising revenue if that happened so the number of teams was increased to starting in br br From to the Czech Republic won six consecutive World Championship medals including World Championship gold from to as well as gold at the Winter Olympics In the Czechs were favoured to win but were upset in the quarter final by Russia In the gold medal game between Russia and Slovakia Slovakian Peter Bondra scored in the final two minutes of the game and the nation won its first ever World Championship At the World Championships Sweden made one of the biggest comebacks in tournament history rallying from a deficit in their quarterfinal game against Finland to win The gold medal game between Canada and Sweden went into overtime Canada s Anson Carter scored the winning goal minutes into play but the goal had to be reviewed for ten minutes to determine if the puck had crossed the line In a rematch of the two nations the following year Canada won and repeated as champions br br The NHL season was locked out and eventually cancelled because of a labour dispute between the league and the players The World Championships which featured more top players than normal was won by the Czech Republic At the Winter Olympics Sweden won the gold medal over Finland Three months later Sweden defeated the Czech Republic and won the World Championships They became the first team to win Olympic gold and a separate World Championship tournament in the same year At the World Championship in Moscow Canada

break to allow full player participation IIHF president Ren Fasel responded that the tournament has television contracts and hosting commitments and that a large change would be difficult to put in place br The tournament took place in Germany The first game between Germany and the United States was played at Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen and was attended by people setting a new record for the most attended game in hockey history The tournament was noted for having several surprising preliminary round results including Switzerland beating Canada for the first time in World Championship play Norway defeating eventual champions the Czech Republic and Denmark upsetting Finland and the United States en route to their first ever quarterfinal appearance The German team which had finished th in and only avoided relegation to Division I because they were set to host the tournament advanced to the semi finals for the first time since the new playoff format was adapted They finished fourth

silver medal was the first for the nation since Sweden s gold made them the first team to win the tournament at home since the Soviet Union in br The tournament was held for the first time in independent Belarus in spite of concerns of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the authoritarian government The tournament saw more upsets by the less prominent ice hockey nations France had beaten Canada for the second time in the modern history and made it to the quarterfinals Eventual finalist Finland lost to Latvia and made it to the quarterfinals only due to a shootout win over Switzerland The tournament was won by Russia which had a stacked NHL squad compared to other teams who sent in younger players after the Winter Olympics Finland won silver and Sweden won bronze defeating the Czech Republic br The tournament was held in Prague and Ostrava it was the most attended championship in history It was to be the last appearance of Jarom r J gr on the Czech national hockey team and the home crowd had great expectations for its national team who had failed to win a gold medal since matching its longest run without a win since the break up of Czechoslovakia However the tournament was dominated by an excellent Canadian team which went undefeated and beat Russia in the gold medal match Its captain Sidney Crosby joined the Triple Gold Club becoming the first player to achieve that honour as captain of each winning team The bronze was won by the United States leaving the Czechs with a second consecutive fourth place br br The tournament was cancelled due to the COVID pandemic br br br Tournament structure br br br History br br The first World Championship to be held as an individual event was in Twelve different nations participated Canada s team was given a bye to the gold medal game and the rest of the nations played an elimination tournament to determine which nation would also play for the gold br In the World Championships switched to a similar format to what was used at the Olympics Ten teams played series of round robin format qualifying rounds were played to determine which nations participated in the medal round Medals were awarded based on the final standings of the teams in the medal round The format was changed several times in the s in some years there was a gold medal game while in others the gold medal was awarded based on points br In the tournament format was again switched to being similar to the version used at the Olympics A preliminary round involving teams was played then the top four advanced to the medal round and medals were awarded based on points no gold medal game was played A gold medal game was played in it was the last gold medal game played in the World Championships until br br In thirteen nations took part and were split into two groups The top seven teams Pool A played for the World Championship The other six Pool B played for ranking purposes Generally eight teams played in the top level Championship although the number varied over the years going as low as three in and as high as twelve in The same format was used until The format was criticized because often the gold medal winner was decided before the final game was played such as at the Winter Olympics br During a congress in the IIHF introduced a playoff system br As the IIHF grew more teams began to participate at the World Championships so more pools were introduced Pool C games were first played in and Pool D was introduced in In the pools were renamed Pool B became Division I Pool C became Division II and Pool D became Division III br br br Modern Champion Group Division I II and III format br The modern format for the World Championship features a minimum of teams teams in the main championship group teams in Division I teams in Division II and teams in Division III If there are more than teams the rest compete in Division IV br From to the teams were divided into four groups and played each other in a round robin format preliminary round and the top teams in each group advance into the qualifying round The qualifying round is another round of group play with two groups of six with the top four teams in each group advancing into the knockout playoff stage The bottom four teams in the preliminary round played in another group as well this group determined relegation After a round robin format the bottom two teams were usually relegated to play in Division I the following year br From and the IIHF held a Far East qualifying tournament for Asian teams with an automatic berth in the championship division on the line Japan always won this tournament but finished last at every World Championship except in when they finished th The IIHF discontinued the qualifying tournament following the tournament and Japan was relegated to compete in Division I br br br Champion group format from br The main group features teams The teams are split into two groups based on their world ranking The ranking is based on the standings of the last Winter Olympics and the last four World Championships The results of more recent tournaments have a higher weight in the ranking The last World Championship has value the tournament before and so on The Olympic tournament has the same value as the World Championship the same year br Beginning with the tournament the qualifying round was eliminated and the teams divided into two groups of eight with each team playing seven games in the preliminary round br The top four teams from these groups advanced to the knockout playoff stage In the quarterfinals the first place team from one group played the fourth place team from the opposite group and the second place team from one group played the third place team from the opposite group The winners advanced to the semi finals In cases where the quarter final venues were deemed too far apart to allow easy travel between them the teams stayed within their groups for the quarters The winners of the quarter finals advanced to the semi finals with the winners of the semi finals advancing to the gold medal game and the losers advancing to the bronze medal game br Also starting in the relegation round was eliminated Instead the eighth place team in each group was relegated to Division I br br br Division I II and III formats from br Division I is split into two groups of six both groups play in round robin tournaments independent of each other and the championship division Previously the top team from both groups was promoted to the championship while the bottom team was relegated to Division II Beginning in the top two teams from the A group were promoted to the championship the bottom team was exchanged with the group B winner and that group s last place team was sent to Division II br Division II works similarly to Division I with two six team groups where group A promotes one team to Division I and group B exchanges its last placed team with Division III Division III is now composed of one group of six and if more than six nations register for this the lowest level then a qualification tournament will be held br br br Division IV from br The IIHF introduced Division IV intended to debut in the tournament but cancelled due to COVID Kyrgyzstan hosted the inaugural Division IV Championship in br br br Rules br br br Game rules br br At the first tournament in there were many differences from the modern game games were played outdoors on natural ice forward passes were not allowed the rink was x metres the current International standard is x metres and two twenty minute periods were played Each side had seven players on the ice the extra position being the rover Following the tournament the IIHF held a congress and decided to adopt the Canadian rules six men per side and three periods of play br At an IIHF congress in officials voted to allow body checking in all three zones in a rink similar to the NHL Prior to that body checking was only allowed in the defending zone in international hockey The IIHF later described the rule change as arguably the most substantial and dramatic rule changes in the history of international hockey because it allowed for a more aggressive game The rule which was first applied at the World Championships was controversial IIHF president Bunny Ahearne feared it would make ice hockey a sport for goons Several other rule changes were implemented in the early s players were required to wear helmets starting in and goaltender masks became mandatory in In the IIHF switched to using a playoff system to determine medalists and decided that tie games in the medal round would be decided in a shootout The IIHF decided to test a new rule in that would allow two line passes Prior to that the neutral zone trap had slowed the game down and reduced scoring At the World Championships teams were allowed to decide if they wanted to test the rule Although no team accepted the offer the rule was adopted The IIHF described it as the most revolutionary rule change since allowing body checking in all three zones in The new rule almost immediately changed the game for the better The IIHF World Championship in Norway was a stark contrast to the finals the year before with many more goals scored and with end to end action not defence dominating play br The current IIHF rules differ slightly from the rules used in the NHL One difference between NHL and IIHF rules is rink dimensions the NHL rink is narrower measuring x metres x feet instead of the international size of x metres x feet Another rule difference between the NHL and the IIHF rules concerns how icings are called As of the regular NHL season a linesman stops play due to icing using the hybrid icing method instead of the former method where a defending player other than the goaltender touched the puck before an attacking player was able to in contrast to the IIHF rules that use no touch icing where play is stopped the moment the puck crosses the goal line The NHL and IIHF differ also in penalty rules The NHL in addition to the minor and double minor penalties called in IIHF games calls major penalties which are more dangerous infractions of the rules such as fighting and have a duration of five minutes This is in contrast to the IIHF rule in which players who fight are ejected from the game br Since the season the NHL instituted several new rules Some of them were already used by the IIHF such as the shootout and making the two line pass legal Others which were not picked up by the IIHF such as requiring smaller goaltender equipment and the addition of the goaltender trapezoid to the rink However the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL s league s zero tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more hooking holding and interference penalties In the IIHF voted to eliminate tie games and institute a three point system wins in regulation time would be worth three points overtime wins would be two points and over time losses would be worth one point The system was first used at the World Championships br Since the World Championships banned the shootout for the Gold Medal Game Multiple minute golden goal overtime periods of on are played until whoever scores which wins the game br br br Player eligibility br The World Championships have been open to all players both professional and amateur since The IIHF lists the following requirements for a player to be eligible to play br br Each player must be under the jurisdiction of an IIHF member national association br Each player must be a citizen of the country he represents br Each player must be at least years of age on the day the respective championship starts or be at least and obtain an under age waiver br If a player who has never played in an IIHF competition changes their citizenship they must participate in national competitions in their new country for at least two consecutive years and have an international transfer card ITC If a player who has previously played in an IIHF tournament wishes to change their national team they must have played in their new country for four years A player can only do this once br As this tournament takes place during the same time period as the NHL s Stanley Cup playoffs NHL players generally only become available if their respective NHL team missed the playoffs or once they have been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention It is therefore common for several NHL players to join the World Championships while the tournament is already in progress br br br Divisions br br As of the IIHF World Championships are split into five different divisions This is the alignment of the divisions accurate as of the IIHF World Ranking Teams that are not ranked are not included here for a full list of IIHF members see List of members of the International Ice Hockey Federation br Keys br br Promoted br Never been promoted relegated began in that
