id: 70149799
On February Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo Ukrainian War that started in The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since World War II It is estimated to have caused tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties and hundreds of thousands of military casualties By June Russian troops occupied about of Ukraine From a population of million about million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than million had fled the country by April creating Europe s largest refugee crisis since World War II Extensive environmental damage caused by the war has been widely described as an ecocide while war related disruption to Ukrainian agriculture and shipping contributed to a world food crisis The Russian attacks on civilians have been characterised by scholars as genocide and democide against Ukrainians br Before the invasion Russian troops massed near Ukraine s borders as Russian officials denied any plans to attack Russian president Vladimir Putin then announced a special military operation saying it was to support the Russian backed breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk whose paramilitary forces had been fighting Ukraine in the Donbas conflict since Putin espoused irredentist views challenging Ukraine s right to exist and falsely claimed that Ukraine was governed by neo Nazis persecuting the Russian minority He said his goal was to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched at a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv a southern front from Crimea and an eastern front from the Donbas and towards Kharkiv Ukraine enacted martial law ordered a general mobilisation and severed diplomatic relations with Russia br Russian troops retreated from the northern front by April after encountering logistical challenges and stiff Ukrainian resistance On the southern and southeastern fronts Russia captured Kherson in March and Mariupol in May after a destructive siege Russia launched a renewed offensive in the Donbas and continued to bomb military and civilian targets far from the front including the energy grid through the winter In late Ukraine launched successful counteroffensives in the south and east Soon after Russia announced the illegal annexation of four partly occupied regions In November Ukraine retook parts of Kherson Oblast including Kherson city In June Ukraine launched another counteroffensive in the southeast which by the end of the year had petered out with only small amounts of territory retaken br The invasion was met with widespread international condemnation The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal in March The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine The Baltic states all declared Russia a terrorist state Protests occurred around the world with anti war protesters in Russia being met by mass arrests and the enactment of a law enabling greater media censorship Over companies closed their operations in Russia and Belarus as a result of the invasion The International Criminal Court ICC opened investigations into possible crimes against humanity war crimes abduction of children and genocide The ICC issued six arrest warrants in that regard for Putin and Maria Lvova Belova as well as for military officials Sergey Kobylash Viktor Sokolov Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov br br br Background br br br International treaties br After the collapse of the Soviet Union in late the newly independent states of the Russian Federation and Ukraine maintained cordial relations In return for security guarantees Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty in agreeing to dismantle the nuclear weapons the former USSR had left in Ukraine At that time Russia the UK and the USA agreed in the Budapest Memorandum to uphold Ukraine s territorial integrity In Russia signed the Charter for European Security affirming the right of each state to choose or change its security arrangements and join alliances In Putin said that Ukraine s relations with NATO were a matter for those two partners br However when Ukraine and Georgia sought to join NATO in Putin warned that their membership would be a threat to Russia Some NATO members worried about antagonising Russia At the Bucharest summit NATO refused to offer Ukraine and Georgia membership but a joint declaration was issued that Ukraine would become a member one day Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would do everything it could to prevent this Putin claimed that NATO members had promised in not to let Eastern European countries join No such provision was included in any treaty signed by Russia or NATO br br br Ukrainian revolution Russian intervention in Crimea and Donbas br br In Ukraine s parliament overwhelmingly approved finalising an association agreement with the European Union EU Russia had put pressure on Ukraine to reject it Kremlin adviser Sergei Glazyev warned in September that if Ukraine signed the EU agreement Russia would no longer acknowledge Ukraine s borders In November Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych suddenly withdrew from signing the agreement choosing closer ties to the Russian led Eurasian Economic Union instead This coerced withdrawal triggered a wave of protests known as Euromaidan culminating in the Revolution of Dignity in February Yanukovych was removed from power by parliament and fled to Russia br br Pro Russian unrest immediately followed in eastern and southern Ukraine Russian soldiers with no insignia occupied the Ukrainian territory of Crimea and seized the Crimean Parliament Russia annexed Crimea in March after a widely disputed referendum The war in Donbas began in April when armed Russian backed separatists seized Ukrainian government buildings and proclaimed the independent Donetsk People s Republic and Luhansk People s Republic Russian troops were directly involved in these conflicts The ceasefires of the Minsk agreements signed in September and February in a bid to stop the fighting repeatedly failed br The annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas sparked a wave of Russian nationalism and Russian fascism with calls to annex more Ukrainian land for Novorossiya New Russia Analyst Vladimir Socor called Putin s speech following the annexation a manifesto of Greater Russia Irredentism Putin referred to the Kosovo independence precedent and NATO bombing of Yugoslavia as a justification for his involvement in the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas br Because of Russia s occupation of Crimea and its invasion of the Donbas Ukraine s parliament voted in December to remove the neutrality clause from the Constitution and to seek Ukraine s membership in NATO However it was impossible for Ukraine to join NATO at the time as a key requirement for admission is that any applicant nation has no unresolved external territorial disputes br br br Prelude br br There was a massive Russian military build up near the Ukraine border in March and April and again in both Russia and Belarus from October onward Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine with denials being issued up to the day before the invasion The decision to invade Ukraine was reportedly made by Putin and a small group of war hawks or siloviki in Putin s inner circle including national security adviser Nikolai Patrushev and defence minister Sergei Shoigu br In July Putin published an essay On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians in which he called Ukraine historically Russian lands and claimed there is no historical basis for the idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from the Russians Days before the invasion Putin claimed that Ukraine never had real statehood and that modern Ukraine was a mistake created by the Russian Bolsheviks American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin s ideas as imperialism British journalist Edward Lucas described it as historical revisionism Other observers found that Russia s leadership held a distorted view of Ukraine as well as of its own history and that these distortions were propagated through the state br During the second build up Russia demanded that NATO end all activity in Eastern Europe and ban Ukraine or any former Soviet state from ever joining NATO Russia threatened an unspecified military response if NATO followed an aggressive line These demands were widely seen as non viable Eastern European states have willingly joined NATO for security reasons and their governments sought protection from Russian irredentism A treaty to prevent Ukraine joining would go against NATO s open door policy despite NATO s unenthusiastic response to Ukrainian requests to join NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that Russia has no say on whether Ukraine joins and that Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbours NATO s official policy is that it does not seek confrontation and NATO and Russia had co operated until Russia annexed Crimea NATO offered to improve communication with Russia to discuss missile placements and military exercises as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine s borders but Russia did not do so br French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz both made efforts in February to prevent war Macron met Putin but failed to dissuade him from the invasion Scholz warned Putin heavy sanctions would be imposed should he invade and told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to declare Ukraine a neutral state and renounce its aspirations to join NATO Zelenskyy replied that Putin could not be trusted to uphold such a settlement Ukraine had been a neutral country in when Russia occupied Crimea and invaded the Donbas On February Zelenskyy made a speech at the Munich Security Conference calling for Western powers to drop their policy of appeasement towards Moscow and implement a clear time frame for when Ukraine could join NATO br br br Putin s invasion announcement br br On February Putin announced Russian diplomatic recognition of the Russian controlled territories of Ukraine as independent states the Donetsk People s Republic and Luhansk People s Republic The following day Russia announced that it was sending troops into these territories as peacekeepers and the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force abroad br br Before a m Kyiv time on February Putin in another speech announced a special military operation which effectively declar ed war on Ukraine Putin said the operation was to protect the people of the Russian controlled breakaway republics He falsely claimed that they had been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime Putin also falsely claimed that Ukrainian government officials were neo Nazis under Western control that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons and that NATO was building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia He said Russia sought the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine and espoused views challenging Ukraine s right to exist Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self determination Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine and Russian troops invaded from the north east and south Russia did not officially declare war Reports of an alleged leak of Russian Federal Security Service FSB documents by US intelligence sources said that the FSB had not been aware of Putin s plan to invade Ukraine br br br Strength br The strength of Russian invading forces including Russia controlled people s militias of DPR and LPR is estimated at personnel The strength of Russian forces fighting at February is estimated at br br br Timeline br br The invasion described as the biggest attack on a European country since the Second World War began at dawn on February Russia launched a simultaneous ground and air campaign commencing air and missile strikes across Ukraine with some rockets reaching as far west as Lviv It is Russia s largest combined arms operation since the Battle of Berlin in Fighting began in Luhansk Oblast at a m Kyiv time near Milove on the border with Russia The main infantry and tank attacks were launched in four spearheads creating a northern front launched towards Kyiv from Belarus a southern front from Crimea a southeastern front from Russian controlled Donbas and an eastern front from Russia towards Kharkiv and Sumy Russian vehicles were subsequently marked with a white Z military symbol a non Cyrillic letter believed to be a measure to prevent friendly fire br Immediately after the invasion began Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine The same evening he ordered a general mobilisation of all Ukrainian males between and years old prohibiting them from leaving the country Wagner Group mercenaries and Kadyrovites contracted by the Kremlin reportedly made several attempts to assassinate Zelenskyy including an operation involving several hundred mercenaries meant to infiltrate Kyiv with the aim of killing the Ukrainian president The Ukrainian government said anti war officials within Russia s FSB shared the plans with them br The Russian invasion was unexpectedly met by fierce Ukrainian resistance In Kyiv Russia failed to take the city and was repulsed in the battles of Irpin Hostomel and Bucha The Russians tried to encircle the capital but its defenders under Oleksandr Syrskyi held their ground effectively using Western Javelin anti tank missiles and Stinger anti aircraft missiles to thin Russian supply lines and stall the offensive br On the southern front Russian forces had captured the regional capital of Kherson by March A column of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles was ambushed on March in Brovary and sustained heavy losses that forced them to retreat The Russian army adopted siege tactics on the western front around the key cities of Chernihiv Sumy and Kharkiv but failed to capture them due to stiff resistance and logistical setbacks In Mykolaiv Oblast Russian forces advanced as far as Voznesensk but were repelled and pushed back south of Mykolaiv On March the Russian Defence Ministry stated that the first stage of the military operation in Ukraine was generally complete that the Ukrainian military forces had suffered serious losses and the Russian military would now concentrate on the liberation of Donbas The first stage of the invasion was conducted on four fronts including one towards western Kyiv from Belarus by the Russian Eastern Military District comprising the th th and th Combined Arms Armies A second axis deployed towards eastern Kyiv from Russia by the Central Military District northeastern front comprised the st Combined Arms Army and the nd Guards Combined Arms Army br A third axis was deployed towards Kharkiv by the Western Military District eastern front with the st Guards Tank Army and th Combined Arms Army A fourth southern front originating in occupied Crimea and Russia s Rostov oblast with an eastern axis towards Odesa and a western area of operations toward Mariupol was opened by the Southern Military District including the th th and th Combined Arms Army the latter also commanding the st and nd Army Corps of the Russian separatist forces in Donbas By April Russian troops deployed to the northern front by the Russian Eastern Military District pulled back from the Kyiv offensive reportedly to resupply and redeploy to the Donbas region in an effort to reinforce the renewed invasion of southeastern Ukraine The northeastern front including the Central Military District was similarly withdrawn for resupply and redeployment to southeastern Ukraine On April delegates from the US and allied nations met at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to discuss the formation of a coalition that would provide economic support in addition to military supplies and refitting to Ukraine Following Putin s Victory Day speech in early May US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said no short term resolution to the invasion should be expected br br Ukraine s reliance on Western supplied equipment constrained operational effectiveness as supplying countries feared that Ukraine would use Western made mat riel to strike targets in Russia Military experts disagreed on the future of the conflict some suggested that Ukraine should trade territory for peace while others believed that Ukraine could maintain its resistance due to Russian losses br By May disparities between Russian and Ukrainian artillery were apparent with Ukrainian artillery being vastly outgunned in terms of both range and number In response to US President Joe Biden s indication that enhanced artillery would be provided to Ukraine Putin said that Russia would expand its invasion front to include new cities in Ukraine In apparent retribution Putin ordered a missile strike against Kyiv on June after not directly attacking the city for several weeks On June deputy head of the SBU Vadym Skibitsky stated that during the Severodonetsk campaign the frontlines were where the future of the invasion would be decided This is an artillery war now and we are losing in terms of artillery Everything now depends on what the west gives us Ukraine has one artillery piece to to Russian artillery pieces Our western partners have given us about of what they have br On June Reuters reported that US Intelligence Director Avril Haines in an update of past U S intelligence assessments on the Russian invasion said that U S intelligence agencies agree that the invasion will continue for an extended period of time In short the picture remains pretty grim and Russia s attitude toward the West is hardening On July BBC reported that extensive destruction by the Russian invasion would cause immense financial damage to Ukraine s reconstruction economy with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal telling nations at a reconstruction conference in Switzerland that Ukraine needs bn for a recovery plan and Russian oligarchs should contribute to the cost br br br Initial invasion February April br br The invasion began on February launched out of Belarus to target Kyiv and from the northeast against the city of Kharkiv The southeastern front was conducted as two separate spearheads from Crimea and the southeast against Luhansk and Donetsk br br br Kyiv and northern front br br Russian efforts to capture Kyiv included a probative spearhead on February from Belarus south along the west bank of the Dnipro River The apparent intent was to encircle the city from the west supported by two separate axes of attack from Russia along the east bank of the Dnipro the western at Chernihiv and from the east at Sumy These were likely intended to encircle Kyiv from the northeast and east br Russia tried to seize Kyiv quickly with Spetsnaz infiltrating into the city supported by airborne operations and a rapid mechanised advance from the north but failed The United States contacted Zelenskyy and offered to help him flee the country lest the Russian Army attempt to kidnap or kill him on seizing Kyiv Zelenskyy responded that The fight is here I need ammunition not a ride The Washington Post which described the quote as one of the most cited lines of the Russian invasion was not entirely sure of the comment s accuracy Reporter Glenn Kessler said it came from a single source but on the surface it appears to be a good one Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from Belarus gained control of the ghost town of Chernobyl Russian Airborne Forces attempted to seize two key airfields near Kyiv launching an airborne assault on Antonov Airport and a similar landing at Vasylkiv near Vasylkiv Air Base on February br By early March Russian advances along the west side of the Dnipro were limited by Ukrainian defences As of March a large Russian convoy reportedly kilometres mi long had made little progress toward Kyiv The London based think tank Royal United Services Institute RUSI assessed Russian advances from the north and east as stalled Advances from Chernihiv largely halted as a siege began there Russian forces continued to advance on Kyiv from the northwest capturing Bucha Hostomel and Vorzel by March though Irpin remained contested as of March By March the lengthy convoy had largely dispersed and taken cover On March Ukrainian forces began a counter offensive to repel Russian forces Unable to achieve a quick victory in Kyiv Russian forces switched their strategy to indiscriminate bombing and siege warfare br On March a Ukrainian counter offensive retook several towns to the east and west of Kyiv including Makariv Russian troops in the Bucha area retreated north at the end of March Ukrainian forces entered the city on April Ukraine said it had recaptured the entire region around Kyiv including Irpin Bucha and Hostomel and uncovered evidence of war crimes in Bucha On April NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said that the Russian retraction resupply and redeployment of their troops from the Kyiv area should be interpreted as an expansion of Putin s plans for Ukraine by redeploying and concentrating his forces on eastern Ukraine Kyiv was generally left free from attack apart from isolated missile strikes One did occur while UN Secretary General Ant nio Guterres was visiting Kyiv on April to discuss the survivors of the siege of Mariupol with Zelenskyy One person was killed and several were injured in the attack br br br Northeastern front br br Russian forces advanced into Chernihiv Oblast on February besieging its administrative capital within four days of fighting On February Ukrainian forces lost control over Konotop As street fighting took place in the city of Sumy just kilometres mi from the Russo Ukrainian border Ukrainian forces claimed that on February that Russian armoured vehicles had been destroyed and dozens of soldiers captured following a Bayraktar TB drone and artillery attack on a large Russian column near Lebedyn in Sumy Oblast Russian forces also attacked Okhtyrka deploying thermobaric weapons br On March Frederick Kagan wrote that the Sumy axis was then the most successful and dangerous Russian avenue of advance on Kyiv and commented that the geography favoured mechanised advances as the terrain is flat and sparsely populated offering few good defensive positions Travelling along highways Russian forces reached Brovary an eastern suburb of Kyiv on March The Pentagon confirmed on April that the Russian army had left Chernihiv Oblast but Sumy Oblast remained contested On April the governor of Sumy Oblast said that Russian troops were gone but had left behind rigged explosives and other hazards br br br Southern front br br On February Russian forces took control of the North

approached the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on February and besieged Enerhodar A fire began but the Ukrainian military said that essential equipment was undamaged A third Russian attack group from Crimea moved northwest and captured the bridge over the Dnieper On March Russian troops took Kherson this was the first major city to fall to Russian forces Russian troops moved on Mykolaiv and attacked it two days later They were repelled by Ukrainian forces br After renewed missile attacks on March in Mariupol the Ukrainian government said more than had died By March Mariupol was completely encircled and fighting reached the city centre hampering efforts to evacuate civilians On March an art school sheltering around people was destroyed by Russian bombs The Russians demanded surrender and the Ukrainians refused On March Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said that m ore than percent of the whole town is destroyed br Putin told Emmanuel Macron in a phone call on March that the bombardment of Mariupol would only end when the Ukrainians surrendered On April Russian troops refused safe passage into Mariupol to buses sent by the United Nations to evacuate civilians as peace talks continued in Istanbul On April following the retreat of Russian forces from Kyiv Russia expanded its attack on southern Ukraine further west with bombardment and strikes

or worse than before as peace talks with Russia were to resume in Istanbul br Amid the heightened Russian shelling of Kharkiv on March Russia reported a helicopter strike against an oil supply depot approximately kilometres mi north of the border in Belgorod and accused Ukraine of the attack Ukraine denied responsibility By April the renewed massing of Russian invasion troops and tank divisions around the towns of Izium Sloviansk and Kramatorsk prompted Ukrainian government officials to advise the remaining residents near the eastern border of Ukraine to evacuate to western Ukraine within days given the absence of arms and munitions previously promised to Ukraine by then br br br Southeastern front April September br br By April Russian progress on the southeastern front appeared to be impeded by opposing Ukrainian forces in the large heavily fortified Azovstal steel mill and surrounding area in Mariupol br On April The New York Times confirmed that Russia had launched a renewed invasion front referred to as an eastern assault across a kilometre mi front extending from Kharkiv to Donetsk and Luhansk with simultaneous missile attacks again directed at Kyiv in the north and Lviv in western Ukraine As of April a NATO official described Russian advances as uneven and minor An anonymous US Defence official called the Russian offensive very tepid minimal at best and anaemic br In June the chief spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Defence Igor Konashenkov revealed that Russian troops were divided between the Army Groups Centre commanded by Colonel General Aleksander Lapin and South commanded by Army General Sergey Surovikin On July Lavrov announced that Russia would respond to the increased military aid being received by Ukraine from abroad as justifying the expansion of its special military operation to include objectives in both the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions br Russian Ground Forces started recruiting volunteer battalions from the regions in June to create a new rd Army Corps within the Western Military District with a planned strength estimated at personnel Its units were deployed to the front around the time of Ukraine s September Kharkiv

Azovstal iron works and estimated Ukrainian civilians were completely sealed off from any type of relief br After consecutive meetings with Putin and Zelenskyy UN Secretary General Guterres on April said he would attempt to organise an emergency evacuation of survivors from Azovstal in accordance with assurances he had received from Putin on his visit to the Kremlin On April Russian troops allowed civilians to leave under UN protection By May after allowing approximately Ukrainian civilians to depart from the Azovstal steel factory Russian troops renewed their bombardment of the steel factory On May The Daily Telegraph reported that Russia had used thermobaric bombs against the remaining Ukrainian soldiers who had lost contact with the Kyiv government in his last communications Zelenskyy authorised the commander of the besieged steel factory to surrender as necessary under the pressure of increased Russian attacks On May the Associated Press reported that all civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal steel works at the end of the three day ceasefire br br After the last civilians evacuated from the Azovstal bunkers nearly two thousand Ukrainian soldiers remained barricaded there of them injured They were able to communicate a plea for a military corridor to evacuate as they expected summary execution if they surrendered to Russian forces Reports of dissent within the Ukrainian troops at Azovstal were reported by Ukrainska Pravda on May indicating that the commander of the Ukrainian marines assigned to defend the Azovstal bunkers made an unauthorised acquisition of tanks munitions and personnel broke out from the position there and fled The remaining soldiers spoke of a weakened defensive position in Azovstal as a result which allowed progress to advancing Russian lines of attack Ilia Somolienko deputy commander of the remaining Ukrainian troops barricaded at Azovstal said We are basically here dead men Most of us know this and it s why we fight so fearlessly br On May the Ukrainian General staff announced that the Mariupol garrison had fulfilled its combat mission and that final evacuations from the Azovstal steel factory had begun The

second phase of the invasion began On April Russia s Brigadier General Rustam Minnekayev in a defence ministry meeting said that Russia planned to extend its Mykolaiv Odesa front after the siege of Mariupol further west to include the breakaway region of Transnistria on the Ukrainian border with Moldova The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine called this plan imperialism and said that it contradicted previous Russian claims that it did not have territorial ambitions in Ukraine and also that the statement admitted that the goal of the second phase of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine Georgi Gotev of EURACTIV noted on April that Russian occupation from Odesa to Transnistria would transform Ukraine into a landlocked nation with no practical access to the Black Sea Russia resumed its missile strikes on Odesa on April destroying military facilities and causing two dozen civilian casualties br Explosions destroyed two Russian broadcast towers in Transnistria on April that had primarily rebroadcast Russian television programming Ukrainian sources said Russian missile attacks at the end of April destroyed runways in

it was still operated by its Ukrainian staff As many as Russian soldiers controlled the plant Kyiv s nuclear agency said they were shelling nearby areas and storing weapons and missile systems there Almost the entire country went on air raid alert They already shell the other side of the river Dnipro and the territory of Nikopol Energoatom president Pedro Kotin said Russia agreed on August to allow IAEA inspectors access to the Zaporizhzhia plant after a phone call from Macron to Putin As of July however access to the plant remained limited and required extensive negotiation br Russia reported that attacks with explosions from artillery shells had been recorded by August at the plant and the company town of Enerhodar Tobias Ellwood chair of the UK s Defence Select Committee said on August that any deliberate damage to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that could cause radiation leaks would be a breach of Article of the North Atlantic Treaty under which an attack on a member state of NATO is an attack on them all US congressman Adam Kinzinger said the following day that any radiation leak would kill people in NATO countries an automatic activation of Article br br Shelling hit coal ash dumps at the neighbouring coal fired power station on August and the ash was on fire on August The kV transmission line to the Dniprovska substation the only one of the four kV transmission lines still undamaged and cut by military action passes over the ash dumps At p m on August the line was cut off due to the fire disconnecting the plant and its two operating reactors from the national grid for the first time since its startup in In response backup generators and coolant pumps for reactor started up and reactor reduced generation br Incoming power was still available across the kV line to the substation at the coal fired station so the diesel generators were not essential for cooling reactor cores and spent fuel pools The kV line and reactor resumed operation at p m but the line was cut by fire again two hours later The line but not the reactors resumed operation again later that day On August one reactor restarted in the afternoon and another in the evening resuming electricity supplies to the grid On August an IAEA team led by Rafael Grossi went to the plant to investigate Lydie Evrard and Massimo Aparo were also on the team No leaks had been reported at the plant before their arrival but shelling had occurred days before br br br Russian annexations and occupation losses September November br br On September Ukrainian forces launched a surprise counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region beginning near Balakliia led by General Syrskyi An emboldened Kyiv launched a counteroffensive September around Kharkiv successful enough to make Russia admit losing key positions and for The New York Times to say that it dented the image of a Mighty Putin Kiev sought more arms from the West to sustain the counteroffensive On September Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation and Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu said reservists would be called He also said that his country would use all means to defend itself Mykhailo Podolyak an adviser to Zelenskyy said that the decision was predictable and that it was an attempt to justify Russia s failures British Foreign Office Minister Gillian Keegan called the situation an escalation while former Mongolian president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj accused Russia of using Russian Mongols as cannon fodder br br br Russian annexation of Donetsk Kherson Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts br br In late September Russian installed officials in Ukraine organised referendums on the annexation of the occupied territories of Ukraine These included the Donetsk People s Republic and the Luhansk People s

million Ukrainian civilians potentially constituting crimes against humanity The OSCE and Ukraine have accused Russia of forcibly moving civilians to filtration camps in Russian held territory and

evacuated about Mariupol residents to Russia Also on October Russia announced the forced deportation of civilians from areas around the line of contact in Kherson oblast RIA Novosti and Ukrainian officials said that thousands were dispatched to various centres in cities in Russia and Russian occupied Ukraine from which people were sent to economically depressed regions of Russia In April

fertility rates worldwide and considerable emigration It is the first time that two countries with an average age above have gone to war against each other Russia had a fighting age to year old male population more than four times higher than Ukraine s and slightly higher birth rates while the willingness to fight was more pronounced in Ukraine br Several sources have pointed out that the war is considerably worsening Ukraine s demographic crisis making significant shrinking very likely A July study by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies stated that regardless of how long the war lasts and whether or not there is further military escalation Ukraine is unlikely to recover demographically from the consequences of the war Even in it will have only about million inhabitants around fewer than before the war million and the decline in the working age population is likely to be the most severe and far reaching The study took different scenarios from a best case end of the war in without much further escalation to a worst case end of the war in with further escalation into account Flight from war affected especially the southern and eastern regions and especially educated women of child bearing age and their children With an estimate of more than of refugees not returning study author Maryna Tverdostup concluded that long term shrinking will significantly impair the conditions for reconstruction br The war in Ukraine and the associated emigration lower birth rates and war related casualties further deepened the demographic crisis of Russia Many commentators predict that the situation will be worse than during the s The UN is projecting that the decline that started in will continue and if current demographic conditions persist Russia s population would be million in fifty years a decline of about br Since February hundreds of thousands of Russians have emigrated estimates range from to over Combined with mobilisation this possibly removed roughly half a million to one million working age males from Russia s population Studies report that this will have a demographic effect especially in Russia that lasts much longer

have contaminated around acres of soil and likely made agricultural activities temporarily impossible Around of Ukraine s land is now littered with explosives and more than million hectares of forest have been damaged br According to Netherlands based peace organisation PAX Russia s deliberate targeting of industrial and energy infrastructure has caused severe pollution and the use of explosive weapons has left millions of tonnes of contaminated debris in cities and towns In early June the Kakhovka Dam under Russian occupation was damaged causing flooding and triggering warnings of an ecological disaster br The Ukrainian government international observers and journalists have described the damage as ecocide The Ukrainian government is investigating more crimes against the environment and ecocide a crime in Ukraine Zelenskyy has met with prominent European figures Heidi Hautala Margot Wallstrom Mary Robinson and Greta Thunberg to discuss the environmental damage and how to prosecute it br According to an investigation by NGL Media published in April Russia has completely destroyed over hectares of Ukrainian forests The investigation stated that long term ecological consequences may include lowering of the groundwater level reduction of biodiversity worsening of air quality fire outbreaks and rivers and ponds drying up br br br Economic impact br br br Ukraine br
