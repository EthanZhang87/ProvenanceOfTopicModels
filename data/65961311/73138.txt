id: 73138
The Arizona Coyotes were a professional ice hockey team based in the Phoenix metropolitan area which competed in the National Hockey League NHL as a member of the Central Division and the Pacific Division in the Western Conference and the West Division They played at America West Arena now Footprint Center in downtown Phoenix from to at Glendale s Gila River Arena now Desert Diamond Arena from to and at Mullett Arena in Tempe from to br The organization was established on December as the Winnipeg Jets a charter franchise of the World Hockey Association WHA After seven WHA seasons they were one of four organizations enfranchised by the NHL on June when the WHA ceased operations Due to financial troubles the Jets were sold to American owners who moved the team to Phoenix on July where they were renamed the Phoenix Coyotes The franchise name changed to the Arizona Coyotes on June Alex Meruelo became the majority owner on July later becoming the franchise s sole owner following the arrest of minority owner Andrew Barroway br The team failed to gain long term stability despite the relocation to the state of Arizona The NHL later took over the Phoenix Coyotes franchise in when then owner Jerry Moyes gave up the team after filing for bankruptcy The NHL maintained control of the franchise until when they found new ownership willing to keep it in Arizona Despite a difficult working relationship with the Phoenix suburb of Glendale the Coyotes were able to secure a year to year arrangement to play in the facility up until the end of the season Negotiations with the city then broke down and the team subsequently signed an agreement to play their games at Mullett Arena on the campus of Arizona State University starting with the season and ending the season after that br After a proposal for a new arena in Tempe was rejected by the residents of the city in May and following the conclusion of the season the Coyotes suspended hockey operations In a deal brokered by the NHL the Coyotes were essentially split in half the team s hockey assets players staff and draft picks were moved to Salt Lake City for the creation of the Utah Hockey Club owned by Ryan Smith while the Coyotes name history and other intellectual property were retained by Meruelo who intended build a new arena within the state of Arizona If the Coyotes secured a new arena by they would have been allowed to rejoin the NHL with the reactivated team inheriting its previous history records and intellectual property Conversely should the Coyotes have failed to secure a new arena within the specified time frame the NHL had the right to permanently cease operations for the franchise br On June three days after the Arizona State Land Department cancelled an auction for a acres ha parcel of land Meruelo intended to purchase as a site for a new arena it was reported that Meruelo had told staff members he had no plans to look for another arena option leaving the future of the team uncertain Less than a day later Meruelo announced his intention to leave the ownership group further muddling the team s future It is not yet clear if it will result in the dissolution of the franchise and whether its history and records will be transferred to the Utah Hockey Club or the current Winnipeg Jets br br br Franchise history br br br Original Winnipeg Jets br br The team began play as the Winnipeg Jets one of the founding franchises in the World Hockey Association WHA The Jets were the most successful team in the short lived WHA winning the Avco World Trophy the league s championship trophy three times and making the finals five out of the WHA s seven seasons It then became one of the four teams admitted to the NHL as part of a merger when the financially struggling WHA folded in br However the club was never able to translate its WHA success into the NHL after the merger The merger s terms allowed the established NHL teams to reclaim most of the players that had jumped to the upstart league and the Jets lost most of their best players in the ensuing reclamation draft As a result they finished last in the NHL during their first two seasons including a nine win season in that is still the worst in franchise history However they recovered fairly quickly making the playoffs times in the next seasons But the Jets only won two playoff series largely because they were in the same division as the powerful Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames Because of the way the playoffs were structured for much of their Winnipeg run the team was all but assured of having to defeat either the Oilers or the Flames or both to reach the Conference Finals In for instance they finished with the fourth best record in the NHL with points at the time their best as an NHL team However they were swept by the Oilers in the division finals Two seasons later they dispatched the Flames in the first round only to be swept again by the Oilers in the division finals The franchise did not win another playoff series for years br The Jets ran into financial trouble when player salaries began spiralling up in the s this hit the Canadian teams particularly hard Winnipeg was the second smallest market in the NHL for most of the Jets existence and became the smallest after the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver in to become the Colorado Avalanche In addition the club s home arena Winnipeg Arena was one of the smallest in the league seating just under people It was over years old and had no luxury suites Despite strong fan support owner Barry Shenkarow was forced to put the team on the market Several attempts to keep the team in Winnipeg fell through br br br Relocation to Phoenix br In October Minnesota businessmen Steven Gluckstern and Richard Burke purchased the team with plans to move it to Minneapolis St Paul which had just lost the Minnesota North Stars in for the season However in December after they were unable to secure a lease at Minneapolis Target Center they opted to move the Jets to Phoenix instead Minnesota was ultimately awarded an expansion team in the Minnesota Wild br After the franchise considered Mustangs Outlaws Wranglers and Freeze a name the team contest yielded the official name Coyotes At the time the name was largely seen as play on the Looney Tunes character Wile E Coyote of Wile E Coyote and the Road Runner since Phoenix was home to several minor league teams and one short lived WHA team called the Phoenix Roadrunners including an International Hockey League IHL team that was playing there in However Coyotes was considered suitable in any case since the coyote is endemic to the whole of Arizona unlike the roadrunner which is only found in the southern and western regions of the state The Roadrunners only played one more season before leaving Phoenix however the Coyotes later revived the Roadrunners nickname for their American Hockey League affiliate the Tucson Roadrunners br br br Early years in Phoenix br In the summer the move occurred the team added established superstar Jeremy Roenick from the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for trading Alexei Zhamnov Roenick teamed up with power wingers Keith Tkachuk and Rick Tocchet to form a dynamic offensive punch that led the Coyotes through their first years in Arizona Also impressive were young players like Shane Doan he eventually was the last remaining player from the team s days in Winnipeg Oleg Tverdovsky and goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin whom the fans nicknamed the Bulin Wall br br Another key addition to the squad was veteran forward Mike Gartner who had joined from the Toronto Maple Leafs Despite his experience and scoring his th career goal on December Gartner battled injuries in the latter half of the season The Coyotes did not renew his contract and he retired at the end of the season After arriving in Phoenix the team posted six consecutive or better seasons making the playoffs in every year but one The one time they did not make the playoffs in they became the first team to earn points and miss the playoffs br The Coyotes original home America West Arena was suboptimal for hockey Although considered a state of the art arena when built for the Phoenix Suns it was designed specifically as a basketball venue with sight lines optimized for the smaller playing surface of that sport and not with hockey in mind The floor was just barely large enough to fit a standard NHL rink forcing the Coyotes to hastily re engineer it to accommodate the foot rink The configuration left a portion of one end of the upper deck hanging over the boards and ice obscuring almost a third of the rink and one goal from several sections As a result listed capacity had to be cut down from over seats to just over the second smallest in the league at the time after the first season br Burke bought out Gluckstern in but was unable to attract more investors to alleviate the team s financial woes In Burke sold the team to Phoenix area developer Steve Ellman with Wayne Gretzky as a part owner and head of hockey operations br The closest that they came to advancing past the first round during their first decade in Arizona was during the playoffs After building a series lead the Coyotes fell in overtime of Game on a goal by Pierre Turgeon of the St Louis Blues In the Coyotes posted points one point behind their best total as an NHL team while in Winnipeg but went down rather meekly to the San Jose Sharks in five games br From then until the season the Coyotes were barely competitive and managed to break the point barrier only once during that time Attendance levels dropped considerably worrying many NHL executives In addition an unfavorable arena lease at city owned America West Arena had the team suffering massive financial losses as much as million a year at one point the Coyotes have yet to recover from the resulting financial problems br Ellman put forward numerous proposals to improve the hockey sightlines in America West Arena in hopes of boosting capacity back over the mark However none of these got beyond the planning stages leading Ellman to commit to building a new arena After nearly three years of proposals to build an arena on the former Los Arcos Mall in Scottsdale and having difficulty financing the purchase of the Coyotes and finishing demolition of Los Arcos along with infighting in the Scottsdale City Council Ellman looked toward the West Valley and in December the team moved into Glendale Arena which then became known as Jobing com Arena during the NHL season Simultaneously the team changed its logo and uniforms moving from the multi colored kit to a more streamlined look In Ellman sold the Coyotes the National Lacrosse League s Arizona Sting and the lease to Gila River Arena to trucking magnate Jerry Moyes who was also a part owner of Major League Baseball s Arizona Diamondbacks br br br Gretzky era br On August Brett Hull son of former Jet Bobby Hull was signed and promptly assigned the elder Hull s retired number Two days later Gretzky named himself head coach replacing Rick Bowness despite the fact he had never coached at any level of hockey The Coyotes Ring of Honor was unveiled on October inducting Gretzky who had never played for the organization but whose number was retired by all NHL teams after his retirement in and Bobby Hull Only a week later Brett Hull announced his retirement On January Jets great Thomas Steen was the third inductee to the Ring of Honor br br Another moment in a series of bad luck the Coyotes were planning to host the NHL All Star Game but the event was canceled because of the Winter Olympics The team returned to Winnipeg on September to play a preseason game against the Edmonton Oilers but were shut out before a sellout crowd of br On April CEO Jeff Shumway announced that General Manager Michael Barnett Gretzky s agent for over years senior executive vice president of hockey operations Cliff Fletcher and San Antonio Rampage s general manager and Coyotes assistant general manager Laurence Gilman have been relieved of their duties The Coyotes finished the season their worst record since relocating to Phoenix On May Jeff Shumway announced Don Maloney had agreed to a multi year contract to become general manager of the Coyotes As per club policy the terms of the contract were not disclosed However as has been the case with all general managers since Maloney served in an advisory role to Gretzky br The season was something of a resurgence for the Coyotes After their disastrous campaign the Coyotes looked to rebuild the team by relying on their drafted talent such as Peter Mueller and Martin Hanzal to make the team successful as opposed to using free agency The Coyotes also acquired Radim Vrbata from the Chicago Blackhawks for Kevyn Adams in an effort to provide the team with more offense The team signed both Alex Auld and David Aebischer to compete for the starting goaltender position with Mikael Tellqvist acting as the backup goaltender Neither Auld or Aebischer were able to hold on to the starting position leaving the Coyotes to turn to the waiver wire for assistance On November the Coyotes were able to claim Ilya Bryzgalov off waivers from the Anaheim Ducks Bryzgalov responded by not only starting in goal the day he was acquired but posting a shutout in his Coyotes debut against the Los Angeles Kings Bryzgalov was soon given a three year contract extension because of his high level of play Despite predictions of another disastrous season the Coyotes played competitive hockey for most of the season However they finished eight points short of the last playoff spot with points br br br Return to the playoffs and first division title br On September Dave Tippett took over coaching duties of the Phoenix Coyotes after Wayne Gretzky stepped down hours before In just games Tippett led the Coyotes to more wins in their regular season than their previous season en route to the first win season in the franchise s NHL history br br On March the Coyotes clinched a playoff spot their first playoff spot since the season and in the process reached the point mark for the first time ever as an NHL team and the first time overall since the WHA Jets scored points They finished with points the highest point total in the franchise s year history This was good enough for fourth overall in the NHL tying the Jets for the franchise s highest finish as an NHL team They also qualified for the fourth seed in the Western Conference giving them a home ice advantage in the first round for the first time since br Their first round opponent in the Stanley Cup playoffs was the Detroit Red Wings Game of the series was the first NHL playoff game to be played in Gila River Arena However an injury to Shane Doan sidelined him for most of the series and the veteran Red Wings defeated the Coyotes in seven games br In the following year the Coyotes played the Detroit Red Wings for the second straight postseason in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs The Coyotes were swept in four games br On April the Coyotes defeated the Minnesota Wild with a score of to win the Pacific Division title their first division title as an NHL team in Winnipeg or Phoenix This gave them the third seed in the West and with it home ice advantage in a playoff series for only the third time in franchise history In the first round they defeated the Chicago Blackhawks in six games the franchise s first playoff series win since The first five games went to overtime tying a record when the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs did it in the Stanley Cup Finals They faced the Nashville Predators in the second round winning the first two games and the series However in the Western Conference finals the Coyotes fell to the Los Angeles Kings who eventually went on to win the Cup that year in game five of a series br br br bankruptcy and attempts to sell the team br br In December the media became aware the Coyotes were suffering massive losses and that the NHL was paying the team s bills The media reports were minimized by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and vice president Bill Daly However Moyes had secretly given operational control of the team to the league In May Moyes put the team into bankruptcy hours before Bettman was to present him an offer to sell the team to Chicago Bulls and Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf Moyes intended to sell the team to Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie who in turn intended to purchase the team out of bankruptcy and move it to Hamilton Ontario The NHL responded by stripping Moyes of his remaining ownership authority br From May until September hearings were held in Phoenix bankruptcy court to determine the fate of the Coyotes and the holding company Two potential bidders for the team surfaced Reinsdorf and Ice Edge Holdings but they did not submit a bid for the team Instead the NHL put in the only rival bid to Balsillie for the team while it contended the Moyes Balsillie deal violated NHL rules The bankruptcy court voided the planned sale to Balsillie accepting the NHL s argument that bankruptcy could not be used to circumvent NHL rules The NHL s bid was also declared insufficient but the judge left the window open to an improved bid Moyes and the NHL settled with the NHL purchasing the team and assuming all debts The NHL negotiated a temporary lease with the City of Glendale which owns Gila River Arena br The NHL then negotiated with Reinsdorf and Ice Edge toward a deal with Glendale Ice Edge signed a letter of intent to purchase the team from the NHL while Reinsdorf had won the approval of the City of Glendale On May ESPN com reported the Reinsdorf bid had fallen apart and that the City of Glendale was working with Ice Edge to purchase the team in a last ditch effort to keep them in Arizona The National Post criticized both bids as they were conditional on municipal taxpayers covering any losses the Coyotes might incur and suggested that keeping the team in Phoenix was never economically viable br In July the Ice Edge bid collapsed because it did not satisfy Glendale s financial conditions Ice Edge decided to concentrate on an effort to purchase a minor league team The City of Glendale had to step in and guarantee the team s losses for as a precondition of the NHL not transferring the franchise A consortium of investors led by Chicago investor Matt Hulsizer then reached a deal to purchase the Coyotes from the NHL along with a lease agreement with Glendale However the Hulsizer deal collapsed in late June at least in part because of a threatened suit by the Goldwater Institute over the legality of payments that Glendale was to make to Hulsizer before the consortium bought the team The threat of the suit may have prevented the sale of bonds to finance the payments The team only stayed in the Phoenix area for the season after another million payment by the City of Glendale br Also in former Coyotes bidders True North Sports and Entertainment purchased the Atlanta Thrashers and moved them to Winnipeg thus ending any possibility that the Coyotes would return to Manitoba As part of the transaction the NHL agreed to transfer the Jets name logos and related trademarks from the league owned Coyotes to True North and the Thrashers thus becoming the new Winnipeg Jets However the original Jets history remains with the Coyotes organization br The NHL lockout provided another opportunity for the Coyotes to find a potential owner and avoid relocation while the NHL suspended team operations during the labor dispute A deal to former San Jose Sharks owner Greg Jamison had been drafted just as the lockout ended but failed to be finalized and fulfilled by January The deal would have kept the Coyotes in Phoenix for the next years relying on a taxpayer subsidy according to the agreement It would also have had Phoenix dropped from the name and instead used Arizona br California investment executive Darin Pastor also submitted a bid to purchase the Coyotes His bid proposed to keep the team in the Glendale area while engaging young hockey players in the region through school partnerships and scholarship efforts The NHL rejected Pastor s bid on May citing the bid was inconsistent with what we had previously indicated were the minimum prerequisites of a bid br br br New ownership and the Arizona Coyotes br br Because the team had been in bankruptcy since and lost revenue each year the NHL planned to move the Coyotes should a deal with the city for a new lease and new ownership not be decided by July The plan was to move the franchise to a new city likely Seattle On July by a vote of the Glendale City Council approved a year lease agreement with Renaissance Sports and Entertainment RSE which purchased the team from the NHL for US million by August The members of the Canadian group were Executive Chairman Governor George Gosbee President CEO Alternate Governor Anthony LeBlanc Alternate Governor Craig Stewart and Directors Gary J Drummond W David Duckett William Bill Dutton Robert Gwin Scott Saxberg and Richard Walter RSE partnered with Global Spectrum owners of the Philadelphia Flyers for help in managing Gila River Arena The agreement had the City of Glendale giving RSE US million per year for management fees There was a clause stipulating RSE could relocate the team after five years if it accrued US million in losses br On January the new ownership group announced that the team would change its name to the Arizona Coyotes for the season According to Coyotes club president Anthony LeBlanc the change was made to reflect the fact the team is no longer located within Phoenix city limits and to include all hockey fans in the state of Arizona Aside from a new shoulder patch the team s uniform design did not change br Following the conclusion of the season it was reported that lackluster revenue from parking and non hockey events enabled the City of Glendale to recoup just million which was significantly less than the million the city expected to receive back from sources including parking receipts ticket sales and naming rights for the arena br On June it was reported that a Scottsdale Arizona public relations firm had sued IceArizona the owner of the Phoenix Coyotes alleging the NHL club had reneged on a sponsorship deal worth nearly A Coyotes spokesman responded to this issue by calling it a quarter million dollar scheme By October IceArizona entered a deal to sell a controlling interest in the Coyotes to Philadelphia based hedge fund manager Andrew Barroway who had recently failed in his attempt to purchase the New York Islanders The deal was approved by the NHL Board of Governors on December br During the season the team finished last in the Pacific Division with the second worst record in the NHL On June Glendale City Council voted to terminate its year million agreement with the Coyotes The city claimed It was entitled to terminate the agreement because two former city employees Craig Tindall and Julie Frisoni were involved in securing the deal and later worked for the Coyotes On July it was announced the Coyotes and City Council had agreed on a resolution On July the Coyotes announced the City Council had reached a two year deal br At the conclusion of the season Coyotes general manager Don Maloney was terminated from his position after eight seasons and one General Manager of the Year award The Coyotes replaced Maloney with John Chayka who at years of age became the youngest NHL GM of all time being promoted from his position as assistant general manager analytics within the Coyotes staff In August Dawn Braid was hired as the Coyotes skating coach making her the first female full time coach in the NHL br On November the Coyotes announced plans to build a new arena in Tempe Arizona which was scheduled to be completed for the NHL season The project would have included an adjoining seat arena to be used for Coyotes practices and as the home for the Arizona State University hockey team However the arena project was withdrawn when ASU pulled out of the deal in February br At the end of the season Barroway bought out the rest of the IceArizona ownership group and became the sole owner of the franchise Following the transfer former IceArizona CEO Anthony LeBlanc and the director of hockey operations Gary Drummond both left the organization On June the Coyotes opted not to re sign long time captain Shane Doan who had been with the franchise since they were the Winnipeg Jets The Coyotes left Doan a standing offer to remain with the team in a non playing role On June head coach Dave Tippett left his positions within the Coyotes after eight seasons and was succeeded by Rick Tocchet on July br On December it was announced that the team would move to the Central Division in changing divisions for the second time since relocating to Arizona as part of a league realignment following the addition of the Seattle Kraken The team previously played in the Central Division for their first two seasons following their relocation from Winnipeg in br On July Barroway sold controlling interest in the Coyotes to billionaire Alex Meruelo with Barroway remaining as a minority owner br During the NHL Entry Draft the Coyotes received widespread backlash and criticism for drafting Mitchell Miller in the fourth round th pick overall after allegations surfaced that he had bullied and discriminated against an African American classmate having a learning disability during high school in Soon thereafter they renounced his draft rights br For the COVID pandemic shortened season the Coyotes were placed in the reformed West Division and played a division only game schedule They finished in fifth place with points outside of the playoffs After the season the team and coach Rick Tocchet mutually agreed to part ways Andre Tourigny was hired as head coach of the Coyotes on July br For the season the Coyotes moved into the Central Division upon the arrival of the Kraken in the Pacific Division In the NHL Draft the Coyotes would select Josh Doan son of former Coyotes player Shane Doan Josh would later play with the Coyotes in On August the city of Glendale and the Gila River Arena chose to not renew their operating agreement with the Coyotes beyond the season The franchise entered negotiations with Tempe to develop a new arena on an old solid waste compost yard but the terrain had problems regarding environmental remediation On September they submitted a proposal to build a new arena in Tempe br br On December the Coyotes were informed that they would be locked out of Gila River Arena on December if they did not pay million owed in taxes including to the City of Glendale The team paid the bills the next day citing unfortunate human error as the cause of the issue In late January the Coyotes were in talks with Arizona State University ASU to use their new seat arena as a temporary home arena for the next few years On February the Coyotes signed a three year agreement to play their games at Mullett Arena starting with the season On April the Coyotes played their final home game at the Gila River Arena against the Nashville Predators with a comeback win On October the Coyotes would make their debut in the Mullett Arena which sold out to a crowd of people that day in a overtime loss to the current Winnipeg Jets franchise with Christian Fischer scoring the first two goals of the franchise at the arena for that game br br br Asset relocation to Utah and suspension of operations br br A proposal by the Coyotes to build a new arena in Tempe was rejected by residents of the city on May The arena was estimated to cost billion with billion of the cost privately funded Despite speculation on immediate relocation the team remained in Arizona playing at Mullett Arena during the NHL season The Coyotes spoke with the city of Mesa about a potential arena at the Fiesta Mall site but that plan was ultimately rejected for unknown reasons In January Scottsdale mayor David Ortega announced his opposition to a Coyotes proposal which planned an arena in northern Phoenix near the border of Scottsdale Following this the Coyotes initially stated on social media their commitment to keeping the team in Arizona They announced that the ownership was intent on winning a land auction for acres ha of state owned land between Scottsdale Road and Loop in Phoenix to build an arena However the auction had been delayed from January to June which likely played a part into the ownership s final decision with the franchise near the end of the season br On April it was reported that with the NHL s permission the Coyotes were making efforts to relocate to Salt Lake City Utah following concerns about an indefinite timeframe on finding a new arena and the effects of continued play at Mullett Arena in the interim This led to the NHL buying the franchise then reselling it to Ryan Smith owner of the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association NBA for a reported billion Of that payment billion went to Coyotes owner Alex Meruelo for the sale with Meruelo agreeing to refund the money to the NHL as an expansion fee should his efforts to locate a new home for the franchise succeed and million went to the NHL s other owners as the equivalent of a relocation fee The Utah team will play its home games at the Jazz s home arena the Delta Center Renovations will be required to make it the team s permanent home similar to the renovations made to the Climate Pledge Arena before the Kraken began play in the NHL two seasons prior br On April ahead of a overtime win against the Edmonton Oilers at Rogers Place general manager Bill Armstrong officially disclosed the news of the team s impending sale and relocation to Coyotes players and staff Five days later on April the Coyotes played their final game at Mullett Arena and ultimately their last game before deactivation against the same Oilers team With the fans engaging in one last Whiteout and audibly heard chanting phrases such as Salt Lake sucks and we love you Coyotes throughout the game the moribund Coyotes won with Sean Durzi scoring the final goal of the team s first incarnation into an empty net Amongst the events of the game Shane Doan was given his retirement banner which had been lost by the team in the move to Mullett Arena but had been rediscovered by a local fan and following the end of the game the fans gave the outgoing team a standing ovation and the players in turn spent over an hour afterwards on the ice giving away team apparel and equipment also signing a majority of the fan gifts as well as taking a final team picture on the ice and taking turns hugging and thanking longtime equipment manager Stan Wilson who had moved with the team from Winnipeg in The following day the sale and relocation was officially approved and the team was officially deactivated until further notice br Rather than formally relocating the Coyotes franchise was initially declared dormant with the Utah club being considered an expansion team similar to the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League NFL with the Coyotes continuing minor business operations mostly focused on finding a new arena Meruelo remained on the NHL Board of Governors as an observer retaining the rights to the Coyotes brand and history including the history and records of the Winnipeg Jets with a five year window to build or otherwise locate a new arena for his team before reactivating the Coyotes through an expansion draft Conversely if Meruelo were to fail to come up with a suitable arena by end of that five year window he would have been required to cede the franchise back to the NHL If that occured the franchise would cease operations permanently at that time The sale was finalized on April after the NHL Board of Governors voted to establish a new team in Utah effectively expanding the NHL to a total of or clubs depending on potential further expansion plans should the Coyotes have succeeded in building a new team arena br On June the Arizona State Land Department canceled a land auction for a acre parcel of land in north Phoenix which Meruelo intended to purchase as a site for a new arena Three days later on June it was reported that Meruelo had told staff he had no plans to pursue further arena options for the team and on the Board of Governors meeting on June Meruelo announced to Gary Bettman that he was not pursuing the franchise reactivation with the Coyotes effectively folding as a result br br br Team information br br br Name br Upon the franchise s relocation to Phoenix a public team naming vote was held with Coyotes defeating Scorpions among the finalists Both coyotes and scorpions are inhabitants of the Sonoran Desert and the owners supporters of the club wanted the team name to be an animal that was representative of the region On June the team changed its geographic name to Arizona br br br Logos and jerseys br br Upon their arrival in Phoenix in the team adopted a look with a traditional Southwestern design The primary logo was a Southwest Native American styled hockey stick wielding coyote in a kachina inspired style The jerseys featured pointed green shoulders with brick red trim over a white home or black road body and non traditional striping patterns These uniforms remained in place until A third jersey primarily green with a nighttime desert landscape wrapped around the bottom and the cuffs of the sleeves was introduced in and retired in when the team redesigned the uniforms br As the NHL switched home and road jerseys beginning in the season and coinciding with the team s move from America West Arena to the newly completed Glendale Arena the Coyotes redesigned their look completely adopting a howling coyote head logo while dropping several colors from the team s palette Sedona red and white became the primary colors with desert sand and black remaining as logo trim colors A variation of these colors was later used for the Major League Baseball team Arizona Diamondbacks The uniform s simplified two color scheme with three stripes on each sleeve and the tail bears some resemblance to later versions of the Montreal Maroons jerseys The team also changed its shoulder patch taking the form of the outline of the state of Arizona with an homage to the state flag and the abbreviation PHX This logo was worn only on the right shoulder leaving the left shoulder bare br br The Coyotes updated their jerseys for the season along with all NHL teams as part of the switchover to Rbk Edge jerseys The changes made were adding an NHL crest just below the neck opening removing the stripes that were previously just above the lower hem and moving the PHX patch from the right to the left shoulder The white jersey also gained red shoulder coloring and laces at the collar The three stripe pattern is applied to the side of the pants br The Coyotes also added a third jersey for the season It is primarily black and features a new alternate coyote logo on the front with the primary logo coyote head patch on the right shoulder and the Official Seal on the left Since white does not appear on the alternate solid red pant shells are worn with this jersey br Before the season it was announced the Coyotes third jersey would no longer be used The patch on the home and away jerseys that used to read PHX would also be changed to read AZ to match the team s rebranded name br On June the Coyotes introduced updated jerseys The uniforms reintegrated black into the design the color was prominently featured on the uniform sleeves socks and pants br The Coyotes wore their black Kachina jerseys for a few dates between and seasons The style was similar to the originals but was adapted to the Reebok Edge cut For the season and beyond the Coyotes revived the Kachina uniforms as a third jersey and was updated to the Adidas adizero cut In the black Kachina design became the primary home jerseys for only the red trim on the letters were changed to silver to commemorate the team s th season in Arizona but kept the previous red howling coyote jerseys as an alternate The road howling coyote jerseys were also retained In addition the Coyotes wore a second alternate uniform a purple Reverse Retro version of the Kachina head alternates br Before the season the Coyotes hinted at a possible rebrand in September after the team named MullenLowe LA as its branding partner During the off season the Coyotes quietly brought back the Kachina logo as the primary and later revealed a white road version of the Kachina uniforms while keeping the previous howling coyote home uniform as an alternate br In the season Arizona once again wore its Kachina head alternates as its Reverse Retro uniform but with sienna as the base color Also during that season a new alternate uniform was released returning to the simplified brick red and sand color scheme from to but with kachina patterns at the bottom and on the sleeves The uniform features Arizona in sand with a star above the i and a sand saguaro on the right side of the pants The captain s patch is denoted by the crescent
