CBC Radio One The CBC s French language Radio Canada network also produces sports programming br Once the country s dominant sports broadcaster in recent years it has lost many of its past signature properties such as the Canadian Football League Toronto Blue Jays baseball Canadian Curling Association championships the Olympic Games for a period the FIFA World Cup and the National Hockey League to the cable specialty channels TSN and Sportsnet The CBC has maintained partial rights to the NHL as part of a sub licensing agreement with current rightsholder Rogers Media maintaining the Saturday night Hockey Night in Canada and playoff coverage although this coverage is produced by Sportsnet as opposed to the CBC itself as was the case in the past br As a result of funding reductions from the federal government increased costs for licensing and decreased revenues in April the CBC announced it would no longer bid for professional sports broadcasting rights The CBC has since used its digital platforms to provide overflow coverage of events not on television and simulcasts of television coverage Since then the CBC s in house sports coverage has been largely focused on Olympic sports other domestic amateur and semi professional competitions such as the Canadian Hockey League CHL along with coverage of Spruce Meadows show jumping competitions br The majority of CBC Television s sports
