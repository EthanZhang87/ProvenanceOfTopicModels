up in and Additionally the Lightning tied the then all time record for regular season wins in the season later broken by the Boston Bruins and won straight playoff series from to The team s sustained success during this period has led some to regard the Lightning as a modern NHL dynasty The franchise is owned by Jeffrey Vinik and the general manager is Julien BriseBois Jon Cooper has served as head coach since March and is the longest tenured active head coach in the NHL br br br Franchise history br br br Early years br br br Bringing hockey to Tampa br In the late s the NHL announced it would expand Two rival groups from the Tampa Bay Area decided to bid for a franchise a St Petersburg based group fronted by future Hartford Whalers Carolina Hurricanes owners Peter Karmanos and Jim Rutherford and a Tampa based group fronted by Phil Esposito and his brother Tony both members of the Hockey Hall of Fame One of the Esposito group s key backers the Pritzker family backed out a few months before the bid to be replaced by a consortium of Japanese businesses headed by Kokusai Green a golf course and resort operator Although it appeared on paper that the Karmanos Rutherford group had more financial resources it only wanted to pay million of the million expansion fee before starting operations In contrast the Esposito Kokusai Green group was one of the few groups willing to pay the full million fee up front The Esposito group would win the expansion franchise on December and name the team the Lightning after Tampa Bay s status as the Lightning Capital of North America br br Phil Esposito assigned himself president and general manager while Tony became chief scout Terry Crisp who played for the Philadelphia Flyers when they won two Stanley Cups in the mid s and coached the Calgary Flames to a Stanley Cup in was tapped as the first head coach Phil Esposito also hired former teammates from the Boston Bruins of the s including former linemate Wayne Cashman as an assistant coach and former Bruin trainer John Frosty Forristal as the team s trainer The inaugural team photo has him flanked by Cashman and player Ken Hodge Jr son of his other Bruins linemate br In Angus Montagu th Duke of Manchester announced that a company of which he was a director would raise millions of dollars in investments in the Lightning but his plans were unsuccessful and he was later convicted of wire fraud br The Lightning played their first preseason game in September against the Minnesota North Stars and then turned heads later that preseason when Manon Rh aume became the first woman to play in an NHL game which also made her the first woman to play in any of the major professional North American sports leagues She played for the Lightning against the St Louis Blues and stopped seven of nine shots br The Lightning played their first regular season game on October in Tampa s tiny seat Expo Hall at the Florida State Fairgrounds They surprised the visiting Chicago Blackhawks winning with four goals by little known Chris Kontos The team rose to the top of the Campbell Conference s Norris Division within a month behind Kontos initial torrid scoring pace and a breakout season by forward Brian Bradley However it buckled under the strain of some of the longest road trips in the NHL their nearest division rival the Blues were over miles km away and finished in last place with a record of for points This was at the time one of the best ever showings by an NHL expansion team Bradley s goals gave Tampa Bay fans optimism for the next season it would be a team record until the season br The following season saw the Lightning shift to the Eastern Conference s Atlantic Division as well as move into the Florida Suncoast Dome a building originally designed for baseball in St Petersburg which was reconfigured for hockey and renamed the ThunderDome The team acquired goaltender Daren Puppa left wing goal scorer Petr Klima and veteran forward Denis Savard While Puppa s play resulted in a significant improvement in goals allowed from to Savard was long past his prime and Klima s scoring was offset by his defensive lapses The Lightning finished last in the Atlantic Division in with a record of for points Another disappointing season followed in the lockout shortened season with a record of for points br br br On ice and off ice struggles br In their fourth season backed by Bradley s team leading points second year forward Alexander Selivanov s goals and Roman Hamrlik s All Star year on defense the Lightning finally qualified for the playoffs posting a record for points ahead of the defending Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils for the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference by a single win Due to his stellar play in net Puppa was named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy losing out to Jim Carey of the Washington Capitals Playing the Philadelphia Flyers a team seen as a Stanley Cup contender in the first round the Lightning split the opening two games in Philadelphia before taking Game in overtime before a ThunderDome crowd of This was the largest crowd for an NHL game a record that stood until the Heritage Classic in Edmonton and it still stands today as the largest crowd at a Stanley Cup playoffs game An injury to Puppa in that game however would see the Lightning lose the next three games and the series br br The Lightning moved into a new arena in downtown Tampa the Ice Palace later the St Pete Times Forum Tampa Bay Times Forum and now Amalie Arena for the season They had acquired goal scorer Dino Ciccarelli from the Detroit Red Wings during the off season and he did not disappoint scoring goals while Chris Gratton notched another goals The team appeared destined for another playoff appearance but suffered a devastating rash of injuries Puppa developed back trouble that kept him out of all but six games during the season he would only play a total of games from until his retirement in Bradley also lost time to a series of concussions that would limit him to a total of games from until his retirement in December Center John Cullen developed non Hodgkin lymphoma and missed the last games of the season he would eventually be forced to retire in Decimated by these ailments the Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs They would not tally as much as points again for five years br Most of the Lightning s early stars were gone by the season due to free agency and a series of ill advised trades Crisp was fired games into the season and replaced by Jacques Demers Though Demers had presided over the resurgence of the Detroit Red Wings in the s and helmed a Stanley Cup run with the Montreal Canadiens in he was unable to change the team s fortunes and the Lightning ended up losing games That team s winning percentage is still the worst in franchise history br By most accounts the Lightning s plunge to the bottom of the NHL was due to inattentive ownership by Kokusai Green Rumors abounded as early as the team s second season that the Lightning were on the brink of bankruptcy and that the team was part of a money laundering scheme for the yakuza Japanese crime families Its scouting operation consisted of Tony Esposito and several satellite dishes The Internal Revenue Service investigated the team in and and nearly threatened to put a tax lien on the franchise for in back taxes The situation led longtime NHL broadcaster and writer Stan Fischler to call the Lightning a skating vaudeville show br Even in their first playoff season the team was awash in red ink and Kokusai Green was looking to sell the team however its asking price of million for the team and the lease with the Ice Palace deterred buyers A possible sale was further hampered by the team s murky ownership structure many team officials including Crisp did not know who really owned the team Kokusai Green s owner Takashi Okubo had never met with the Espositos or with NHL officials in person prior to being awarded the Lightning franchise and never watched his team play during his seven years as owner br Nearly all of Kokusai Green s investment in the team and the Ice Palace came in the form of loans leaving the team constantly short of cash At least one prospective buyer pulled out after expressing doubts that Okubo even existed In fact the first time anyone connected with the Lightning or the NHL even saw Okubo was in the spring of Esposito was forced into several trades just to keep the team above water The team s financial situation was a considerable concern to NHL officials rumors surfaced that the NHL was seriously considering taking control of the team if Okubo failed to find a buyer by the summer of br Forbes wrote an article in late calling the Lightning a financial nightmare with a debt equal to of its value the highest of any major North American sports franchise Even though the Ice Palace was built for hockey and the Lightning were the only major tenant Forbes called the team s deal with the arena a lemon since it would not result in much revenue for years It was also behind on paying state sales taxes and federal payroll taxes br Finally in Kokusai Green found a buyer Although William Davidson longtime owner of the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association NBA was thought to be the frontrunner the buyer turned out to be insurance tycoon and motivational speaker Art Williams who previously owned the Birmingham Barracudas of the Canadian Football League CFL The team was million in debt at the time the sale closed Williams knew very little about hockey but was very visible and outspoken and immediately pumped an additional million into the team s payroll He also cleared most of the debt from the Kokusai Green era After taking control Williams publicly assured the Espositos that their jobs were safe only to fire them two games into the season He then gave Demers complete control of hockey operations as both coach and general manager The Lightning drafted Vincent Lecavalier first overall in a player who would be a cornerstone of the team for years to come br Williams was widely seen as being in over his head Early in the season the Lightning lost ten games in a row all but ending any chance of making the playoffs They ended up losing games that year more than the expansion Nashville Predators br br br Return to respectability br By the spring of Williams had seen enough He had not attended a game in some time because this team broke my heart He lost million in the season alone as much money in one year as he had estimated he could have reasonably lost in five years Williams sold the team for million million less than he had paid for the team a year earlier to Detroit Pistons owner William Davidson who had almost bought the team a year earlier Along with the sale the Lightning acquired a new top minor league affiliate Davidson also owned the Detroit Vipers of the now defunct International Hockey League br Davidson remained in Detroit but appointed Tom Wilson as team president to handle day to day management of the team Wilson immediately fired Demers who despite his best efforts and fatherly attitude toward Lecavalier was unable to overcome the damage from the Kokusai Green ownership Wilson persuaded Ottawa Senators general manager and former Vipers GM Rick Dudley to take over as the Lightning s new general manager Dudley in turn brought Vipers coach Steve Ludzik in as the team s new head coach Wilson Dudley and Ludzik had helped make the Vipers one of the premier minor league hockey franchises having won a Turner Cup in only their third season in Detroit the team had originally been based in Salt Lake City br However as had been the case with Demers the damage from the last few seasons under Kokusai Green was too much for Ludzik to overcome Even with a wholesale transfer of talent from Detroit to Tampa a move that eventually doomed the Vipers which folded along with the IHL in the Lightning lost games in and in becoming the first team in NHL history to post four straight loss seasons The lone bright spots in those years were the blossoming of Lecavalier and Brad Richards into NHL stars Ludzik was replaced in early by career NHL assistant John Tortorella The March trade deadline offered another glimmer of hope when the team acquired hold out goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin from the Phoenix Coyotes for three players and a draft pick br The season Tortorella s first full year behind the bench saw some improvement Martin St Louis was having a breakout season when he broke his leg in game number and was lost for the remainder of the season Khabibulin recorded a shut out at the NHL All Star Game but was not named its MVP by all accounts due to the game s voting protocol By mid February the Lightning were well out of playoff contention and were sinking under a rash of injuries Dudley who had guaranteed a playoff berth before the season was fired and replaced by his assistant Jay Feaster Still the Lightning showed some signs of life earning more than points for the first time since Tortorella stripped Lecavalier of the captaincy due to contract negotiations that had made the young center miss the start of the season br br br Two dream seasons and first Stanley Cup championship br With a young core of players led by Vincent Lecavalier Brad Richards Martin St Louis and Fredrik Modin the Lightning were thought to be very close to respectability However they arrived somewhat earlier than expected in The young team was led by the goaltending of Nikolai Khabibulin and the scoring efforts of Lecavalier St Louis Modin Richards and Ruslan Fedotenko Throughout the season the Lightning battled the Washington Capitals for first place in the Southeast Division They finished with a record of for points breaking the point barrier for the first time in team history They won the division by just one point giving them home ice advantage in their first round match up with the Capitals At season s end coach Tortorella was recognized for his efforts by being named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award losing out to Jacques Lemaire of the Minnesota Wild br In the first round of the playoffs the Lightning quickly fell two games behind in the series but followed the two losses with four consecutive wins for their first playoff series win in franchise history However in the semifinals they went down in five games to the New Jersey Devils who went on to win the Stanley Cup br The Lightning s dramatic improvement continued through the regular season finishing with a record of for points second best in the NHL after the Western Conference s Detroit Red Wings the first point season in franchise history The Lightning lost only man games to injury In the first round of the playoffs the Lightning ousted the New York Islanders in five games with Khabibulin posting shutouts in games and br In the second round the Lightning faced the Montreal Canadiens Lecavalier Richards and Khabibulin led the team to a four game sweep of Montreal Next they faced the Philadelphia Flyers in the Conference Finals After a tightly fought seven game series in which neither team was able to win consecutive games Fredrik Modin notched the winning goal of the seventh and deciding game earning the Eastern Conference championship for the Lightning and their first ever berth in the Stanley Cup Finals br Their opponent in the final round was the Calgary Flames The final round also went the full seven games with the deciding game played in the St Pete Times Forum on June This time Ruslan Fedotenko was the Game hero scoring both Lightning goals in a victory Brad Richards who had points in the postseason won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs the Lightning had won all contests in which he had scored a goal since the opening of the season Tortorella won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL s Coach of the Year Only three years after their last of four consecutive seasons of or more losses and in only their th year of existence the Lightning became the southernmost team ever to win the Stanley Cup an accomplishment since surpassed by the Florida Panthers Martin St Louis led the team and the NHL with points his goals were fourth most after the of tied trio Jarome Iginla Rick Nash and Ilya Kovalchuk

record of for points in a conference where six teams notched or more points They lost to the Ottawa Senators in five games in the first round of the playoffs br br During the off season the Lightning traded Fredrik Modin and Fredrik Norrena to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for goaltender Marc Denis in an effort to replace the departing John Grahame who had signed with the Carolina Hurricanes However free agent Johan Holmqvist would eventually receive the majority of playing time and most of the club s wins The first half of was inconsistent for the Lightning maintaining an record throughout the first few months January and February were far better months for the team going in January and in February driving them back into the playoff race Fourteen games in March were split even and on March Vincent Lecavalier broke the franchise record for most points in a season with finishing with The record was previously held by Martin St Louis who had set the record in the

champions for the third time in team history on April in the final week of the regular season the Lightning suffered a loss to the Florida Panthers the night before the season finale in Atlanta That same night the Thrashers defeated the Carolina Hurricanes and subsequently clinched the division For the Lightning this meant having to settle for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference with a final record of points However the Lightning were eliminated from playoff competition on April after a home loss to the New Jersey Devils in Game of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals br br

top overall pick in the NHL Entry Draft through the draft lottery which they eventually won on April They would use their first overall pick to select Steven Stamkos of the Ontario Hockey League s Sarnia Sting who like Lecavalier before was expected to become a franchise cornerstone player for years to come br The Lightning were the worst team on the road in the NHL winning only games Another showing of the team s poor play was the difference from the previous season s success in the overtime shootout periods In the season the Lightning had one of the best extra period records winning games in either overtime or the shootout However in the season they won only three games losing nine br Vincent Lecavalier suffered a dislocated shoulder as the result of an open ice hit from Matt Cooke of the Washington Capitals in the game before the season finale in Atlanta Lecavalier who planned on having arthroscopic wrist surgery after the season s ending would undergo surgery to repair his right shoulder as well Cooke was fined by the NHL for the hit as Lecavalier did not have possession of the puck at the time Perhaps the lone bright spot in the season was Lecavalier s winning both
