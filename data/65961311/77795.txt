the concept of ESPN in May after he was fired from his job with the World Hockey Association s New England Whalers Rasmussen and his ESPN co founder Ed Eagan joined by Rasmussen s son Scott who had also been let go by the Whalers first rented office space in Plainville Connecticut However the plan to base ESPN there was put on hold because of a local ordinance prohibiting buildings from bearing rooftop satellite dishes Available land to build their own facility on was quickly found in Bristol Connecticut where the channel remains headquartered to this day with funding to buy the property provided by Getty Oil which purchased of the company from Bill Rasmussen on February in an attempt to diversify the company s holdings This helped the credibility of the fledgling company however there were still many doubters about the viability of their sports channel concept Another event that helped build ESPN s credibility was securing an advertising agreement with Anheuser Busch in the spring of the company invested million to be the exclusive beer advertised on the network br br ESPN launched on September beginning with the first telecast of what would become the channel s flagship program SportsCenter Taped in front of a small live audience inside the Bristol studios it was broadcast to million cable subscribers throughout the United States br ESPN s next big step forward came when the channel acquired the rights to broadcast coverage of the early rounds of the NCAA Division I men s basketball tournament It first aired its games in March helping bring attention to what is

stone for ESPN came throughout a couple of months in During this period the American Broadcasting Company ABC purchased of ESPN from the Rasmussens and Getty Oil Under Getty ownership the channel was unable to compete for the television rights to major sports events contracts as its majority corporate parent would not provide the funding leading ESPN to lose out for broadcast deals with the National Hockey League to USA Network and NCAA Division I college football to TBS For years the NFL NBA and Major League Baseball refused to consider cable as a means of broadcasting some of their
