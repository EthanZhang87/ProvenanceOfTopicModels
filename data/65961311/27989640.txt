that Bleacher Report s policy resulted in a glut of low quality content which made it difficult for the network s readers to find credible coverage of their favorite teams and sports It was also argued that the model tarnished the reputation of every writer associated with the Bleacher Report brand which made it difficult for the network s more talented contributors to build loyal audiences and that it empowered unqualified writers without editorial oversight which compromised the prestige and credibility of the sports writing profession SB Nation Senior MMA editor Luke Thomas described it as the Walmart of Journalism and its MMA coverage toothless amateur coverage br Since abandoning the content farm model in Bleacher Report has been the subject of continued criticism for its exploitation of unpaid contributors its blanket policy prohibiting writers from breaking their own news and its high volume production of low quality search optimized slideshow content These critiques

manufactured garbage In December a lampoon article in The Onion played on the same themes In July Deadspin published a lengthy narrative written by Tom Schreier a former Bleacher Report featured

media training program br Establishing a paid team of Lead Writers to headline the network s sport specific writer communities br Although some detractors likened such changes to spritzing a little room deodorizer after leaving a steaming deposit in the toilet and failing to flush apart from a published rebuttal disputing the objectivity and accuracy of the October SF Weekly article Bleacher
