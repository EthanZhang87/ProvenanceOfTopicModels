Sweden formally the Kingdom of Sweden is a Nordic country located on the Scandinavian Peninsula in Northern Europe br At square kilometres sq mi Sweden is the largest Nordic country and the fifth largest country in Europe The capital and largest city is Stockholm Sweden has a population of million and a low population density of inhabitants per square kilometre sq mi with around of Swedes residing in urban areas which cover of the entire land area in the central and southern half of the country It borders Norway to the west and north and Finland to the east With the country ranging from N to N the climate of Sweden is diverse due to the length of the country br Sweden has been inhabited since prehistoric times c BC The inhabitants emerged into history as the Geats Swedish G tar and Swedes Svear and constituted the sea peoples known as the Norsemen A unified Swedish state emerged during the late th century In Sweden joined Norway and Denmark to form the Scandinavian Kalmar Union which Sweden left in When Sweden became involved in the Thirty Years War on the Protestant side an expansion of its territories began forming the Swedish Empire which remained one of the great powers of Europe until the early th century During this era Sweden controlled much of the Baltic Sea Most of the conquered territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were lost during the th and th centuries The eastern half of Sweden present day Finland was lost to Imperial Russia in The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in when Sweden by military means forced Norway into a personal union a union which lasted until br Sweden is a highly developed country ranked fifth in the Human Development Index It is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy with legislative power vested in the member unicameral Riksdag It is a unitary state divided into counties and municipalities Sweden maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens It has the world s th highest GDP per capita and ranks very highly in quality of life health education protection of civil liberties economic competitiveness income equality gender equality and prosperity Sweden joined the European Union on January It is also a member of the United Nations NATO the Nordic Council the Schengen Area the Council of Europe the World Trade Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD br br br Etymology br br The name for Sweden is generally agreed to derive from the Proto Indo European root s w e meaning one s own referring to one s own tribe from the tribal period The native Swedish name Sverige a compound of the words Svea and rike first recorded in the cognate Sw orice in Beowulf translates as realm of the Swedes which excluded the Geats in G taland br The contemporary English variation was derived in the th century from Middle Dutch and Middle Low German As early as references are found in Middle Dutch referring to a lande van sweden land of the Swedes with swede as the singular form In Old English the country was known as Sw oland or Sw or ce and in Early Modern English as Swedeland Some Finnic languages such as Finnish and Estonian use the terms Ruotsi and Rootsi these variations refer to the Rus people who inhabited the coastal areas of Roslagen in Uppland and who gave their name to Russia br br br History br br br Prehistory br br Sweden s prehistory begins in the Aller d oscillation a warm period around BC with Late Palaeolithic reindeer hunting camps of the Bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the country s southernmost province Scania This period was characterised by small clans of hunter gatherers who relied on flint technology br Sweden and its people were first described by Publius Cornelius Tacitus in his Germania AD In Germania and he mentions the Swedes Suiones as a powerful tribe with ships that had a prow at each end longships Which kings kuningaz ruled these Suiones is unknown but Norse mythology presents a long line of legendary and semi legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC The runic script was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the second century AD but all that has survived from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke Proto Norse at the time a language ancestral to Swedish and other North Germanic languages br In the sixth century Jordanes names two tribes living in Scandza both of which are now considered to be synonymous with the Swedes the Suetidi and Suehans The Suehans were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and according to Jordanes had very fine horses similar to those of the Thyringi of Germania alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis br br br Vikings br br The Swedish Viking Age lasted roughly from the eighth century to the th century It is believed that Swedish Vikings and Gutar mainly travelled east and south going to Finland Estonia the Baltic countries Russia Belarus Ukraine the Black Sea and even as far as Baghdad Their routes passed through the Dnieper south to Constantinople on which they carried out numerous raids The Byzantine Emperor Theophilos noticed their great skills in war and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard known as the Varangian Guard The Swedish Vikings called Rus are believed to be the founders of Kievan Rus The Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan described these Vikings saying br br I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the Itil I have never seen more perfect physical specimens tall as date palms blond and ruddy they wear neither tunics nor caftans but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free Each man has an axe a sword and a knife and keeps each by him at all times The swords are broad and grooved of Frankish sort br br The actions of these Swedish Vikings are commemorated on many runestones in Sweden such as the Greece runestones and the Varangian runestones There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards which are commemorated on stones such as the England runestones The last major Swedish Viking expedition appears to have been the ill fated expedition of Ingvar the Far Travelled to Serkland the region south east of the Caspian Sea Its members are commemorated on the Ingvar runestones none of which mentions any survivor br During the early stages of the Viking Age a centre of trade in northern Europe developed at Birka on the island of Bj rk not far from where Stockholm was later constructed in mid latitude Sweden Birka was founded around AD as a trading port by a king or merchants trying to control trade Birka was the Baltic link in the Dnieper Trade Route through Ladoga Aldeigja and Novgorod Holmsgard to the Byzantine Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate It was abandoned c AD around the same time Sigtuna was founded as a Christian town some km to the northeast It has been estimated that the population in Viking Age Birka was between and people Archaeological finds indicate that Birka still was wealthy in the th and th centuries Thousands of graves coins jewelry and other luxury items have been found there br br br Kingdom of Sweden br The actual age of the kingdom of Sweden is unknown Establishing the age depends mostly on whether Sweden should be considered a nation when the Svear Sweonas ruled Svealand or if the emergence of the nation started with the Svear and the G tar Geats of G taland being united under one ruler In the first case Svealand was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year by Tacitus but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way The epic poem Beowulf describes semi legendary Swedish Geatish wars in the sixth century br However historians usually start the line of Swedish monarchs from when Svealand and G taland were ruled under the same king namely Eric the Victorious and his son Olof Sk tkonung in the tenth century These events are often described as the consolidation of Sweden although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later G taland in this sense mainly includes the provinces of sterg tland East Gothia and V sterg tland West Gothia The island of Gotland was disputed by other people than Swedes at this time Danish Hanseatic and Gotland domestic Sm land was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests and only the city of Kalmar with its castle was of importance There were Swedish settlements along the southern coastline of Norrland one of the four lands of Sweden br br Saint Ansgar is usually credited with introducing Christianity to Sweden in but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the th century In the th century Sweden was undergoing dynastic struggles between the Erik and Sverker clans The divide ended when a third clan married into the Erik clan and founded the Bjelbo dynasty This dynasty gradually consolidated Sweden to a strong state In the years according to the legend of Eric IX and the Eric Chronicles Swedish kings made a first second and third crusade to pagan Finland and started conflicts with the Rus who no longer had any connection with Sweden The Swedish colonisation of the coastal areas of Finland also started during the th and th century In the th century the colonisation began to be more organised and by the end of the century several of the coastal areas of Finland were inhabited mostly by Swedes br Except for the provinces of Scania Blekinge and Halland in the south west of the Scandinavian peninsula which were parts of the Kingdom of Denmark during this time feudalism never developed in Sweden as it did in the rest of Europe As a result the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history Slavery also called thralldom was not common in Sweden and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence by the spread of Christianity by the difficulty of obtaining slaves from lands east of the Baltic Sea and by the development of cities before the th century Indeed both slavery and serfdom were abolished altogether by a decree of King Magnus IV in Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the primary means of exchange br In Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus Eriksson who was a grandson of King Magnus III of Sweden and of King Haakon V of Norway King Magnus also ruled Scania from to In the middle of the th century Sweden was struck by the Black Death The population of Sweden and most of Europe was decimated The population in the same territory did not reach the numbers of the year again until the beginning of the th century One third of the population died during During this period the cities began to acquire greater rights and were strongly influenced by German merchants of the Hanseatic League active especially at Visby In Queen Margaret I of Denmark the former daughter in law of Magnus Eriksson affected the personal union of Sweden Norway and Denmark through the Kalmar Union However Margaret s successors whose rule was also centred in Denmark were unable to control the Swedish nobility br br Many times the Swedish crown was inherited by child kings over the course of the kingdom s existence consequently real power was held for long periods by regents notably those of the Sture family chosen by the Swedish parliament King Christian II of Denmark who asserted his claim to Sweden by force of arms ordered a massacre of Swedish nobles in Stockholm in This came to be known as the Stockholm blood bath and stirred the Swedish nobility to new resistance and on June now Sweden s national holiday in they made Gustav Vasa their king This is sometimes considered as the foundation of modern Sweden Shortly afterwards the new king rejected Catholicism and led Sweden into the Protestant Reformation br The term riksdag was used for the first time in the s although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as in the town of Arboga During the Riksdag assemblies of and under King Gustav Vasa representatives of all four estates of the realm clergy nobility townsmen and peasants were called on to participate for the first time The monarchy became hereditary in br The Hanseatic League sought civil and commercial privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the Baltic Sea In exchange they offered a certain amount of protection to the joining cities The privileges obtained by the Hansa included assurances that only Hansa citizens would be allowed to trade from the ports where they were located They sought agreement to be free of all customs and taxes With these concessions L beck merchants flocked to Stockholm where they soon came to dominate the city s economic life and made the port city of Stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of Sweden Under the Hanseatic trade two thirds of Stockholm s imports consisted of textiles while the remaining third was salt The main exports from Sweden were iron and copper br However the Swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the Hansa mostly consisting of German citizens Consequently when Gustav Vasa or Gustav I broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he was regarded as a hero by the Swedish people Furthermore when Sweden did develop freed itself from the Hanseatic League and entered its golden era the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class br The end of the th century was marked by a final phase of rivalry between the remaining Catholics and the new Protestant communities In Gustav Vasa s Catholic grandson and king of Poland Sigismund ascended the Swedish throne He pursued to strengthen Rome s influence by initiating Counter Reformation and created a dual monarchy which temporarily became known as the Polish Swedish Union His despotic rule strongly characterised by intolerance towards the Protestants sparked a civil war that plunged Sweden into poverty In opposition Sigismund s uncle and successor Charles Vasa summoned the Uppsala Synod in which officially confirmed the modern Church of Sweden as Lutheran Following his deposition in Sigismund attempted to reclaim the throne at every expense and hostilities between Poland and Sweden continued for the next one hundred years br br br Swedish Empire br br Sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the reign of king Gustavus Adolphus seizing territories from Russia and the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth in multiple conflicts During the Thirty Years War Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states and defeated the Imperial army at the Battle of Breitenfeld in Gustavus Adolphus planned to become the new Holy Roman Emperor ruling over a united Scandinavia and the Holy Roman states but he was killed at the Battle of L tzen in After the Battle of N rdlingen in Sweden s only significant military defeat of the war pro Swedish sentiment among the German states faded These German provinces broke away from Swedish power one by one leaving Sweden with only a few northern German territories Swedish Pomerania Bremen Verden and Wismar From to during the last years of the war Sweden and Denmark Norway fought the Torstenson War The result of that conflict and the conclusion of the Thirty Years War helped establish postwar Sweden as a major force in Europe The Peace of Westphalia in granted Sweden territories in northern Germany br In the middle of the th century Sweden was the third largest country in Europe by land area Sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of Charles X after the treaty of Roskilde in following Charles X s crossing of the Danish Belts The foundation of Sweden s success during this period is credited to Gustav I s major changes to the Swedish economy in the th century and his introduction of Protestantism One third of the Finnish population died in the devastating Great Famine of that struck the country Famine also hit Sweden killing roughly of Sweden s population br In the th century Sweden was engaged in many wars for example with Poland Lithuania with both sides competing for territories of today s Baltic states The Polish Swedish War ended with a ceasefire in Stary Targ Truce of Altmark on September that was in favour of the Swedes to whom Poland ceded the larger part of Livonia together with its important port of Riga The Swedes also got the right to tax Poland s trade on the Baltic on the value of goods and kept control of many of the cities in Royal and Ducal Prussia including Pi awa Pillau Memel and Elbl g Elbing The Swedes later conducted a series of invasions into the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth known as the Deluge After more than half a century of almost constant warfare the Swedish economy had deteriorated It became the lifetime task of Charles X s son Charles XI to rebuild the economy and refit the army His legacy to his son the coming ruler of Sweden Charles XII was one of the finest arsenals in the world a large standing army and a great fleet Russia the most serious threat to Sweden at this time had a larger army but lagged far behind in both equipment and training br After the Battle of Narva in one of the first battles of the Great Northern War the Russian army was so severely devastated that Sweden had an open chance to invade Russia However Charles XII did not pursue the Russian army instead turning against Poland and defeating the Polish king Augustus II the Strong and his Saxon allies at the Battle of Klisz w in This gave Russia time to rebuild and modernise its army br br After the success of invading Poland Charles XII decided to make an attempt at invading Russia but this ended in a decisive Russian victory at the Battle of Poltava in After a long march exposed to Cossack raids the Russian Tsar Peter the Great s scorched earth techniques and the extremely cold winter of the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and were enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava The defeat meant the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire In addition the plague raging in East Central Europe devastated the Swedish dominions and reached Central Sweden in Returning to Sweden in Charles XII launched two campaigns against Norway in and respectively During the second attempt he was shot to death during the siege of Fredriksten fortress The Swedes were not militarily defeated at Fredriksten but the whole structure and organisation of the campaign fell apart with the king s death Forced to cede large areas of land in the Treaty of Nystad in Sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the Baltic Sea With Sweden s lost influence Russia emerged as an empire and became one of Europe s dominant nations As the war finally ended in Sweden had lost an estimated men of those from the area of present day Sweden and from the Finnish part of Sweden br Executive power was historically shared between the King and an aristocratic Privy council until followed by the King s autocratic rule initiated by the commoner estates of the Riksdag As a reaction to the failed Great Northern War a parliamentary system was introduced in followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in and the latter granting several civil liberties Already during the first of those three periods the Era of Liberty the Swedish Rikstag had developed into a very active Parliament and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century br In the th century Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia and most of them were lost culminating with the loss in of eastern Sweden to Russia which became the highly autonomous Grand Principality of Finland in Imperial Russia br In interest of re establishing Swedish dominance in the Baltic Sea Sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor France in the Napoleonic Wars However in a French Marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte was chosen as heir presumptive to Charles XIII in he established the House of Bernadotte taking the regnal name of Charles XIV Sweden s role in the Battle of Leipzig gave it the authority to force Denmark Norway an ally of France to cede Norway to the King of Sweden on January in exchange for the northern German provinces at the Treaty of Kiel The Norwegian attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the Swedish king Charles XIII He launched a military campaign against Norway on July ending in the Convention of Moss which forced Norway into a personal union with Sweden under the Swedish crown which lasted until The campaign was the last time Sweden was at war br br br Modern history br br The Swedish East India Company began in The obvious choice of home port was Gothenburg at Sweden s west coast the mouth of G ta lv river is very wide and has the county s largest and best harbour for high seas journeys The trade continued into the th century and caused the little town to become Sweden s second city br Between and the population in Sweden doubled According to some scholars mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion over of the population emigrated annually during the s It is thought that between and more than one million Swedes moved to the United States Nevertheless Sweden remained poor retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Western European countries began to industrialise br Despite the slow rate of industrialisation into the th century many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy due to constant innovations and a rapid population growth These innovations included government sponsored programmes of enclosure aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands and the introduction of new crops such as the potato The Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in Swedish politics which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party now called the Centre Party Between and Sweden began developing the industrialised economy that exists today br Strong grassroots movements sprang up in Sweden during the latter half of the th century trade unions temperance groups and independent religious groups creating a strong foundation of democratic principles These movements precipitated Sweden s migration into a modern parliamentary democracy achieved by the time of World War I As the Industrial Revolution progressed during the th century people gradually moved into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions A communist revolution was avoided in following the re introduction of parliamentarism and the country was democratised br br br World War I and World War II br br Sweden was officially neutral during World War I However under pressure from the German Empire they did take steps which were detrimental to the Allied powers most notably mining the resund channel thus closing it to Allied shipping and allowing the Germans to use Swedish facilities and the Swedish cipher to transmit secret messages to their overseas embassies Sweden also allowed volunteers to fight alongside the Germans for the White Guards against the Red Guards and Russians in the Finnish Civil War and briefly occupied land in cooperation with the German Empire br As in the First World War Sweden remained officially neutral during World War II although its neutrality has been disputed Sweden was under German influence for much of the war as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades The Swedish government unofficially supported Finland in the Winter War and the Continuation War by allowing volunteers and materiel to be shipped to Finland However Sweden supported Norwegian resistance against Germany and in helped rescue Danish Jews from deportation to Nazi concentration camps br During the last year of the war Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts and many refugees among them several thousand Jews from Nazi occupied Europe were rescued thanks to the Swedish rescue missions to internment camps and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees The Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg and his colleagues ensured the safety of tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews Nevertheless both Swedes and others have argued that Sweden could have done more to oppose the Nazis war efforts br br br Post war era br br Sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside NATO and Warsaw Pact membership during the Cold War but privately Sweden s leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments Following the war Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe Sweden received aid under the Marshall Plan and participated in the OECD During most of the post war era the country was governed by the Swedish Social Democratic Party largely in co operation with trade unions and industry The government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporations br Sweden was one of the founding states of the European Free Trade Area EFTA During the s the EFTA countries were often referred to as the Outer Seven as opposed to the Inner Six of the then European Economic Community EEC br Like many industrialised countries Sweden entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of and In the s several key Swedish industries were significantly restructured Shipbuilding was discontinued wood pulp was integrated into modernised paper production the steel industry was concentrated and specialised and mechanical engineering was robotised Swedish GDP per capita ranking declined during this time br br br Recent history br br A bursting real estate bubble caused by inadequate controls on lending combined with an international recession and a policy switch from anti unemployment policies to anti inflationary policies resulted in a fiscal crisis in the early s Sweden s GDP declined by around In a run on the currency caused the central bank to briefly increase interest rates to br The response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden s competitiveness among them reducing the welfare state and privatising public services and goods A referendum passed with in favour of joining the EU on November Sweden joined the European Union on January In a referendum the Swedish electorate voted against joining the Euro currency Sweden held the chair of the European Union from July to December br On September the MS Estonia sank as the ship was crossing the Baltic Sea en route from Tallinn Estonia to Stockholm Sweden The disaster claimed the lives of people of them were Swedes being one of the worst maritime disasters of the th century br Until Sweden generally remained non aligned militarily although it participated in some joint military exercises with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO and some other countries stationed its troops under NATO command in Afghanistan took part in EU sponsored peacekeeping operations in Kosovo Bosnia and Herzegovina and Cyprus and helped enforce a UN mandated no fly zone over Libya during the Arab Spring In addition there was extensive cooperation with other European countries in the area of defence technology and defence industry some Swedish made weaponry was used by Coalition militaries in Iraq In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine Sweden moved to formally join NATO alongside Finland After many months of delays caused by the objections of Turkey and Hungary Sweden became a NATO member on March br br In recent decades Sweden has become a more culturally diverse nation due to significant immigration in it was estimated that of the population was foreign born and an additional of the population were born to two immigrant parents The influx of immigrants has brought new social challenges Violent incidents have periodically occurred including the Stockholm riots In response to these violent events the anti immigration opposition party the Sweden Democrats promoted their anti immigration policies while the left wing opposition blamed growing inequality caused by the centre right government s socioeconomic policies br Sweden was heavily affected by the European migrant crisis eventually forcing the government to tighten regulations of entry to the country Some of the asylum restrictions were relaxed again later br On November Magdalena Andersson became Sweden s first female prime minister The September general election ended in a narrow win to a bloc of right wing parties On October Ulf Kristersson of the Moderate Party became the new Prime Minister br br br Geography br br Situated in Northern Europe Sweden lies west of the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Bothnia providing a long coastline and forms the eastern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula To the west is the Scandinavian mountain chain Skanderna a range that separates Sweden from Norway Finland is located to its north east It has maritime borders with Denmark Germany Poland Russia Lithuania Latvia and Estonia and it is also linked to Denmark south west by the resund Bridge Its border with Norway km long is the longest uninterrupted border within Europe br Sweden lies between latitudes and N and mostly between longitudes and E part of Stora Drammen island is just west of br br At km sq mi Sweden is the th largest country in the world the fifth largest country in Europe and the largest country in Northern Europe The lowest elevation in Sweden is in the bay of Lake Hammarsj n near Kristianstad at m ft below sea level The highest point is Kebnekaise at m ft above sea level br Sweden has provinces or landskap While these provinces serve no political or administrative purpose they play an important role in people s self identity The provinces are usually grouped together in three large lands parts the northern Norrland the central Svealand and southern G taland The sparsely populated Norrland encompasses almost of the country Sweden also has the Vindelfj llen Nature Reserve one of the largest protected areas in Europe totaling ha approx km br About of Sweden lies north of the Arctic Circle Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural with increasing forest coverage northward Around of Sweden s total land area is covered with forests The highest population density is in the resund Region in southern Sweden along the western coast up to central Bohusl n and in the valley of lake M laren and Stockholm Gotland and land are Sweden s largest islands V nern and V ttern are its largest lakes V nern is the third largest in Europe after Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega in Russia Combined with the third and fourth largest lakes M laren and Hj lmaren these lakes take up a significant part of southern Sweden s area Sweden s extensive waterway availability throughout the south was exploited with the building of the G ta Canal in the th century shortening the potential distance between the Baltic Sea south of Norrk ping and Gothenburg by using the lake and river network to facilitate the canal br Sweden also has plenty of long rivers draining the lakes Northern and central Sweden have several wide rivers known as lvar commonly sourced within the Scandinavian Mountains The longest river is Klar lven G ta lv which originates in Tr ndelag in central Norway running kilometres mi before it enters the sea at Gothenburg In southern Sweden narrower rivers known as ar are also common The vast majority of municipal seats are set either on the sea a river or a lake and the majority of the country s population live in coastal municipalities br br br Climate br br Most of Sweden has a temperate climate despite its northern latitude with largely four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year The winter in the far south is usually weak and is manifested only through some shorter periods with snow and sub zero temperatures autumn may well turn into spring there without a distinct period of winter The northern parts of the country have a subarctic climate while the central parts have a humid continental climate The coastal south can be defined as having either a humid continental climate using the C isotherm or an oceanic climate using the C isotherm br Due to the increased maritime moderation in the peninsular south summer differences between the coastlines of the southernmost and northernmost regions are about C F in summer and C F in winter This grows further when comparing areas in the northern interior where the winter difference in the far north is about C F throughout the country The warmest summers usually happen in the M laren Valley around Stockholm due to the vast landmass shielding the middle east coast from Atlantic low pressure systems in July Daytime highs in Sweden s municipal seats vary from C F to C F in July and C F to C F in January The colder temperatures are influenced by the higher elevation in the northern interior At sea level the coldest average highs range from C F to C F As a result of the mild summers the arctic region of Norrbotten has some of the northernmost agriculture in the world br Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude and even somewhat farther south mainly because of the combination of the Gulf Stream and the general west wind drift caused by the direction of Earth s rotation Because of Sweden s high latitude the length of daylight varies greatly North of the Arctic Circle the sun never sets for part of each summer and it never rises for part of each winter In the capital Stockholm daylight lasts for more than hours in late June but only around hours in late December Sweden receives between and hours of sunshine annually br The highest temperature ever recorded in Sweden was C F in M lilla in while the coldest temperature ever recorded was C F in Vuoggatj lme on February br On average most of Sweden receives between and mm and in of precipitation each year making it considerably drier than the global average The south western part of the country receives more precipitation between and mm and in and some mountain areas in the north are estimated to receive up to mm in Despite northerly locations southern and central Sweden may have almost no snow in some winters Most of Sweden is located in the rain shadow of the Scandinavian Mountains through Norway and north west Sweden It is predicted that as the Barents Sea gets less frozen in the coming winters becoming thus Atlantified additional evaporation will increase future snowfalls in Sweden and much of continental Europe br br br Vegetation br br Sweden has a considerable south to north distance which causes large climatic difference especially during the winter The related matter of the length and strength of the four seasons plays a role in which plants that naturally can grow at various places Sweden is divided into five major vegetation zones These are br br The southern deciduous forest zone br The southern coniferous forest zone br The northern coniferous forest zone or the Taiga br The alpine birch zone br The bare mountain zone br Southern deciduous forest zone also known as the nemoral region the southern deciduous forest zone is a part of a larger vegetation zone which also includes Denmark and large parts of Central Europe It has to a rather large degree become agricultural areas but larger and smaller forests still exist The region is characterised by a large wealth of trees and shrubs The beech is the most dominant tree but oak can also form smaller forests Elm at one time formed forests but have been heavily reduced due to Dutch Elm disease Other important trees and shrubs in this zone include hornbeam elder hazel fly honeysuckle linden lime spindle yew alder buckthorn blackthorn aspen European rowan Swedish whitebeam juniper European holly ivy dogwood goat willow larch bird cherry wild cherry maple ash alder along creeks and in sandy soil birch compete with pine Spruce is not native but between approximately and large areas were planted with it During the last years large areas of former spruce plantings have been replanted with deciduous forest br Southern coniferous forest zone also known as the boreo nemoral region is delimited by the oak s northern natural limit limes norrlandicus and the Spruce s southern natural limit between the southern deciduous zone and the Taiga farther north In the southern parts of this zone the coniferous species are found mainly spruce and pine mixed with various deciduous trees Birch grows largely everywhere The beech s northern boundary crosses this zone Although in its natural area also planted Spruce are common and such woods are very dense as the spruces can grow very tight especially in this vegetation zone s southern areas br The northern coniferous forest zone or the Taiga begins north of the natural boundary of the oak Of deciduous species the birch is the only one of significance Pine and spruce are dominant but the forests are slowly but surely more sparsely grown the farther towards the north it gets In the extreme north is it difficult to state the trees forms true forests at all due to the large distances between the trees br The alpine birch zone in the Scandinavian mountains depending on both latitude and altitude is an area where only a smaller kind of birch Betula pubescens or B tortuosa can grow Where this vegetation zone ends no trees grow at all the bare mountain zone br Sweden had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of ranking it rd globally out of countries br br br Government and politics br Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its popular movements Folkr relser the most notable being trade unions the independent Christian movement the temperance movement the women s movement and the intellectual property pirate movements Sweden was the first country in the world to outlaw corporal punishment of children by their parents parents right to spank their own children was first removed in and it was explicitly prohibited by law from July br Sweden is currently leading the EU in statistics measuring equality in the political system and equality in the education system The Global Gender Gap Report ranked Sweden as the number one country in terms of gender equality br br br Constitutional framework br br Sweden has four fundamental laws Swedish grundlagar which together form the Constitution the Instrument of Government Swedish Regeringsformen the Act of Succession Swedish Successionsordningen the Freedom of the Press Act Swedish Tryckfrihetsf rordningen and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression Swedish Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen br The public sector in Sweden is divided into two parts the legal person known as the State Swedish staten and local authorities the latter include Regional Councils Swedish regioner renamed from county councils landsting in and local Municipalities Swedish kommuner The local authorities rather than the State make up the larger part of the public sector in Sweden Regional Councils and Municipalities are independent of one another the former merely covers a larger geographical area than the latter The local authorities have self rule as mandated by the Constitution and their own tax base Notwithstanding their self rule local authorities are nevertheless in practice dependent upon the State as the parameters of their responsibilities and the extent of their jurisdiction are specified in the Local Government Act Swedish Kommunallagen passed by the Riksdag br Sweden is a constitutional monarchy and King Carl XVI Gustaf is the head of state but the role of the monarch is limited to ceremonial and representative functions Under the provisions of the Instrument of Government the King lacks any formal political power The King opens the annual Riksdag session chairs the Special Council held during a change of Government holds regular Information Councils with the Prime Minister and the Government chairs the meetings of the Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs Swedish Utrikesn mnden and receives Letters of Credence of foreign ambassadors to Sweden and signs those of Swedish ambassadors sent abroad In addition the King pays State Visits abroad and hosts those incoming br Legislative power is vested in the unicameral Riksdag with members General elections are held every four years Legislation may be initiated by the Government or by members of the Riksdag Members are elected on the basis of proportional representation to a four year term The internal workings of the Riksdag are in addition to the Instrument of Government regulated by the Riksdag Act Swedish Riksdagsordningen The fundamental laws can be altered by the Riksdag alone only an absolute majority with two separate votes separated by a general election in between is required br br The Government Swedish Regeringen operates as a collegial body with collective responsibility and consists of the Prime Minister appointed and dismissed by the Speaker of the Riksdag following an actual vote in the Riksdag before an appointment can be made and other cabinet ministers Swedish Statsr d appointed and dismissed at the sole discretion of the Prime Minister The Government is the supreme executive authority and is responsible for its actions to the Riksdag br Most of the State administrative authorities Swedish statliga f rvaltningsmyndigheter report to the Government A unique feature of Swedish State administration is that individual cabinet ministers do not bear any individual ministerial responsibility for the performance of the agencies within their portfolio as the director generals and other heads of government agencies reports directly to the Government as a whole and individual ministers are prohibited to interfere thus the origin of the pejorative in Swedish political parlance term ministerstyre English ministerial rule in matters that are to be handled by the individual agencies unless otherwise specifically provided for in law br The Judiciary is independent from the Riksdag Government and other State administrative authorities The role of judicial review of legislation is not practised by the courts instead the Council on Legislation gives non binding opinions on legality There is no stare decisis in that courts are not

Throughout the th century Swedish foreign policy was based on the principle of non alignment in peacetime and neutrality in wartime Sweden s government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war br During the early Cold War era Sweden combined its policy of non alignment and a low profile in international affairs with a security policy based on strong national defence The function of the Swedish military was to deter attack Beginning in the late s Sweden attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations It involved itself significantly in international peace efforts especially through the United Nations and in support of the Third World Following the assassination of Olof

are divided into Army Air Force and Navy The head of the armed forces is the Supreme Commander verbef lhavaren B the most senior commissioned officer in the country Up to the King was pro forma Commander in Chief but in reality it was clearly understood through the th century that the monarch would have no active role as a military leader br br Until the end of the Cold War nearly all males reaching the age of military service were conscripted In recent years the number of conscripted males has shrunk dramatically while the number of female volunteers has increased slightly Recruitment has generally shifted towards finding the most motivated recruits By law all soldiers serving abroad must be volunteers On July Sweden ended routine conscription switching to an all volunteer force unless otherwise required for defence readiness The total forces gathered would consist of about personnel This in comparison with the s before the fall of the Soviet Union when Sweden could gather up

industrialisation After World War II a succession of governments expanded the welfare state by raising the taxes A series of successive social reforms transformed the country into one of the most

Sweden s rating on the Human Development Index will fall from in to in br Sweden has been relatively quick to adopt neoliberal policies such as privatisation financialisation and deregulation compared to countries such as France The current Swedish government is continuing the trend of moderate rollbacks of previous social reforms Growth has been higher than in many other EU countries Since the mid s Sweden has had the fastest growth in inequality of any developed nation according to the OECD This has largely been attributed to the reduction in state benefits and a shift toward the privatisation

born after World War II understand and speak English owing to trade links the popularity of overseas travel a strong Anglo American influence and the tradition of subtitling rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films and the relative similarity of the two languages which makes learning English easier In a survey by Eurobarometer of Swedes reported the ability to speak English br English became a compulsory subject for secondary school students studying natural sciences as early as and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since the late s Most students also

partly that until children automatically became members at birth if at least one of the parents was a member Since only children and adults who are christened become members Some Swedes are today
