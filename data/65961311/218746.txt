The Western Hockey League WHL is a junior ice hockey league based in Western Canada and the Northwestern United States The WHL is one of three leagues that constitutes the Canadian Hockey League CHL

the Memorial Cup Canada s national junior championship WHL teams have won the Memorial Cup times The WHL is composed of teams divided into two conferences of two divisions The Eastern Conference comprises teams from Manitoba Saskatchewan and Alberta while the Western Conference comprises eleven teams from British Columbia and the American states of Washington and Oregon br The league was founded in as the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League CMJHL with seven teams in Saskatchewan and Alberta For its season the league was renamed the Western Canada Junior Hockey League WCJHL From the league was renamed the Western Canada Hockey League WCHL and finally the Western Hockey League from after the admission of American based teams to the league br The league was the brainchild of Bill Hunter who desired to build a western league capable of competing with the top leagues in Ontario and Quebec He partnered with Scotty Munro Del Wilson and Jim Piggott to make this vision a reality Originally considered an outlaw league by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association the western league was not sanctioned as a top junior league until when Canadian junior hockey was reorganized br br br History br br br Tumultuous beginnings br Despite winning the Memorial Cup Edmonton Oil Kings owner Bill Hunter was growing concerned about the state of junior hockey in Western Canada Each of the West s four provinces had its own junior league and Hunter felt that this put them at a disadvantage when competing nationally against larger leagues based in Ontario and Quebec Desiring stronger competition Hunter s Oil Kings were competing in both the Alberta Junior Hockey League and the senior Central Alberta Hockey League During the Memorial Cup Hunter made newspaper headlines when he outlined his vision for a nation wide junior hockey league competing for the Memorial Cup The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association s CAHA second vice president Lloyd Pollock responded by saying that the idea was a pipe dream and was not feasible while the CAHA was re negotiating a development agreement with the National Hockey League NHL br CAHA informed the Oil Kings that they were required to play full time in a junior hockey league for the season or would be ineligible to compete for the Memorial Cup This led Hunter to endorse the suggestion of Estevan Bruins owner Scotty Munro to create a new Western regional junior league Five members of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League SJHL the Bruins Moose Jaw Canucks Regina Pats Saskatoon Blades and Weyburn Red Wings left the SJHL and joined the Oil Kings and the Calgary Buffaloes in forming the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League CMJHL Despite concerns that the CMJHL would mean the demise of the Alberta and Saskatchewan leagues the SJHL did immediately fold the governing bodies in both provinces sanctioned the new league However CAHA did not sanction it declaring the CMJHL to be an outlaw league and suspending its teams and players from participation in CAHA events including the Memorial Cup The new league accused CAHA of overstepping its boundaries and with the support of the players and their families chose to play the season regardless The CMJHL began legal action against the CAHA executive in March fighting to regain eligibility to enter the Memorial Cup tournament br In May the CMJHL renamed itself to the Western Canada Junior Hockey League WCJHL The league also added four new teams including the Swift Current Broncos and three teams based in Manitoba the Brandon Wheat Kings Flin Flon Bombers and Winnipeg Jets The new CAHA NHL development agreement came into effect July The new pact ended direct sponsorship of junior teams by the NHL which shifted to paying development fees to CAHA with junior players becoming eligible for the NHL entry draft at age With the agreement settled CAHA finally sanctioned the WCHL which allowed for the league champion Estevan Bruins to compete for the Memorial Cup However in May Hunter announced that the league would use an age limit of in spite of the CAHA NHL agreement The WCJHL claimed that the lower age limit decreased its talent pool and negatively impacted ticket sales In response CAHA again suspended the league and its players br In June the WCJHL changed its name to the Western Canada Hockey League WCHL and announced that it was leaving CAHA to form the rival Canadian Hockey Association CHA Hunter became chairman of the board for the WCHL and Ron Butlin became president of the WCHL and the CHA Concerns over the WCHL s relationship with CAHA and a desire to compete for the Memorial Cup led the Pats Canucks and Red Wings to withdraw before the season and join a revived Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League instead At the conclusion of the season the CHA organized its own national championship which pitted the WCHL champion Flin Flon Bombers against the St Thomas Barons from Ontario The initiative was undermined when the Barons withdrew from the best of seven series during the fourth game in protest of alleged violent play on the part of the Bombers The Bombers who were awarded the title proceeded to challenge the Memorial Cup champion Montreal Junior Canadiens to a championship showdown but the Montreal team declined br br After years of disputes Canadian junior hockey was reorganized in with CAHA absorbing the CHA and re sanctioning the WCHL making it one of three top flight major junior leagues along with the Ontario Hockey Association now the Ontario Hockey League and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League now the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League Then in the format of the Memorial Cup was changed to become a tournament between the champion of each major junior league br League logo timeline br br br br br br br br br br br

Breakers and Billings Bighorns a year later the WCHL shortened its name to the Western Hockey League Despite the Flin Flon Bombers early success the remoteness and size of the community increasingly posed a challenge and in the team relocated to Edmonton in a brief revival of the Oil Kings the team would move again a year later and become the Great Falls Americans br br br The brawling s br The s were marked by several brawls that involved police intervention one of the most bizarre trades in hockey history and the tragic deaths of four players in a bus crash br Early in the WHL season Medicine Hat Tigers manager and coach Pat Ginnell traded blows with a linesman during a bench clearing brawl against the Lethbridge Broncos Ginnell was found guilty of assault fined and suspended for games by the WHL In March a violent brawl between the Regina Pats and Calgary Wranglers saw the two teams collectively fined and players suspended for combined games Pats coach Bill LaForge would end up in a courtroom later that season when he got into an altercation with a fan LaForge was acquitted when the judge noted that it was hard to convict a man for assault when faced with an obnoxious person trying to get into the coach s area LaForge resigned following the season after serving three separate suspensions br On January the Seattle Breakers dealt Tom Martin and to the Victoria Cougars for the Cougars team bus The Breakers had been unable to sign Martin who wanted to play in his home town of Victoria and the Cougars were unable to use the bus which they had purchased from the folded Spokane Flyers because they were unwilling to pay the taxes and duties required to register the vehicle in Canada br On December tragedy struck the Swift Current Broncos when their bus slid off an icy highway and rolled on the way to Regina for a game Scott Kruger Trent Kresse Brent Ruff and Chris Mantyka were killed in the crash The Broncos retired their numbers and introduced a
