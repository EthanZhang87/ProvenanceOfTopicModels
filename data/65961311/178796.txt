considered most likely that the name in fact derived from one already in use manemesaskwatan or the place where willows are cut referring to the Cree practice of cutting saskatoon berry willows for arrow shafts br br br History br br In the Toronto based Temperance Colonization Society was granted sections of land straddling the South Saskatchewan River between what is now Warman and Dundurn The aim of the group was to escape the liquor trade in Toronto and set up a dry community in the Prairie region The following year settlers led by John Neilson Lake arrived on the site of what is now Saskatoon and established the first permanent settlement The settlers travelled by railway from Ontario to Moose Jaw and then completed the final leg via horse drawn cart as the railway had yet to be completed to Saskatoon br br In the North West Rebellion affected the tiny community in a variety of ways Chief Whitecap and Charles Trottier passed through the present day University campus on their

the aspen parkland biome The lack of surrounding mountainous topography gives the city a relatively flat grid though the city does sprawl over a few hills and into a few valleys The lowest point in the city is the river while the highest point is in the Sutherland College Park area Saskatoon on a cross section from west to east has a general decline in elevation above sea level heading towards the river and on the east bank of the river the terrain is mostly level until outside the city where it begins to decrease in elevation again br Saskatoon is divided into east and west sides by the South Saskatchewan River It is then divided into Suburban Development Areas SDA which are composed of neighbourhoods Street addresses are demarcated into north and south for avenues aligned in those directions and similar east and west for streets aligned in those directions West of the river the demarcation line for north and south addresses is nd Street while east and west are divided by Idylwyld Drive north of th Street and Avenue A south of th On the east side in order to line up with nd Idylwyld Lorne Avenue demarcates east and west while Aird Street a minor residential road marks the north south boundary except in the Sutherland community where a separate east west demarcation takes place with Central Avenue as the boundary there is however no separate north south divide As a result of the unusual demarcation on the east side few streets there actually carry a North or West designation and only a few streets in Sutherland are demarcated East and West br A second major
