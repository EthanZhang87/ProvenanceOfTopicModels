The City of North Vancouver is a city on the north shore of Burrard Inlet British Columbia Canada It is a suburb of Vancouver It is the smallest in area and the most urbanized of the North Shore municipalities although it has significant industry of its own including shipping chemical production and film production The city is served by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police British Columbia Ambulance Service and the North Vancouver City Fire Department br br br History br In the s Arthur Heywood Lonsdale and a relation James Pemberton Fell made substantial investments through their company Lonsdale Estates and in he financed the Moodyville investments Several locations in the North Vancouver area are named after Lonsdale and his family br Not long after the District of North Vancouver was formed an early land developer and second reeve of the new council James Cooper Keith personally underwrote a loan to commence construction of a road which undulated from West Vancouver to Deep Cove amid the slashed sidehills swamps and burnt stumps The road sometimes under different names and not always contiguous is still one of the most important east west thoroughfare carrying traffic across the North Shore br Development was slow at the outset The population of the district in the census was only people Keith joined Edwin Mahon and together they controlled North Vancouver Land Improvement Company Soon the pace of development around the foot of Lonsdale began to pick up The first school was opened in The district was able to build a municipal hall in and actually have meetings in North Vancouver instead of in Vancouver where most of the landowners lived The first bank and first newspaper arrived in In the BC Electric Railway Company opened up a street car line that extended from the ferry wharf up Lonsdale to th Street By the streetcar system extended west to the Capilano River and east to Lynn Valley br The owners of businesses who operated on Lonsdale as part of an initiative led by Keith and Mahon brought a petition to the district council in calling for a new compact city to be carved out of the unwieldy district br During the ensuing two years there was much and sometimes heated debate Some thought the new city should have a new name such as Northport Hillmont or Parkhill Burrard became the favourite of the new names but majority view was that North Vancouver remain in order to remain associated with the rising credibility of Vancouver in financial markets and as a place to attract immigrants br Some thought the boundary of the new city should reflect geography and extend from Lynn Creek or Seymour River west to the Capilano River and extend three miles up the mountainside That the boundary of the city which came into existence in just happened to match that of the lands owned by the North Vancouver Land Improvement Company and Lonsdale Estate was no accident Since the motivation for creating the city was to reserve local tax revenue for the work of putting in services for the property owned by the major developers there was little reason to take on any of the burden beyond the extent of their holdings br Residents in west part of the District of North Vancouver now had less reason to be connected with what remained and they petitioned to create the District of West Vancouver the west part of the North Shore not the west side of Vancouver in The eastern boundary of that new municipality is for the most part the Capilano River and a community that is easily distinguished from the two North Vancouvers has since developed br br The City of North Vancouver continued to grow around the foot of Lonsdale Avenue Serviced by the North Vancouver Ferries it proved a popular area Commuters used the ferries to work in Vancouver Street cars and early land speculation spurred interest in the area Streets city blocks and houses were slowly built around lower Lonsdale Wallace Shipyards and the Pacific Great Eastern Railway provided an industrial base although the late arrival of the Second Narrows railway bridge in controlled development br br The Depression again bankrupted the city while the Second World War turned North Vancouver into the Clydeside of Canada with a large shipbuilding program Housing the shipyard workers provided a new building boom which continued on through the post war years By that time North Vancouver became a popular housing area br br br Geography br br The City of North Vancouver is separated from Vancouver by the Burrard Inlet and it is surrounded on three sides by the
