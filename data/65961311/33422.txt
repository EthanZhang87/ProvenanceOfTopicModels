hockey writers ex players general managers and coaches Gretzky is the leading career goal scorer assist producer and point scorer in NHL history and has more career assists than any other player has total points He is the only NHL player to total over points in one season a feat he accomplished four times In addition Gretzky tallied over points in professional seasons of them consecutively At the time of his retirement in he held NHL records regular season records playoff records and All Star records br Born and raised in Brantford Ontario Gretzky honed his skills on a backyard rink and regularly played minor hockey at a level far above his peers Despite his unimpressive size and strength Gretzky s intelligence stamina and reading of the game were unrivaled He was adept at dodging checks from opposing players consistently anticipated where the puck was going to be and executed the right move at the right time Gretzky became known for setting up behind his opponent s net an area that was nicknamed Gretzky s office br Gretzky was the top scorer in the World Junior Championships In June he signed with the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association WHA where he briefly played before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers When the WHA folded the Oilers joined the NHL where he established many scoring records and led his team to four Stanley Cup championships Gretzky s trade to the Los Angeles Kings on August had an immediate impact on that team s performance ultimately leading them to the Stanley Cup Finals and he is credited with popularizing hockey in California Gretzky played briefly for the St Louis Blues before finishing his career with the New York Rangers Gretzky captured nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player Art Ross Trophies for most points in a season two Conn Smythe Trophies as playoff MVP and five Lester B Pearson Awards now called the Ted Lindsay Award for most outstanding player as judged by his peers He led the league in goal scoring five times and assists times He also won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for sportsmanship and performance five times and often spoke out against fighting in hockey br After his retirement in Gretzky was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame making him the most recent player to have the waiting period waived The NHL retired his jersey number league wide Gretzky was one of six players voted to the International Ice Hockey Federation s IIHF Centennial All Star Team He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in and received the Order of Hockey in Canada in Gretzky became executive director for the Canadian national men s hockey team during the Winter Olympics in which the team won a gold medal In he became part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes and following the NHL lock out he became the team s head coach In Gretzky was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame In September following the Phoenix Coyotes bankruptcy Gretzky resigned as head coach and relinquished his ownership share In October he returned to the Oilers as a minority partner and vice chairman of their parent company Oilers Entertainment Group He left in to become an analyst on Turner Sports NHL coverage br br br Early years br Wayne Douglas Gretzky was born on January in Brantford Ontario the son of Phyllis Leone Hockin and Walter Gretzky The couple married in and lived in an apartment in Brantford where Walter worked for Bell Telephone Canada The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue in Brantford seven months after Wayne was born chosen partly because its yard was flat enough to make an ice rink Wayne had a sister Kim born and brothers Keith Glen and Brent The family regularly visited the farm of Wayne s grandparents Tony and Mary and watched Hockey Night in Canada together By age two Wayne was trying to score goals against Mary using a souvenir stick The farm was where Wayne skated on ice for the first time aged two years months br br Walter taught Wayne Keith Brent Glen and their friends hockey on a rink he made in the backyard of the family home nicknamed the Wally Coliseum Drills included skating around bleach bottles and tin cans and flipping pucks over scattered hockey sticks to be able to pick up the puck again in full flight Walter gave the advice to skate where the puck s going not where it s been Wayne was a classic prodigy whose extraordinary skills made him the target of other children s jealous parents br The team Gretzky played on at age six was otherwise composed of year olds His first coach Dick Martin remarked that he handled the puck better than the year olds According to Martin Wayne was so good that you could have a boy of your own who was a tremendous hockey player and he d get overlooked because of what the Gretzky kid was doing The sweaters for year olds were far too large for Gretzky who coped by tucking the sweater into his pants on the right side Gretzky continued doing this throughout his NHL career br By age Gretzky had scored an astonishing goals and assists in just one season with the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers His play attracted media attention beyond Brantford including a profile by John Iaboni in the Toronto Telegram in October In the Quebec International Pee Wee Hockey Tournament Gretzky scored points playing for Brantford By age he had scored over goals br His play attracted considerable negative attention from other players parents including those of his teammates and he was often booed According to Walter the capper was being booed on Brantford Day at Toronto s Maple Leaf Gardens in February When Gretzky was his family arranged for him to move to and play hockey in Toronto partly to further his career and partly to remove him from the uncomfortable pressure The Gretzkys had to legally challenge the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to win Wayne the right to play in a different area which was disallowed at the time The Gretzkys won and Wayne played Junior B hockey with the Toronto Nationals in a league that included year olds He earned Rookie of the Year honours in the Metro Junior B Hockey League in with points in games The following year as a year old he had points in games with the same team renamed the Seneca Nationals br Despite his offensive statistics scoring points in games in Junior B two teams bypassed him in the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League draft of year olds The Oshawa Generals picked Tom McCarthy first and the Niagara Falls Flyers picked Steve Peters second overall With the third pick the Sault Ste Marie Greyhounds selected Gretzky even though Walter Gretzky had told the team Wayne would not move to Sault Ste Marie a northern Ontario city that inflicts a heavy travelling schedule on its junior team The Gretzkys made an arrangement with a local family they knew and Wayne played for the Greyhounds at age It was with the Greyhounds that Gretzky first wore the number on his jersey He originally wanted to wear number for his hockey hero Gordie Howe but it was already being worn by teammate Brian Gualazzi At coach Muzz MacPherson s suggestion Gretzky settled on br br br World Hockey Association br By the World Hockey Association which had competed with the established NHL since was struggling The league which at one point iced fourteen teams was down to seven surviving franchises The WHA had long sought to arrange a merger with the NHL but were constantly rebuffed by a group of hardline owners in the older league With the WHA s long term survival in doubt Birmingham Bulls owner John F Bassett believed the only way to gain meaningful leverage over the NHL was to sign as many young and promising superstars as possible The NHL did not allow the signing of players under age but the WHA had no such rules Bassett saw Gretzky as the most promising young prospect Several WHA teams courted Gretzky notably the Bulls and the Indianapolis Racers br Ultimately it was Racers owner Nelson Skalbania who on June signed year old Gretzky to a seven year personal services contract worth US million Skalbania opted to have Gretzky sign a personal services contract rather than a standard player contract in part because by that point it was well known that a majority of NHL owners if not yet the required to add new NHL franchises were willing to absorb at least some WHA teams While Skalbania knew it was unlikely the Racers would be one of these teams in part because the WHA insisted that all of its surviving Canadian teams be included he still hoped to keep the Racers alive long enough to collect compensation from the surviving teams when the WHA dissolved as well as any funds earned from selling the young star br Gretzky scored his first professional goal against Dave Dryden of the Edmonton Oilers in his fifth game and his second goal four seconds later However he played only eight games for Indianapolis The Racers were losing per game Skalbania told Gretzky he would be moved offering him a choice between the Edmonton Oilers and the Winnipeg Jets On the advice of his agent Gretzky picked the Oilers but the move was not that simple On November Gretzky goaltender Eddie Mio and forward Peter Driscoll were put on a private plane not knowing where they would land and what team they would be joining While in the air Skalbania worked on the deal Skalbania offered to play a game of backgammon with Winnipeg owner Michael Gobuty the stakes being if Gobuty won he would get Gretzky and if he lost he had to give Skalbania a share of the Jets Gobuty turned down the proposal and the players landed in Edmonton Mio paid the bill for the flight Skalbania sold Gretzky Mio and Driscoll to Oilers owner Peter Pocklington a former business partner Although the announced price was Pocklington paid The money was not enough to keep the Racers alive they folded that December br One of the highlights of Gretzky s season was his appearance in the WHA All Star Game The format was a three game series between the WHA All Stars and Dynamo Moscow played at Edmonton s Northlands Coliseum The WHA All Stars were coached by Jacques Demers who put Gretzky on a line with his boyhood idol Gordie Howe and Howe s son Mark In game one the line scored seven points and the WHA All Stars won by a score of In game two Gretzky and Mark Howe each scored a goal and Gordie Howe picked up an assist as the WHA won The line did not score in the final game but the WHA won by a score of br On Gretzky s th birthday January Pocklington signed him to a year personal services contract the longest in hockey history at the time worth C million with options for more years Gretzky finished third in the league in scoring at points behind Robbie Ftorek and R al Cloutier Gretzky captured the Lou Kaplan Trophy as rookie of the year and helped the Oilers to first place in the league br By the end of the regular season the signings of Gretzky and other young stars in addition to other factors had compelled enough of the hardline NHL owners to change their positions and an agreement recognized as the expansion by the NHL was finalized Under the agreement the WHA agreed to fold after the season with the Oilers and three other teams the Hartford New England Whalers the Quebec Nordiques and the Winnipeg Jets joining the older league as expansion franchises The Oilers like the other three teams were to be allowed to protect two goaltenders and two skaters from being reclaimed by the established NHL teams in the NHL Expansion Draft The NHL also lowered its minimum age ensuring players such as Gretzky would not need to return to the junior level albeit with the caveat that such previously underaged players were supposed to be placed into the NHL Entry Draft pool Nevertheless to avoid any potential for litigation over the validity of Gretzky s personal services contract the Oilers were allowed to keep him on their roster as one of their priority selections In exchange for agreeing to keep Gretzky off the draft board the NHL placed Edmonton at the bottom of the draft order br The WHA completed the playoffs of its final season as planned The Oilers reached the Avco World Trophy finals the only WHA championship series appearance for the franchise where they lost to the Winnipeg Jets in six games br br br NHL career br br br Edmonton Oilers br Gretzky s success in the WHA carried over into the NHL despite some critics suggesting he would struggle in what was considered the bigger tougher and more talented league In his first NHL season Gretzky was awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL s Most Valuable Player the first of eight in a row and tied for the scoring lead with Marcel Dionne with points Although Gretzky played games to Dionne s Dionne was awarded the Art Ross Trophy because he had scored more goals to The season still stands as the highest point total by a first year player in NHL history Gretzky became the youngest player to score goals but was not eligible for the Calder Memorial Trophy given to the top NHL rookie because of his previous year of WHA experience The Calder was instead awarded to Boston Bruins defenceman Ray Bourque br In his second season Gretzky won the Art Ross the first of seven consecutive with a then record points breaking both Bobby Orr s record for assists in a season and Phil Esposito s record for points in a season He won his second straight Hart Trophy In the first game of the Stanley Cup playoffs against the Montreal Canadiens Gretzky had five assists a single game playoff record br During the season Gretzky surpassed a record that had stood for years goals in games first set by Maurice Rocket Richard during the NHL season and tied by Mike Bossy during the NHL season Gretzky accomplished the feat in only games His th goal of the season came on December in the final seconds of a win against the Philadelphia Flyers and was his fifth of the game Later that season Gretzky broke Esposito s record for most goals in a season on February scoring three to help defeat the Buffalo Sabres He ended the season with records of goals assists and points in games becoming the only player in NHL history to break the two hundred point mark That year Gretzky became the first hockey player and first Canadian to be named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year He was also named Sportsman of the Year by Sports Illustrated The Canadian Press also named Gretzky Newsmaker of the Year in br The following seasons saw Gretzky break his assists record three more times in in and in he also bettered that mark assists in with and with and his point record one more time in By the time he finished playing in Edmonton he held or shared NHL records br The Edmonton Oilers finished first overall in their last WHA regular season The same success was not immediate when they joined the NHL but within four seasons the Oilers were competing for the Stanley Cup The Oilers were a young strong team featuring in addition to Gretzky future Hall of Famers including forwards Mark Messier Glenn Anderson and Jari Kurri defenceman Paul Coffey and goaltender Grant Fuhr Gretzky was its captain from to In they made it to the Stanley Cup Finals only to be swept by the three time defending champion New York Islanders The following season the Oilers met the Islanders in the Finals again this time winning the Stanley Cup their first of five in seven years br Gretzky was named an officer of the Order of Canada on June for outstanding contribution to the sport of hockey Since the Order ceremonies are always held during the hockey season it took years and months and two Governors General before he could accept the honour He was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada in for his continued contributions to the world of hockey notably as one of the best players of all time as well as for his social engagement as a philanthropist volunteer and role model for countless young people Five times between and Gretzky led the NHL in goals scored The Oilers also won the Stanley Cup with Gretzky three additional times in and br When the Oilers joined the NHL Gretzky continued to play under his personal services contract with Oilers owner Peter Pocklington This arrangement came under increased scrutiny by the mid s especially following reports that Pocklington had used the contract as collateral to help secure a million loan with the Alberta Treasury Branches Amid growing concern around the NHL that a financial institution might be able to lay claim to Gretzky s rights in the event the heavily leveraged Pocklington were to declare bankruptcy as well as growing dissatisfaction on the part of Gretzky and his advisers in Gretzky and Pocklington agreed to replace the personal services contract with a standard NHL contract br br br The Gretzky rule br In June as part of a package of five rule changes to be implemented for the season the NHL Board of Governors decided to introduce offsetting penalties where neither team lost a man when coincidental penalties were called The effect of calling offsetting penalties was felt immediately in the NHL because during the early s when the Gretzky era Oilers entered a four on four or three on three situation with an opponent they frequently used the space on the ice to score one or more goals A few days later during a press conference the day after being awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy Gretzky criticized the NHL for punishing teams and players who previously benefited The rule change became known as the Gretzky rule The rule was reversed for the season by which time a majority of the players from the all time powerhouse Edmonton Oilers the Oilers team the one most directly impacted by the June rule change was later voted the greatest NHL team ever as part of the NHL s centennial celebrations had changed teams or retired from hockey br br br Strategy and effect on NHL play br Gretzky had a major influence on the style of play of the Edmonton Oilers and the NHL as a whole helping to inspire a more team based strategy Using this approach the Oilers led by Gretzky became the highest scoring team in NHL history br br He was I think the first Canadian forward to play a true team game said hockey writer and former NHL goaltender Ken Dryden The focus of the game before Gretzky s arrival he said especially among the Canadian teams was on the player with the puck getting the puck to a star player who would make the big play Gretzky reversed that He knew he wasn t big enough strong enough or even fast enough to do what he wanted to do if others focused on him Like a magician he had to direct attention elsewhere to his four teammates on the ice with him to create a momentary distraction to move unnoticed into the open ice where size and strength didn t matter Gretzky made his opponents compete with five players not one and he made his teammates full partners in the game He made them skate to his level and pass and finish up to his level or they would be embarrassed br Between and the Edmonton Oilers averaged goals a season when no previous team had scored and Gretzky on his own had averaged points when no player before had scored more than in one year Dryden wrote in his book The Game In the past defenders and teams had learned to devise strategies to stop opponents with the puck To stop them without it that was interference But now if players without the puck skated just as hard as those with it but faster and dodged and darted to open ice just as determinedly but more effectively how did you shut them down br In this Gretzky added his considerable influence as the preeminent NHL star of his day to that of the Soviets who had also developed a more team style of play and had successfully used it against the best NHL teams beginning in the Summit Series The Soviets and Gretzky changed the NHL game says Dryden Gretzky the kid from Brantford with the Belarusian name was the acceptable face of Soviet hockey No Canadian kid wanted to play like Makarov or Larionov They all wanted to play like Gretzky br At the same time Gretzky recognized the contributions of their coach in the success of the Oilers Under the guidance of Glen Sather our Oiler teams became adept at generating speed developing finesse and learning a transition game with strong European influences br Gretzky explains his style of play further br br People think that to be a good player you have to pick the puck up deke around ninety three guys and take this ungodly slap shot No Let the puck do all the moving and you get yourself in the right place I don t care if you re Carl Lewis you can t out skate that little black thing Just move the puck give it up get it back give it up It s like Larry Bird The hardest work he does is getting open The jump shot is cake br That s all hockey is open ice That s my whole strategy Find Open Ice Chicago coach Mike Keenan said it best There s a spot on the ice that s no man s land and all the good goal scorers find it It s a piece of frozen real estate that s just in between the defense and the forward br br br The Trade br Two hours after the Oilers won the Stanley Cup in Gretzky learned from his father that the Oilers were planning to deal him to another team Walter Gretzky had known for months after having been tipped off by Skalbania but kept the news from Wayne so as not to upset him According to Walter Wayne was being shopped to Los Angeles Detroit and Vancouver and Pocklington needed money as his other business ventures were not doing well At first Gretzky did not want to leave Edmonton but he received a call while on his honeymoon from Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall who asked permission to meet and discuss the deal Gretzky informed McNall that his prerequisites for a deal to take place were that Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski join him as teammates in Los Angeles Both McNall and Pocklington quickly agreed After the details of the trade were finalized by the two owners one final condition had to be met Gretzky had to call Pocklington and request a trade When Pocklington told Oilers general manager and head coach Sather about his plans to trade Gretzky to Los Angeles Sather tried to stop the deal but when he found out that Gretzky had been involved in the negotiations he changed his attitude and requested Luc Robitaille in exchange The Kings refused instead offering Jimmy Carson br On August in a move that heralded significant change in the NHL the Oilers traded Gretzky along with McSorley and Krushelnyski to the rival Kings for Carson Martin G linas million in cash and the Kings first round draft picks in later traded to the New Jersey Devils who used it to select Jason Miller used to select Martin Ru insk and used to select Nick Stajduhar The Trade as it came to be known upset Canadians to the extent that New Democratic Party House Leader Nelson Riis demanded the government block it and Pocklington was burned in effigy outside Northlands Coliseum br In Gretzky s first appearance in Edmonton after the trade a game nationally televised in Canada he received a four minute standing ovation The arena was sold out and the attendance of was the Oilers biggest crowd ever to that date Large cheers erupted for his first shift his first touch of the puck his two assists and Mark Messier s body check of Gretzky into the boards After the game Gretzky took the opportunity to confirm his patriotism I m still proud to be a Canadian I didn t desert my country I moved because I was traded and that s where my job is But I m Canadian to the core I hope Canadians understand that After the season a life sized bronze statue of Gretzky was erected outside Northlands Coliseum holding the Stanley Cup over his head br br br Los Angeles Kings br br The Kings named Gretzky their alternate captain He made an immediate impact on the ice scoring on his first shot on goal in the first regular season game The Kings got off to their best start ever winning four straight en route to qualifying for the playoffs For only the second time in his NHL career Gretzky finished second in scoring but narrowly edged the Pittsburgh Penguins Mario Lemieux who scored points for the Hart Trophy as MVP br Despite being underdogs against the defending Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers in the Smythe Division semifinals Gretzky led the Kings to a shocking upset of his old squad spearheading the Kings return from a series deficit to win the series He was nervous Edmonton would greet him with boos but they were eagerly waiting for him The Kings were then swept by the Calgary Flames who went on to win their first Stanley Cup br In the Associated Press named Gretzky Male Athlete of the Decade For the second year in a row the Kings eliminated the defending champions in the first round when they defeated the Flames in six games but also for the second year in a row their season ended in a second round sweep this time at the hands of Gretzky s former team The Oilers went on to win their fifth Cup and first without Gretzky In his post championship interview Messier who had replaced Gretzky as Edmonton s captain following the trade dedicated the Oilers Cup win to him br Gretzky s first season in Los Angeles saw a marked increase in attendance and fan interest in a city not previously known for following hockey The Kings now boasted of numerous sellouts Many credit Gretzky s arrival with putting non traditional American hockey markets on the NHL map not only did California receive two more NHL franchises the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and San Jose Sharks during Gretzky s tenure in Los Angeles but his popularity in Southern California proved to be an impetus in the league establishing teams in other parts of the U S Sun Belt br Gretzky was sidelined for much of the regular season with a back injury he returned on January which was also his th NHL game and his point output ended a record year streak in which he recorded at least points each season However he performed well in the playoffs notably when he scored a hat trick in game seven of the Campbell Conference Finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs This victory propelled the Kings into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history where they faced the Montreal Canadiens After winning the first game of the series by a score of the team lost the next three games in overtime and then fell in the deciding fifth game where Gretzky failed to get a shot on net br The next season Gretzky broke Gordie Howe s career goal scoring record of and won the scoring title but the team began a long slide and despite numerous player and coaching moves they failed to qualify for the playoffs again until After the financially troubled McNall was forced to sell the Kings in Gretzky s relationship with the Kings new owners grew strained Under both McNall and the new ownership group the team was fiscally unstable to the point that paychecks to players bounced Finally in early Gretzky requested a trade During the NHL lock out Gretzky and some friends including Mark Messier Marty McSorley Brett Hull and Steve Yzerman formed the Ninety Nine All Stars Tour and played eight exhibition games in various countries br br br St Louis Blues br On February Gretzky joined the St Louis Blues in a trade for Patrice Tardif Roman Vopat Craig Johnson and two draft picks Peter Hogan and Matt Zultek He partially orchestrated the trade after reports surfaced that he was unhappy in Los Angeles At the time of the trade the Blues and New York Rangers emerged as front runners but the Blues met his salary demands Gretzky was immediately named the team s captain He scored points in games for the team in the regular season and the playoffs and the Blues came within one game of the Conference Finals br However the chemistry everyone expected with winger Brett Hull never developed Gretzky was also forced to endure public criticism from his head coach for the first time in his career Long before either he or Gretzky joined the Blues Mike Keenan had refused to moderate his coaching style even while coaching Gretzky with Team Canada during international tournaments Gretzky s professional relationship with Keenan was thus never particularly warm and the coach s public rebukes effectively ended any realistic prospect of Gretzky remaining in St Louis once he became a free agent Gretzky rejected a three year deal worth million with the Blues and on July signed with the New York Rangers as a free agent rejoining longtime Oilers teammate Mark Messier and former Kings teammate Luc Robitaille for a two year million plus incentives contract br br br New York Rangers br br Gretzky ended his professional playing career with the New York Rangers where he played his final three seasons and helped the team reach the Eastern Conference Finals in The Rangers were defeated in the Conference Finals in five games by the Philadelphia Flyers despite Gretzky leading the Rangers in the playoffs with goals and assists For the first time in his NHL career Gretzky was not named captain except for a brief period as acting captain in when captain Brian Leetch was injured and out of the line up After the season Mark Messier signed a free agent contract with the Vancouver Canucks ending the brief reunion of Messier and Gretzky after just one season The playoff run was Gretzky s last as a player and Rangers did not return to the playoffs until well after Gretzky retired Along with Jaromir Jagr he topped the NHL in with assists It was the th time in seasons that Gretzky earned at least a share of the league lead in the statistic br In before his retirement The Hockey News named a committee of hockey experts former NHL players past and present writers broadcasters coaches and hockey executives to select and rank the greatest players in NHL history The experts voted Gretzky number one Gretzky said he would have voted Bobby Orr or Gordie Howe as the best of all time br The season was his last as a professional player He reached one milestone in this last season breaking the professional total regular season and playoffs goal scoring record of which Gordie Howe had held Gretzky was having difficulty scoring this season and finished with only nine goals contributing to this being the only season in which he failed to average at least a point per game but his last goal brought his scoring total for his combined NHL WHA career to one more than Howe As the season wound down there was media speculation that Gretzky would retire but he refused to announce his retirement His last NHL game in Canada was on April a tie with the Ottawa Senators and the Rangers second to last game of the season Following the contest in a departure from the usual three stars announcement Gretzky was awarded all three stars Upon returning to New York Gretzky announced he would retire after the Rangers last game of the season br The final game of Gretzky s career was a overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on April in Madison Square Garden Although the game involved two American teams both national anthems were played with the lyrics slightly adjusted to accommodate Gretzky s departure In place of the lyrics O Canada we stand on guard for thee Bryan Adams ad libbed We re going to miss you Wayne Gretzky The Star Spangled Banner as sung by John Amirante was altered to include the words in the land of Wayne Gretzky Gretzky ended his career with a final point assisting on the lone New York goal scored by Brian Leetch At the time of his retirement Gretzky was the second to last WHA player still active in professional hockey Mark Messier who attended the game along with other representatives of the Edmonton Oilers dynasty was the last br br br International play br br Gretzky made his first international appearance as a member of the Canadian national junior team at the World Junior Championships in Montreal Quebec The Canadian coach Punch McLean was originally skeptical of Gretzky s ability as he was the youngest player to compete in the tournament at the age of He went on to lead the tournament in scoring with points to earn All Star Team and Best Forward honours His points remain the most scored by a year old in the World Junior Championships Canada finished with the bronze medal br Gretzky debuted with the Canadian national team at the Canada Cup He led the tournament in scoring with points en route to a second place finish to the Soviet Union losing in the final Seven months later Gretzky joined Team Canada for the World Championships in Finland He notched points in games including a two goal two assist effort in Canada s final game against Sweden to earn the bronze Gretzky did not win his first international competition until the Canada Cup when Canada defeated Sweden in a best of three finals He led the tournament in scoring for the second consecutive time and was named to the All Star Team br Gretzky s international career highlight arguably came three years later at the Canada Cup Gretzky has called the tournament the best hockey he has played in his life Playing on a line with Pittsburgh Penguins superstar Mario Lemieux he recorded a tournament best points in nine games After losing the first game of a best of three final series against the Soviets Gretzky propelled Canada with a five assist performance in the second game including the game winning pass to Lemieux in overtime to extend the tournament In the deciding game three Gretzky and Lemieux once again combined for the game winner With the score tied and minutes to go in regulation Lemieux one timed a pass from Gretzky on a on with defenceman Larry Murphy Lemieux scored to win the tournament for Canada the play is widely regarded as one of the most memorable plays in Canadian international competition br The Canada Cup marked the last time the tournament was played under the Canada Cup moniker Gretzky led the tournament for the fourth and final time with points in seven games He did not however compete in the final against the United States due to a back injury Canada nevertheless won in two games by scores of and Five years later the tournament was revived and renamed the World Cup in It marked the first time Gretzky did not finish as the tournament s leading scorer his seven points in eight games placed him fourth overall br Leading up to the Winter Olympics in Nagano Japan it was announced that NHL players would be eligible to play for the first time Gretzky was named to the club on November However Gretzky was passed over for the captaincy along with several other Canadian veterans including Steve Yzerman and Ray Bourque in favour of the younger Eric Lindros Expectations were high for the Canadian team but the team lost to the Czech Republic in the semi finals The game went to a shootout with a tie after overtime but Gretzky was controversially not selected by coach Marc Crawford as one of the five shooters all of whom failed to score Team Canada then lost the bronze medal game to Finland to finish without a medal The Olympics marked Gretzky s eighth and final international appearance finishing with four assists in six games He retired from international play holding the records for most goals most assists and most overall points in best on best hockey br br br Skills and influences br br br Style of play br br Gretzky s size and strength were unimpressive in fact far below average for the NHL but he is widely considered the smartest player in the history of the game His reading of the game and his ability to improvise on the fly were unrivaled and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time His coach at the Edmonton Oilers Glen Sather said He was so much more intelligent While they were using all this energy trying to rattle his teeth he was just skating away circling analyzing things br He was also considered one of the most creative players in hockey You never knew what he was going to do said hockey Hall of Famer Igor Larionov He was improvising all the time Every time he took the ice there was some spontaneous decision he would make That s what made him such a phenomenal player Gretzky s ability to improvise came into the spotlight at the Olympics in Japan Then an older player in the sunset of his career he had been passed over for the captaincy of the team But as the series continued his unique skills made him a team leader br br The Canadians had trouble with the big ice They had trouble with the European patterns and the lateral play and the endless inventive cycling Slowly as game after game went by and the concern continued to rise Wayne Gretzky began climbing through the line up He almost alone among the Canadians seemed to take to the larger ice surface as if it offered more opportunity instead of obligation His playing time soared as he was being sent on not just for power plays but double shifts and even penalty kills By the final round it was Wayne Gretzky who assumed the leadership both on and off the ice br br He passed and shot with prodigious skill Hall of Fame defenceman Bobby Orr said of Gretzky He passes better than anybody I ve ever seen In his first two seasons in the NHL his deft passing skills helped earn him a reputation as an ace playmaker and so opposing defencemen focused their efforts on foiling his attempts to pass the puck to other scorers In response Gretzky started shooting on goal himself and with exceptional effectiveness He had a fast and accurate shot Wayne Gretzky was one of the most accurate scorers in NHL history said one biography Statistics support the contention whereas Phil Esposito who had set the previous goal scoring record needed shots to score goals Gretzky netted his th after only shots about half as many He scored his all time single season record of goals with just shots Because he was so light compared to other players goalies were often surprised by how hard Gretzky s shot was Goalies called his shots sneaky fast He also had a way of never shooting the puck with the same rhythm twice making his shots harder to time and block br Veteran Canadian journalist Peter Gzowski wrote that Gretzky seemed to be able to slow down time There is an unhurried grace to everything Gretzky does on the ice Winding up for the slapshot he will stop for an almost imperceptible moment at the top of his arc like a golfer with a rhythmic swing Gretzky uses this room to insert an extra beat into his actions In front of the net eyeball to eyeball with the goaltender he will hold the puck one extra instant upsetting the anticipated rhythm of the game extending the moment He distorts time and not only by slowing it down Sometimes he will release the puck before he appears to be ready threading the pass through a maze of players precisely to the blade of a teammate s stick or finding a chink in a goaltender s armour and slipping the puck into it before the goaltender is ready to react br Commentators have noted Gretzky s uncanny ability to judge the position of the other players on the ice so much so that many suspected he enjoyed some kind of extrasensory perception that he played like he had eyes in the back of his head Gretzky said he sensed other players more than he saw them I get a feeling about where a teammate is going to be he said A lot of times I can turn and pass without even looking Gretzky explained that what appeared to be instinct was in large part the effect of his relentless study and practice of the game in co operation with his coaches As a result he developed a deep understanding of its shifting patterns and dynamics Gzowski said that Gretzky understood the game so well that he could instantly recognize and capitalize upon emerging patterns of play What we take to be creative genius is in fact a reaction to a situation that he has stored in his brain as deeply and firmly as his
