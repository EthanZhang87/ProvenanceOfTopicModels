African Americans from Middle Tennessee fled as refugees to Union lines they were housed in contraband camps around military installations in Nashville s eastern western and southern borders The Battle of Nashville December was a significant Union victory and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war it was also the war s final major military action in which Tennessee regiments played a large part on both sides of the battle Afterward the Confederates conducted a war of attrition making guerrilla raids and engaging in small skirmishes Confederate forces in the Deep South were almost constantly in retreat br In three years after the end of the Civil War the Nashville chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded by Confederate veteran John W Morton He was reported to have initiated General Nathan Bedford Forrest into the white sepremacist organization The latter became Grand Wizard of the organization which had chapters of this secret insurgent group

referendum was held in on the issue of consolidating city and county government It failed to gain approval although it was supported by the then elected leaders of both jurisdictions County Judge Beverly Briley and Mayor Ben West br Following the referendum s failure Nashville annexed some square miles of suburban jurisdictions to expand its tax base This increased uncertainty among residents and created resentment among many suburban communities Under the second charter for metropolitan government which was approved in two levels of service provision were proposed the General Services District and the Urban Services District to provide for a differential in tax levels Residents of the Urban Services District had a full range of city services The areas that made up the General Services District however had a lower tax rate until full services were provided This helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region
