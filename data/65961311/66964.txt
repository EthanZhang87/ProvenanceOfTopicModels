the Penguins Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL s Pittsburgh Pirates from to and of the American Hockey League s Pittsburgh Hornets franchise from to with a short break from to In the spring of Jack McGregor a state senator from Kittanning Pennsylvania began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh The senator formed a group of local investors that included H J Heinz Company heir H J Heinz III Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney and the Mellon family s Richard Mellon Scaife The projected league expansion depended on securing votes from the then current NHL owners to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D Norris owner of the Chicago Black Hawks and his brother Bruce Norris owner of the Detroit Red Wings The effort was successful and on February the National Hockey League awarded an expansion team to Pittsburgh for the season The Penguins paid million million today for their entry and million today more for start up costs The Civic Arena s capacity was boosted from to to meet the NHL requirements for expansion The Pens also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL s Board of Governors br br A contest was held where of entries picked Penguins as the team s nickname sharing its nickname with the athletic department of the newly named Youngstown State University in nearby Youngstown Ohio Youngstown is part of the Penguins territorial rights to this day though they did briefly share them with the Cleveland Barons in the mid s Mark Peters had the winning entry which was inspired because the team was to play in the Igloo the nickname of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena a logo was chosen that had a penguin in front of a triangle which symbolized the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh The Penguins first general manager Jack Riley opened the first pre season camp for the franchise in Brantford Ontario on September playing the franchise s first exhibition match in Brantford against the Philadelphia Flyers on September Restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing Original Six teams hampered the Pens along with the rest of the expansion teams Beyond aging sniper Andy Bathgate all star defenseman Leo Boivin who had begun his professional career with the Hornets and New York Rangers veteran Earl Ingarfield a cast of former minor leaguers largely manned the first Penguins team Several players played for the Hornets the previous season Bathgate wingers Val Fonteyne and Ab McDonald and goaltenders Hank Bassen and Joe Daley George Sullivan was named the head coach for the club s first two seasons and McDonald was named the team s first captain br On October league president Clarence Campbell and McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins opening home game against the Montreal Canadiens On October they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team as they defeated the Chicago Black Hawks However the Penguins went and finished in fifth place in the West Division missing the playoffs and ending with the third worst record in the league The team s best player proved to be longtime Cleveland Barons AHL goaltender Les Binkley who recorded a goals against average and was second in the league with six shutouts Defensive winger Ken Schinkel won the team s sole league honor being named to represent the Penguins in the NHL All Star Game Bathgate led the team in scoring with points but retired at season s end McDonald who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring was also gone at season s end traded to the St Louis Blues in exchange for center Lou Angotti br The next season saw the team slip in the standings amid a sharp drop in form by Binkley into sixth place and with the league s worst record Several changes were made to improve the team resulting in Boivin and several others being traded and new players including longtime future Pens star Jean Pronovost making their debuts No captain was named to replace McDonald the team went with four alternate captains br br br Triumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere br br In the draft the Penguins selected Michel Briere who although being chosen th was soon drawing comparisons to Phil Esposito and Bobby Clarke Joining the team in November he finished as the second place rookie scorer in the NHL behind Bobby Clarke with points th overall and third on the Penguins Briere placed second in Calder Memorial Trophy voting for Rookie of the Year honors behind Chicago goaltender Tony Esposito Briere led Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the Pirates The Penguins defeated the Oakland Seals in a four game sweep in the quarterfinals with Briere scoring the series clinching goal in overtime In the semi final round defending conference champions St Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games Briere led the team in playoff scoring recording five goals including three game winners and eight points Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics On May Briere was in a car crash in his native Quebec suffering brain trauma and slipping into a coma from which he would never recover he died a year later His number jersey was never reissued remaining out of circulation until it was formally retired in br In the season the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a record the fourth worst record in the league Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in only to be swept by the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round Except for a handful of players like Ken Schinkel Pronovost Syl Apps Jr Keith McCreary agitator Bryan Watson and goaltender Les Binkley talent was thin but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both and br The Penguins battled the California Golden Seals for the division cellar in when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced by Jack Button Button obtained Steve Durbano Ab DeMarco Bob Battleship Kelly and Bob Paradise through trades The personnel moves proved successful and the team improved to a record although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth br However in early the Penguins creditors demanded payment of back debts forcing the team into bankruptcy The doors to the team s offices were padlocked and it looked like the Penguins would fold or relocate Around the same time rumors began circulating that the Penguins and the California Golden Seals were to be relocated to Seattle and Denver respectively the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the season Through the intervention of a group that included former Minnesota North Stars head coach Wren Blair the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh eventually being bought by shopping mall magnate Edward J DeBartolo Sr br br br Playoff runs and a uniform change br br Beginning in the mid s Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs led by the likes of the Century Line of Syl Apps Lowell MacDonald and Jean Pronovost They nearly reached the Stanley Cup semi finals in but were ousted from the playoffs by the New York Islanders in one of the only four best of seven game series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none As the s wore on a mediocre team defense neutralized the Penguins success beyond the regular season Baz Bastien a former coach and general manager of the AHL s Hornets later became general manager The Penguins missed the playoffs in Bastien traded prime draft picks for several players whose best years were already behind them and the team would suffer in the early s as a result The decade closed with a playoff appearance in and a rousing opening series win over the Buffalo Sabres before a second round sweep at the hands of the Boston Bruins br The Penguins began the s by changing their team colors in January the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present day scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh s other sports teams the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers as well as the Flag of Pittsburgh Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades and both had enjoyed world championship seasons The Bruins protested this color change claiming a monopoly on black and gold but the Penguins defended their choice stating that the NHL Pirates also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburgh s traditional sporting colors The NHL agreed and Pittsburgh could use black and gold The Penguins officially debuted the black and gold uniform in a game against the St Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January On the ice the Penguins began the s with defenseman Randy Carlyle and prolific scorers Paul Gardner and Mike Bullard but little else br During the early part of the decade the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higher seeded opponents in the playoffs In the th seeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their first round playoff series The following season as the th seed they lost the decisive game of their first round series in overtime to the heavily favored St Louis Blues Then in the playoffs the Penguins held a lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions the New York Islanders However the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal by John Tonelli who had tied the game before It would be the Pens final playoff appearance until br br br Lemieux Jagr era br br The team had the league s worst record in both the and seasons With the team suffering financial problems it seemed the Penguins would either fold or relocate Mario Lemieux one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history was due to be drafted in the NHL Entry Draft Heading towards the end of the season ahead of the New Jersey Devils who were placed last the Penguins made several questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the short term They posted three six game winless streaks in the last games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests from Devils management Pittsburgh head coach Lou Angotti later admitted that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with the worst record saying in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette that a mid season lunch prompted the plan because there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted Other teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall Lemieux paid dividends right away scoring on his first ever shot of his first ever NHL shift in his first NHL game However the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival In the late s the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast trading for superstar defenseman Paul Coffey from the Edmonton Oilers after the Oilers Stanley Cup win and bringing in young talent like scorers Kevin Stevens Rob Brown and John Cullen from the minors The team finally acquired a top flight goaltender with the acquisition of Tom Barrasso from Buffalo All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Pens but the team struggled to make the playoffs The Pens missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game In they missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify In for the second time in a row the Penguins missed the playoffs by one game br In Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals assists and points On December Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game even strength shorthanded penalty shot power play and empty net The Pens shocked the New York Rangers in a four game sweep in the first round however the Philadelphia Flyers halted their progress in the second round The seven game defeat featured Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game br br br Golden Age br A herniated disc in Lemieux s back cut short his season although he still amassed points However the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture They opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the off season Free agent signings Bryan Trottier and trades Joe Mullen Larry Murphy Ron Francis and Ulf Samuelsson played a major part in this Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted Jaromir Jagr with the fifth overall pick in the NHL Entry Draft The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West Jagr became the Penguins second franchise player and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent br The roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the Stanley Cup Finals in six games punctuated by an victory in the deciding game the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over years After the Stanley Cup Finals the Penguins met with President George H W Bush the first NHL team ever to visit the White House The following season the team lost coach Bob Johnson to cancer and Scotty Bowman took over as coach Under Bowman they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in br Cancer revisited the Penguins in when Lemieux was tragically diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma Only two months after the diagnosis missing out of games he came back to win his fourth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion with points edging out Pat LaFontaine and Adam Oates Despite the off ice difficulties Pittsburgh finished with a record the franchise s best regular season ever winning the Presidents Trophy After Lemieux s return the team played better than it ever had before winning an NHL record consecutive games Despite all of this success the New York Islanders eliminated them in the second round of Game in overtime br The Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the s The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards Alexei Kovalev Martin Straka Aleksey Morozov Robert Lang and Petr Nedved and defensemen Sergei Zubov Darius Kasparaitis and Kevin Hatcher Despite the departure of many of the franchise s Stanley Cup winning roster the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in where they lost to the Washington Capitals in six games the second round in where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games and the conference finals in where they lost to the Florida Panthers in seven games The playoffs marked a turning point as the Penguins suffered a first round elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games br br br Lemieux s retirement and return br br On April the franchise was rocked when Mario Lemieux citing ongoing health concerns and his disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated announced he would retire at the conclusion of the playoffs Lemieux was so respected in the NHL and his achievements over the course of his career were so great that he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the year he retired the three year waiting period being waived His departure was the first in a series of events that would once again lead the Penguins into regular season stagnation and to the brink of financial ruin br The Montreal Canadiens eliminated the team in the first round of the playoffs in despite being the second seeded team in the East The following year their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games In the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals in the first round only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers in the second round br By this time the lofty contracts handed out during the early s were catching up with the Penguins At one point the team owed over million to numerous creditors leading then owners Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win to ask the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills When the deferred salaries finally came due combined with other financial pressures the Penguins were forced to file for Chapter bankruptcy in November br Lemieux then stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy The Penguins owed Lemieux million in deferred salary making him the team s largest individual creditor He proposed recovering this money by converting it into equity enough to give him controlling interest He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh The NHL and the courts agreed and Lemieux with help from supermarket tycoon Ronald Burkle assumed control on September saving the franchise for the second time br Lemieux again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player On December Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in months officially becoming the first player owner in NHL history Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the playoffs highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in Game of the second round Darius Kasparaitis scored the series clinching goal to advance the Penguins to the Eastern Conference Finals where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils br br br Rebuilding br br The Penguins attendance had dwindled in the late s In the club had an average attendance of at home games the lowest it had been since Lemieux s rookie year Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in years in finishing in a tie for third to last in their conference The following season they finished second last In the NHL Entry Draft the Penguins selected goaltender Marc Andre Fleury with the first overall pick br The season was an ordeal with Lemieux missing all but regular season games with a hip injury and attendance dipping to an average of the lowest average of any NHL team with just one sellout As the season progressed the Penguins signed new head coach and former Penguins player and commentator Eddie Olczyk and opted not to include Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the season This culminated in the worst record in the NHL with the team winning just games As in the s the Penguins struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL Entry Draft classes that would yield multiple world class talents The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the NHL Entry Draft Alexander Ovechkin which went to the Washington Capitals However Ovechkin s countryman center Evgeni Malkin was similarly highly regarded and Pittsburgh took him with the second overall pick However a transfer dispute between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF delayed his Pittsburgh debut br By this point the Penguins had collapsed financially since the Stanley Cup winning years of the early s Their home venue the Civic Arena had become the oldest arena in the NHL and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the city for a new facility With Pittsburgh uninterested in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins Lemieux began looking into the possibilities of selling or relocating the team to Kansas City Missouri A lockout prompted the cancellation of the NHL season One of the many reasons for the lockout included disagreements on resolving the financial struggles of teams like the Penguins and the Ottawa Senators which had filed for bankruptcy protection During the lockout the Penguins players dispersed between the club s American Hockey League AHL affiliate the Wilkes Barre Scranton Penguins and to European leagues br br br Crosby Malkin era present br br With the lockout resolved in the NHL organized an unprecedented draft lottery to set the NHL Entry Draft selection order The draft lottery which was held behind closed doors in a secure location resulted in the Penguins being awarded the first overall pick Quebec Major Junior Hockey League QMJHL superstar Sidney Crosby who had been training with Lemieux over the summer was the consensus first overall pick with many referring to the draft lottery process as The Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes The Penguins selected Crosby on July with the top pick instantly rekindling interest in hockey in Pittsburgh br The Penguins began rebuilding the team under the salary cap However Evgeni Malkin the Penguins draft pick could not report to Pittsburgh immediately because of a playing rights dispute with the Russian Superleague The addition of Crosby paid instant dividends with attendance rising by approximately per game on average in the season However Crosby s presence did not immediately translate into wins as the team began the season with a long winless skid that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to Michel Therrien Then on January Lemieux announced his second retirement after developing an irregular heartbeat this time permanently He finished as the NHL s seventh all time scorer eighth in goals and tenth in assists and with the second highest career points per game average which is second to Wayne Gretzky s br Despite the team s struggles Crosby established himself as a star in the league amassing points in his debut season and finishing second to Alexander Ovechkin for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded each year to the league s top rookie In the Penguins final game of the season Crosby tallied a goal and an assist to become the top scoring rookie in Penguin history eclipsing Lemieux The Penguins again posted the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the highest goals against total in the League They received the second overall draft pick their fourth top two pick in four years in the NHL Entry Draft and selected touted two way forward Jordan Staal The team announced on April they would not renew the contract for general manager Craig Patrick who had been the general manager since December On May Ray Shero signed a five year contract as general manager br br br Runner up and third Stanley Cup title br br Change came for the Penguins on October when Evgeni Malkin made his NHL debut He set the modern NHL record with a goal in each of his first six games Malkin would record points in consecutive games The Penguins finished the season in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with a record of totaling points only two points behind the Atlantic Division winners the New Jersey Devils It was the franchise s first point season in years and represented an enormous point leap from the previous season In the first round of the playoffs the eventual Stanley Cup runners up the Ottawa Senators defeated the Penguins At the season s end rookies Malkin and Jordan Staal were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded to the Rookie of the Year which Malkin won br On March Pennsylvania s Governor Ed Rendell Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Mario Lemieux of the Penguins ownership group announced an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long sought arena The state of the art multi purpose facility the Consol Energy Center guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in the city of Pittsburgh Following the announcement of the plan the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team On June a million bond was issued and the Penguins signed a year lease on September binding them to the city of Pittsburgh through br After a mediocre start to the season Crosby and starting goaltender Marc Andre Fleury were both injured long term due to high right ankle sprains In their absence the team flourished because of the play and leadership of Malkin On April the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title their first division title in years with a win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers Malkin finished the season with points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years beating Ottawa defeating the New York Rangers and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers to clinch the Prince of Wales Trophy Pittsburgh lost the Stanley Cup Finals

and assists in games for the playoff scoring lead br br In the season Malkin won the Art Ross and was again a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy Crosby finished third in League scoring with goals and assists for points despite missing five games The Penguins record dipped mid season but lifted after Dan Bylsma replaced head coach Therrien The effect was almost instantaneous and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home ice advantage in their first round match up against the Philadelphia Flyers whom the Penguins defeated in six games It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals where they eliminated the Carolina Hurricanes in a four game sweep After defeating the Hurricanes the Penguins earned their

Rutherford s first action as general manager was to fire head coach Dan Bylsma and on June he announced that Mike Johnston was hired as Bylsma s replacement In the season the Penguins led the

remained skeptical John Steigerwald brother of former Penguins broadcaster Paul Steigerwald noted in his autobiography that upon his arrival at KDKA TV from WTAE TV in the station cared more about the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League than the Penguins However Lemieux s play steadily grew the fanbase in the area which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade br Today the Penguins are one of the NHL s most popular teams especially among American non Original Six franchises and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh s three major professional sports teams taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and
