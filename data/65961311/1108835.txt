The District of North Vancouver is a district municipality in British Columbia Canada and is part of Metro Vancouver It surrounds the City of North Vancouver on three sides It is largely characterized as a relatively quiet affluent suburban hub home to many middle and upper middle class families Homes in the District of North Vancouver generally range from mid sized family bungalows to very large luxury houses A number of dense multi family and mixed use developments have popped up across the district in recent years however the district remains a primarily suburban municipality It is served by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police British Columbia Ambulance Service and the District of North Vancouver Fire Department br br br History br br For thousands of years the Indigenous Squamish and their kin Tsleil Waututh of the Coast Salish resided in the land known as North Vancouver Slightly over years ago the people of the Squamish and Tsleil Waututh living on the North Shore had their first glimpse of Europeans First the Spanish arrived giving their name to Vancouver s Spanish Banks and in Captain George Vancouver explored the local shores But it was not until that the first attempt was made to harvest the North Shore s rich stands of timber leading to fuller settlement of the area that would later become North Vancouver br The first industry on the North Shore was Pioneer Mills founded in to log the huge trees of the coastal rainforest After twice changing hands the operation was bought by Sewell Sue Prescott Moody in Near where the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool grain elevators now stand the town of Moodyville grew up and stood as the main centre of activity on the North Shore until the mill closed in The first school was established in Moodyville The second Central School opened in in a building that still stands as part of what is now Presentation House at rd Street and Chesterfield Avenue the current home of the North Vancouver Museum and Archives br In the first municipality on the North Shore was formed as the District of North Vancouver It stretched across the North Shore from Horseshoe Bay to Deep Cove but omitted Moodyville In the early years of the th century a real estate boom took place with speculators including the British poet Rudyard Kipling eager to turn a quick dollar A new community began to take shape In the Hotel North Vancouver was built in the first bank a branch of the Bank of North America opened A newspaper the Express commenced publication in and in the British Columbia Electric Railway began streetcar service br Industry particularly shipbuilding became central with the nearby stands of trees a rich resource for a society in which ships houses and most other manmade things were constructed mainly of wood The Wallace Shipyards moved in to the area just east of Lonsdale Avenue drawn by the arrival of electricity Over the years this company later known as Burrard Dry Dock and then Versatile Pacific Shipyards became a major force in the local economy Many of the shipyard s buildings still stand although the company has now ceased operations br Economic prosperity and rapid growth in the Lower Lonsdale area of North Vancouver led to the establishment in of the separate City of North Vancouver with a population of approximately West Vancouver separated from the district in Apart from the addition of Moodyville in the boundaries of the city have not changed even though far more people now call the district home br Communications with Vancouver have always been an important factor in the development of the North Shore The first ferry service was supplied by Navvy Jack s rowboat in In the Sea Foam established a regular ferry service that continued until The SeaBus re established water transportation in Rail service was slower in developing While the Pacific Great Eastern Railway inaugurated a mile run from North Vancouver to Whytecliff Park in it was not until the completion of the first Second Narrows Bridge in that rail and road links with the Lower Mainland supplemented the local ferry service br Early plans for North Vancouver were ambitious However early grandiose plans met with a number of setbacks The real estate boom was overtaken by a worldwide depression in and then World War I delayed many projects The depression that began in coupled with disruptions to communications over the Second Narrows caused by ships colliding with the bridge led to economic difficulties and severe tax shortfalls Both the city and the district were placed in receivership in But the opening of the second road crossing the Lions Gate Bridge in was a significant factor in making the North Shore more accessible And the war years led to an economic revival of North Vancouver especially because of the many ships built in the Burrard Dry Dock at the foot of Lonsdale for the Canadian war effort br In the postwar years the city and the District of North Vancouver boomed with most of the growth taking place in the district because of its greater land resources br Since there have been proposals to amalgamate the District of North Vancouver with the City of North Vancouver into a single North Vancouver Surveys have shown that the majority of the municipalities residents support the idea and many do not even know that the city and the district are separate entities br br
