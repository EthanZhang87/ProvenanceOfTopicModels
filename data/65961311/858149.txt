The Regina Leader Post is the daily newspaper of Regina Saskatchewan Canada and a member of the Postmedia Network br br br Founding br The newspaper was first published as The Leader in by Nicholas Flood Davin soon after Edgar Dewdney Lieutenant Governor of the North West Territories decided to name the vacant and featureless site of Pile O Bones renamed Regina by Princess Louise Duchess of Argyll the wife of the Governor General of Canada as territorial capital rather than the previously established Battleford Troy and Fort Qu Appelle presumably because he had acquired ample land on the site for resale br A group of prominent citizens approached lawyer Nicholas Flood Davin soon after his arrival in Regina and urged him to set up a newspaper Davin accepted their offer and their in seed money The Regina Leader printed its first edition on March Published weekly by the mercurial Davin it almost immediately achieved national prominence during the North West Rebellion and the subsequent trial of Louis Riel Davin had immediate access to the developing story and his scoops were picked up by the national press and briefly brought the Leader to national prominence br Davin s greatest coup was sending his reporter Mary McFadyen Maclean to conduct a jailhouse interview with Riel Maclean obtained this by masquerading as a francophone Catholic cleric and interviewing Riel in French under the nose of uncomprehending anglophone watch house guards br br br Growth and absorbing competitors br br Having begun with a small wooden shack before Regina had full streets or electricity and plumbing outside Government House The Leader soon moved to a substantial office building on the southwest corner of Hamilton Street and th Avenue one block east of what was then the post office southwest across street from City Hall Also around this time it was acquired by the Sifton family It then moved to a multi story building across Hamilton Street to the south of the Simpson s department store It ultimately relocated in the s to east city outskirts on Park Street at Victoria Avenue where it still remains br br In the Leader merged with another paper the Regina Evening Post itself in a building on Twelfth Avenue at Rose Street before the merger and continued to publish daily editions of both before consolidating them under the title The Leader Post in In the paper launched one of the oldest radio stations in Canada CKCK Five years later the company was purchased by the Sifton family which launched CKCK TV Saskatchewan s first television station in br Newspapers were a thriving industry in the days through television s arrival in the s until the Internet in the s began to change people s gathering of news compounded by the merger of local companies into ownership of local companies by national multi corporation organizations Other titles absorbed by the Leader Post included the Regina Daily Star and The Province br In the Leader Post released an electronic version of the newspaper so that subscribers could view their newspapers on the Internet Electronic and daily print subscribers also enjoy access to extra content not available to all

Ontario Armadale group by Hollinger Inc a company that was headed by the Canadian media baron Conrad Black Within three months the staffs at each newspaper had been cut by one quarter which becoming a cause c l bre in Canadian journalism The event with substantial elimination of staff and coverage of local news corresponded with one at the Regina television station CKCK DT once locally owned but by no longer so br An immediate effect was a significant reduction in coverage of local and provincial news and a greater coverage of national events Loss of news reporter staff the increasing television news coverage and the arrival and growth of the internet all increased difficulty in preserving much less increasing the Leader Post s significance br Black s company subsequently divested itself of the Leader Post in together with most other Canadian news media it had owned in conjunction with Black s renunciation of his Canadian citizenship to obtain a British peerage br Eventually branding itself as the Regina Leader Post the newspaper shut down its printing facilities in in favor of being printed in Saskatoon with the press of The StarPhoenix In Postmedia announced that the StarPhoenix
