id: 3247833
The injured reserve list abbr IR list is a designation used in North American professional sports leagues for athletes who suffer injuries and become unable to play The exact name of the list varies by league it is known as injured reserve in the National Football League NFL and National Hockey League NHL the injured list in the Canadian Football League CFL and the injured list historically known as the disabled list in Major League Baseball MLB The National Basketball Association NBA does not have a direct analog to an injured reserve list instead using a more general purpose inactive list that does not require a player to be injured br Injured reserve lists are used because the rules of these leagues allow for only a certain numbers of players on each team s roster Designating a player as Injured Reserve frees up a roster spot enabling the team to add a new replacement player during the injured athlete s convalescence Injured reserve can be for serious injuries or illnesses br br br NHL rules br A player may be placed on injured reserve if he is unable to participate due to illness or injury provided that the player had passed the club s initial physical examination at the start of the season To qualify for the IR due to injury that injury must be sufficient in the opinion of the team s medical staff to render the player unable to participate for the seven days following that injury Once placed on IR the team may then replace the player on their roster The player on IR may not return to active play for seven days although they may participate in non competitive events such as practice meetings etc br br br NFL rules br A team may place a player on injured reserve reserve injured list who is not immediately available for participation with a club Generally these players may not practice or return to the active roster for the rest of the season including postseason games or the Pro Bowl in which they are placed on injured reserve but are allowed to be with the team br Starting in the NFL and the NFLPA reached an agreement allowing one player placed on injured reserve to be brought back to the active roster Provided that the player was on the final man preseason roster a rule exempted for the season and that the injury was deemed to keep this player unable to practice or play football for an estimated six weeks the player may be allowed to practice after Week and be activated to play after Week In the rule was changed to allow up to two players to return from injured reserve after Week In the rule was slightly modified due to the timing of a team s bye week so that players are eligible to return only after their team has played eight games instead of after eight weeks In the number of players eligible to return to each team in a season increased to three In the number of players eligible to return was changed to eight and players were eligible to return after four games br Teams may also place a player on injured reserve with a minor injury designation but the team must release the player once he is healthy br During the preseason the league also allows players with long term but not season ending injuries to be placed into one of three designations physically unable to perform PUP for injuries sustained during the previous season or during offseason training activities a player who passes their physical at the beginning of training camp and practices is physically able to participate and is thus ineligible for the PUP list reserve non football injury NFI for injuries sustained outside of team or league activities despite the name this includes lingering injuries from college football play should an injured player be drafted and join the team or reserve non football illness NFI for severe illnesses sustained by players unrelated to football Players on the PUP list can be moved to the active roster after week of the regular season or placed on injured reserve As of players on the NFI lists can begin practicing after week but cannot be activated until their team has played eight games When a player from the NFI list begins practicing a three week window starts in which they are eligible to be moved to the active roster If the player is not activated at the conclusion of the three week window they must remain on the NFI list for the rest of the season During the regular season players on the PUP list and injured reserve do not count against the league s man roster maximum but do count against the man roster limit br br br NBA rules br br Due to abuses in the use of the injured reserve list where some teams found it convenient to use the IR to stash players without independent medical oversight the injured reserve has been renamed the Inactive List with the last collective bargaining agreement Starting in the season players can enter the inactive list one hour before tip off for as little as one game The inactive list has a minimum of one player and a maximum of three subject to hardship rules when a team with three injured players already on its inactive list has a fourth player injured Players sent to the NBA G League continues to count on a team s inactive list br br br WNBA rules br Unlike its parent league the WNBA has no injury list as of the season This notably affected the Seattle Storm going into that season when reigning league MVP Breanna Stewart tore her right Achilles in the EuroLeague Women final Because of the lack of an injured list the Storm suspended Stewart without pay to free up a roster spot The WNBA would later make Stewart a paid league ambassador during her rehabilitation br The league had an injury list when it began play in players placed on this list were required to sit out at least three games In the league changed to an inactive list of up to two players but it was eliminated after the season when rosters were reduced to WNBA rosters now consist of players br br br MLB rules br br There are five types of injured reserve lists in Major League Baseball br br Up to Games The Paternity and Bereavement Lists in MLB are designed for family situations A player on Bereavement List for the health or funeral of another family member may miss
