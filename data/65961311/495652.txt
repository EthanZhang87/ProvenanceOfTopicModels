id: 495652
In ice hockey a goal is scored when the puck entirely crosses the goal line between the two goal posts and below the goal crossbar A goal awards one point to the team attacking the goal scored upon regardless of which team the player who actually deflected the puck into the goal belongs to see also own goal Typically a player on the team attempting to score shoots the puck with their stick towards the goal net opening and a player on the opposing team called a goaltender tries to block the shot to prevent a goal from being scored against their team br The term goal may also refer to the structure in which goals are scored The ice hockey goal is rectangular in shape the front frame of the goal is made of steel tube painted red and consists of two vertical goalposts and a horizontal crossbar A net is attached to the back of the frame to catch pucks that enter the goal and also to prevent pucks from entering it from behind The entire goal is considered an inbounds area of the playing surface and it is legal to play the puck behind the goal Under NHL rules the opening of the goal is inches cm wide by inches cm tall and the footprint of the goal is inches cm deep br br br Method of scoring br br The object of the game of ice hockey is to score more goals than the opposing team Goaltenders and defencemen are concerned primarily with keeping the other team from scoring a goal while forwards are primarily concerned with scoring goals on the other team Forwards also have to be defensively responsible while defencemen need to press offensively and it is not unknown for goalies to attempt to position the puck for a counterattack or even attempt to shoot against an unguarded net br For a goal to be scored the puck normally must entirely cross the goal line between the posts and under the crossbar of the goal frame A goal is not allowed under any of the following conditions br br the puck is sent into the goal from a stick raised above the height of the crossbar br the puck is intentionally kicked batted or thrown into the net by an attacking player a puck may deflect off an attacking player s skate or body provided that player does not make a deliberate attempt to kick or redirect the puck with their body br the puck enters the net directly after deflecting off an official br the goaltender is impeded from preventing the goal by an attacking player br the scoring shot caused the scoring team to become offside even if the team is no longer offside at the time of the goal br the scoring team had too many people on ice at the time of the goal br the goal was scored with a broken stick br the net was dislodged prior to the puck entering it br the goaltender shoots the puck after crossing the center line however replacing the goaltender with an extra attacker is allowed br the puck breaks into two or more pieces prior to any portion of it entering the goal br Additionally in many leagues a goal does not count if a player from the attacking team has a skate or stick in the goal crease before the puck The National Hockey League NHL abolished this rule starting in the season after the disputed triple overtime goal in the Stanley Cup Finals Brett Hull of the Dallas Stars scored the series clinching goal against the Buffalo Sabres There are those who believe that video replay shows Hull s skate in the crease prior to the puck br A goal may be awarded if a player would normally be awarded a penalty shot but the opposing team had substituted a skater for a goaltender In such rare cases a goal is awarded rather than allowing a penalty shot attempt on an empty goal net br br br Credit for goals and assists br Typically the last player on the goal scoring team to touch the puck before it goes into the net is credited with scoring that goal Zero one or two other players on the goal scoring team may also credited with an assist for helping their teammate to score the goal If another player on the goal scoring team touched the puck to help score the goal before the goal scoring player touched it without an opposing player intervening touching the puck in between then that player gets an assist If yet another player on the goal scoring team also touched the puck before that without an opposing player intervening then that player also gets an assist br For a hockey player a goal or an assist credited to them is also considered a point thus the number of goals scored by that player plus the number of assists for them equals the number of points for that player However a rule says that only one point can be credited to any one player on a goal scored This means one player cannot be credited with a goal and an assist for the same goal scored instead the player would only get credit for a goal and a different player may get credit for an assist if applicable It also means that one player cannot be credited with two assists for the same goal scored instead the player would only get credit for one assist and a different player may get credit for the other assist if applicable br Usually on a hockey team forwards score the most goals and get the most points although defensemen can score goals and often get assists In professional play goaltenders only occasionally get an assist and only very rarely score a goal when the opposite net is empty without a goaltender br br br Scoring statistics br The number of goals scored is a closely watched statistic Each year the Rocket Richard Trophy is presented to the NHL player to have scored the most goals The trophy is named after Maurice Richard the first player to score goals in a season at a time when the NHL regular season was only games compared to today The player to have scored the most goals in an NHL season is Wayne Gretzky Gretzky is also the fastest to goals during his record setting season in which he finished with goals he scored his th goal in the Edmonton Oilers th game of the season br The overall amount of goal scoring is also closely watched In recent years goal scoring has decreased Many believe the game is less entertaining because of this and blame the change on the increasing size of goaltending equipment and the advent of defensive systems such as the neutral zone trap Fans of defensive hockey counter by saying the high scoring of the s was an anomaly and this shift represents a return to the norm For the American Hockey League season four major rule changes were made that were intended to increase the scoring in games and make it more popular among casual fans br br increasing the size of the attack zones by narrowing the neutral zone two feet each side and thus moving the goal line back two feet br restrictions on the goaltender playing the puck br permitting offside players to negate the penalty by tagging up with the blue line br changing the offside rule by permitting passes which cross the center line and one blue line but not between both blue lines in certain restrictions br The AHL rules were slightly modified and adopted in the NHL and ECHL for when the NHL returned after the lockout br br br Types of goals br There are a number of different types of goals for which separate statistics are kept but all count equally br br An even strength goal is a goal scored when both teams have the same number of players on the ice br A power play goal PPG is a goal scored by a team on a power play that is with a numerical advantage in players due to a penalty being served by one or more of the other team s players br A shorthanded goal SHG is a goal scored by a team that

winning team in excess of the losing team s final score e g if the score is the game winning goal would be the third goal scored for the winning team br br br Related terms br br The goal judge is an official positioned off ice behind each goal for the specific purpose of indicating when the puck has crossed the goal line and entered the goal For arenas so equipped the goal judge turns on a red light behind the goal when they see the puck cross the goal line As in all matters however the referee retains final authority and can override the opinion of the goal judge br The two teammates of the scorer who last touched the puck before them provided that no opponent touched it in between are each credited with an assist Assists and goals count equally to comprise a player s statistical scoring total br If a hockey player causes the puck to enter their own team s net which in soccer is called an own goal credit for the goal goes to the last player on the scoring team to have touched the puck No assists are awarded If a shot deflects off a defender and enters the net it is not considered an own goal br Other phrases include a garbage goal for a goal scored more as the result of luck or opportunism than skill and a breakaway goal for a goal scored when a player has gotten behind the defenders to face the goaltender alone br When a player scores three goals in a game it is known as a hat trick A natural hat trick occurs when a player scores three consecutive goals uninterrupted by any other player scoring for either team A Gordie Howe hat trick occurs when a player scores a goal gets an assist and gets in a fight br Any puck heading towards the net is counted as a shot When the goaltender prevents the shot from entering the net they are credited with a save Shots resulting in saves by the goaltender or goals scored are considered shots on goal or shots on net A shot which is blocked by an opposing player before it reaches the goaltender is not considered a shot on net Also if the puck is deflected wide of the net by another player regardless of team it is not counted as a shot on net If a goaltender traps the puck that was heading towards the goal but wide it is often not counted as a shot nor are shots that bounce off the crossbar or posts br br br Goal horn br The trend of sounding a horn when the home team scores a goal originated in the Stanley Cup Finals between the Montreal Canadiens and the Chicago Black Hawks Black Hawks owner Bill Wirtz had the horn of his yacht installed in the team s home arena Chicago Stadium and had it sound after Black Hawks goals This practice become commonplace in professional hockey In all goal horns are paired with a song Some notable ones include Lithium by Nirvana used by the Seattle Kraken The Fratellis Chelsea Dagger used by the Chicago Blackhawks Tim McGraw s I Like It I Love It which has a couple words substituted to fit the Nashville Predators and Ray Castoldi the music director and organist and Madison Square Garden s Slapshot a song used by the New York Rangers since br br br See also br List of NHL statistical leaders br List of goaltenders who have scored a goal in an NHL game br br br br
