newspaper was founded in by Conrad Black in an attempt to compete with The Globe and Mail In CanWest completed its acquisition of the National Post In the newspaper ceased distribution in Atlantic Canada and the Canadian territories Postmedia assumed ownership of the newspaper in after the CEO of the National Post s Paul Godfrey assembled an ownership group to acquire CanWest s chain of newspapers br br br History br Conrad Black built the National Post around the Financial Post a financial newspaper in Toronto which Hollinger Inc purchased from Sun Media in Originally slated for an October launch date the debut of the paper was delayed until October because of financial complications that stemmed from Black s acquisition of the Financial Post which was retained as the name of the new newspaper s business section br Outside Toronto the Post was built on the printing and distribution infrastructure of Hollinger s national newspaper chain formerly called Southam Newspapers that included the newspapers Ottawa Citizen Montreal Gazette Edmonton Journal Calgary Herald and Vancouver Sun The Post became Black s national flagship title and Ken Whyte was appointed editor br Beyond his political vision Black attempted to compete directly with Kenneth Thomson s media empire led in Canada by The Globe and Mail which Black and many others perceived as the platform of the Liberal establishment br When the Post launched its editorial stance was conservative It advocated a unite the right movement to create a viable alternative to the Liberal government of Jean Chr tien and supported the Canadian Alliance The Post s op ed page has included dissenting columns by ideological liberals such as Linda McQuaig as well as conservatives including Mark Steyn and Diane Francis and David Frum Original members of the Post editorial board included Ezra Levant Neil Seeman Jonathan Kay Conservative Member of Parliament John Williamson and the author historian Alexander Rose br The Post s magazine style graphic and layout design has won awards The original design of the Post was created by Lucie Lacava a design consultant based in Montreal The Post now bears the motto World s Best Designed Newspaper on its front page br br br st century br The Post was unable to maintain momentum in the market without continuing to operate with annual budgetary deficits At the same time Conrad Black was becoming preoccupied by his debt heavy media empire Hollinger International Black divested his Canadian media holdings and sold the Post to CanWest Global Communications Corp controlled by Israel Izzy Asper in two stages percent in along with the entire Southam newspaper chain and the remaining percent in CanWest Global also owned the Global Television Network br Izzy Asper died in October and his sons Leonard and David Asper assumed control of CanWest the latter serving as chairman of the Post Editor in chief Matthew Fraser departed in after the arrival of a new publisher Les Pyette the paper s seventh publisher in seven years Fraser s deputy editor Doug Kelly succeeded him as editor Pyette departed seven months after his arrival replaced by Gordon Fisher br The Post limited print distribution in Atlantic Canada in part of a trend to which The Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star Canada s other two papers with inter regional distribution have all resorted Print editions were removed from all Atlantic Canadian newsstands except in Halifax as of Focussing further on its online publishing in the paper suspended weekday editions and home delivery in Manitoba and Saskatchewan The reorientation towards digital continued into its next decade br Politically the Post has retained a conservative editorial stance although the Asper family has long been a strong supporter of the Liberal Party of Canada Izzy Asper was once leader of the Liberal Party in his home province of Manitoba The Aspers had controversially fired the publisher of the Ottawa Citizen Russell Mills for calling for the resignation of Liberal prime minister Jean Chr tien br However the Post endorsed the Conservative Party of Canada in the election when Fraser was editor The Conservatives narrowly lost that election to the Liberals After the election the Post surprised many of its conservative readers by shifting its support to the victorious Liberal government of prime minister Paul Martin and was highly critical of the Conservatives and their leader Stephen Harper The paper switched camps again in the runup to the election in which the Conservatives won a minority government br Like its competitor The Globe and Mail the Post publishes a separate edition in Toronto Ontario Canada s largest city and the fourth largest English language media centre in North America after New York City Los Angeles and Chicago The Toronto edition includes additional local content not published in the edition distributed to the rest of Canada and is printed at the Toronto Star Press Centre in Vaughan br On September the Post unveiled a major redesign of its appearance Guided by Gayle Grin the Post s managing editor of design and graphics the redesign features a standardization in the size of typeface and the number of typefaces used cleaner font for charts and graphs and the move of the nameplate banner from the top to the left side of Page as well as each section s front page br In the paper announced that as a temporary cost cutting measure it would not print a Monday edition from July to September On October Canwest Global announced that due to a lack of funding the National Post might close down as of October subject to moving the paper to a new holding company Late on October Ontario Superior Court Justice Sarah Pepall ruled in Canwest s favour and allowed the paper to move into a holding company Investment bankers hired by Canwest received no offers when they tried to sell the National Post earlier that year Without a buyer closing the paper was studied but the costs were greater than gains from liquidating assets The lawyer for Canwest in arguing to Justice Pepall said the National Post added value to other papers in the Canwest chain br In an ownership group was assembled by National Post CEO Paul Godfrey in to bid for the chain of newspapers being sold by the financially troubled Canwest the company s broadcasting assets were sold separately to Shaw Communications Godfrey secured financial backing from U S private equity firm Golden Tree Asset Management as well as other investors The group completed a billion transaction to acquire the chain from Canwest on July forming the Postmedia Network The company s shares were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in On October the Post announced its first ever yearly profit In Chatham Asset Management acquired a per cent stake in the Postmedia Network resulting in the reduction in their staff including a third of the National Post s editorial staff br br br Facilities br br The National Post s main office is at Bloor Street East in Toronto Ontario It was formerly located at Don Mills Road in the Don Mills neighbourhood of Toronto which was vacated in br The newspaper is published at Postmedia s Islington Printing Plant in Toronto s Rexdale neighbourhood along with the Toronto Sun London Free Press and various Postmedia and Metroland owned weekly newspapers The newspaper was previously printed at the Toronto Star Press Centre in Vaughan Ontario until the Toronto Star closed the site br br br Controversies br br br Iran hoax br br On May the newspaper ran two pieces alleging that the Iranian parliament had passed a law requiring religious minorities to wear special identifying badges One piece was a front page news item titled Iran Eyes Badges For Jews accompanied by a picture of two Jews bearing Nazi ordered yellow badges Later on the same day experts began coming forward to deny the accuracy of the Post story The story proved to be false but not before it had been picked up by a variety of other news media and generated comment from world leaders Comments on the story by the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper caused Iran to summon Canada s ambassador to Tehran Gordon E Venner for an explanation br On May the editor in chief of the newspaper Doug Kelly published an apology for the story on page admitting that it was false and the National Post had not exercised enough caution or checked enough sources br br br Accusation of anti Islam sentiment br From to the now defunct Canadian Islamic Congress CIC had been actively monitoring media coverage for anti Muslim or anti Islam sentiment and had issued reports highlighting its findings It had opposed the use of phrases such as Islamic guerrillas Islamic insurgency and Muslim militants saying that terms like militant or terrorist should be used without a religious association since no religion teaches or endorses terrorism militancy or extremism The Congress had singled out the National Post saying the paper consistently is No as an anti Islam media outlet br A number of writers for the National Post have subsequently criticized the CIC over these accusations Alexander Rose wrote that judging by the CIC s support for the Durban Conference during which hook nosed Jews were equated with apartheid and genocide the CIC doesn t seem to have problems with some kinds of truly inflammatory racist language and that the CIC s fetish for censorship in the interest of social harmony as the CIC puts it reeks of the very authoritarianism oppressing Muslims in Egypt Iraq Iran and Saudi Arabia In addition Rose stated that By editing out bad language it seems the CIC believes that correct thoughts will result even at the necessary expense of reporting the truth Robert Fulford wrote that the CIC justifies its existence mainly by complaining about acts of prejudice that haven t happened and that it s ridiculous to suggest that we avoid the subject of religion when crimes are committed in the name of that religion by men and women considered part of it while Jonathan Kay wrote that the folks at the Canadian Islamic Congress purport to be the arbiters of what can and can t be said in this country and that CIC President Elmasry is the country s self appointed judge of all that is hateful br br br Allegations of bias br A survey of Canadians found that the National Post was perceived to be middle of the pack for bias among national news outlets perceived biased by per cent of Canadians overall A Ipsos survey commissioned by CBC found that of respondents believed the Post leaned to the right or far right br The advocacy group Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East has accused the Post of pro Israel bias for publishing articles from the Jewish News Syndicate which it describes as a mouthpiece for the Israeli military br br br Notable staff br br br Editors in chief br br br Staff br br br Columnists br The following is a
