id: 2839423
JT Jupiter Tessellation is an openly published ISO standardized D CAD data exchange format used for product visualization collaboration digital mockups and other purposes It was developed by Siemens br It can contain any combination of approximate faceted data boundary representation surfaces NURBS Product and Manufacturing Information PMI and Metadata textual attributes either exported from the native CAD system or inserted by a product data management PDM system br The JT format contains a scene graph representation of an assembly nested sub assemblies of parts with CAD specific node and attributes data Facet information triangles is stored by using geometry compression techniques Visual attributes of D scene and model like lights textures and or materials are supported Product and Manufacturing Information PMI Precise Part definitions BRep additional metadata and a variety of representation configurations are supported The JT format is designed to be streamable br br br Overview br JT files are used in product lifecycle management PLM software programs and their respective CAD systems by engineers and other professionals that need to analyze the geometry of complex products The format and associated software is structured so that extremely large numbers of components can be quickly loaded shaded and manipulated in real time Because all major D CAD formats are supported a JT assembly can contain a mixture of any combination which has led to the term multi CAD As JT is typically implemented as an integral part of a PLM solution the resulting multi CAD assembly is managed such that changes to the original CAD product definition files can be automatically synchronized with their associated JT files resulting in a multi CAD assembly that is always up to date br Because JT files are inherently lightweight of the size of a CAD file they are ideal for internet collaboration With the growing trend toward globalization more companies are leveraging resources wherever they are available in the world Collaboration using JT allows companies to send D visualization data to suppliers and partners much more easily than sending the associated heavy CAD files In addition real time on line collaboration is easier because the amount of information sent back and forth across the internet is reduced Finally JT provides an inherent security feature such that intellectual property does not have to be shared with inappropriate parties As indicated above JT can contain any combination of data such that the right amount of information can be shared without exposing the underlying proprietary design definition information br JT is often used for Digital mock up DMU work which allows engineers to validate that a product can be assembled without interferences long before a physical prototype could be produced This spatial validation is enabled by precise measurements and cross sectioning as well as sophisticated clearance interference detection Leveraging JT for digital mock up allows users to reduce or eliminate costly physical prototypes and enables decision making to occur much earlier in the development process br Finally JT is used as a CAD interoperability format for exchanging design data for Collaborative Product Development where JT files are created by translating data from CAD systems such as NX Unigraphics Creo Elements Pro FORAN I DEAS Solid Edge Catia Microstation or Autodesk Inventor br br br Large model rendering br JT was created to support the interactive display of very large assemblies i e those containing tens of thousands of components The JT file format is capable of storing an arbitrary number of faceted representations with varying levels of detail LODs When the whole product is displayed on the computer screen the hosting application displays only a simple coarse model However as the user zooms into a particular area progressively finer representations are loaded and displayed Over time unused representations are unloaded to save memory br br br History br JT was originally developed by Engineering Animation Inc and Hewlett Packard as the DirectModel toolkit initially Jupiter JT is the abbreviation for Jupiter Tesselation When EAI was purchased by UGS Corp JT became a part of UGS s suite of products Early in UGS announced the publication of the JT data format easing the adoption of JT as a master D format Also in UGS was acquired by Siemens AG and became Siemens Digital Industries Software JT is the common interoperability format in use across all of Siemens Digital Industries Software and has been adopted as the long term data archival format across all of Siemens br On September the ISO stated officially that the JT specification has been accepted for publication as an ISO Publicly Available Specification PAS End of August the Ballot for the New Work Item NWI proposal for JT as ISO International Standard was started by ProSTEP iViP ProSTEP iViP thereby aimed on the one hand to publish the JT file format specification as ISO Standard and on the other hand to harmonize this undertaking with the new STEP AP development so that JT and STEP especially STEP AP XML can be used together to assure major benefits within industrial data exchange scenarios br In December JT has been officially published as ISO ISO JT V as a D visualization format based on version of JT specifications released by Siemens Digital Industries Software Through this publication via ISO for the first time a completely neutral and royalty free specification of JT was available br Beginning of in ISO the specification of ISO JT V was started The ISO DIS V was accepted by ISO in November The final International Standard was published in November Main difference between V and V is the incorporation of a STEP B rep as an additional B rep segment br br For providing additional functionalities and innovations required by industry ProSTEP iViP and VDA decided mid of to specify a so called JT Industrial Application Package JTIAP which is a JT file format specification completely compatible to ISO V as well as the future V and currently existing JT Open based implementations Thereby JTIAP provide a more comprehensive compression algorithm LZMA specifies XT B rep as recommended representation of exact geometry and allows the neutral and royalty free implementation of JT br br br Data model br The JT data model is capable of representing a wide range of engineering data This data can be very lightweight holding little more than facet data or it can be quite rich containing complete NURBS geometry representations along with product structure attributes meta data and PMI It also supports multiple tessellations and level of detail LOD generation br br Product Structure assembly part instance br Facet polygon polygon set br Lighting light set point light infinite light br Textures br Precise Geometry and Topology point curve surface face loop edge vertex br Boundary representation B rep could use either JT B rep and XT B rep Parasolid format STEP B rep will be supported by ISO JT V br Geometry Primitives box cylinder pyramid sphere br Product and Manufacturing Information PMI GD T D annotations br Attributes Properties text integer float date layers br br br File structure br The relationship of product structure hierarchy to exported JT file structure is arbitrary Any node in the hierarchy may be specified as the start of a new JT file Thus product structure may be represented in a variety of JT file configurations br JT supports common product structure to file structure mappings These include br br Per part All assembly nodes in a product structure hierarchy are stored in a single JT file and each part node in the hierarchy is stored in an individual JT file in a sub directory that is of the same name as the assembly JT file br Fully shattered Each product structure node in the hierarchy is stored in an individual JT file br Monolithic All product structure is stored in a single JT file br PLMXML An open XML based file format specified by Siemens Digital Industries Software A PLMXML structure could link to the model data in another file an External Representation or the data can be embedded within the Representation element in the XML file an InternalRepresentation br STEP AP XML An ISO Standard with allows to represent assembly meta kinematic data etc and to link to the model data as external references leaves on a STEP tree In global automotive industry for realizing cross company data exchange scenarios the application of STEP AP XML and JT is recommended br Client applications may use these mappings or choose to define their own custom mapping br br br Compression br To help shrink the storage and transmission bandwidth requirements of D models JT files may take advantage of compression Use of compression is transparent to the user of the JT data and a given model may be composed of JT files using different compression settings including none br To date the JT file format has evolved through two forms of compression exposed in JT Open Toolkit as standard and advanced compression These differ in that the former employs a simple lossless compression algorithm while the latter employs a more sophisticated domain specific compression scheme supporting lossy geometry compression Client applications are encouraged to take advantage of advanced compression over standard compression as attainable compression ratios are much greater Support for standard compression is maintained only in the interest of backward compatibility with legacy JT file viewing applications br The compression form used by a JT file is related to the JT file format version in which it was written This version is readily viewable by opening a JT file in a text editor and looking at its ASCII header information br br br See also br Open Packaging
