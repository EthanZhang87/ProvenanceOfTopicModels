Ghostscript is a suite of software based on an interpreter for Adobe Systems PostScript and Portable Document Format PDF page description languages Its main purposes are the rasterization or rendering of such page description language files for the display or printing of document pages and the conversion between PostScript and PDF files br br br Features br Ghostscript can be used as a raster image processor RIP for raster computer printers for instance as an input filter of line printer daemon or as the RIP engine behind PostScript and PDF viewers It can also be used as a file format converter such as PostScript to PDF converter The ps pdf conversion program comes with the Ghostscript distribution br Ghostscript can also serve as the back end for PDF to raster image png tiff jpeg etc converter this is often combined with a PostScript printer driver in virtual printer PDF creators As it takes the form of a language interpreter Ghostscript can also be used as a general purpose programming environment br Ghostscript has been ported to many operating systems including Unix like systems classic Mac OS OpenVMS Microsoft Windows Plan MS DOS FreeDOS OS ArcaOS Atari TOS RISC OS and AmigaOS br br br History br Ghostscript was originally written by L Peter Deutsch for the GNU Project and released under the GNU General Public License in At the time of the initial release there was a similar commercial software product named GoScript from LaserGo Later Deutsch formed Aladdin Enterprises to dual license Ghostscript also under a proprietary license with an own development fork Aladdin Ghostscript under the Aladdin Free Public License which despite the name is not a free software license as it forbids commercial distribution and GNU Ghostscript distributed with the GNU General Public License With version in both development branches were merged again and dual licensed releases were still provided br Ghostscript is currently owned by Artifex Software and maintained by Artifex Software employees and the worldwide user community According to Artifex as of version the commercial version of Ghostscript can no longer be freely distributed for commercial purposes without purchasing a license though the A GPL variant allows commercial distribution provided all code using it is released under the A GPL br In February with version Ghostscript changed its license from GPLv to GNU AGPL which raised license compatibility questions for example by Debian br Starting with release Ghostscript has two built in PDF interpreters Until spring up to Ghostscript version the default PDF interpreters implementation itself was coded in PostScript The new default PDF interpreter has been rewritten in C entirely and is faster and more secure than its predecessor while its interface and graphics library have not changed Scripting the new C written PDF interpreter from PostScript is still possible br br br Free fonts br There are several sets of free fonts supplied for Ghostscript intended to be metrically compatible with common fonts attached with the PostScript standard These include br br A collection of font styles from typeface families contributed by German foundry URW in under the GPL and AFPL which is therefore commonly called the URW Base fonts or URW Core fonts The collection is similar to the fonts defined by Adobe in PostScript Level Bookman L Bookman Century Schoolbook L New Century Schoolbook Chancery L Zapf Chancery Dingbats Zapf Dingbats Gothic L Avant Garde Nimbus Mono L Courier Nimbus Roman No L Times Nimbus Sans L Helvetica Palladio L Palatino Standard Symbols L Symbol in Type TrueType and OpenType formats br The GhostPDL package including Ghostscript as well as companion implementations of HP PCL and Microsoft XPS includes additional fonts under the AFPL which bars commercial use It includes URW versions of Garamond Garamond No Optima URW Classico Arial A Antique Olive and Univers U Clarendon Coronet Letter Gothic as well as URW Mauritius and a modified form of Albertus known as A Combined with the base set they represent a little more than half of the standard PostScript font complement br A miscellaneous set including Cyrillic kana and fonts derived from the free Hershey fonts with improvements by Thomas Wolff such as adding accented characters br The Ghostscript fonts were developed in the PostScript Type format but have been converted into the TrueType format As a result a user can install and use the Ghostscript fonts via most modern software Furthermore the Ghostscript fonts are used as parts of various open source applications e g the Linux version of GIMP depends on Graphviz which in turn depends on the Ghostscript fonts Finally multiple open source font projects used glyphs from the Ghostscript fonts e g the Latin characters of GNU FreeFont are based on Nimbus Mono L Nimbus Roman No L and Nimbus Sans L The TeX Gyre fonts are also based on out of the original Ghostscript typeface families The Garamond font has additionally been improved upon br br br See also br br Common Unix Printing System br Foomatic br PostScript Printer Description br Printer driver br pstoedit br br br
