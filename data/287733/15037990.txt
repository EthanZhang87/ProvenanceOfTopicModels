OCR A is a font issued in and first implemented in A special font was needed in the early days of computer optical character recognition when there was a need for a font that could be recognized not only by the computers of that day but also by humans OCR A uses simple thick strokes to form recognizable characters br The font is monospaced fixed width with the printer required to place glyphs cm inch apart and the reader required to accept any spacing between cm inch and cm inch br br br Standardization br The OCR A font was standardized by the American National Standards Institute ANSI br as ANSI X X has since become the INCITS and the OCR A standard is now called ISO br br br Implementations br In American Type Founders produced OCR A one of the first optical character recognition typefaces to meet the criteria set by the U S Bureau of Standards The design is simple so that it can be easily read by a machine but it is more difficult for the human eye to read br As metal type gave way to computer based typesetting Tor Lillqvist used Metafont to describe the OCR A font That definition was subsequently improved by Richard B Wales Their work is available from CTAN br To make the free version of the font more accessible to users of Microsoft Windows John Sauter converted the Metafont definitions to TrueType using potrace and FontForge in In G rkan Seng n created a Debian package from this implementation In Luc Devroye corrected the vertical positioning in John Sauter s implementation and fixed the name of lower case z br Independently Matthew Skala used mftrace to convert the Metafont definitions to TrueType format in In he released a new version created by rewriting the Metafont definitions to work with METATYPE generating outlines directly without an intermediate tracing step On September he updated his implementation to version br In addition to these free implementations of OCR A there are also implementations sold by several vendors As a joke Tobias Frere Jones in created Estupido Espezial a redesign with swashes and a long s It was used in a technology themed section of Rolling Stone br Maxitype designed the OCR X typeface based on the OCR A typeface with OpenType features alien and technology themed dingbats available in six weights Thin Light Regular Medium Bold Black br br br Use br br Although optical character recognition technology has advanced to the point where such simple fonts are no longer necessary the OCR A font has remained in use Its usage remains widespread in the encoding of checks around the world Some lock box companies still insist that the account number and amount owed on a bill return form be printed in OCR A Also because of its unusual look it is sometimes used in advertising and display graphics br Notably it is used for the subtitles in films and television series such as Blacklist and for the main titles in The Pretender Additionally OCR A is used for the films Crimson Tide and Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi br br br Code points br A font is a set of character shapes or glyphs For a computer to use a font each glyph must be assigned a code point in a character set When OCR A was being standardized the usual character coding was the American Standard Code for Information Interchange or ASCII Not all of the glyphs of OCR A fit into ASCII and for five of the characters there were alternate glyphs which might have suggested the need for a second font However for convenience and efficiency all of the glyphs were expected to be accessible in a single font using ASCII coding with the additional characters placed at coding points that would otherwise have been unused br The modern descendant of ASCII is Unicode also known as ISO Unicode contains ASCII and has special provisions for OCR characters so some implementations of OCR A have looked to Unicode for br guidance on character code assignments br br br Pre Unicode standard representation br The ISO standard ISO and the corresponding Japanese Industrial Standard JIS X originally JIS C define character encodings for OCR A OCR B and E B For OCR A they define a modified bit ASCII set also known by its ISO IR number ISO IR including only uppercase letters digits a subset of the punctuation and symbols and some additional symbols Codes which are redefined relative to ASCII as opposed to simply omitted are listed below br br Additionally the long vertical mark is encoded at x C corresponding to the ASCII vertical bar br br br Dedicated OCR A characters in Unicode br br The following characters have been defined for control purposes and are now in the Optical Character Recognition Unicode range F br br br Space digits and unaccented letters br br All implementations of OCR A use U for space br U through U for the decimal digits br U through U A for the unaccented upper case letters and br U through U A for the unaccented lower case letters br br br Regular characters br In addition to the digits and unaccented letters many of the characters of OCR A have obvious code points in ASCII br Of those that do not most including all of OCR A s accented letters have obvious code points in Unicode br br br Remaining characters br Linotype coded the remaining characters of OCR A as follows br br br Additional characters br The fonts that descend from the work of Tor Lillqvist and Richard B Wales define four characters not in OCR A to fill out the ASCII character set These shapes use the same style as the OCR A character shapes They are br br Linotype also defines additional characters br br br Exceptions br Some implementations do not use the above code point assignments for some characters br br br PrecisionID br The PrecisionID implementation of OCR A has
