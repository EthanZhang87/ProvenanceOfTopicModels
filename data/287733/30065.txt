title: TeX
id: 30065
TeX see below stylized within the system as TeX is a typesetting program which was designed and written by computer scientist and Stanford University professor Donald Knuth and first released in The term now refers to the system of extensions which includes software programs called TeX engines sets of TeX macros and packages which provide extra typesetting functionality built around the original TeX language TeX is a popular means of typesetting complex mathematical formulae it has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical systems br TeX is widely used in academia especially in mathematics computer science economics political science engineering linguistics physics statistics and quantitative psychology It has long since displaced Unix troff the previously favored formatting system in most Unix installations It is also used for many other typesetting tasks especially in the form of LaTeX ConTeXt and other macro packages br TeX was designed with two main goals in mind to allow anybody to produce high quality books with minimal effort and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers at any point in time together with the Metafont language for font description and the Computer Modern family of typefaces TeX is free software which made it accessible to a wide range of users br br br History br When the first paper volume of Knuth s The Art of Computer Programming was published in it was typeset using hot metal typesetting on a Monotype machine This method dating back to the th century produced a classic style appreciated by Knuth When the second edition was published in the whole book had to be typeset again because the Monotype technology had been largely replaced by phototypesetting and the original fonts were no longer available When Knuth received the galley proofs of the new book on March he found them inferior Disappointed Knuth set out to design his own typesetting system br Knuth saw for the first time the output of a high quality digital typesetting system and became interested in digital typography On May he wrote a memo to himself describing the basic features of TeX He planned to finish it on his sabbatical in but as it happened the language was not frozen ready to use until more than ten years later Guy Steele happened to be at Stanford during the summer of when Knuth was developing his first version of TeX When Steele returned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that autumn he rewrote TeX s input output I O to run under the Incompatible Timesharing System ITS operating system The first version of TeX called TeX was written in the SAIL programming language to run on a PDP under Stanford s WAITS operating system br br br WEB and literate programming br For later versions of TeX Knuth invented the concept of literate programming a way of producing compilable source code and cross linked documentation typeset in TeX from the same original file The language used is called WEB and produces programs in DEC PDP Pascal br br br TeX br TeX a new version of TeX rewritten from scratch was published in Among other changes the original hyphenation algorithm was replaced by a new algorithm written by Frank Liang TeX also uses fixed point arithmetic instead of floating point to ensure reproducibility of the results across different computer hardware and includes a real Turing complete programming language following intense lobbying by Guy Steele In Donald Knuth released new versions of TeX and Metafont Despite his desire to keep the program stable Knuth realised that different characters for the text input were not enough to accommodate foreign languages the main change in version of TeX is thus the ability to work with bit inputs allowing different characters in the text input TeX was released on March br Since version TeX has used an idiosyncratic version numbering system where updates have been indicated by adding an extra digit at the end of the decimal so that the version number asymptotically approaches This is a reflection of the fact that TeX is now very stable and only minor updates are anticipated The current version of TeX is it was last updated in The design was frozen after version and no new feature or fundamental change will be added so all newer versions will contain only bug fixes Even though Donald Knuth himself has suggested a few areas in which TeX could have been improved he indicated that he firmly believes that having an unchanged system that will produce the same output now and in the future is more important than introducing new features For this reason he has stated that the absolutely final change to be made after my death will be to change the version number to at which point all remaining bugs will become features Likewise versions of Metafont after asymptotically approach e currently at and a similar change will be applied after Knuth s death br br br Public domain br Since the source code of TeX is essentially in the public domain see below other programmers are allowed and explicitly encouraged to improve the system but are required to use another name to distribute the modified TeX meaning that the source code can still evolve For example the Omega project was developed after primarily to enhance TeX s multilingual typesetting abilities Knuth created unofficial modified versions such as TeX XeT which allows a user to mix texts written in left to right and right to left writing systems in the same document br br br Use of TeX br In several technical fields such as computer science mathematics engineering and physics TeX has become a de facto standard Many thousands of books have been published using TeX including books published by Addison Wesley Cambridge University Press Elsevier Oxford University Press and Springer Numerous journals in these fields are produced using TeX or LaTeX allowing authors to submit their raw manuscript written in TeX While many publications in other fields including dictionaries and legal publications have been produced using TeX it has not been as successful as in the more technical fields as TeX was primarily designed to typeset mathematics br When he designed TeX Donald Knuth did not believe that a single typesetting system would fit everyone s needs instead he designed many hooks inside the program so that it would be possible to write extensions and released the source code hoping that the publishers would design versions tailoring to their own needs While such extensions have been created including some by Knuth himself most people have extended TeX only using macros and it has remained a system associated with technical typesetting br br br Typesetting system br TeX commands commonly start with a backslash and are grouped with curly braces Almost all of TeX s syntactic properties can be changed on the fly which makes TeX input hard to parse by anything but TeX itself TeX is a macro and token based language many commands including most user defined ones are expanded on the fly until only unexpandable tokens remain which are then executed Expansion itself is practically free from side effects Tail recursion of macros takes no memory and if then else constructs are available This makes TeX a Turing complete language even at the expansion level The system can be divided into four levels in the first characters are read from the input file and assigned a category code sometimes called catcode for short Combinations of a backslash actually any character of category zero followed by letters characters of category or a single other character are replaced by a control sequence token In this sense this stage is like lexical analysis although it does not form numbers from digits In the next stage expandable control sequences such as conditionals or defined macros are replaced by their replacement text The input for the third stage is then a stream of characters including the ones with special meaning and unexpandable control sequences typically assignments and visual commands Here the characters get assembled into a paragraph and TeX s paragraph breaking algorithm works by optimizing breakpoints over the whole paragraph The fourth stage breaks the vertical list of lines and other material into pages br The TeX system has precise knowledge of the sizes of all characters and symbols and using this information it computes the optimal arrangement of letters per line and lines per page It then produces a DVI file DeVice Independent containing the final locations of all characters This DVI file can then be printed directly given an appropriate printer driver or it can be converted to other formats Nowadays pdfTeX is often used which bypasses DVI generation altogether The base TeX system understands about commands called primitives These low level commands are rarely used directly by users and most functionality is provided by format files predumped memory images of TeX after large macro collections have been loaded Knuth s original default format which adds about commands is Plain TeX The most widely used format is LaTeX originally developed by Leslie Lamport which incorporates document styles for books letters slides etc and adds support for referencing and automatic numbering of sections and equations Another widely used format AMS TeX is produced by the American Mathematical Society and provides many more user friendly commands which can be altered by journals to fit with their house style Most of the features of AMS TeX can be used in LaTeX by using the AMS packages e g amsmath amssymb and the AMS document classes e g amsart amsbook This is then referred to as AMS LaTeX Other formats include ConTeXt used primarily for desktop publishing and written mostly by Hans Hagen at Pragma br br br How it is run br br A sample Hello world program in plain TeX is br br This might be in a file myfile tex as tex is a common file extension for plain TeX files By default everything that follows a percent sign on a line is a comment ignored by TeX Running TeX on this file for example by typing tex myfile tex in a command line interpreter or by calling it from a graphical user interface will create an output file called myfile dvi representing the content of the page in a device independent format DVI A DVI file could then be either viewed on screen or converted to a suitable format for any of the various printers for which a device driver existed printer support was generally not an operating system feature at the time that TeX was created Knuth has said that there is nothing inherent in TeX that requires DVI as the output format and later versions of TeX notably pdfTeX XeTeX and LuaTeX all support output directly to PDF br br br Mathematical example br br TeX provides a different text syntax specifically for mathematical formulas For example the quadratic formula which is the solution of the quadratic equation appears as br br The formula is printed in a way a person would write by hand or typeset the equation In a document entering mathematics mode is done by starting with a symbol then entering a formula in TeX syntax and closing again with another of the same symbol Knuth explained in jest that he chose the dollar sign to indicate the beginning and end of mathematical mode in plain TeX because typesetting mathematics was traditionally supposed to be expensive Display mathematics mathematics presented centered on a new line is similar but uses instead of a single symbol For example the above with the quadratic formula in display math br br The examples here are not actually rendered with TeX spacing character sizes and all else may differ br br br Aspects br The TeX software incorporates several aspects that were not available or were of lower quality in other typesetting programs at the time when TeX was released Some of the innovations are based on interesting algorithms and have led to several theses for Knuth s students While some of these discoveries have now been incorporated into other typesetting programs others such as the rules for mathematical spacing are still unique br br br Mathematical spacing br br Since the primary goal of the TeX language is high quality typesetting for publishers of books Knuth gave a lot of attention to the spacing rules for mathematical formulae He took three bodies of work that he considered to be standards of excellence for mathematical typography the books typeset by the Addison Wesley Publishing house the publisher of The Art of Computer Programming under the supervision of Hans Wolf editions of the mathematical journal Acta Mathematica dating from around and a copy of Indagationes Mathematicae a Dutch mathematics journal Knuth looked closely at these printed papers to sort out and look for a set of rules for spacing While TeX provides some basic rules and the tools needed to specify proper spacing the exact parameters depend on the font used to typeset the formula For example the spacing for Knuth s Computer Modern fonts has been precisely fine tuned over the years and is now set but when other fonts such as AMS Euler were used by Knuth for the first time new spacing parameters had to be defined br The typesetting of math in TeX is not without criticism particularly with respect to technical details of the font metrics which were designed in an era when significant attention was paid to storage requirements This resulted in some hacks overloading some fields which in turn required other hacks On an aesthetics level the rendering of radicals has also been criticized The OpenType math font specification largely borrows from TeX but has some new features enhancements br br br Hyphenation and justification br In comparison with manual typesetting the problem of justification is easy to solve with a digital system such as TeX which provided that good points for line breaking have been defined can automatically spread the spaces between words to fill in the line The problem is thus to find the set of breakpoints that will give the most visually pleasing result Many line breaking algorithms use a first fit approach where the breakpoints for each line are determined one after the other and no breakpoint is changed after it has been chosen Such a system is not able to define a breakpoint depending on the effect that it will have on the following lines In comparison the total fit line breaking algorithm used by TeX and developed by Donald Knuth and Michael Plass considers all the possible breakpoints in a paragraph and finds the combination of line breaks that will produce the most globally pleasing arrangement br Formally the algorithm defines a value called badness associated with each possible line break the badness is increased if the spaces on the line must stretch or shrink too much to make the line the correct width Penalties are added if a breakpoint is particularly undesirable for example if a word must be hyphenated if two lines in a row are hyphenated or if a very loose line is immediately followed by a very tight line The algorithm will then find the breakpoints that will minimize the sum of squares of the badness including penalties of the resulting lines If the paragraph contains br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br possible breakpoints the number of situations that must be evaluated naively is br br br br br br br n br br br br br displaystyle n br br However by using the method of dynamic programming the complexity of the algorithm can be brought down to br br br br O br br br n br br br br br br br br displaystyle O n br br see Big O notation Further simplifications for example not testing extremely unlikely breakpoints such as a hyphenation in the first word of a paragraph or very overfull lines lead to an efficient algorithm whose running time is br br br br O br br n br w br br br br displaystyle O nw br br where br br br br w br br br displaystyle w br br is the width of a line A similar algorithm is used to determine the best way to break paragraphs across two pages in order to avoid widows or orphans lines that appear alone on a page while the rest of the paragraph is on the following or preceding page However in general a thesis by Michael Plass shows how the page breaking problem can be NP complete because of the added complication of placing figures TeX s line breaking algorithm has been adopted by several other programs such as Adobe InDesign a desktop publishing application and the GNU fmt Unix command line utility br If no suitable line break can be found for a line the system will try to hyphenate a word The original version of TeX used a hyphenation algorithm based on a set of rules for the removal of prefixes and suffixes of words and for deciding if it should insert a break between the two consonants in a pattern of the form vowel consonant consonant vowel which is possible most of the time TeX introduced a new hyphenation algorithm designed by Frank Liang in to assign priorities to breakpoints in letter groups A list of hyphenation patterns is first generated automatically from a corpus of hyphenated words a list of words If TeX must find the acceptable hyphenation positions in the word encyclopedia for example it will consider all the subwords of the extended word encyclopedia where is a special marker to indicate the beginning or end of the word The list of subwords includes all the subwords of length e n c y etc of length e en nc etc etc up to the subword of length which is the word itself including the markers TeX will then look into its list of hyphenation patterns and find subwords for which it has calculated the desirability of hyphenation at each position In the case of our word such patterns can be matched namely c l cy d i a edi e dia i a ope d p ed pedi pedia y c For each position in the word TeX will calculate the maximum value obtained among all matching patterns yielding en cy c l o p e d i a Finally the acceptable positions are those indicated by an odd number yielding the acceptable hyphenations en cy clo pe di a This system based on subwords allows the definition of very general patterns such as i a with low indicative numbers either odd or even which can then be superseded by more specific patterns such as d i a if necessary These patterns find about of the hyphens in the original dictionary more importantly they do not insert any spurious hyphen In addition a list of exceptions words for which the patterns do not predict the correct hyphenation are included with the Plain TeX format additional ones can be specified by the user br br br Metafont br br Metafont not strictly part of TeX is a font description system which allows the designer to describe characters algorithmically It uses B zier curves in a fairly standard way to generate the actual characters to be displayed but Knuth devotes substantial attention to the rasterizing problem on bitmapped displays Another thesis by John Hobby further explores this problem of digitizing brush trajectories This term derives from the fact that Metafont describes characters as having been drawn by abstract brushes and erasers It is commonly believed that TeX is based on bitmap fonts but in fact these programs know nothing about the fonts that they are using other than their dimensions It is the responsibility of the device driver to appropriately handle fonts of other types including PostScript Type and TrueType Computer Modern commonly known as the TeX font is freely available in Type format as are the AMS math fonts Users of TeX systems that output directly to PDF such as pdfTeX XeTeX or LuaTeX generally never use Metafont output at all br br br Macro language br TeX documents are written and programmed using an unusual macro language Broadly speaking the running of this macro language involves expansion and execution stages which do not interact directly Expansion includes both literal expansion of macro definitions as well as conditional branching and execution involves such tasks as setting variables registers and the actual typesetting process of adding glyphs to boxes br The definition of a macro not only includes a list of commands but also the syntax of the call It differs with most widely used lexical preprocessors like M in that the body of a macro gets tokenized at definition time br The TeX macro language has been used to write larger document production systems most notably including LaTeX and ConTeXt br br br Development br The original source code for the current TeX software is written in WEB a mixture of documentation written in TeX and a Pascal subset in order to ensure readability and portability For example TeX does all of its dynamic allocation itself from fixed size arrays and uses only fixed point arithmetic for its internal calculations As a result TeX has been ported to almost all operating systems usually by using the web c program to convert the source code into C instead of directly compiling the Pascal code Knuth has kept a very detailed log of all the bugs he has corrected and changes he has made in the program since as of the list contains entries not including the version modification that should be done after his death as the final change in TeX Knuth offers monetary awards to people who find and report a bug in TeX The award per bug started at US one hexadecimal dollar and doubled every year until it was frozen at its current value of Knuth has lost relatively little money as there have been very few bugs claimed In addition recipients have been known to frame their cheque as proof that they found a bug in TeX rather than cashing it br Due to scammers finding scanned copies of his checks on the internet and using them to try to drain his bank account Knuth no longer sends out real checks but those who submit bug reports can get credit at The Bank of San Serriffe instead br br br Distributions and extensions br TeX is usually provided in the form of an easy to install bundle of TeX itself along with Metafont and all the necessary fonts documents formats and utilities needed to use the typesetting system On UNIX compatible systems including Linux and Apple macOS TeX is distributed as part of the larger TeX Live distribution Prior to TeX Live the teTeX distribution was the de facto standard on UNIX compatible systems On Microsoft Windows there is the MiKTeX distribution enhanced by proTeXt and the Microsoft Windows version of TeX Live br Several document processing systems are based on TeX notably jadeTeX which uses TeX as a backend for printing from James Clark s DSSSL Engine the Arbortext publishing system and Texinfo the GNU documentation processing system TeX has been the official typesetting package for the GNU operating system since br Numerous extensions and companion programs for TeX exist among them BibTeX for bibliographies distributed with LaTeX pdfTeX a TeX compatible engine which can directly produce PDF output as well as continuing to support the original DVI output XeTeX a TeX compatible engine that supports Unicode and OpenType and LuaTeX a Unicode aware extension to TeX that includes a Lua runtime with extensive hooks into the underlying TeX routines and algorithms Most TeX extensions are available for free from CTAN the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network br br br Editors br br There are a variety of editors designed to work with TeX br br The TeXmacs text editor is a WYSIWYG WYSIWYM scientific text editor inspired by both TeX and Emacs It uses Knuth s fonts and can generate TeX output br Overleaf is a partial WYSIWYG online editor that provides a cloud based solution to TeX along with additional features in real time collaborative editing br LyX is a WYSIWYM document processor which runs on a variety of platforms including br Linux br Microsoft Windows newer versions require Windows or later br Apple macOS using a non native Qt front end br TeXShop for macOS TeXworks for Linux macOS and Windows and WinShell for Windows are similar tools and provide an integrated development environment IDE for working with LaTeX or TeX For KDE Qt Kile provides such an IDE br Texmaker is the Pure Qt equivalent of Kile with a user interface that is nearly the same as Kile s br TeXstudio is an open source fork of Texmaker that offers a different approach to configurability and features Free downloadable binaries are provided for Windows Linux macOS OS and FreeBSD br GNU Emacs has various built in and third party packages with support for TeX the major one being AUCTeX br Visual Studio Code A notable extension is LaTeX Workshop br For Vim possible plugins include Vim LaTeX Suite Automatic TeX and TeX br For Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice iMath and TexMaths extensions can provide mathematical TeX typesetting br For MediaWiki the Math extension provides mathematical TeX typesetting but the code needs to be surrounded by math tag br br br License br Donald Knuth has indicated several times that the source code of TeX has been placed into the public domain and he strongly encourages modifications or experimentations with this source code However since Knuth highly values the reproducibility of the output of all versions of TeX any changed version must not be called TeX or anything confusingly similar To enforce this rule any implementation of the system must pass a test suite called the TRIP test before being allowed to be called TeX The question of license is somewhat confused by the statements included at the beginning of the TeX source code which indicate that all rights are reserved Copying of this file is authorized only if you make absolutely no changes to your copy This restriction should be interpreted as a prohibition to change the source code as long as the file is called tex web The copyright note at the beginning of tex web and mf web was changed in to explicitly state this This interpretation is confirmed later in the source code when the TRIP test is mentioned If this program is changed the resulting system should not be called TeX The American Mathematical Society tried in the early s to claim a trademark for TeX This was rejected because at the time TEX all caps was registered by Honeywell for the Text EXecutive text processing system br br br XML publication br It is possible to use TeX for automatic generation of sophisticated layout for XML data The differences in syntax between the two description languages can be overcome with the help of TeXML In the context of XML publication TeX can thus be considered an alternative to XSL FO TeX allowed scientific papers in mathematical disciplines to be reduced to relatively small files that could be rendered client side allowing fully typeset scientific papers to be exchanged over the early Internet and emerging World Wide Web even when sending large files was difficult This paved the way for the creation of repositories of scientific papers such as arXiv through which papers could be published without an intermediary publisher br br br Pronunciation and spelling br The name TeX is intended by its developer to be pronounced with the final consonant of loch The letters of the name are meant to represent the capital Greek letters tau epsilon and chi as TeX is an abbreviation of techn Greek for both art and craft which is also the root word of technical English speakers often pronounce it like the first syllable of technical Knuth instructs that it be typeset with the E below the baseline and reduced spacing between the letters This is done as Knuth mentions in his TeXbook to distinguish TeX from other system names such as TEX the Text EXecutive processor developed by Honeywell Information Systems Fans like to proliferate names from the word TeX such as TeXnician user of TeX software TeXhacker TeX programmer TeXmaster competent TeX programmer TeXhax and TeXnique br br br Community br br Notable entities in the TeX community include the TeX Users Group TUG which currently publishes TUGboat and formerly published The PracTeX Journal covering a wide range of topics in digital typography relevant to TeX The Deutschsprachige Anwendervereinigung TeX DANTE is a large user group in Germany The TeX Users Group was founded in for educational and scientific purposes provides an organization for those who have an interest in typography and font design and are users of the TeX typesetting system invented by Knuth The TeX Users Group represents the interests of TeX users worldwide The TeX Users Group publishes the journal TUGboat three times per year DANTE publishes Die TeXnische Kom die four times per year Other user groups include DK TUG in Denmark GUTenberg
