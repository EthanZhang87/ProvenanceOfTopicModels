title: International Components for Unicode
id: 1296785
International Components for Unicode ICU is an open source project of mature C C and Java libraries for Unicode support software internationalization and software globalization ICU is widely portable to many operating systems and environments It gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C C and Java software The ICU project is a technical committee of the Unicode Consortium and sponsored supported and used by IBM and many other companies ICU has been included as a standard component with Microsoft Windows since Windows version br ICU provides the following services Unicode text handling full character properties and character set conversions Unicode regular expressions full Unicode sets character word and line boundaries language sensitive collation and searching normalization upper and lowercase conversion and script transliterations comprehensive locale data and resource bundle architecture via the Common Locale Data Repository CLDR multiple calendars and time zones and rule based formatting and parsing of dates times numbers currencies and messages ICU provided complex text layout service for Arabic Hebrew Indic and Thai historically but that was deprecated in version and was completely removed in version in favor of HarfBuzz br ICU provides more extensive internationalization facilities than the standard libraries for C and C Future ICU planned for April will require C up from C or C up from C depending on what languages is used ICU has historically used UTF and still does only for Java while for C C UTF is supported including the correct handling of illegal UTF br ICU has improved significant changes for GB compliance support i e for Chinese that updated Chinese GB Unicode Transformation Format standard is slightly incompatible has a modified character conversion table mapping some GB characters to Unicode characters that were encoded after GB and has a number of other changes such as improving Japanese and Korean short text line breaking and in English the name T rkiye is now used for the country instead of Turkey the alternate spelling is also available in the data br ICU updates to Unicode including new characters emoji security mechanisms and corresponding APIs and implementations br ICU and CLDR are major releases including a new version of Unicode and major locale data improvements Of the many changes some are for person name formatting or for improved language support e g for Low German and there s e g a new spoof checker API following the latest version Unicode UTS Unicode Security Mechanism br br br Older version details br ICU updated to Unicode and to latest In many formatting patterns ASCII spaces are replaced with Unicode spaces e g a thin space ICU ICU J now requires Java but Most of the ICU library code should still work with Java Android API level but we no longer test with Java ICU added e g phrase based line breaking for Japanese earlier methods didn t work well for short Japanese text such as in titles and headings and support for Hindi written in Latin letters hi Latn also referred to as Hinglish ICU added e g support for emoji properties of strings and can now be built and used with C compilers and ICU operator and operator functions now return bool instead of UBool as an adjustment for incompatible changes in C and as of that version the minimum Windows version is Windows ICU handles removal of Great Britain from the EU ICU added support for Unicode i e the single new symbol for current Japanese Reiwa era but support for it has also been backported to older ICU versions down to ICU ICU with Unicode support is the last version to support older platforms such as Windows XP and Windows Vista Support for AIX Solaris and z OS may also be limited in later versions i e building depends on compiler support br br br Origin and development br After Taligent became part of IBM in early Sun Microsystems decided that the new Java language should have better support for internationalization Since Taligent had experience with such technologies and were close geographically their Text and International group were asked to contribute the international classes to the Java Development Kit as part of the JDK internationalization APIs A large portion of this code still exists in the java text and java util packages Further internationalization features were added with each later release of Java br The Java internationalization classes were then ported to C and C as part of a library known as ICU C ICU for C The ICU project also provides ICU J ICU for Java which adds features not present in the standard Java libraries ICU C and ICU J are very similar though not identical for example ICU C includes a Regular Expression API while ICU J does not Both frameworks have been enhanced over time to support new facilities and new features of Unicode and Common Locale Data Repository CLDR br ICU was released as an open source project in under the name IBM Classes for Unicode It was later renamed to International Components For Unicode In May the ICU project joined the Unicode consortium as technical committee ICU TC and the library sources are now distributed under the Unicode license br br br MessageFormat br A part of ICU is the MessageFormat class a formatting system that allows for any number of arguments to control the plural form plural selectordinal or more general switch case style selection select for things like grammatical gender These statements can be nested ICU MessageFormat was created by adding the plural and selection system to an identically named system in Java SE br br br Alternatives br An alternative for using ICU with C or to using it directly is to use Boost Locale which is a C wrapper for ICU while also allowing other backends The claim for using it rather than ICU directly is that is absolutely unfriendly to C developers It ignores popular C idioms the STL RTTI exceptions etc instead mostly mimicking the Java API Another claim that ICU only supports UTF and thus a reason to avoid using ICU is no longer true with ICU now also supporting UTF for C and C
