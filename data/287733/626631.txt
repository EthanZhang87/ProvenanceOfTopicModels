Extensible Application Markup Language XAML is a declarative XML based language developed by Microsoft for initializing structured values and objects It is available under Microsoft s Open Specification Promise br XAML is used extensively in Windows Presentation Foundation WPF Silverlight Workflow Foundation WF Windows UI Library WinUI Universal Windows Platform UWP and NET Multi platform App UI NET MAUI In WPF and UWP XAML is a user interface markup language to define UI elements data binding and events In WF however XAML defines workflows br XAML elements map directly to Common Language Runtime CLR object instances while XAML attributes map to CLR properties and events on those objects br Anything that is created or implemented in XAML can be expressed using a more traditional NET language such as C or Visual Basic NET However a key aspect of the technology is the reduced complexity needed for tools to process XAML because it is based on XML br br br Technology br XAML originally stood for Extensible Avalon Markup Language Avalon being the code name for Windows Presentation Foundation WPF Before the end of NET Framework development however Microsoft adopted XAML for Workflow Foundation WF br In WPF XAML describes visual user interfaces WPF allows for the definition of both D and D objects rotations animations and a variety of other effects and features A XAML file can be compiled into a Binary Application Markup Language BAML file which may be inserted as a resource into a NET Framework assembly At run time the framework engine extracts the BAML file from assembly resources parses it and creates a corresponding WPF visual tree or workflow br In WF contexts XAML describes potentially long running declarative logic such as those created by process modeling tools and rules systems The serialization format for workflows was previously called XOML to differentiate it from UI markup use of XAML but now they are no longer distinguished However the file extension for files containing the workflow markup is still xoml br XAML uses a specific way to define look and feel called Templates differing from Cascading Style Sheet syntax it is closer to XBL br To create XAML files one could use Microsoft Expression Blend Microsoft Visual Studio the hostable WF visual designer or XAMLPad br br br Examples br br This Windows Presentation Foundation example shows the text Hello world in the top level XAML container called Canvas br br The schema the xmlns http schemas microsoft com part may have to be changed to work on your computer br Using a schema that Microsoft recommends the example can also be br br A crucial part of utilizing XAML to its full potential is making appropriate usage of binding as well as being comfortable with creating your own custom user elements as required for your specific needs Binding can be done as follows br br br Differences between versions of XAML br There are three main Microsoft implementations of XAML br br Windows Presentation Foundation WPF first available with NET Framework br Silverlight and first available for Internet Explorer and now deprecated br Windows UI Library formerly UWP XAML and WinRT XAML first shipped with Windows and Windows Server but now available as a part of the Windows App SDK br These versions have some differences in the parsing behavior Additionally the Silverlight XAML parser is not backward compatible with Silverlight files Silverlight XAML files may be rejected or parsed differently by the Silverlight parser br br br XAML Applications in Web Browsers br Historically XAML based applications could be run in some web browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox This could be achieved through XBAP files created from WPF applications or via the Silverlight browser plugin However both these methods are now unsupported on all major browsers due to their reliance on the discontinued NPAPI browser plugin interface br br br Lock in Concerns br In European Committee for Interoperable Systems ECIS a coalition of mostly American software companies accused Microsoft of attempting to hijack HTML and replace it with XAML thus creating a vendor lock in Jeremy Reimer writing for Ars Technica described this comment as the most egregious error and added that XAML is unlikely to ever replace HTML br br br See also br List of user interface markup languages br Comparison of user interface markup languages br br Interface Builder br Layout manager br br br br br br External links br br XAML Language Reference br XAML for UWP Overview br XAML for WPF Overview br System Windows Markup Namespace br System Xaml Namespace
