The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification IGES is a vendor neutral file format that allows the digital exchange of information among computer aided design CAD systems It is an ASCII based textual format br The official title of IGES is Digital Representation for Communication of Product Definition Data first published in March by the U S National Bureau of Standards as NBSIR Many documents like early versions of the Defense Standards MIL PRF and MIL STD referred to it as ASME Y M the designation of the ANSI committee that approved IGES Version br Using IGES a CAD user can exchange product data models in the form of circuit diagrams wireframe freeform surface boundary B rep or solid modeling CSG representations Applications supported by IGES include traditional engineering drawings models for analysis and other manufacturing functions br br br History br IGES was an initiative of the United States Air Force USAF Integrated Computer Aided Manufacturing ICAM project br ICAM sought to develop procedures IDEF processes Group Technology and software CAD CAM that would integrate all operations in Aerospace manufacturing and thus greatly reduce costs Earlier the USAF Manufacturing Technology Program had funded the Automatically Programmed Tools APT language for programming Numerically Controlled NC machine tools To close the data gap between parts design and manufacturing one of the ICAM goals was to develop CAD software that would automatically generate numerical control programs for the very complex Computer Numerically Controlled CNC machine tools used throughout the Aerospace industry A serious issue was the incompatibility of data produced by the many CAD systems in use at the time USAF ICAM called a meeting at the National Bureau of Standards now known as National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST in to address this issue Boeing offered to sell its CAD translation software to USAF for one United States dollar USAF accepted this offer and contracted NIST to bring together a group of users and vendors including Boeing General Electric Xerox Computervision Applicon and others to further develop and test this software Though it was the practice to begin the name of ICAM developments with the word integrated for example the IDEFs believing that there would be rapid development of graphical exchange software USAF decided that the IGES would be the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification not the Integrated Graphics Exchange Specification br Since the DoD has required that all digital product and manufacturing information PMI for weapons systems contracts the engineering drawings circuit diagrams etc be delivered in electronic form such as IGES format As a result CAx software vendors who want to market their products to DoD subcontractors and their partners needed to support the import reading and export writing of IGES format files br An ANSI standard since IGES has been used in the automotive aerospace and shipbuilding industries It has been used for weapons systems from Trident missile guidance systems to entire aircraft carriers These part models may have to be used years after the vendor of the original design system has gone out of business IGES files provide a way to access this data decades from now Today plugin viewers for Web browsers allow IGES files created years ago to be viewed from anywhere in the world br After the initial release of STEP ISO in interest in further development of IGES declined and Version was the last published standard br br br File format br An IGES file is composed of character ASCII records a record length derived from the punched card era Text strings are represented in Hollerith format the number of characters in the string followed by the letter H followed by the text string e g HSLOT this is the text string format used in early versions of the Fortran language Early IGES translators had problems with IBM mainframe computers because the mainframes used EBCDIC encoding for text and some EBCDIC ASCII translators would either substitute the wrong character or improperly set the parity bit causing a misread br Here is a very small IGES file from containing only two POINT Type two CIRCULAR ARC Type and two LINE Type entities It represents a slot with the points at the centers of the two half circles that form the ends of the slot and the two lines that form the sides br br S br H H HSLOT H DUA IGESLIB BDRAFT B I SLOT IGS G br HBravo BravoDRAFT HBravo IGES V Oct G br HSLOT HINCH H E G br HD A Harrod Tel HAPPLICON Ann Arbor MI G br

indicated by the characters S G D P or T in column The characteristics and geometric information for an entity is split between two sections one in a two record fixed length format the Directory Entry or DE Section the other in a multiple record comma delimited format the Parameter Data or PD Section as can be seen in a more human readable representation of the file br When displayed the user should see two yellow points hard to see on a white background but most CAD systems use a black background one located at the origin of model space two red circular arcs and two green lines br br br Foreign language support br br Due to its growing international popularity several countries including Australia and the UK adopted IGES as their own National Standards for PMI interoperability support was added to the TEXT Type entity to support the ISO Latin alphabet for European characters br In the s IGES added support for the JIS encoding for Kanji as double byte characters JIS allowing members of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association JAMA to exchange part models with their American and European partners without loss of the Kanji text br The current version of IGES does not support Unicode or bit character encoding so Arabic and other scripts like Thai cannot be represented br br br A recursive standard br One of the unique features of the IGES standard is that it was the first ANSI standard to be documented using itself Since Version all of the technical illustrations for the printed version of the standard have been generated from IGES files The electronic publishing system LaTeX integrates raster images generated from IGES files into the PostScript sent to the laser printer so text and images are printed on the same page for subsequent use as camera ready copy for commercial publication Beginning with IGES Version this is how the standard was generated and Version the most recent ANSI approved version is available as a PDF document br Many of the illustrations all of which conform to the Defense Department s MIL D Engineering Drawings Subset of IGES use the entities that they describe e g the illustration of the LEADER ARROW ENTITY Type can be used as a test case for translator implementers because it contains all arrow head styles defined by the standard These WYSIWYG example files can be distinguished by a leading F and trailing X in the file name like f x igs and this library is called the IGES X files by members of the IGES community br Here is one of the example figures Figure from Appendix A fmeparte igs that has appeared in every version of IGES since Version It uses linear angular and ordinate dimension entities as well as examples of both circular and conic arcs It is usually the first part used when testing an IGES translator because the standard has a picture of what it should look like br br br See also br br ISO br br br br br Notes br Nagel Roger N Braithwaite Walt W Kennicott Philip R Initial Graphics
