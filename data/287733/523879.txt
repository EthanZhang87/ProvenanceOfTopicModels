title: Simply connected space
id: 523879
In topology a topological space is called simply connected or connected or simply connected if it is path connected and every path between two points can be continuously transformed into any other such path while preserving the two endpoints in question Intuitively this corresponds to a space that has no disjoint parts and no holes that go completely through it because two paths going around different sides of such a hole cannot be continuously transformed into each other The fundamental group of a topological space is an indicator of the failure for the space to be simply connected a path connected topological space is simply connected if and only if its fundamental group is trivial br br br Definition and equivalent formulations br br A topological space br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br is called simply connected if it is path connected and any loop in br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br defined by br br br br f br br br S br br br br br br X br br br displaystyle f S to X br br can be contracted to a point there exists a continuous map br br br br F br br br D br br br br br br X br br br displaystyle F D to X br br such that br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br restricted to br br br br br S br br br br br br br displaystyle S br br is br br br br f br br br br displaystyle f br br Here br br br br br S br br br br br br br displaystyle S br br and br br br br br D br br br br br br br displaystyle D br br denotes the unit circle and closed unit disk in the Euclidean plane respectively br An equivalent formulation is this br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br is simply connected if and only if it is path connected and whenever br br br br p br br br br br br br br X br br br displaystyle p to X br br and br br br br q br br br br br br br br X br br br displaystyle q to X br br are two paths that is continuous maps with the same start and endpoint br br br br p br br br br br q br br br br br br displaystyle p q br br and br br br br p br br br br br q br br br br br br displaystyle p q br br then br br br br p br br br displaystyle p br br can be continuously deformed into br br br br q br br br displaystyle q br br while keeping both endpoints fixed Explicitly there exists a homotopy br br br br F br br br br br br br br br br br br br br X br br br displaystyle F times to X br br such that br br br br F br br x br br br br br p br br x br br br br displaystyle F x p x br br and br br br br F br br x br br br br br q br br x br br br br br displaystyle F x q x br br br A topological space br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br is simply connected if and only if br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br is path connected and the fundamental group of br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br at each point is trivial i e consists only of the identity element Similarly br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br is simply connected if and only if for all points br br br br x br br y br br X br br br br displaystyle x y in X br br the set of morphisms br br br br br Hom br br br br X br br br br br br x br br y br br br br displaystyle operatorname Hom Pi X x y br br in the fundamental groupoid of br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br has only one element br In complex analysis an open subset br br br br X br br br C br br br br displaystyle X subseteq mathbb C br br is simply connected if and only if both br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br and its complement in the Riemann sphere are connected The set of complex numbers with imaginary part strictly greater than zero and less than one furnishes an example of an unbounded connected open subset of the plane whose complement is not connected It is nevertheless simply connected A relaxation of the requirement that br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br be connected leads to an exploration of open subsets of the plane with connected extended complement For example a not necessarily connected open set has a connected extended complement exactly when each of its connected components is simply connected br br br Informal discussion br Informally an object in our space is simply connected if it consists of one piece and does not have any holes that pass all the way through it For example neither a doughnut nor a coffee cup with a handle is simply connected but a hollow rubber ball is simply connected In two dimensions a circle is not simply connected but a disk and a line are Spaces that are connected but not simply connected are called non simply connected or multiply connected br br The definition rules out only handle shaped holes A sphere or equivalently a rubber ball with a hollow center is simply connected because any loop on the surface of a sphere can contract to a point even though it has a hole in the hollow center The stronger condition that the object has no holes of any dimension is called contractibility br br br Examples br br The Euclidean plane br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br is simply connected but br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br minus the origin br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br is not If br br br br n br br br br br br displaystyle n br br then both br br br br br br R br br br n br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R n br br and br br br br br br R br br br n br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R n br br minus the origin are simply connected br Analogously the n dimensional sphere br br br br br S br br n br br br br br displaystyle S n br br is simply connected if and only if br br br br n br br br br br displaystyle n geq br br br Every convex subset of br br br br br br R br br br n br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R n br br is simply connected br A torus the elliptic cylinder the M bius strip the projective plane and the Klein bottle are not simply connected br Every topological vector space is simply connected this includes Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces br For br br br br n br br br br br br displaystyle n geq br br the special orthogonal group br br br br SO br br br n br br br R br br br br br displaystyle operatorname SO n mathbb R br br is not simply connected and the special unitary group br br br br SU br br br n br br br br displaystyle operatorname SU n br br is simply connected br The one point compactification of br br br br br R br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br is not simply connected even though br br br br br R br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br is simply connected br The long line br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br is simply connected but its compactification the extended long line br br br br br L br br br br br br br displaystyle L br br is not since it is not even path connected br br br Properties br A surface two dimensional topological manifold is simply connected if and only if it is connected and its genus the number of handles of the surface is br A universal cover of any suitable space br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br is a simply connected space which maps to br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br via a covering map br If br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br and br br br br Y br br br displaystyle Y br br are homotopy equivalent and br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br is simply connected then so is br br br br Y br br br br displaystyle Y br br br The image of a simply connected set under a continuous function need not be simply connected Take for example the complex plane under the exponential map the image is br br br br br C br br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb C setminus br br which is not simply connected br The notion of simple connectedness is important in complex analysis because of the following facts br br The Cauchy s integral theorem states that if br br br br U br br br displaystyle U br br is a simply connected open subset of the complex plane br br br br br C br br br br br displaystyle mathbb C br br and br br br br f br br U br br br C br br br br displaystyle f U to mathbb C br br is a holomorphic function then br br br br f br br br displaystyle f br br has an antiderivative br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br on br br br br U br br br br displaystyle U br br and the value of every line integral in br br br br U br br br displaystyle U br br with integrand br br br br f br br br displaystyle f br br depends only on the end points br br br br u br br br displaystyle u br br and br br br br v br br br displaystyle v br br of the path and can be computed as br br br br F br br v br br br F br br u br br br br br displaystyle F v F u br br The integral thus does not depend on the particular path connecting br br br br u br br br displaystyle u br br and br br br br v br br br br displaystyle v br br br The Riemann mapping theorem states that any non empty open simply connected subset of br br br br br C br br br br displaystyle mathbb C br br except for br br br br br C br br br br displaystyle mathbb C br br itself is conformally equivalent to the unit disk br The notion of simple connectedness is also a
