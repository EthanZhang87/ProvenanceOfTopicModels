id: 245719
A Creative Commons CC license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work A CC license is used when an author wants to give other people the right to share use and build upon a work that the author has created CC provides an author flexibility for example they might choose to allow only non commercial uses of a given work and protects the people who use or redistribute an author s work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work br There are several types of Creative Commons licenses Each license differs by several combinations that condition the terms of distribution They were initially released on December by Creative Commons a U S non profit corporation founded in There have also been five versions of the suite of licenses numbered through Released in November the license suite is the most current While the Creative Commons license was originally grounded in the American legal system there are now several Creative Commons jurisdiction ports which accommodate international laws br In October the Open Knowledge Foundation approved the Creative Commons CC BY CC BY SA and CC licenses as conformant with the Open Definition for content and data br br br History br br Lawrence Lessig and Eric Eldred designed the Creative Commons License CCL in because they saw a need for a license between the existing modes of copyright and public domain status Version of the licenses was officially released on December br br br Origins br The CCL allows inventors to keep the rights to their innovations while also allowing for some external use of the invention The CCL emerged as a reaction to the decision in Eldred v Ashcroft in which the United States Supreme Court ruled constitutional provisions of the Copyright Term Extension Act that extended the copyright term of works to be the last living author s lifespan plus an additional years br br br License porting br The original non localized Creative Commons licenses were written with the U S legal system in mind therefore the wording may be incompatible with local legislation in other jurisdictions rendering the licenses unenforceable there To address this issue Creative Commons asked its affiliates to translate the various licenses to reflect local laws in a process called porting As of July Creative Commons licenses have been ported to over jurisdictions worldwide br br br International use br br br Chinese use br Working with Creative Commons the Chinese government adapted the Creative Commons License to the Chinese context replacing the individual monetary compensation of U S copyright law with incentives to Chinese innovators to innovate as a social contribution br br br Applicable works br br Work licensed under a Creative Commons license is governed by applicable copyright law This allows Creative Commons licenses to be applied to all work falling under copyright including books plays movies music articles photographs blogs and websites br br br Software br While software is also governed by copyright law and CC licenses are applicable the CC recommends against using it in software specifically due to backward compatibility limitations with existing commonly used software licenses Instead developers may resort to use more software friendly free and open source software FOSS software licenses Outside the FOSS licensing use case for software there are several usage examples to utilize CC licenses to specify a Freeware license model examples are The White Chamber Mari or Assault Cube Despite the status of CC as the most free copyright license the Free Software Foundation does not recommend releasing software into the public domain using the CC due to patent concerns br However application of a Creative Commons license may not modify the rights allowed by fair use or fair dealing or exert restrictions which violate copyright exceptions Furthermore Creative Commons licenses are non exclusive and non revocable Any work or copies of the work obtained under a Creative Commons license may continue to be used under that license br When works are protected by more than one Creative Commons license the user may choose any of them br br br Preconditions br The author or the licensor in case the author did a contractual transfer of rights needs to have the exclusive rights on the work If the work has already been published under a public license it can be uploaded by any third party once more on another platform by using a compatible license and making reference and attribution to the original license e g by referring to the URL of the original license br br br Consequences br The license is non exclusive royalty free and unrestricted in terms of territory and duration so it is irrevocable unless a new license is granted by the author after the work has been significantly modified Any use of the work that is not covered by other copyright rules triggers the public license Upon activation of the license the licensee must adhere to all conditions of the license otherwise the license agreement is illegitimate and the licensee would commit a copyright infringement The author or the licensor as a proxy has the legal rights to act upon any copyright infringement The licensee has a limited period to correct any non compliance br br br Types of licenses br br br Four rights br The CC licenses all grant baseline rights such as the right to distribute the copyrighted work worldwide for non commercial purposes and without modification In addition different versions of license prescribe different rights as shown in this table br br The last two clauses are not free content licenses according to definitions such as DFSG or the Free Software Foundation s standards and cannot be used in contexts that require these freedoms such as Wikipedia For software Creative Commons includes three free licenses created by other institutions the BSD License the GNU LGPL and the GNU GPL br Mixing and matching these conditions produces sixteen possible combinations of which eleven are valid Creative Commons licenses and five are not Of the five invalid combinations four include both the ND and SA clauses which are mutually exclusive and one includes none of the clauses Of the eleven valid combinations the five that lack the BY clause have been retired because of licensors requested attribution though they do remain available for reference on the website This leaves six regularly used licenses plus the CC public domain declaration br br br Six regularly used licenses br br The six licenses in most frequent use are shown in the following table Among them those accepted by the Wikimedia Foundation the public domain dedication and two attribution BY and BY SA licenses allow the sharing and remixing creating derivative works including for commercial use so long as attribution is given br br br Zero public domain br br Besides copyright licenses Creative Commons also offers CC a tool for relinquishing copyright and releasing material into the public domain CC is a legal tool for waiving as many rights as legally possible Or when not legally possible CC acts as fallback as public domain equivalent license Development of CC began in and it was released in A major target of the license was the scientific data community br In Creative Commons announced its Public Domain Mark a tool for labeling works already in the public domain Together CC and the Public Domain Mark replace the Public Domain Dedication and Certification which took a U S centric approach and co mingled distinct operations br In the Free Software Foundation added CC to its free software licenses However the Free Software Foundation currently does not recommend using CC to release software into the public domain because it explicitly does not grant a patent license br In February CC was submitted to Open Source Initiative OSI for their approval However controversy arose over its clause which excluded from the scope of the license any relevant patents held by the copyright holder This clause was added for scientific data rather than software but some members of the OSI believed it could weaken users defenses against software patents As a result Creative Commons withdrew their submission and the license is not currently approved by the OSI br From to the stock photography website Unsplash used the CC license distributing several million free photos a month Lawrence Lessig the founder of Creative Commons has contributed to the site Unsplash moved from using the CC license to a custom license in June and to an explicitly nonfree license in January br In October the Open Knowledge Foundation approved the Creative Commons CC as conformant with the Open Definition and recommend the license to dedicate content to the public domain br In July Fedora Linux disallowed software licensed under CC due to patent rights explicitly not being waived under the license br br br Retired licenses br Due to either disuse or criticism a number of previously offered Creative Commons licenses have since been retired and are no longer recommended for new works The retired licenses include all licenses lacking the Attribution element other than CC as well as the following four licenses br br Developing Nations License a license which only applies to developing countries deemed to be non high income economies by the World Bank Full copyright restrictions apply to people in other countries br Sampling parts of the work can be used for any purpose other than advertising but the whole work cannot be copied or modified br Sampling Plus parts of the work can be copied and modified for any purpose other than advertising and the entire work can be copied for noncommercial purposes br NonCommercial Sampling Plus the whole work or parts of the work can be copied and modified for non commercial purposes br br br Version br br The latest version of the Creative Commons licenses released on November are generic licenses that are applicable to most jurisdictions and do not usually require ports No new ports have been implemented in version of the license Version discourages using ported versions and instead acts as a single global license br br br Rights and obligations br br br Attribution br Since all current licenses other than the CC variant require attribution of the original author as signified by the BY component as in the preposition by The attribution must be given to the best of one s ability using the information available Creative Commons suggests the mnemonic TASL title author source web link CC licence Generally this implies the following br br Include any copyright notices if applicable If the work itself contains any copyright notices placed there by the copyright holder those notices must be left intact or reproduced in a way that is reasonable to the medium in which the work is being re published br Cite the author s name screen name or user ID etc If the work is being published on the Internet it is nice to link that name to the person s profile page if such a page exists br Cite the work s title or name if applicable if such a thing exists If the work is being published on the Internet it is nice to link the name or title directly to the original work br Cite the specific CC license the work is under If the work is being published on the Internet it is nice if the license citation links to the license on the CC website br Mention if the work is a derivative work or adaptation In addition to the above one needs to identify that their work is a derivative work e g This is a Finnish translation of original work by author or Screenplay based on original work by author br br br Non commercial licenses br br The NonCommercial license allows image creators to restrict selling and profiting from their works by other parties and thus maintaining free of charge access to images br The non commercial option included in some Creative Commons licenses is controversial in definition as it is sometimes unclear what can be considered a non commercial setting and application since its restrictions differ from the principles of open content promoted by other permissive licenses In Wikimedia Deutschland published a guide to using Creative Commons licenses as wiki pages for translations and as PDF br br br Adaptability br br Rights in an adaptation can be expressed by a CC license that is compatible with the status or licensing of the original work or works on which the adaptation is based br br br Legal aspects br The legal implications of large numbers of works having Creative Commons licensing are difficult to predict and there is speculation that media creators often lack insight to be able to choose the license which best meets their intent in applying it br Some works licensed using Creative Commons licenses have been involved in several court cases Creative Commons itself was not a party to any of these cases they only involved licensors or licensees of Creative Commons licenses When the cases went as far as decisions by judges that is they were not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or were not settled privately out of court they have all validated the legal robustness of Creative Commons public licenses br br br Dutch tabloid br In early podcaster Adam Curry sued a Dutch tabloid who published photos from Curry s Flickr page without Curry s permission The photos were licensed under the Creative Commons Non Commercial license While the verdict was in favor of Curry the tabloid avoided having to pay restitution to him as long as they did not repeat the offense Professor Bernt Hugenholtz main creator of the Dutch CC license and director of the Institute for Information Law of the University of Amsterdam commented The Dutch Court s decision is especially noteworthy because it confirms that the conditions of a Creative Commons license automatically apply to the content licensed under it and binds users of such content even without expressly agreeing to or having knowledge of the conditions of the license br br br Virgin Mobile br In Virgin Mobile Australia launched an advertising campaign promoting their cellphone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to Flickr using a Creative Commons BY Attribution license Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity as long as the original creator was attributed credit without any other compensation required Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL leading to the photographer s Flickr page on each of their ads However one picture depicting year old Alison Chang at a fund raising carwash for her church caused some controversy when she sued Virgin Mobile The photo was taken by Alison s church youth counselor Justin Ho Wee Wong who uploaded the image to Flickr under the Creative Commons license In the case concerning personality rights rather than copyright as such was thrown out of a Texas court for lack of jurisdiction br br br SGAE vs Fern ndez br In the fall of the collecting society Sociedad General de Autores y Editores SGAE in Spain sued Ricardo Andr s Utrera Fern ndez owner of a disco bar located in Badajoz who played CC licensed music SGAE argued that Fern ndez should pay royalties for public performance of the music between November and August The Lower Court rejected the collecting society s claims because the owner of the bar proved that the music he was using was not managed by the society br In February the Cultural Association Ladinamo based in Madrid and represented by Javier de la Cueva was granted the use of copyleft music in their public activities The sentence said br br Admitting the existence of music equipment a joint evaluation of the evidence practiced this court is convinced that the defendant prevents communication of works whose management is entrusted to the plaintiff SGAE using a repertoire of authors who have not assigned the exploitation of their rights to the SGAE having at its disposal a database for that purpose and so it is manifested both by the legal representative of the Association and by Manuela Villa Acosta in charge of the cultural programming of the association which is compatible with the alternative character of the Association and its integration in the movement called copy left br br br GateHouse Media Inc v That s Great News LLC br On June GateHouse Media filed a lawsuit against That s Great News GateHouse Media owns a number of local newspapers including Rockford Register Star which is based in Rockford Illinois That s Great News makes plaques out of newspaper articles and sells them to the people featured in the articles GateHouse sued That s Great News for copyright infringement and breach of contract GateHouse claimed that TGN violated the non commercial and no derivative works restrictions on GateHouse Creative Commons licensed work when TGN published the material on its website The case was settled on August though the settlement was not made public br br br Drauglis v Kappa Map Group LLC br In photographer Art Drauglis uploaded several pictures to the photo sharing website Flickr giving them the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike Generic License CC BY SA One photo titled Swain s Lock Montgomery Co MD was downloaded by Kappa Map Group a map making company and published in on the front cover of Montgomery Co Maryland Street Atlas The text Photo Swain s Lock Montgomery Co MD Photographer Carly Lesser Art Drauglis Creative Commoms sic CC BY SA was placed on the back cover but nothing on the front indicated authorship br The validity of the CC BY SA as a license was not in dispute The CC BY SA requires that the licensee to use nothing less restrictive than the CC BY SA terms The atlas was sold commercially and not for free reuse by others The dispute was whether Drauglis license terms that would apply to derivative works applied to the entire atlas Drauglis sued the defendants in June for copyright infringement and license breach seeking declaratory and injunctive relief damages fees and costs Drauglis asserted among other things that Kappa Map Group exceeded the scope of the License because defendant did not publish the Atlas under a license with the same or similar terms as those under which the Photograph was originally licensed The judge dismissed the case on that count ruling that the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph in the sense of the license but rather a collective work Since the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph Kappa Map Group did not need to license the entire atlas under the CC BY SA license The judge also determined that the work had been properly attributed br In particular the judge determined that it was sufficient to credit the author of the photo as prominently as authors of similar authorship such as the authors of individual maps contained in the book and that the name CC BY SA is sufficiently precise to locate the correct license on the internet and can be considered a valid identifier for the license br br br Verband zum Schutz geistigen Eigentums im Internet VGSE br In July German computer magazine LinuxUser reported that a German blogger Christoph Langner used two CC BY licensed photographs from Berlin photographer Dennis Skley on his private blog Linuxundich Langner duly mentioned the author and the license and added a link to the original Langner was later contacted by the Verband zum Schutz geistigen Eigentums im Internet VGSE Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property in the Internet with a demand for for failing to provide the full name of the work the full name of the author the license text and a source link as is required by the fine print in the license Of this sum goes to the photographer and the remainder is retained by VGSE The Higher Regional Court of Cologne dismissed the claim in May br br br Works with a Creative Commons license br br Creative Commons maintains a content directory wiki of organizations and projects using Creative Commons licenses On its website CC also provides case studies of projects using CC licenses across the world CC licensed content can also be accessed through a number of content directories and search engines br br br Unicode symbols br br After being proposed by Creative Commons in Creative Commons license symbols were added to Unicode with version in The circle with an equal sign meaning no derivatives is present in older versions of Unicode unlike all the other symbols br br These symbols can be used in succession to indicate a particular Creative Commons license for example CC BY SA CC Attribution
