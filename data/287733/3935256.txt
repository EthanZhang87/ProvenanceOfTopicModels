Design Web Format DWF is a file format developed by Autodesk for the efficient distribution and communication of rich design data to anyone who needs to view review or print design files Because DWF files are highly compressed they are smaller and faster to transmit than design files without the overhead associated with complex CAD drawings or the management of external links and dependencies With DWF functionality publishers of design data can limit the specific design data and plot styles to only what they want recipients to see and can publish multisheet drawing sets from multiple AutoCAD drawings in a single DWF file They can also publish D models from most Autodesk design applications br DWF files are not a replacement for native CAD formats such as AutoCAD drawings DWG The sole purpose of DWF is to allow designers engineers project managers and their colleagues to communicate design information and design content to anyone needing to view review or print design information without these team members needing to know AutoCAD or other design software br An Autodesk DWF advocate blog cites as DWF s strengths over alternatives that the files have very high mathematical precision and contain meta data for sheets objects and markup data Another significant strength is that comments and markup can be reintroduced to and edited in some Autodesk products such as Revit and AutoCAD br The AutoCAD file format dwfx is based on ISO IEC Open Packaging Conventions br br br Technology br DWF is a file format developed by Autodesk for representing design data in a manner that is independent of the original application software hardware and operating system used to create that design data A DWF file can describe design data containing any combination of text graphics and images in a device independent and resolution independent format These files can be one sheet or multiple sheets very simple or extremely complex with a rich use of fonts graphics color and images The format also includes intelligent metadata that captures the design intent of the data being represented br The DWF technology centers on three components br br C libraries for developers br a viewer for project team members who wish to view design data without knowing AutoCAD br a writer that allows anyone to create a DWF file from any application br br br DWF Toolkit br DWF is an open file format Autodesk publishes the DWF specification and makes available C libraries not available anymore for any developer who wants to build applications around the DWF format with the DWF Toolkit Furthermore DWF is based on other industry standards such as ZLIB XML and common image formats br DWF files since version are a ZIP compressed container for the drawing files despite the first few bytes of the file containing a DWF header renaming a dwf file to zip will allow the component files inside to be viewed with archive compression software Amongst various XML and binary files is a PNG format thumbnail preview br DWF can be interfaced with NET Libraries br br br Design Review br Autodesk Design Review is a free viewing application that enables all members of the project team to easily view measure markup and print designs shared electronically Built around the DWF file format Design Review enables users to view and print complex D and D drawings maps and models published from Autodesk design applications or from the DWF Writer br Also all Markups and Annotations created in Design Review can be imported to the original file when using Autodesk applications such as AutoCAD Inventor or Revit Architectural This feature makes DWF the ideal format for design reviewing and collaboration processes br Although an Autodesk representative stated on the Official Autodesk user Forums in September that the application would be discontinued an update to Autodesk Design Review was released in br br br DWF Writer br Autodesk DWF Writer software publishes the DWF format from CAD applications that do not offer built in DWF publishing such as Bentley MicroStation or Dassault s Solidworks software Autodesk DWF Writer is a Windows printer driver that converts files to DWF format The result is that the entire project team can standardize on a common file format to exchange and review designs and sheet sets at no additional cost br br br Freewheel br In Autodesk introduced an online translator for DWFs called Freewheel Freewheel was a way to view a DWF file without downloading software It was also a web service which offered developers a web based interface for viewing querying and manipulating DWF files br Freewheel has been replaced by the web based viewing and editing web service Autodesk br br br Platforms br Autodesk s DWF viewers except for Freewheel are all based on Microsoft Windows br The DWF Toolkit is available on Microsoft Windows Linux and Mac OS X br br br History br The DWF format first appeared in as part of the unveiling of Autodesk s WHIP Netscape Navigator plug in The format was originally referred to as the Drawing Web Format since DWF files were generated by the Autodesk Internet Publishing Kit As the format grew in use beyond just AutoCAD it was renamed to Design Web Format Although originally a D only format DWF has evolved to include D Today DWF files are generated by all Autodesk products In addition there are a variety of third party applications that make use of the format br br br Alternatives br PDF is an internationally recognized open file format developed by Adobe Systems to allow electronic exchange of any printable document independent of the source application software hardware and operating system PDF E is a subset of v of the PDF specification specifically designed for engineering use br SVG Scalable Vector Graphics is an open XML based file format It is suitable for use both as a format for creating and editing drawings and as a format for viewing and publication For instance Inkscape uses SVG as its native format and both the Firefox and Opera browsers natively display SVG br br br See also br CAD br DWG br DXF br PDF br PDF E br Epaper Portable
