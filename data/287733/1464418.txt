COLLADA for collaborative design activity is an interchange file format for interactive D applications It is managed by the nonprofit technology consortium the Khronos Group and has been adopted by ISO as a publicly available specification ISO PAS br COLLADA defines an open standard XML schema for exchanging digital assets among various graphics software applications that might otherwise store their assets in incompatible file formats COLLADA documents that describe digital assets are XML files usually identified with a dae digital asset exchange filename extension br br br History br Originally created at Sony Computer Entertainment by R mi Arnaud and Mark C Barnes it has since become the property of the Khronos Group a member funded industry consortium which now shares the copyright with Sony The COLLADA schema and specification are freely available from the Khronos Group The COLLADA DOM uses the SCEA Shared Source License br Several graphics companies collaborated with Sony from COLLADA s beginnings to create a tool that would be useful to the widest possible audience and COLLADA continues to evolve through the efforts of Khronos contributors Early collaborators included Alias Systems Corporation Criterion Software Autodesk Inc and Avid Technology Dozens of commercial game studios and game engines have adopted the standard br In March Khronos released the COLLADA Conformance Test Suite CTS The suite allows applications that import and export COLLADA to test against a large suite of examples ensuring that they conform properly to the specification In July the CTS software was released on GitHub allowing for community contributions br ISO PAS Industrial automation systems and integration COLLADA digital asset schema specification for D visualization of industrial data was published in July br br br Software tools br COLLADA was originally intended as an intermediate format for transporting data from one digital content creation DCC tool to another application Applications exist to support the usage of several DCCs including br br br Game engines br Originally intended as an interchange format many game engines now support COLLADA including br br br Applications br Some games and D applications have started to support COLLADA br br br Physics br As of version physics support was added to the COLLADA standard The goal is to allow content creators to define various physical attributes in visual scenes For example one can define surface material properties such as friction Furthermore content creators can define the physical attributes for the objects in the scene This is done by defining the rigid bodies that should be linked to the visual representations More features include support for ragdolls collision volumes physical constraints between physical objects and global physical properties such as gravitation br Physics middleware products that support this standard include Bullet Physics Library Open Dynamics Engine PAL and NVIDIA s PhysX These products support by reading the abstract found in the COLLADA file and transferring it into a form that the middleware can support and represent in a physical simulation This also enables different middleware and tools to exchange physics data in a standardized manner br The Physics Abstraction Layer provides support for COLLADA Physics to multiple physics engines that do not natively provide COLLADA support including JigLib OpenTissue Tokamak physics engine and True Axis PAL also provides support for COLLADA to physics engines that also feature a native interface br br br Versions br October br February br June br January added features such as character skinning and morph targets rigid body dynamics support for OpenGL ES materials and shader effects for multiple shading languages including the Cg programming language GLSL and HLSL First release through Khronos br July primarily a patch release br August added kinematics and B rep as well as some FX redesign and OpenGL ES support Formalised as ISO PAS br br br See also br glTF Graphics Library Transmission Format br FBX Filmbox br List of vector graphics markup languages br Open Game Engine Exchange OpenGEX br Universal Scene Description USD br Universal D U D br VRML br WebGL br X D Extensible D Graphics br br br br br br External links br Official website
