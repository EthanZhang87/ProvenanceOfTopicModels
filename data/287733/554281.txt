title: Haiku (operating system)
id: 554281
Haiku originally OpenBeOS is a free and open source operating system for personal computers It is a community driven continuation of BeOS and aims to be binary compatible with it but is largely a reimplementation with the exception of certain components like the Deskbar The Haiku project began in supported by the nonprofit Haiku Inc and the operating system remains in beta br br br History and project br The OpenBeOS project began by Michael Phipps on August after the announcement of Palm Inc purchasing Be Inc marking the end of BeOS development to support the BeOS user community by creating an open source backward compatible replacement for BeOS Palm refused to license the BeOS code to a third party meaning that OpenBeOS had to be reverse engineered In Phipps founded the non profit organization Haiku Inc in Rochester New York United States to financially support development br In the project held its first North American developers conference WalterCon it was also announced on this day that OpenBeOS was renamed to Haiku to avoid infringing on Palm s trademarks The BeUnited org nonprofit organization which promoted open standards for BeOS compatible operating system projects announced that Haiku would be its reference platform In February the project held a Tech Talk at Googleplex attended by ex Be engineers as well as Jean Louis Gass e who voiced his support for the project There is also an annual conference BeGeistert held in Germany since when BeOS was active br br br Development br Apart from the graphical user interface Tracker and Deskbar which were open sourced with BeOS Haiku is original software The modular design of BeOS allowed individual components of Haiku to initially be developed in teams in relative isolation in many cases developing them as replacements for the BeOS components prior to the completion of other parts of the operating system br The first project by OpenBeOS was a community created stop gap update for BeOS in featuring open source replacement for some BeOS components The kernel of NewOS for x Dreamcast SuperH and PowerPC was successfully forked that same year from which Haiku has been based on since The app server window manager was completed in In July Haiku developer Stephan A mus introduced Icon O Matic an icon editor and a storage format HVIF with a rendering engine based on Anti Grain Geometry The PackageInstaller was created by Lukasz Zemczak at the Google Summer of Code br br Java support was eventually added by a team from BeUnited who had ported it to BeOS followed by WLAN from the FreeBSD stack Alongside a port to GCC the first alpha release finally arrived followed seven years of development After the initial full BeOS compatibility as target a community poll was launched to redefine the future of Haiku beyond a free software refactoring of BeOS from the late s and decided to expand vision to supporting basic contemporary systems and protocols with more ambitious support for modern hardware web standards and compatibility with FLOSS libraries On October Haiku obtained Qt support br The WebPositive browser was first preloaded with Alpha replacing BeZillaBrowser After this much time was spent on building a package management system which went live in September Beta arrived in and one of the most notable new features was the PackageFS and package installation through the HaikuDepot and pkgman Beta was the first official Haiku release to support full package management br Wine was first ported to Haiku in br br br Release history br br br Architecture br br As with BeOS Haiku is written in C and provides an object oriented API The Haiku kernel is a modular hybrid kernel which began as a fork of NewOS a modular monokernel written by former Be Inc engineer Travis Geiselbrecht Many features have been implemented including a virtual file system VFS layer and symmetric multiprocessing SMP support It runs on bit and bit x processors and recently has been ported to RISC V there is also a port for ARM under development but is currently far behind the x port br The application program interface API is based on that of BeOS which is divided into a number of kits which collect related classes together and bear some relation to the library which contains the supporting code In Access Co Ltd the owners of Be Inc s intellectual property released the text of this BeBook under a Creative Commons licence The boot loader is filesystem agnostic and can also chainload GRUB LILO and NTLDR br br Since the Beta release Haiku s memory management includes ASLR DEP and SMAP br Graphics operations and window management is handled by the app server protocol VESA is used as a fallback video output mode Haiku is POSIX compatible and has translation layers for X and Wayland br br br User interface br br The graphical user interface is formed of Tracker a file manager and the Deskbar an always on top taskbar that is placed in the upper right corner of the screen containing a menu tray and a list of running programs Tracker is an evolution from OpenTracker which was released under a license with two addenda restricting the use of Be Inc trademarks Zeta also modified OpenTracker on their own operating system br The icons in Haiku are named stippi and were designed by Stephan A mus A mus also created the Haiku Vector Icon Format HVIF a vector storage format to store icons in Haiku and is aimed at fast rendering and small file sizes br br br Software br Package management is done by the graphical application HaikuDepot and a command line equivalent called pkgman Packages can also be activated by installing them from remote repositories with pkgman or dropping them over a special packages directory Haiku package management mounts activated packages over a read only system directory The Haiku package management system performs dependency solving with libsolv from the openSUSE project br It comes with a number of preloaded applications such as a WebKit based web browser WebPositive a document reader BePDF a simple web server PoorMan text editors Pe and StyledEdit an IRC client Vision and a Bash based terminal emulator Terminal br br br Compatibility with BeOS br Haiku R aims to be compatible with BeOS at both the source and binary level allowing software written and compiled for BeOS to be compiled and run without modification on Haiku The bit version of Haiku however does not have BeOS compatibility at the binary level but the API still does Installation of these PKG format files are done using the PackageInstaller br br br Reception br In after the release of Haiku Alpha Ars Technica reviewed the operating system and praised it for being fast but ultimately stating that it may not be much more than an interesting diversion something to play with on a spare bit of hardware Haiku Beta was reviewed by ZDNET in where it stated Haiku is for those who experienced either NeXT or AfterStep and want an operating system that looks and feels a bit old school but performs faster than any OS they ve ever experienced It further praised Haiku s kernel file system and object oriented API br br br See also br br Comparison
