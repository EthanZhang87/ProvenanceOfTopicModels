PGF TikZ is a pair of languages for producing vector graphics e g technical illustrations and drawings from a geometric algebraic description with standard features including the drawing of points lines arrows paths circles ellipses and polygons PGF is a lower level language while TikZ is a set of higher level macros that use PGF The top level PGF and TikZ commands are invoked as TeX macros but in contrast with PSTricks the PGF TikZ graphics themselves are described in a language that resembles MetaPost Till Tantau is the designer of the PGF and TikZ languages He is also the main developer of the only known interpreter for PGF and TikZ which is written in TeX PGF is an acronym for Portable Graphics Format TikZ was introduced in version of PGF and it is a recursive acronym for TikZ ist kein Zeichenprogramm German for TikZ is not a drawing program br br br Overview br The PGF TikZ interpreter can be used from the popular LaTeX and ConTeXt macro packages and also directly from the original TeX Since TeX itself is not concerned with graphics the interpreter supports multiple TeX output backends dvips dvipdfm dvipdfmx xdvipdfmx TeX ht and pdftex s internal PDF output driver Unlike PSTricks PGF can thus directly produce either PostScript or PDF output but it cannot use some of the more advanced PostScript programming features that PSTricks can use due to the least common denominator effect PGF TikZ comes with an extensive documentation the version a of the manual has over pages br The standard LaTeX picture environment can also be used as a front end for PGF by merely using the pgfpict e package br The project has been under constant development since Most of the development until was done by Till Tantau and since then Henri Menke has been the main contributor Version was released on December One of the major new features of this version was graph drawing using the graphdrawing package which however requires LuaTeX This version also added a new data visualization method and support for direct SVG output via the new dvisvgm driver br br br Export br Several graphical editors can produce output for PGF TikZ such as the KDE program Cirkuit and the math drawing program GeoGebra Export to TikZ is also available as extensions for Inkscape Blender MATLAB matplotlib Gnuplot Julia and R The circuit macros package of m macros exports circuit diagrams to TikZ using the dpic g command line option The dot tex program can convert files in the DOT graph description language to PGF TikZ br br br Libraries br TikZ features libraries for easy drawing of many kinds of diagrams such as the following alphabetized by library name br br br Gallery br The following images were created with TikZ and show some examples of the range of graphic types that can be produced The link in each caption points to the source code for the image br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br See also br br Asymptote vector graphics language br br br br br br Further reading br br br External links br br PGF TikZ on CTAN br PGF TikZ manual on CTAN br PGF TikZ gallery at TeXample net
