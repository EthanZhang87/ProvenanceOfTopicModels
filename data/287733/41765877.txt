The Open Game Engine Exchange OpenGEX is a format that aids the application agnostic transferring of complex scene data between D graphics apps including game engines and D modelling apps It uses Open Data Description Language for data storage a method for arbitrary data storage that maintains human readability The OpenGEX file format is registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority IANA as the model vnd opengex media type br The OpenGEX format is defined by the Open Game Engine Exchange Specification which is available on the official website opengex org br Export plugins that write the OpenGEX format are available for Autodesk Maya and D Studio Max with an unofficial plugin available for Blender br br br Format br At the most basic level an OpenGEX file consists of a node hierarchy a set of objects a set of materials and some additional information about global units and axis orientation The various node object and material structures contain all of the details such as geometric data and animation tracks within a hierarchy of additional types of structures defined by OpenGEX The following types of data can appear in an OpenGEX file br br Hierarchical scene organization node trees br Node and object transforms matrices translations rotations and scales br Geometry objects light objects and camera objects br Meshes composed of vertex attribute arrays and index arrays for multiple levels of detail br Skinned meshes skeleton bind pose transforms bone influence weighting data br Multiple morph targets for meshes and animated morph weights br Keyframe animation with linear B zier and TCB animation curves br Material colors and textures diffuse specular normal emission opacity transparency br br br Example br A very simple example of a complete OpenGEX file describing a green cube is shown in the listing below It begins with a group of Metric structures that define the units of measurement and the global up direction Those are followed by a single GeometryNode structure that provides the name and transform for the cube The geometric data for the cube is stored in the GeometryObject structure that is referenced by the geometry node The geometry object structure contains a single mesh of triangle primitives that includes per vertex positions normals and texture coordinates Finally the Material structure at the end of the file contains the green diffuse reflection color br br Metric key distance float br Metric key up string z br br GeometryNode node br br Name string Cube br ObjectRef ref geometry br MaterialRef ref material br br Transform br br float br br br br br br br br br br GeometryObject geometry Cube br br Mesh primitive triangles br br VertexArray attrib position br br float br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br VertexArray attrib normal br br float br br br br br br br br br br br br br VertexArray attrib texcoord br br float br br br br br br br br br br br IndexArray br br uint br br br br br br br br br br Material material br br Name string Green br br Color attrib diffuse float br br br br History br The development of the OpenGEX format was funded by a crowd sourcing campaign that ended on May As the format was being designed the Open Data Description Language was also created as a generic base language upon which OpenGEX was built Support for the OpenGEX format was originally implemented in C Engine version br br br See also br glTF a Khronos Group file format for D Scenes and models br br br br br br External links br Official website
