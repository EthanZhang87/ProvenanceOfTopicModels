PSTricks is a set of macros that allow the inclusion of PostScript drawings directly inside TeX or LaTeX source code It was originally written by Timothy Van Zandt and has been maintained in recent years by Denis Girou Sebastian Rahtz and Herbert Voss de br br br Basic usage br br There is a wide array of commands available for making graphics Coordinates in PSTricks are always represented in parentheses as the following example scaled illustrates br br br Extensions br br PSTricks commands are low level so many LaTeX packages have been made in order to ease the creation of several kinds of graphics that are commonly used on mathematical typesetting br pst plot provides commands for creating function graphs br Consider the following example br br The previous example also illustrate that TeX commands can be used as elements into the pictures br Since PostScript uses RPN style for mathematical operations the argument to pst plot must be supplied in the same form br An alternative is to use the optional argument algebraic then the formula can be described as an algebraic expression br pstricks add extends pst plot enabling also polar graphs and allowing the use algebraic notation for plots instead of RPN br pst math provides trigonometric functions in radians since PostScript defaults to using degrees and hyperbolic trigonometric functions br pst dplot is used for creating D graphics like the following br br multido provides basic loop functionality for programming graphs with repeating elements br br pst eucl is a beta extension for easy creation of geometrical drawings br br There are many other extensions for drawing Circuit diagrams barcodes graphs trees visualizing data etc br br br Compatibility br PSTricks is only fully compatible with TeX systems using PostScript intermediates including but not limited to eTeX and others However it is not compatible with the widely used pdfTeX engine in PDF mode As pdfTeX is the default engine in most current installations users of PSTricks must either force pdfTeX to DVI mode or use auto pst pdf PGF TikZ is an alternative to PSTricks that is compatible with pdfTeX br br br Software which supports PSTricks output br Inkscape br Interactive geometry software C a R GeoGebra Kig br JPicEdt br Mathematica br WinFIG br LaTeXPiX br gnuplot br LaTeXDraw br Dia br GeoGebra br br br See also br PSfrag br Asymptote vector graphics language br TeX br List of TeX extensions br LaTeX br PostScript br Inkscape for converting SVG images to PSTricks code br PGF TikZ Portable Graphics Format an alternative TeX package for programming graphics also works with pdftex br CircuiTikZ br br br Further reading br br br External links br Official website br PSTricks documentation br PSTricks examples br LaTeXDraw a free and open source graphical editor generating PSTricks code written in Java br JPicEdt another free and open source graphical editor generating PSTricks code written in Java br LaTeXPiX a freeware graphical editor generating amongst others PSTricks code written for Windows OS
