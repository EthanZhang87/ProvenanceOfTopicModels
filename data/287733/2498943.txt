font that was easier to read on computer screens than Roboto while retaining its vertical proportions Earlier versions of Inter then Interface and Inter UI included glyphs and followed the vertical glyph metrics ascender and descender from Roboto while Roboto glyphs were included as a fallback for characters which have not been re designed in Inter Inter changed its vertical glyph metrics since making it different from that of Roboto br Due to this condition the typeface had to be released in two combined licenses the SIL Open Font License for original glyph designs for Inter and Apache License for the fallback Roboto glyphs and outlines This exception was removed in after Roboto was re licensed from Apache to OFL br Inter also has an experimental Display version a font which has
