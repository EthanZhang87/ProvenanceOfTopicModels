glTF Graphics Library Transmission Format or GL Transmission Format and formerly known as WebGL Transmissions Format or WebGL TF is a standard file format for three dimensional scenes and models A glTF file uses one of two possible file extensions gltf JSON ASCII or glb binary Both gltf and glb files may reference external binary and texture resources Alternatively both formats may be self contained by directly embedding binary data buffers as base encoded strings in gltf files or as raw byte arrays in glb files An open standard developed and maintained by the Khronos Group it supports D model geometry appearance scene graph hierarchy and animation It is intended to be a streamlined interoperable format for the delivery of D assets while minimizing file size and runtime processing by apps As such its creators have described it as the JPEG of D br br br Overview br The glTF format stores data primarily in JSON The JSON may also contain blobs of binary data known as buffers and refer to external files for storing mesh data images etc The binary glb format also contains JSON text but serialized with binary chunk headers to allow blobs to be directly appended to the file br The fundamental building blocks of a glTF scene are nodes Nodes are organized into a hierarchy such that a node may have other nodes defined as children Nodes may have transforms relative to their parent Nodes may refer to resources such as meshes skins and cameras Meshes may refer to materials which refer to textures which refer to images Scenes are defined using an array of root nodes br Most of the top level glTF properties use a flat hierarchy for storage Nodes are saved in an array called nodes and are referred to by index including by other nodes A glTF scene refers to its root nodes by index Furthermore nodes refer to meshes by index which refer to materials by index which refer to textures by index which refer to images by index br All glTF data structures support being extended using an extensions JSON property This allows adding arbitrary JSON data to any data structure defined using an extension specification that is built upon the base glTF spec See the Extensions section for more information br br br Releases br br br glTF br Members of the COLLADA working group conceived the file format in At SIGGRAPH Khronos presented a demo of glTF which was then called WebGL Transmissions Format WebGL TF On October Khronos released the glTF specification br br br Adoption of glTF br At SIGGRAPH Oculus announced their adoption of glTF citing the similarities to their ovrscene format In October Microsoft joined the D Formats working group at Khronos to collaborate on glTF br br br glTF br The second version glTF was released in June and is a complete overhaul of the file format from version with most tools adopting the version Based on a proposal by Fraunhofer originally presented at SIGGRAPH Physically based rendering PBR was added replacing WebGL shaders used in glTF glTF added the GLB binary format into the base specification Other upgrades include sparse accessors and morph targets for techniques such as facial animation and schema tweaks and breaking changes for corner cases or performance such as replacing top level glTF object properties with arrays for faster index based access There is ongoing work towards import and export in Unity and an integrated multi engine viewer validator br br br Adoption of glTF br On March Microsoft announced that they will be using glTF as the D asset format across their product line including Paint D D Viewer Remix D Babylon js and Microsoft Office Sketchfab also announced support for glTF As of the glTF and GLB formats are used on and supported by companies including DGG UX D Sketchfab Facebook Microsoft Oculus Google Adobe Box TurboSquid Unreal Engine and Qt Quick D The format has been noted as an important standard for augmented reality integrating with modeling software such as Autodesk Maya Autodesk ds Max and Poly br In February the Smithsonian Institution launched their Open Access Initiative releasing approximately million D images and D models into the public domain using glTF for the D models br In July glTF was released as the ISO IEC International Standard Khronos stated they will make regular submissions to bring updates and new widely adopted glTF functionality into refreshed versions of ISO IEC to ensure that there is no long term divergence between the ISO IEC and Khronos specifications br The open source game engine Godot supports importing glTF files since version and export since version br br br Extensions br The glTF format can be extended with arbitrary JSON to add new data and functionality Extensions can be placed on any part of a glTF including nodes animations materials textures and on the entire document Khronos keeps a non comprehensive registry of glTF extensions on GitHub including all official Khronos extensions and a few third party extensions br br PBR extensions model the physical appearance of real world objects allowing developers to create realistic D assets that have the correct appearance As new PBR extensions are released they continue to expand PBR capabilities within the glTF framework allowing a wider range of scenes and objects to be realistically rendered as D assets br The KTX extension for universal texture compression enables D models in the glTF format to be highly compressed and to use natively supported texture formats reducing file size and boosting rendering speed br Draco is a glTF extension for mesh compression to compress and decompress D meshes to help reduce the size of D files It compresses vertex attributes normals colors and texture coordinates br Various glTF extensions for game engine interoperability have been developed by OMI group This includes extensions for physics shapes physics bodies physics joints audio playback seats spawn points and more br The VRM consortium has developed glTF extensions for advanced humanoid D avatars including dynamic spring bones and toon materials br br br Derivative formats br On August D Tiles now a proposed OGC Community Standard built on glTF to add a spatial data structure metadata and declarative styling for streaming massive heterogeneous D geospatial datasets br VRM a model format for VR is built on the glb format It is a D humanoid avatar specification and file format br br br Software ecosystem br Khronos maintains the glTF Sample Viewer for viewing glTF assets Khronos also maintains the glTF Validator for validating if D models conform to the glTF specification br glTF loaders are in open source WebGL engines including PlayCanvas Three js Babylon js Cesium PEX xeogl and A Frame The Godot game engine supports and recommends the glTF format with both import and export support br Open source glTF converters are available from COLLADA FBX and OBJ Assimp can import and export glTF br glTF files can also be directly exported from a variety of D editors such as Blender Vectary Autodesk ds Max natively or using Verge D exporter Autodesk Maya using babylon js exporter Autodesk Inventor Modo Houdini Paint D Godot and Substance Painter br Open source glTF utility libraries are available for programming languages including JavaScript Node js C C Haskell Java Go Rust Haxe Ada and TypeScript Khronos keeps a list of these libraries and other related applications on their ecosystem site br D Commerce a working group of universal guidelines standards and certifications for D content creation and distribution in e commerce incorporates glTF for transmission of photorealistic D assets In June the D Commerce viewer certification program was launched enabling D viewers to demonstrate they can accurately and reliably display D products using the glTF file format D Commerce s asset guidelines released in include best practices for use of the glTF file format in D Commerce br br br See also
