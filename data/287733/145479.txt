Encapsulated PostScript EPS is a Document Structuring Convention DSC conforming PostScript document format usable as a graphics file format The format was developed as early as by John Warnock and Chuck Geschke the founders of Adobe together with Aldus The basis of early versions of the Adobe Illustrator Artwork file format is formed by EPS together with the DSC Open Structuring Conventions br In short EPS files are self contained reasonably predictable PostScript documents that describe an image or drawing and can be placed within another PostScript document An EPS file is essentially a PostScript program saved as a single file that includes a low resolution preview encapsulated within it allowing some programs to display a preview on the screen An EPS file contains a DSC comment describing the rectangle containing the image Applications can use this information to lay out the page even if they are unable to directly render the PostScript inside br br br Previews br EPS files frequently include a preview picture of the content for on screen display The idea is to allow a simple preview of the final output in any application that can draw a bitmap Without this preview the applications would have to directly render the PostScript PS data inside the EPS which was beyond the capabilities of most machines that used PostScript br When EPS was first implemented the only machines widely using PostScript were Apple Macintoshes These machines could not directly render the PostScript which presented Adobe with the dilemma of how to provide a preview image for the designer while also including the PS version for the printer On the Mac this turned out to be easy to solve as the Mac file system includes two parts known as forks that are logically referred to as one file By placing the PostScript in the data fork and a standard Mac PICT resource in the resource fork both images could be moved about together invisibly as if they were one file While a PICT preview often contains a bitmap it could also contain a vector representation of the whole image providing very high quality previews br Neither of these technologies is commonly used on any other operating system however When faced with the same problems on Microsoft Windows based versions of their programs Adobe chose to instead add a TIFF file encoded into the header section of the PostScript Sometimes although more rarely they used the Windows Metafile WMF format instead WMF has the potential to provide vector previews similar to PICT on the Mac Both of these PC format EPS files have a particular disadvantage because the PostScript data header and preview are all in the same file they will cause printing errors if a program does not understand the format well enough to extract only the PostScript data br A fourth format known as a EPSI includes an ASCII encoded preview bitmap This format provides only black and white previews It is mainly used on Unix like systems With several different ways of representing the preview EPSI files have limited portability An application that is unable to interpret an EPS file s preview will typically show an empty box on screen but it will be able to print the file correctly The most widely supported kind of preview is a Windows format preview with a TIFF br br br Vulnerability br Due to the ability to use embedded scripts Microsoft removed support for EPS files in Microsoft Office programs in May br br br See also br Portable Document Format PDF br Scalable Vector Graphics SVG br br br br br br Further reading br Adobe Systems Incorporated Encapsulated PostScript File Format Specification PDF Archived from the original PDF on Retrieved br A First Guide to Encapsulated PostScript br PostScript vs PDF Adobe archived from the original on official introductory comparison of PS EPS vs PDF br EPS a Programming Language
