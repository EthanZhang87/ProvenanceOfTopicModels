SIL International formerly known as the Summer Institute of Linguistics is an evangelical Christian nonprofit organization whose main purpose is to study develop and document languages especially those that are lesser known in order to expand linguistic knowledge promote literacy translate the Christian Bible into local languages and aid minority language development br Based on its language documentation work SIL publishes a database Ethnologue of its research into the world s languages and develops and publishes software programs for language documentation such as FieldWorks Language Explorer FLEx and Lexique Pro br Its main offices in the United States are located at the International Linguistics Center in Dallas Texas br br br History br William Cameron Townsend a Presbyterian minister founded the organization in after undertaking a Christian mission with the Disciples of Christ among the Kaqchikel Maya people in Guatemala in the early s In he turned to Mexico with the purpose of translating the Bible into indigenous languages there as he had done for Kaqchikel Townsend established a working relationship with the Mexican Secretariat of Public Education under the government of President L zaro C rdenas in office and founded SIL to educate linguist missionaries to work in Mexico Because the Mexican government did not allow missionary work through its educational system Townsend founded Wycliffe Bible Translators in as a separate organization from SIL Wycliffe Bible Translators focused on Bible translation and missionary activities whereas SIL focused on linguistic documentation and literacy education br Having initiated collaboration with the Mexican education authorities Townsend started the institute as a small summer training session in Sulphur Springs Arkansas in to train missionaries in basic linguistic anthropological and translation principles Through the following decades the SIL linguists worked at providing literacy education to indigenous people of Mexico while simultaneously working with the Wycliffe Bible Translators on Bible translation One of the students at the first summer institute in its second year Kenneth Lee Pike would become the foremost figure in the history of SIL He served as SIL s president from to then as president emeritus until his death in br The Mexican branch Instituto Ling stico de Verano was established in br In Michel Kenmogne from Cameroon became president br In SIL said it had language projects in countries and staff from countries br br br Contributions br SIL s principal contribution to linguistics has been the data that have been gathered and analyzed from over minority and endangered languages many of which had not been previously studied academically SIL endeavors to share both the data and the results of analysis in order to contribute to the overall knowledge of language This has resulted in publications on languages such as Hixkaryana and Pirah which have challenged the universality of some linguistic theories SIL s work has resulted in over technical publications all of which are listed in the SIL Bibliography Most of these are a reflection of linguistic fieldwork br SIL s focus has not been on the development of new linguistic theories but tagmemics though no longer promoted by SIL was developed by Kenneth Pike who also coined the words emic and etic more widely used today in anthropology br Another focus of SIL is literacy work particularly in indigenous languages SIL assists local regional and national agencies that are developing formal and informal education in vernacular languages These cooperative efforts enable new advances in the complex field of educational development in multilingual and multicultural societies br SIL provides instructors and instructional materials for linguistics programs at several major institutions of higher learning around the world In the United States these include Dallas International University Biola University Moody Bible Institute and Dallas Theological Seminary Other universities with SIL programs include Trinity Western University in Canada Charles Darwin University in Australia and Universidad Ricardo Palma in Lima Peru br The organization has recently established a new Language and Culture Documentation Services Unit that aims to preserve and revitalize languages threatened by extinction The creation of this department reflects a growing interest in documenting endangered languages and incorporates a multidisciplinary approach of anthropology and linguistics br br br Affiliations br SIL has Consultative Status with UNESCO as an NGO and has Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council ECOSOC as an advocate for ethnolinguistic communities br The organization is a member of the Forum of Bible Agencies International and Micah Network and is a founding member of Maaya the World Network for Linguistic Diversity br br br Methodological contributions br br br Ethnologue and ISO codes br br Ethnologue A Guide to the World s Languages has been published by SIL since br From the th edition onwards the entire contents of the published book were also shared online From the th edition onwards the publication shifted to a web centric paradigm meaning that the website is now the primary means by which the database is accessed Among other advantages this greatly facilitates user contributions A new edition is now published every February The th edition was released in February and lists languages br Starting with the th edition Ethnologue uses the ISO standard which assigns letter codes to languages these were derived in part from the letter codes that were used in the Ethnologue s th edition SIL is the registration authority for the ISO standard br With the publication of the th edition Ethnologue launched a subscription service but claiming that the paywall would only affect of users Users who contribute over accepted changes are rewarded with lifetime free access br A comprehensive review of the th th and th editions acknowledged that Ethnologue is at present still better than any other nonderivative work of the same scope except that it fails to disclose the sources for the information presented br br br Software br SIL has developed widely used software for linguistic research br br Adapt It is a tool for translating text from one language into a related language after performing limited linguistic analysis br In the field of lexicon collection ShoeBox the newer ToolBox Field Linguist s Toolbox and Lexique Pro have largely been replaced by FieldWorks Language Explorer FLEx Windows and Linux for linguists and WeSay also Windows and Linux for non professionals SIL also provides a Webonary website for publishing dictionaries br Graphite is a smart font technology and rendering system br Keyman is a keyboard software solution for typing over of the world s languages and can be used to make custom keyboards br br br Fonts br SIL has developed several widely used font sets that it makes available as free software under the SIL Open Font License OFL The names of SIL fonts reflect the Biblical mission of the organization charis Greek for grace doulos Greek for servant and gentium Latin for of the nations These fonts have become standard resources for linguists working on the documentation of the world s languages Most of them are designed only for specific writing systems such as Ethiopic Devanagari New Tai Lue Hebrew Arabic Khmer Yi Myanmar Coptic and Tai Viet or some more technical notation such as cipher musical notation or IPA Fonts that support Latin include br br Gentium a typeface family designed to enable the diverse ethnic groups around the world who use the Latin Cyrillic and Greek scripts to produce readable high quality publications It supports a wide range of Latin and Cyrillic based alphabets br Doulos SIL a Unicode serif font similar in design to Times Times New Roman It contains a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any Roman or Cyrillic based writing system whether used for phonetic or orthographic needs In addition there is provision for other characters and symbols useful to linguists It contains near complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode for Latin and Cyrillic br Charis SIL a Unicode based font family that supports the wide range of languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic scripts It is specially designed to make long texts pleasant and easy to read even in less than ideal reproduction and display environments br Andika a sans serif Unicode font designed especially for literacy use and the needs of beginning readers The focus is on clear letterforms that will not be easily confused with one another It supports near complete coverage for Latin and Cyrillic br br br Recognitions br The Summer Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America passed a resolution that the work of SIL should be strongly commended by our Society and welcomed as one of the most promising developments in applied linguistics in this country br SIL holds formal consultative status with UNESCO and the United Nations and has been publicly recognized by UNESCO for their work in many parts of Asia SIL also holds non governmental organization status in many countries br SIL s work has received appreciation and recognition in a number of international settings In SIL was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding This foundation honors outstanding individuals and organizations working in Asia who manifest greatness of spirit in service to the peoples of Asia UNESCO Literacy Prizes have been awarded to SIL s work in a number of countries Australia Cameroon Papua New Guinea Philippines br br br Criticism br In SIL s agreement was officially terminated by the Mexican government after critiques from anthropologists regarding the combination of education and missionary activities in indigenous communities though SIL continued to be active in that country At a conference of the Inter American Indian Institute in M rida Yucat n in November delegates denounced the Summer Institute of Linguistics charging that it was using a scientific name to conceal its Protestant agenda and an alleged capitalist view that was alien to indigenous traditions This led to the agreement with the Ecuadoran government being terminated in although a token presence remained In the early s the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador CONAIE demanded the expulsion of SIL from the country SIL was also expelled from Brazil Mexico and Panama and restricted in Colombia and Peru br The organization s focus on language description language development and Bible translation and the missionary activities carried out by many of its field workers have been criticized by linguists and anthropologists who argue that SIL aims to change indigenous cultures which exacerbates the problems that cause language endangerment and language death Linguists have argued that the missionary focus of SIL makes relations with academic linguists and their reliance on SIL software and knowledge infrastructure problematic in that respective goals while often overlapping also sometimes diverge considerably br SIL does not consider efforts to change cultural patterns a form of culture destruction and points out that all their work is based on the voluntary participation of indigenous peoples In the SIL view ethnocide is not a valid concept and it would lead to pessimism to characterize culture change resulting from the inevitable progress of civilization as ethnocide SIL considers itself as actively protecting endangered languages by promoting them within the speech community and providing mother tongue literacy training Additionally their expanded interest in preserving threatened languages has resulted in the creation of a Language and Culture Documentation Services Unit br br br Regional offices br Besides the headquarters in Dallas SIL has offices and locally incorporated affiliated organizations in the following countries br br br Africa
