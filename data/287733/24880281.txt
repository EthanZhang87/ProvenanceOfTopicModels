OCR B is a monospace font developed in by Adrian Frutiger for Monotype by following the European Computer Manufacturer s Association standard Its function was to facilitate the optical character recognition operations by specific electronic devices originally for financial and bank oriented uses It was accepted as the world standard in It follows the ISO E standard refined in letterpress design size I It includes all ASCII symbols and other symbols needed in the bank environment It is widely used for the human readable digits in UPC EAN barcodes It is also used for machine readable passports It shares that purpose with OCR A but it is easier for the human eye and brain to read and it has a less technical look than OCR A br br br History br In June the European Computer Manufacturers Association ECMA started standardization activities related to Optical Character Recognition OCR After evaluating existing OCR designs it was decided to develop two new fonts A stylized design with just digits called Class A and a more conventional type design with broader character coverage called Class B In February ECMA proposed a design for the Class B font to ISO who adopted it as international standard ISO in October The first revision contained three font sizes I II and III The specification included a Letterpress design intended for high quality printing equipment and a rounded edge Constant Strokewidth design for impact printers with reduced typographic quality br In September ECMA started work to revise its published standard To make OCR B more widely accepted the shapes of some characters were slightly modified The new revision removed font size II which had been rarely used in practice it deleted five character shapes and it added a new font size IV ECMA published the second edition of OCR B in October br In March ECMA published a third revision of its ECMA specification It added the symbols and to OCR B two types of erasure marks for blackening out mis printed characters were added and the length of the Vertical bar was changed to match ISO br In Turkey proposed extending ISO to include the Turkish letters and The request was generalized to extend OCR B with a number of Latin and Greek letters used in European languages A revision of the ISO standard was therefore br started producing three successive draft documents The final draft would have extended OCR B with Latin and Greek letters for six Latin letters the draft gave new alternate shapes A request to extend OCR B with Vietnamese accents was rejected Other than previous versions of the standard which specified glyph shapes via reference drawings the new revision would have included the shapes in machine readable form However br industry support for testing the new font could not be secured at the time br so the revision effort was halted in IV The working group described their findings in a technical report br br In June the European Committee for Standardization published a report for adding the Euro sign to OCR B The report proposed both a single stroked and a double stroked variant of the Euro sign leaving the decision to further testing of OCR performance Testing was difficult the theoretical design methods used when the OCR B glyphs were originally developed could no longer be reproduced and the technological constraints of the s were also not entirely relevant anymore in the OCR environments of the s A new test method was devised using present time OCR technology The tests found no difference in OCR performance between the two Euro variants and recommended the adoption of the double stroked variant as it matches the conventional glyph shape The project did not have funds to thorougly test the glyph extensions of the proposal initial results were inconclusive br br br Availability br Microsoft Office ships a version of Letterpress OCR B produced by Monotype It covers Windows Many vendors including Adobe still sell their versions of OCR A and OCR B br The TeX typesetting system has a public domain Constant Strokewidth OCR B font in METAFONT definition form It was created by Norbert Swartz in and updated in It has a setting for square stroke ends The definition has also been translated to METATYPE so the rounded version is available in TrueType and OpenType too br A version of Constant Strokewidth OCR B by Matthew Anderson has extended character coverage It is available under CC BY br br br MS DOS OCR B encoding br The MS DOS OCR B encoding is code page Note that the grave acute circumflex at x B tilde diaeresis and cedilla can be added over in the case of the cedilla under letters to form accented letters Note that the alternative Latin small latter m not in Unicode euro sign and vertical bar were later added to the code page but it is unknown where they are located br br Characters not in Unicode br br a Group erase x br b Alternative vertical bar x C br c Character erase x F br br br br br br
