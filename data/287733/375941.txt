Computer Graphics Metafile CGM is a free and open international standard file format for D vector graphics raster graphics and text and is defined by ISO IEC br br br Overview br All graphical elements can be specified in a textual source file that can be compiled into a binary file or one of two text representations CGM provides a means of graphics data interchange for computer representation of D graphical information independent from any particular application system platform or device br As a metafile i e a file containing information that describes or specifies another file the CGM format has numerous elements to provide functions and to represent entities so that a wide range of graphical information and geometric primitives can be accommodated Rather than establish an explicit graphics file format CGM contains the instructions and data for reconstructing graphical components to render an image using an object oriented approach br Although CGM is not widely supported for web pages and has been supplanted by other formats in the graphic arts it is still prevalent in engineering aviation and other technical applications br The initial CGM implementation was effectively a streamed representation of a sequence of Graphical Kernel System GKS primitive operations It has been adopted to some extent in the areas of technical illustration and professional design but has largely been superseded by formats such as SVG and DXF br The World Wide Web Consortium has developed WebCGM a profile of CGM intended for the use of CGM on the Web br br br History br ANSI X ANSI X committee br ISO ISO br ANSI ISO ANSI and ISO br ISO a k a CGM ISO br ISO IEC nd Edition ISO IEC JTC SC br December WebCGM W C br January WebCGM W C br March WebCGM W C Recommendation br br br Further reading br Arnold D B and P R Bono CGM and CGI Metafile and Interface Standards for Computer Graphics Springer Verlag New York NY br Henderson L R and Gebhardt CGM SGML for Graphics The Gilbane Report Fall br Henderson L R and A M Mumford The CGM Handbook Academic Press San Diego CA br Bono P R J L Encarnacao L M Encarnacao and W R Herzner PC Graphics With GKS Prentice Hall Englewood Cliffs NJ br Vaughan Tay Making It Work th ed br br br See also br Comparison of graphics file formats br br br br br br External links br br br General br Overview of CGM Standards br CGM File Format Summary br WebCGM Resource Page br Technology Reports WebCGM br Use of CGM as a Scalable Graphics Format br CGM Open Reference documents related materials for CGM and WebCGM br br br Standards br WebCGM W C Recommendation December br WebCGM W C Recommendation January br WebCGM W C Recommendation March br ISO IEC Part Functional specification br ISO IEC Part Technical Corrigendum br ISO IEC Part Technical Corrigendum br ISO IEC Part Binary encoding br ISO IEC Part Clear text encoding br br br Other br WebCGM and SVG A Comparison br CGM Examples
