Johnston or Johnston Sans is a sans serif typeface designed by and named after Edward Johnston The typeface was commissioned in by Frank Pick commercial manager of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London also known as The Underground Group as part of his plan to strengthen the company s corporate identity Johnston was originally created for printing with a planned height of inch or cm but it rapidly became used for the enamel station signs of the Underground system as well br It has been the corporate font of public transport in London since the foundation of the London Passenger Transport Board in and of predecessor companies since its introduction in making its use one of the world s longest lasting examples of corporate branding It was a copyrighted property of the LPTB s successor Transport for London until Public Domain Day Johnston died in br Johnston s work originated the genre of the humanist sans serif typeface typefaces that are sans serif but take inspiration from traditional serif fonts and Roman inscriptions His student Eric Gill who worked on the development of the typeface later used it as a model for his own Gill Sans released from As a corporate font Johnston was not available for public licensing until recently and as such Gill Sans has become more widely used br br br Features br br The capitals of the typeface are based on Roman square capitals such as those on the Column of Trajan and the lower case on traditional serif fonts Johnston greatly admired Roman capitals writing that they held the supreme place among letters for readableness and beauty They are the best forms for the grandest and most important inscriptions Justin Howes author of the leading work on the Johnston Sans design Johnston s Underground Type has highlighted the similarity of the design to the eighteenth century Caslon type designed by William Caslon in particular noting that Johnston had worked on a book printed using this typeface shortly before starting work on his design and reproduced their structure in a textbook br Johnston s alphabet marked a break with the kinds of sans serif then popular now normally known as grotesques which tended to have squarer shapes inspired by signwriting and Didone type of the period Some aspects of the alphabet are geometric the letter O is a nearly perfect circle and the M unlike Roman capitals but like Caslon straight sided As with most serif fonts the g is a two storey design The l copies the curl of the t and produces a rather wide letter compared to most sans serif fonts The lower case i and j have diagonally placed square dots or tittles a motif that in some digitisations is repeated in the full stop commas apostrophes and other punctuation marks br Johnston s design process considered a variety of eccentricities such as a capital form q in the lower case and a single storey a like that later seen on Futura before ultimately discarding them in favour of a clean simplified design However many early versions of Johnston s alphabet included a Garamond style W formed of two crossed V s and some early renderings as hand lettering showed variation br Unlike many sans serifs of the period Johnston s design while not slender is not particularly bold Gill would later write of his admiration for how Johnston had redeemed the sans serif from its nineteenth century corruption of extreme boldness br br As an alphabet intended for signage Johnston was designed without any italics Any italic design seen is therefore an invention of a later designer intended to match Johnston s design Different designers have chosen different approaches to achieve this some offering a true italic others an oblique in which the letters are simply slanted and some declining to offer one perhaps concluding that an italic is inappropriate to the purpose of the original design An official version of the typeface in italics was commissioned by London Transport from Berthold Wolpe in br br br History br br Johnston had become interested in sans serif letters some years before the commission although best known as a calligrapher he had written and worked also on custom lettering and in his textbook Writing and Illuminating and Lettering had noted It is quite possible to make a beautiful and characteristic alphabet of equal stroke letters on the lines of the so called block letter the sans serif letters of contemporary trade but properly proportioned and finished He had also written in spring that new books should bear some living mark of the time in which we live Johnston had previously unsuccessfully attempted to enter type design a trade which at the time normally made designs in house Howes wrote that Johnston s font was the first typeface to have been designed for day to day use by a leading artist craftsman br Pick specified to Johnston that he wanted a typeface that would ensure that the Underground Group s posters would not be mistaken for advertisements it should have the bold simplicity of the authentic lettering of the finest periods and belong unmistakably to the twentieth century Pick considered a sans serif best suited to transport use concluding that the Column of Trajan capitals were not suited to reproduction on flat surfaces br In The Underground Group was absorbed by the London Passenger Transport Board and the typeface was adopted as part of the London Transport brand As early as the LPTB mentioned it as a package promoting the system s billboards to advertisers as an example of its commitment to stylish design along with its commission of art from Feliks Topolski Johnston s drawings survive in the Victoria and Albert Museum br Johnston s original design came with two weights ordinary and bold while condensed letters soon followed for use on buses to show routes and destinations Heavy does not contain lower case letters Johnston also worked on other lettering and branding for the Underground system most famously the bar and circle roundel that the Underground continues to use refined from earlier designs where the roundel was solid red br The font family was called a variety of names in its early years such as Underground or Johnston s Railway Type before later being generally called simply Johnston A similar problem exists with Gill Sans which was at first often referred to by other names such as its order number Series Gill Sans serif or Monotype Sans serif br br br New Johnston br br Johnston was originally printed using wood type for large signs and metal type for print London Transport often did not use Johnston for general small printing with many documents such as bus timetables using other typefaces such as Gill Sans and Granby By the s as cold type was becoming the norm for printing Johnston had become difficult for printers to use Signs and posters of the period started to use other more easily sourced typefaces such as Helvetica Univers and News Gothic To maintain London Transport s old corporate identity Johnston was rendered into cold type br Rather than simply producing a phototype of the original design Johnston was redesigned in by Eiichi Kono at Banks Miles to produce New Johnston The new family comes in eight members Light Medium Bold weights with corresponding Italics Medium Condensed and Bold Condensed the old family had only two weights Regular and Bold and the latter had no lowercase letters After all precisely hand drawn letters nearly were completed and sent to AlphaType for digitisation in the US in New Johnston finally became ready for Linotron photo typesetting machine and first appeared in London s Underground stations in It is the official typeface exclusively used by Transport for London and The Mayor of London ever since br br The New Johnston Medium as the new standard is slightly heavier or bolder than the original Johnston Regular or sometimes confusingly called Medium and lighter than the original Bold and has a larger x height made suitable for main text setting as well as large display sizes The average x height of the New Johnston is roughly larger than the original as the limit for keeping the original Johnston flavour which was fundamental The larger x height allowed larger counters and type size size of x height in particular and weight are reciprocal factors for legibility but enlarging x height can affect style and appearance Since the original Johnston weights Regular and Bold were maintained as closely as possible inevitably New Johnston Medium appears very close to Light and Bold This is the whole point of this particular solution because New Johnston Medium works as the one fits all standard font for virtually every application from large type sizes for posters and signs to minute type sizes for pocket map maintaining much improved legibility Punctuation marks are matched the diamond tittle differing from Johnston s original design enhancing the identity of London Transport br In Banks and Miles in partnership with Signus Limited digitised the first PostScript Type fonts for the then London Transport under the auspices of the corporate design manager Roger Hughes Hughes and Jeremy Rewse Davies LT s design director also commissioned New Johnston Book a special weight with distinctive modifications to allow better representation on low resolution laser printers The New Johnston Book weight was designed specifically for high volume publications and its usage was intended to be restricted to sizes below pt In the typeface was digitised on behalf of Transport for London by Agfa Monotype Corporation with the addition of two further weights Book and Book Bold as well as corresponding italic variants The revised font family not commercially available is known as New Johnston TfL In the early stages of digitisation there was the chronic problem in letter spacing which seems to be solved more or less by now br A further change occurred in when Transport for London removed the serif from the numeral and also altered the in both cases reverting them to their original appearance br New Johnston s numerals are originally designed to fit for setting tabular matters which was requested by TfL br As a proprietary typeface one of the first ever Johnston did not become commercially available in metal type However capitalising on the popularity of the design style after Gill Sans had become popular the typefounders Stephenson Blake who cast the Johnston metal type created a similar but not identical design Granby for sale According to Mike Ashworth of Transport for London London Transport itself made some use of Granby by the s due to the limited availability of Johnston metal type It also used Gill Sans for printed ephemera such as timetables br br br Johnston Delf Smith br br This variant was commissioned by Frank Pick as a wedge serif variation of the organisation s standard sans serif Johnston face and was designed by Percy Delf Smith a former pupil of Edward Johnston Johnston had considered a wedge serif design during the early stages of the commission The typeface was originally used for the headquarters building at Broadway SW and some early s Underground stations It can only be seen on some signs at Sudbury Town on the Piccadilly line br In early a digitisation of the typeface was developed by Transport for London under the name Johnston Delf Smith for its own use on historic signs It is the property of TfL br Designer Matthieu Cortat has released an unrelated implementation of the design commercially under the name Petit Serif br br br Johnston br br A new version known as Johnston was commissioned by Transport for London from Monotype in to commemorate the th anniversary of the introduction of the typeface It includes two new weights Hairline and Thin for digital use as well as symbols such as the hash character Several characters have been changed such as the restoration of the diagonal bowl on the lowercase g which was lost in New Johnston The font is designed to reflect Johnston s original intentions and to be closer to the original version of the Johnston typeface br br br Non TfL digitisations br br Several digitisations of the Johnston type exist br br br ITC Johnston br International Typeface Corporation released a variant in called ITC Johnston It originally included three font weights like New Johnston however it does not include the hooked and uses side pointed br In November the typeface was rereleased in OpenType format which also expanded the font family to include italic fonts resembling those of Gill Sans in all weights OpenType features include alternates case forms small caps romans only old style figure Separate small caps romans only and old style figure faces were also released for each weight in TrueType and PostScript formats for a total of fifteen typefaces br br br P Underground br In London Transport Museum licensed the original Johnston typeface exclusively to P Type Foundry available commercially first under the name of Johnston Underground and then in an expanded version called Underground Pro P s design is not based on New Johnston having principally the goal of digitising and expanding on the original Johnston designs br br The full Underground Pro Set contains nineteen Pro OpenType fonts and Basic OpenType fonts covering extended

small caps designs br br br Usages br Its use has included the Tube map sometimes hand lettered nameplates and general station signing as well as much of the printed material issued by the Underground Group and its successors also by the nationalised British Road Services in the immediate post war era br It was used for wayfinding signs at the London Summer Olympics and Summer Paralympics including venues outside London It was also used for the signs that accompanied the parade of nations during the opening ceremony br It is also used in the overlays of the BBC TV show Sherlock New Johnston is used for signage in the fictional Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in the Fox TV show House although in later seasons the similar font Gill Sans was used most noticeably on Wilson s door during season br The font is used in the wayfinding signage at Westfield London br Hong Kong s Citybus and NWFB buses use the font on the front route number display and timetables br br br Similar fonts br
