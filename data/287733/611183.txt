Courier is a monospaced slab serif typeface commissioned by IBM and designed by Howard Bud Kettler in the mid s The Courier name and typeface concept are in the public domain Courier has been adapted for use as a computer font and versions of it are installed on most desktop computers br br br History br IBM did not trademark the name Courier so the typeface design concept and its name are now public domain According to some sources a later version for IBM s Selectric typewriters was developed with input from Adrian Frutiger although Paul Shaw writes that this is a confusion with Frutiger s adaptation of his Univers typeface for the Selectric system Sources differ on whether the design was published in or br As a monospaced font in the s Courier found renewed use in the electronic world in situations where columns of characters must be consistently aligned for instance in computer programming It has also become an industry standard for all screenplays to be written in point Courier or a close variant Twelve point Courier New was also the U S State Department s standard typeface until January when it was replaced with point Times New Roman Reasons for the change included the desire for a more modern and legible font br Kettler was once quoted about how the name was chosen The font was nearly released with the name Messenger After giving it some thought Kettler said A letter can be just an ordinary messenger or it can be the courier which radiates dignity prestige and stability br br br Variants br br br Code variants br With the rise of digital computing variants of the Courier typeface were developed with features helpful in coding larger punctuation marks stronger distinctions between similar characters such as the numeral vs the upper case O and the numeral vs the lower case L sans serif variants and other features to provide increased legibility when viewed on screens Today many Courier typefaces include a code version within the type family Courier New Baltic Courier New CE Courier New Cyr Courier New Greek Courier New Tur are aliases created in the FontSubstitutes section of WIN INI These entries all point to the master font When an alias font is specified the font s character map contains a different character set from the master font and the other alias fonts br br br IBM Courier br IBM made Courier freely available in Postscript Type format Known as IBM Courier or simply Courier it is available under the IBM MIT X Consortium Courier Typefont agreement Among other IBM specific characters it contains optionally a dotted zero which seems to have originated as an option on IBM display controllers and a slashed zero br br br Courier Pitch BT and Courier Code br The Courier Pitch BT typeface was released as a font by Bitstream Courier BT is heavier than Courier New and more closely approximates the look of the original Courier type on paper The freely available version often seen as a system font on electronic devices includes the characters of the ANSI character set in Type format Courier BT has been donated to the X Consortium by Bitstream along with Bitstream Charter and is the default Courier font on most Linux distributions Expanded Pan European W G character sets are made available for license by Bitstream br Courier Code is a variant of Courier Pitch BT for use in programming The zero is dotted to better distinguish it from the capital O and the lowercase L has been altered to better distinguish it from the number one The leading has been increased slightly as well br br br Courier New br Courier New appears as a system font on many electronic devices This Courier variant was produced for electronic use by Monotype Its thin appearance when printed on paper owes to its being digitized directly from the golf ball of the IBM Selectric without accounting for the visual weight normally added by the typewriter s ink ribbon ClearType rendering technology includes a hack to make the font appear more legible on screens though printouts retain the thin look The font family includes Courier New Courier New Bold Courier New Italic and Courier New Bold Italic br Courier New was introduced as a system font with Windows which also included raster Courier fonts The fonts were also sold commercially by Ascender Corporation The Ascender fonts have WGL at the end of the font name and cover only the WGL characters br Courier New features higher line space than Courier Punctuation marks were reworked to make the dots and commas heavier Versions from onward include Hebrew and Arabic glyphs with most of the Arabic characters added on non italic fonts The styling of Arabic glyphs is similar to those found in Times New Roman but adjusted for monospace The Courier New version includes over glyphs covering over characters per font br br br Courier Prime br br This Courier typeface developed by Alan Dague Greene with funding from John August and Quote Unquote Apps includes a true Italic style Courier Prime matches the metrics of Courier Final Draft with some design changes and improvements aimed at greater legibility and beauty The typeface was released in January under the SIL Open Font
