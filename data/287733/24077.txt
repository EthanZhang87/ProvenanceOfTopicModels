Portable Document Format PDF standardized as ISO is a file format developed by Adobe in to present documents including text formatting and images in a manner independent of application software hardware and operating systems Based on the PostScript language each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed layout flat document including the text fonts vector graphics raster images and other information needed to display it PDF has its roots in The Camelot Project initiated by Adobe co founder John Warnock in br PDF was standardized as ISO in The last edition as ISO was published in December br PDF files may contain a variety of content besides flat text and graphics including logical structuring elements interactive elements such as annotations and form fields layers rich media including video content three dimensional objects using U D or PRC and various other data formats The PDF specification also provides for encryption and digital signatures file attachments and metadata to enable workflows requiring these features br br br History br br The development of PDF began in when John Warnock wrote a paper for a project then code named Camelot in which he proposed the creation of a simplified version of PostScript called Interchange PostScript IPS Unlike traditional PostScript which was tightly focused on rendering print jobs to output devices IPS would be optimized for displaying pages to any screen and any platform br Adobe Systems made the PDF specification available free of charge in In the early years PDF was popular mainly in desktop publishing workflows and competed with several other formats including DjVu Envoy Common Ground Digital Paper Farallon Replica and even Adobe s own PostScript format br PDF was a proprietary format controlled by Adobe until it was released as an open standard on July and published by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO at which time control of the specification passed to an ISO Committee of volunteer industry experts In Adobe published a Public Patent License to ISO granting royalty free rights for all patents owned by Adobe necessary to make use sell and distribute PDF compliant implementations br PDF the sixth edition of the PDF specification that became ISO includes some proprietary technologies defined only by Adobe such as Adobe XML Forms Architecture XFA and JavaScript extension for Acrobat which are referenced by ISO as normative and indispensable for the full implementation of the ISO specification These proprietary technologies are not standardized and their specification is published only on Adobe s website Many of them are not supported by popular third party implementations of PDF br ISO published ISO in available for purchase replacing the free specification provided by Adobe In December the second edition of PDF ISO was published with clarifications corrections and critical updates to normative references ISO does not include any proprietary technologies as normative references br In April the PDF Association made ISO available for download free of charge br br br Technical details br A PDF file is often a combination of vector graphics text and bitmap graphics The basic types of content in a PDF are br br Typeset text stored as content streams i e not encoded in plain text br Vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist of shapes and lines br Raster graphics for photographs and other types of images and br Other multimedia objects br In later PDF revisions a PDF document can also support links inside document or web page forms JavaScript initially available as a plugin for Acrobat or any other types of embedded contents that can be handled using plug ins br PDF combines three technologies br br An equivalent subset of the PostScript page description programming language but in declarative form for generating the layout and graphics br A font embedding replacement system to allow fonts to travel with the documents br A structured storage system to bundle these elements and any associated content into a single file with data compression where appropriate br br br PostScript language br PostScript is a page description language run in an interpreter to generate an image It can handle graphics and has standard features of programming languages such as branching and looping PDF is a subset of PostScript simplified to remove such control flow features while graphics commands remain br PostScript was originally designed for a drastically different use case transmission of one way linear print jobs in which the PostScript interpreter would collect a series of commands until it encountered the showpage command then execute all the commands to render a page as a raster image to a printing device PostScript was not intended for long term storage and real time interactive rendering of electronic documents to computer monitors so there was no need to support anything other than consecutive rendering of pages If there was an error in the final printed output the user would correct it at the application level and send a new print job in the form of an entirely new PostScript file Thus any given page in a PostScript file could be accurately rendered only as the cumulative result of executing all preceding commands to draw all previous pages any of which could affect subsequent pages plus the commands to draw that particular page and there was no easy way to bypass that process to skip around to different pages br Traditionally to go from PostScript to PDF a source PostScript file that is an executable program is used as the basis for generating PostScript like PDF code see e g Adobe Distiller This is done by applying standard compiler techniques like loop unrolling inlining and removing unused branches resulting in code that is purely declarative and static The end result is then packaged into a container format together with all necessary dependencies for correct rendering external files graphics or fonts to which the document refers and compressed Modern applications write to printer drivers which directly generate PDF rather than going through PostScript first br As a document format PDF has several advantages over PostScript br br PDF contains only static declarative PostScript code that can be processed as data and does not require a full program interpreter or compiler This avoids the complexity and security risks of an engine with such a higher complexity level br Like Display PostScript PDF has supported transparent graphics since version while standard PostScript does not br PDF enforces the rule that the code for any particular page cannot affect any other pages That rule is strongly recommended for PostScript code too but has to be implemented explicitly see e g the Document Structuring Conventions as PostScript is a full programming language that allows for such greater flexibilities and is not limited to the concepts of pages and documents br All data required for rendering is included within the file itself improving portability br Its disadvantages are br br A loss of flexibility and limitation to a single use case br A sometimes much larger file size br PDF since v supports embedding of interactive D documents D drawings can be embedded using U D or PRC and various other data formats br br br File format br A PDF file is organized using ASCII characters except for certain elements that may have binary content br The file starts with a header containing a magic number as a readable string and the version of the format for example PDF The format is a subset of a COS Carousel Object Structure format A COS tree file consists primarily of objects of which there are nine types br br Boolean values representing true or false br Real numbers br Integers br Strings enclosed within parentheses or represented as hexadecimal within single angle brackets Strings may contain bit characters br Names starting with a forward slash br Arrays ordered collections of objects enclosed within square brackets br Dictionaries collections of objects indexed by names enclosed within double angle brackets br Streams usually containing large amounts of optionally compressed binary data preceded by a dictionary and enclosed between the stream and endstream keywords br The null object br Comments using bit characters prefixed with the percent sign may be inserted br Objects may be either direct embedded in another object or indirect Indirect objects are numbered with an object number and a generation number and defined between the obj and endobj keywords if residing in the document root Beginning with PDF version indirect objects except other streams may also be located in special streams known as object streams marked Type ObjStm This technique enables non stream objects to have standard stream filters applied to them reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for Tagged PDF Object streams do not support specifying an object s generation number other than br An index table also called the cross reference table is located near the end of the file and gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file This design allows for efficient random access to the objects in the file and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file incremental update Before PDF version the table would always be in a special ASCII format be marked with the xref keyword and follow the main body composed of indirect objects Version introduced optional cross reference streams which have the form of a standard stream object possibly with filters applied Such a stream may be used instead of the ASCII cross reference table and contains the offsets and other information in binary format The format is flexible in that it allows for integer width specification using the W array so that for example a document not exceeding KiB in size may dedicate only bytes for object offsets br At the end of a PDF file is a footer containing br br The startxref keyword followed by an offset to the start of the cross reference table starting with the xref keyword or the cross reference stream object followed by br The EOF end of file marker br If a cross reference stream is not being used the footer is preceded by the trailer keyword followed by a dictionary containing information that would otherwise be contained in the cross reference stream object s dictionary br br A reference to the root object of the tree structure also known as the catalog Root br The count of indirect objects in the cross reference table Size br Other optional information br Within each page there are one or multiple content streams that describe the text vector and images being drawn on the page The content stream is stack based similar to PostScript br br There are two layouts to the PDF files non linearized not optimized and linearized optimized Non linearized PDF files can be smaller than their linear counterparts though they are slower to access because portions of the data required to assemble pages of the document are scattered throughout the PDF file Linearized PDF files also called optimized or web optimized PDF files are constructed in a manner that enables them to be read in a Web browser plugin without waiting for the entire file to download since all objects required for the first page to display are optimally organized at the start of the file PDF files may be optimized using Adobe Acrobat software or QPDF br Page dimensions are not limited by the format itself However Adobe Acrobat imposes a limit of million by million inches or trillion in km br br br Imaging model br The basic design of how graphics are represented in PDF is very similar to that of PostScript except for the use of transparency which was added in PDF br PDF graphics use a device independent Cartesian coordinate system to describe the surface of a page A PDF page description can use a matrix to scale rotate or skew graphical elements A key concept in PDF is that of the graphics state which is a collection of graphical parameters that may be changed saved and restored by a page description PDF has as of version graphics state properties of which some of the most important are br br The current transformation matrix CTM which determines the coordinate system br The clipping path br The color space br The alpha constant which is a key component of transparency br Black point compensation control introduced in PDF br br br Vector graphics br As in PostScript vector graphics in PDF are constructed with paths Paths are usually composed of lines and cubic B zier curves but can also be constructed from the outlines of text Unlike PostScript PDF does not allow a single path to mix text outlines with lines and curves Paths can be stroked filled fill then stroked or used for clipping Strokes and fills can use any color set in the graphics state including patterns PDF supports several types of patterns The simplest is the tiling pattern in which a piece of artwork is specified to be drawn repeatedly This may be a colored tiling pattern with the colors specified in the pattern object or an uncolored tiling pattern which defers color specification to the time the pattern is drawn Beginning with PDF there is also a shading pattern which draws continuously varying colors There are seven types of shading patterns of which the simplest are the axial shading Type and radial shading Type br br br Raster images br Raster images in PDF called Image XObjects are represented by dictionaries with an associated stream The dictionary describes the properties of the image and the stream contains the image data Less commonly small raster images may be embedded directly in a page description as an inline image Images are typically filtered for compression purposes Image filters supported in PDF include the following general purpose filters br br ASCII Decode a filter used to put the stream into bit ASCII br ASCIIHexDecode similar to ASCII Decode but less compact br FlateDecode a commonly used filter based on the deflate algorithm defined in RFC deflate is also used in the gzip PNG and zip file formats among others introduced in PDF it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact zlib deflate compression Predictor from the TIFF specification and predictors filters from the PNG specification RFC br LZWDecode a filter based on LZW Compression it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact LZW compression Predictor from the TIFF specification and predictors filters from the PNG specification br RunLengthDecode a simple compression method for streams with repetitive data using the run length encoding algorithm and the image specific filters br DCTDecode a lossy filter based on the JPEG standard br CCITTFaxDecode a lossless bi level black white filter based on the Group or Group CCITT ITU T fax compression standard defined in ITU T T and T br JBIG Decode a lossy or lossless bi level black white filter based on the JBIG standard introduced in PDF and br JPXDecode a lossy or lossless filter based on the JPEG standard introduced in PDF br Normally all image content in a PDF is embedded in the file But PDF allows image data to be stored in external files by the use of external streams or Alternate Images Standardized subsets of PDF including PDF A and PDF X prohibit these features br br br Text br Text in PDF is represented by text elements in page content streams A text element specifies that characters should be drawn at certain positions The characters are specified using the encoding of a selected font resource br A font object in PDF is a description of a digital typeface It may either describe the characteristics of a typeface or it may include an embedded font file The latter case is called an embedded font while the former is called an unembedded font The font files that may be embedded are based on widely used standard digital font formats Type and its compressed variant CFF TrueType and beginning with PDF OpenType Additionally PDF supports the Type variant in which the components of the font are described by PDF graphic operators br Fourteen typefaces known as the standard fonts have a special significance in PDF documents br br Times v in regular italic bold and bold italic br Courier in regular oblique bold and bold oblique br Helvetica v in regular oblique bold and bold oblique br Symbol br Zapf Dingbats br These fonts are sometimes called the base fourteen fonts These fonts or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics should be available in most PDF readers but they are not guaranteed to be available in the reader and may only display correctly if the system has them installed Fonts may be substituted if they are not embedded in a PDF br Within text strings characters are shown using character codes integers that map to glyphs in the current font using an encoding There are several predefined encodings including WinAnsi MacRoman and many encodings for East Asian languages and a font can have its own built in encoding Although the WinAnsi and MacRoman encodings are derived from the historical properties of the Windows and Macintosh operating systems fonts using these encodings work equally well on any platform PDF can specify a predefined encoding to use the font s built in encoding or provide a lookup table of differences to a predefined or built in encoding not recommended with TrueType fonts The encoding mechanisms in PDF were designed for Type fonts and the rules for applying them to TrueType fonts are complex br For large fonts or fonts with non standard glyphs the special encodings Identity H for horizontal writing and Identity V for vertical are used With such fonts it is necessary to provide a ToUnicode table if semantic information about the characters is to be preserved br A text document which is scanned to PDF without the text being recognised by optical character recognition OCR is an image with no fonts or text properties br br br Transparency br The original imaging model of PDF was opaque similar to PostScript where each object drawn on the page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location In PDF the imaging model was extended to allow transparency When transparency is used new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects The addition of transparency to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to PDF and earlier specifications As a result files that use a small amount of transparency might be viewed acceptably by older viewers but files making extensive use of transparency could be viewed incorrectly by an older viewer br The transparency extensions are based on the key concepts of transparency groups blending modes shape and alpha The model is closely aligned with the features of Adobe Illustrator version The blend modes were based on those used by Adobe Photoshop at the time When the PDF specification was published the formulas for calculating blend modes were kept secret by Adobe They have since been published br The concept of a transparency group in PDF specification is independent of existing notions of group or layer in applications such as Adobe Illustrator Those groupings reflect logical relationships among objects that are meaningful when editing those objects but they are not part of the imaging model br br br Additional features br br br Logical structure and accessibility br br A tagged PDF see clause in ISO includes document structure and semantics information to enable reliable text extraction and accessibility Technically speaking tagged PDF is a stylized use of the format that builds on the logical structure framework introduced in PDF Tagged PDF defines a set of standard structure types and attributes that allow page content text graphics and images to be extracted and reused for other purposes br Tagged PDF is not required in situations where a PDF file is intended only for print Since the feature is optional and since the rules for tagged PDF were relatively vague in ISO support for tagged PDF among consuming devices including assistive technology AT is uneven as of ISO however includes an improved discussion of tagged PDF which is anticipated to facilitate further adoption br An ISO standardized subset of PDF specifically targeted at accessibility PDF UA was first published in br br br Optional Content Groups layers br With the introduction of PDF version came the concept of Layers Layers more formally known as Optional Content Groups OCGs refer to sections of content in a PDF document that can be selectively viewed or hidden by document authors or viewers This capability is useful in CAD drawings layered artwork maps multi language documents etc br Basically it consists of an Optional Content Properties Dictionary added to the document root This dictionary contains an array of Optional Content Groups OCGs each describing a set of information and each of which may be individually displayed or suppressed plus a set of Optional Content Configuration Dictionaries which give the status Displayed or Suppressed of the given OCGs br br br Encryption and signatures br A PDF file may be encrypted for security in which case a password is needed to view or edit the contents PDF defines bit AES encryption as the standard for PDF files The PDF Reference also defines ways that third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF br PDF files may be digitally signed to provide secure authentication complete details on implementing digital signatures in PDF are provided in ISO br PDF files may also contain embedded DRM restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying editing or printing These restrictions depend on the reader software to obey them so the security they provide is limited br The standard security provided by PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords a user password which encrypts the file and prevents opening and an owner password which specifies operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted which can include modifying printing or copying text and graphics out of the document or adding or modifying text notes and AcroForm fields The user password encrypts the file while the owner password does not instead relying on client software to respect these restrictions An owner password can easily be removed by software including some free online services Thus the use restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document are not secure and cannot be assured once the file is distributed this warning is displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files br Even without removing the password most freeware or open source PDF readers ignore the permission protections and allow the user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document were not limited by password protection br Beginning with PDF Usage rights UR signatures are used to enable additional interactive features that are not available by default in a particular PDF viewer application The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by a bona fide granting authority For example it can be used to allow a user br br To save the PDF document along with a modified form or annotation data br Import form data files in FDF XFDF and text CSV TSV formats br Export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats br Submit form data br Instantiate new pages from named page templates br Apply a digital signature to existing digital signature form field br Create delete modify copy import and export annotations br For example Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features in Adobe Reader using public key cryptography Adobe Reader verifies that the signature uses a certificate from an Adobe authorized certificate authority Any PDF application can use this same mechanism for its own purposes br Under specific circumstances including non patched systems of the receiver the information the receiver of a digital signed document sees can be manipulated by the sender after the document has been signed by the signer br PAdES PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures is a set of restrictions and extensions to PDF and ISO making it suitable for advanced electronic signatures This is published by ETSI as TS br br br File attachments br PDF files can have file attachments which processors may access and open or save to a local filesystem br br br Metadata br PDF files can contain two types of metadata The first is the Document Information Dictionary a set of key value fields such as author title subject creation and update dates This is optional and is referenced from an Info key in the trailer of the file A small set of fields is defined and can be extended with additional text values if required This method is deprecated in PDF br In PDF support was added for Metadata Streams using the Extensible Metadata Platform XMP to add XML standards based extensible metadata as used in other file formats PDF allows metadata to be attached to any object in the document such as information about embedded illustrations fonts and images as well as the whole document attaching to the document catalog using an extensible schema br PDF documents can also contain display settings including the page display layout and zoom level in a Viewer Preferences object Adobe Reader uses these settings to override the user s default settings when opening the document The free Adobe Reader cannot remove these settings br br br Accessibility br PDF files can be created specifically to be accessible to people with disabilities PDF file formats in use as of can include tags text equivalents captions audio descriptions and more Some software can automatically produce tagged PDFs but this feature is not always enabled by default Leading screen readers including JAWS Window Eyes Hal and Kurzweil and can read tagged PDFs Moreover tagged PDFs can be re flowed and magnified for readers with visual impairments Adding tags to older PDFs and those that are generated from scanned documents can present some challenges br One of the significant challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views which depending on the document s creation can be inconsistent with each other The three views are i the physical view ii the tags view and iii the content view The physical view is displayed and printed what most people consider a PDF document The tags view is what screen readers and other assistive technologies use to deliver high quality navigation and reading experience to users with disabilities The content view is based on the physical order of objects within the PDF s content stream and may be displayed by software that does not fully support the tags view such as the Reflow feature in Adobe s Reader br PDF UA the International Standard for accessible PDF based on ISO was first published as ISO in and establishes normative language for accessible PDF technology br br br Multimedia br Rich Media PDF is a PDF file including interactive content that can be embedded or linked within the file It can contain images audio video content or buttons For example if the interactive PDF is a digital catalog for an E commerce business products can be listed on the PDF pages and can be added with images and links to the website and buttons to order directly from the document br br br Forms br Interactive Forms is a mechanism to add forms to the PDF file format PDF currently supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms Both formats today coexist in the PDF specification br br AcroForms also known as Acrobat forms introduced in the PDF format specification and included in all later PDF specifications br XML Forms Architecture XFA forms introduced in the PDF format specification Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with AcroForms XFA was deprecated from PDF with PDF br AcroForms were introduced in the PDF format AcroForms permit the uses of objects e g text boxes Radio buttons etc and some code e g JavaScript Alongside the standard PDF action types interactive forms AcroForms support submitting resetting and importing data The submit action transmits the names and values of selected interactive form fields to a specified uniform resource locator URL Interactive form field names and values may be submitted in any of the following formats depending on the settings of the action s ExportFormat SubmitPDF and XFDF flags br br HTML Form format br HTML Specification since PDF HTML since br Forms Data Format FDF br based on PDF uses the same syntax and has essentially the same file structure but is much simpler than PDF since the body of an FDF document consists of only one required object Forms Data Format is defined in the PDF specification since PDF The Forms Data Format can be used when submitting form data to a server receiving the response and incorporating it into the interactive form It can also be used to export form data to stand alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form FDF was originally defined in as part of ISO br XML Forms Data Format XFDF br external XML Forms Data Format Specification Version supported since PDF it replaced the XML form submission format defined in PDF the XML version of Forms Data Format but the XFDF implements only a subset of FDF containing forms and annotations Some entries in the FDF dictionary do not have XFDF equivalents such as the Status Encoding JavaScript Page s keys EmbeddedFDFs Differences and Target In addition XFDF does not allow the spawning or addition of new pages based on the given data as can be done when using an FDF file The XFDF specification is referenced but not included in PDF specification and in later versions It is described separately in XML Forms Data Format Specification The PDF specification allowed form submissions in XML format but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF specification XFDF conforms to the XML standard XFDF can be used in the same way as FDF e g form data is submitted to a server modifications are made then sent back and the new form data is imported in an interactive form It can also be used to export form data to stand alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form As of August XFDF is an ISO IEC standard under the formal name ISO Document management XML Forms Data Format Part Use of ISO XFDF This standard is a normative reference of ISO br PDF br The entire document can be submitted rather than individual fields and values as was defined in PDF br AcroForms can keep form field values in external stand alone files containing key value pairs The external files may use Forms Data Format FDF and XML Forms Data Format XFDF files The usage rights UR signatures define rights for import form data files in FDF XFDF and text CSV TSV formats and export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats br In PDF Adobe Systems introduced a proprietary format for forms Adobe XML Forms Architecture XFA Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with ISO s AcroForms feature and most PDF processors do not handle XFA content The XFA specification is referenced from ISO PDF as an external proprietary specification and was entirely deprecated from PDF with ISO PDF br br br Licensing br Anyone may create applications that can read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to Adobe Systems Adobe holds patents to PDF but licenses them for royalty free use in developing software complying with its PDF specification br br br Security br br br Changes to content br In November researchers from Ruhr University Bochum and Hackmanit GmbH published attacks on digitally signed PDFs They showed how to change the visible content in a signed PDF without invalidating the signature in of desktop PDF viewers and of online validation services by abusing implementation flaws br At the same conference they additionally showed how to exfiltrate the plaintext of encrypted content in PDFs In they showed new so called shadow attacks on PDFs that abuse the flexibility of features provided in the specification An overview of security issues in PDFs regarding denial of service information disclosure data manipulation and arbitrary code execution attacks was presented by Jens M ller br br br Malware vulnerability br PDF files can be infected with viruses Trojans and other malware They can have hidden JavaScript code that might exploit vulnerabilities in a PDF hidden objects executed when the file that hides them is opened and less commonly a malicious PDF can launch malware br PDF attachments carrying viruses were first discovered in The virus named OUTLOOK PDFWorm or Peachy uses Microsoft Outlook to send itself as an attached Adobe PDF file It was activated with Adobe Acrobat but not with Acrobat Reader br From time to time new vulnerabilities are discovered in various versions of Adobe Reader prompting the company to issue security fixes Other PDF readers are also susceptible One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file providing a vector for attack If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure Some of these vulnerabilities are a result of the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits although it does not protect against exploits in other parts of the PDF viewing software Security experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing br On March security researcher Didier Stevens reported an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader exploit that runs a malicious executable if the user allows it to launch when asked br br br Software br br br Viewers and editors br Many PDF viewers are provided free of charge from a variety of sources Programs to manipulate and edit PDF files are available usually for purchase br There are many software options for creating PDFs including the PDF printing capabilities built into macOS iOS and most Linux distributions Much document processing software including LibreOffice Microsoft Office if updated to SP and later WordPerfect and Scribus can export documents in PDF format There are many PDF print drivers for Microsoft Windows the pdfTeX typesetting system the DocBook PDF tools applications developed around Ghostscript and Adobe Acrobat itself as well as Adobe InDesign Adobe FrameMaker Adobe Illustrator Adobe Photoshop that allow a PDF printer to be set up which when selected sends output to a PDF file instead of a physical printer Google s online office suite Google Docs allows uploading and saving to PDF Some web apps offer free PDF editing and annotation tools br The Free Software Foundation was developing a free high quality and fully functional set of libraries and programs that implement the PDF file format and associated technologies to the ISO standard as one of its high priority projects In however the GNU PDF project was removed from the list of high priority projects due to the maturation of the Poppler library which has enjoyed wider use in applications such as Evince with the GNOME desktop environment Poppler is based on Xpdf code base There are also commercial development libraries available as listed in List of PDF software br The Apache PDFBox project of the Apache Software Foundation is an open source Java library licensed under the Apache License for working with PDF documents br br br Printing br Raster image processors RIPs are used to convert PDF files into a raster format suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers digital production presses and prepress in a process known as rasterization RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine from Adobe Systems and Jaws and the Harlequin RIP from Global Graphics br In the Jaws raster image processor from Global Graphics became the first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format The company released an upgrade to its Harlequin RIP with the same capability in br Agfa Gevaert introduced and shipped Apogee the first prepress workflow system based on PDF in br Many commercial offset printers have accepted the submission of press ready PDF files as a print source specifically the PDF X a subset and variations of the same The submission of press ready PDF files is a replacement for the problematic need for receiving collected native working files br In PDF was widely accepted as the standard print job format at the Open Source Development Labs Printing Summit It is supported as a print job format by the Common Unix Printing System and desktop application projects such as GNOME KDE Firefox Thunderbird LibreOffice and OpenOffice have switched to emit print jobs in PDF br Some desktop printers also support direct PDF printing which can interpret PDF data without external help br br br Native display model br br PDF was selected as the native metafile format for Mac OS X replacing the PICT format of the earlier classic Mac OS The imaging model of the Quartz graphics layer is based on the model common to Display PostScript and PDF leading to the nickname Display PDF The Preview application can display PDF files as can version and later of the Safari web browser System level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically provided they support the OS standard printing architecture The files are then exported in PDF format according to the file header When taking a screenshot under Mac OS X versions through the image was also captured as a PDF later versions save screen captures as a PNG file though this behavior can be set back to PDF if desired br br br Annotation br br Adobe Acrobat is one example of proprietary software that allows the user to annotate highlight and add notes to already created PDF files One UNIX application available as free software under the GNU General Public License is PDFedit The freeware Foxit Reader available for Microsoft Windows macOS and Linux allows annotating documents Tracker Software s PDF XChange Viewer allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative Apple s macOS s integrated PDF viewer Preview does also enable annotations as does the open source software Skim with the latter supporting interaction with LaTeX SyncTeX and PDFSync and integration with BibDesk reference management software Freeware Qiqqa can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs The Text Verification Tool exports differences in documents as annotations and markups br There are also web annotation systems that support annotation in pdf and other document formats In cases where PDFs are expected to have all of the functionality of paper documents ink annotation is required br br br Conversion and Information Extraction br PDF s emphasis on preserving the visual appearance of documents across different software and hardware platforms poses challenges to the conversion of PDF documents to other file formats and the targeted extraction of information such as text images tables bibliographic information and document metadata Numerous tools and source code libraries support these tasks Several labeled datasets to test PDF conversion and information extraction tools exist and have been used for benchmark evaluations of the tool s performance br br br Alternatives br br The Open XML Paper Specification is a competing format used both as a page description language and as the native print spooler format for Microsoft Windows since Windows Vista br Mixed Object Document Content Architecture is a competing format MO DCA P is a part of Advanced
