The computer program pdfTeX is an extension of Knuth s typesetting program TeX and was originally written and developed into a publicly usable product by H n Th Th nh as a part of the work for his PhD thesis at the Faculty of Informatics Masaryk University Brno Czech Republic The idea of making this extension to TeX was conceived during the early s when Ji Zlatu ka and Phil Taylor discussed some developmental ideas with Donald Knuth at Stanford University Knuth later met H n Th Th nh in Brno during his visit to the Faculty of Informatics to receive an honorary doctorate from Masaryk University br Two prominent characteristics of pdfTeX are character protrusion which generalizes the concept of hanging punctuation and font expansion an implementation of Hermann Zapf s ideas for improving the grayness of a typeset page Both extend the core paragraph breaking routine They are discussed in Th nh s PhD thesis br pdfTeX is included in most modern distributions of LaTeX and ConTeXt including TeX Live MacTeX and MiKTeX and used as the default TeX engine The main difference between TeX and pdfTeX is that whereas TeX outputs DVI files pdfTeX can output PDF files directly This allows tight integration of PDF features such as hypertext links and tables of contents using packages such as hyperref On the other hand packages such as PSTricks which exploit the earlier conversion process of DVI to PostScript may fail although replacements such as PGF TikZ have been written Direct embedding of PostScript graphics is no longer functional and one has to use a program such as eps pdf to convert EPS files to PDF which can then be directly inserted by pdfTeX br It is possible to obtain DVI output from pdfTeX This DVI output should be identical to that of TeX unless pdfTeX s extra microtypography features have been activated Moreover since LaTeX ConTeXt et al are simply macro packages for TeX they work equally well with pdfTeX Hence pdflatex for example calls the pdfTeX program using the standard LaTeX macros to typeset LaTeX documents whereas it is the default rendering engine for ConTeXt documents br br br Features br pdfTeX has several features not available in standard TeX br br Native TrueType and Type font embedding br Micro typographic extensions such as margin kerning and font expansion br Direct access to PDF specific features such as hyperlinks tables of contents and document information br br br See also br br List of TeX extensions br List of PDF software br LuaTeX br XeTeX br br br br br br External links br pdfTeX project page br pdfTeX manual br Micro typographic extensions to the TeX typesetting system dissertation by H n Th Th nh br interview
