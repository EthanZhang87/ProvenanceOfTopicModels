Raphael Linus Levien also known as Raph Levien born April is a software developer a member of the free software developer community through his creation of the Advogato virtual community and his work with the free software branch of Ghostscript From until and from onwards he was employed at Google He holds a PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley He also made a computer assisted proof system similar to Metamath Ghilbert In April Levien announced a text editor made as a Project Google allows some employees to spend of their working hours developing their own projects Xi br br br Imaging and typography br The primary focus of Levien s work and research is in the varied areas regarding the theory of imaging that is rendering pictures and fonts for electronic display which in addition to being aesthetically and mathematically important also contribute to the accessibility and search openness of the web br Levien has written several papers documenting his research in halftoning technology which has been implemented in the Gimp Print free software package as well as by several commercial implementations He also created Gill the GNOME desktop illustration application which aimed at supporting the W C SVG standard for Vector Graphics He states it was named after Eric Gill the English type designer responsible for the Gill Sans Perpetua and Joanna fonts Direct development on Gill ceased around the year but a fork of its codebase has evolved to Sodipodi and through it to Inkscape br In Levien completed a PhD thesis entitled From Spiral to Spline Optimal Techniques in Interactive Curve Design and published a standalone essay on the mathematical history of Elastica He calls the Elastica A beautiful family of curves based on beautiful mathematics and a rich and fascinating history br Beginning in his work with Google largely focused on introducing high quality open licensed well organized webfonts to the internet through Google s webfont API Here his experience with typographical technology history and industry helped to shape the development of this growing resource though he has since moved on from the project to work on Android fonts and text layout br One of his own fonts Inconsolata named in as one of the ten best programming fonts by Hivelogic and generally known for its clean lines and elegant design is now available within the Google library Regarding this font and his curves work in general Levien had to say And in fact I don t just use the Euler spirals I use a mixture of curves my package is called Spiro which is kind of an abbreviation for polynomial spirals Most Inconsolata the monospaced font mentioned above is drawn using G continuous splines which are a very close approximation to the Minimum Variation Curve of Henry Moreton I now think that s overkill and G continuous splines the Euler spiral ones are plenty and could be done with fewer points br br br Advogato br In November Levien founded Advogato a social website for the free software community to test his ideas of attack resistant trust metrics and to provide a development focused forum for the free software community that was free of the kind of commercial motivations of such sites as SourceForge br The site has been successful from the point of view of the first criterion surviving many attacks aimed at subverting the attack metric made both by developers trying out attacks and by spammers The site has needed only relatively minor changes to cope with these The site s trust metric provides alongside Epinions one of the two most important datasets used in the empirical analysis of trust metrics and reputation systems Levien observed that Google s PageRank algorithm can be understood to be an attack resistant trust metric rather similar to that behind Advogato br The site has had a more rocky road as a forum for free software developers and currently hosts less discussion than at its peak as developers have moved from forums to weblogs Due to this Advogato has added a syndication feature that includes the weblogs of its current certified developer base It remains one of the earlier networking sites and is still a place for active discussion on the development of free software br br br Activism in GPL licensed software and encryption legislation br Levien played a small part in precipitating the relaxation of the US crypto export legislation by filing for a Commodities Jurisdiction Request for a T shirt containing an implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm in four lines of Perl At the time the code on the T shirt would have been regarded as a munition by the United States and other NATO governments br ZD Net s Interactive week summarised the issue that patents pose to the free software community br br Levien recognizes the paradox On one hand he made money from forcing everyone who used his patented ideas to give him royalties On the other he shared the source code of several programs and recognized how the cooperation helped him and others The two models were in conflict br As a resolution to this conflict in March Levien made a patent grant of his patent portfolio to the GPL community br br br Personal life br He is divorced with two sons Alan and Max He is a member of the Berkeley Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends Quakers In the book TeX People Interviews from the world of TeX Levien notes I was born in Enkhuizen the Netherlands and moved to Virginia when I was three so I don t really speak Dutch or anything but I do find myself with a
