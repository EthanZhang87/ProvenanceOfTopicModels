ISO is an ISO standard for the computer interpretable representation and exchange of product manufacturing information It is an ASCII based format Its official title is Automation systems and integration Product data representation and exchange It is known informally as STEP which stands for Standard for the Exchange of Product model data ISO can represent D objects in Computer aided design CAD and related information br br br Overview br The objective of the international standard is to provide a mechanism that is capable of describing product data throughout the life cycle of a product independent from any particular system The nature of this description makes it suitable not only for neutral file exchange but also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases and archiving br STEP can be typically used to exchange data between CAD computer aided manufacturing computer aided engineering product data management enterprise data modeling and other CAx systems br STEP addresses product data from mechanical and electrical design geometric dimensioning and tolerancing analysis and manufacturing as well as additional information specific to various industries such as automotive aerospace building construction ship oil and gas process plants and others br STEP is developed and maintained by the ISO technical committee TC Automation systems and integration sub committee SC Industrial data Like other ISO and IEC standards STEP is copyright by ISO and is not freely available However the EXPRESS schemas are freely available as are the recommended practices for implementers br Other standards developed and maintained by ISO TC SC are br br ISO PLIB Parts Library br ISO MANDATE Industrial manufacturing management data br ISO Process Plants including Oil and Gas facilities Life Cycle data br ISO PSL Process specification language br ISO IIDEAS Integration of industrial data for exchange access and sharing br ISO Open technical dictionaries and their application to master data br ISO Data quality br STEP is closely related with PLIB ISO IEC br br br History br The basis for STEP was the Product Data Exchange Specification PDES which was initiated during the mid s and was submitted to ISO in The Product Data Exchange Specification PDES was a data definition effort intended to improve interoperability between manufacturing companies and thereby improve productivity br The evolution of STEP can be divided into four release phases The development of STEP started in as a successor of IGES SET and VDA FS The initial plan was that STEP shall be based on one single complete implementation independent Product Information Model which shall be the Master Record of the integrated topical and application information models But because of the complexity the standard had to be broken up into smaller parts that can be developed balloted and approved separately In ISO published the initial release of STEP as international standards IS with the parts AP and AP Today AP Configuration controlled D design is still one of the most important parts of STEP and supported by many CAD systems for import and export br In the second phase the capabilities of STEP were widely extended primarily for the design of products in the aerospace automotive electrical electronic and other industries This phase ended in the year with the second major release including the STEP parts AP AP AP AP AP AP AP AP AP Basic harmonization between the APs especially in the geometric areas was achieved by introducing the Application Interpreted Constructs AIC series br A major problem with the monolithic APs of the first and second releases is that they are too big have too much overlap with each other and are not sufficiently harmonized These deficits led to the development of the STEP modular architecture and series This activity was primarily driven by new APs covering additional life cycle phases such as early requirement analysis AP and maintenance and repair AP and also new industrial areas AP AP New editions of the previous monolithic APs on a modular basis have been developed AP AP AP The publication of these new editions coincided with the release in of the new ISO product SMRL the STEP Module and Resource Library that contains all STEP resource parts and application modules on a single CD The SMRL will be revised frequently and is available at a much lower cost than purchasing all the parts separately br In December ISO published the first edition of a new major Application Protocol AP Managed model based d engineering that combined and replaced the following previous APs in an upward compatible way br br AP Explicit draughting Simple D drawing geometry related to a product No association no assembly hierarchy br AP Associative draughting D D drawing with association but no product structure br AP Configuration controlled D designs of mechanical parts and assemblies br AP Mechanical design using boundary representation br AP Core data for automotive mechanical design processes br AP Managed model based D engineering br AP was created by merging the following two Application protocols br br AP Configuration controlled D designs of mechanical parts and assemblies as used by the Aerospace Industry br AP Core data for automotive mechanical design processes used by the Automotive Industry br In addition AP edition contains extensions and significant updates for br br Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing br Kinematics br Tessellation br Two APs had been modified to be directly based on AP and thus became supersets of it br br AP Composite and metallic structural analysis and related design br AP Electronic assembly interconnect and packaging design This is the most complex and sophisticated STEP AP br br AP edition published in April extends edition domain by the description of Electrical Wire Harnesses and introduces an extension of STEP modelisation and implementation methods based on SysML and system engineering with an optimized XML implementation method br This new edition contains also enhancements on D Dimensioning and Tolerancing and Composite Design New functionalities are also introduced like br br curved triangles br textures br levels of detail LODs br color on vertex br D scanner data support br persistent IDs on geometry br additive manufacturing br br br Structure br br STEP is divided into many parts grouped into br br Environment br Parts x Description methods EXPRESS EXPRESS X br Parts x Implementation methods STEP File STEP XML SDAI br Parts x Conformance testing methodology and framework br Integrated data models br The Integrated Resources IR consisting of br Parts x and x Integrated generic resources br Parts xx Integrated application resources br PLIB ISO Parts library Logical model of expressions br Parts xx Application Interpreted Constructs AIC br Parts xxx Application Modules AM br Top parts br Parts xx Application Protocols AP br Parts xx Abstract Test Suites ATS for APs br Parts xx Implementation modules for APs br In total STEP consists of several hundred parts and every year new parts are added or new revisions of older parts are released This makes STEP the biggest standard within ISO br Each part has its own scope and introduction br The APs are the top parts They cover a particular application and industry domain and hence are most relevant for users of STEP Every AP defines one or several Conformance Classes suitable for a particular kind of product or data exchange scenario To provide a better understanding of the scope information requirements and usage scenarios an informative application activity model AAM is added to every AP using IDEF br STEP is primarily defining data models using the EXPRESS modeling language Application data according to a given data model can be exchanged either by a STEP File STEP XML or via shared database access using SDAI br Every AP defines a top data models to be used for data exchange called the Application Interpreted Model AIM or in the case of a modular AP called Module Interpreted Models MIM These interpreted models are constructed by choosing generic objects defined in lower level data models x x xx xx and adding specializations needed for the particular application domain of the AP The common generic data models are the basis for interoperability between APs for different kinds of industries and life cycle stages br In APs with several Conformance Classes the top data model is divided into subsets one for each Conformance Class br The requirements of a conformant STEP application are br br implementation of either a preprocessor or a postprocessor or both br using one of the STEP implementation methods STEP File STEP XML or SDAI for the AIM MIM data model and br supporting one or several conformance classes of an AP br Originally every APs was required to have a companion Abstract test suite ATS e g ATS for AP providing Test Purposes Verdict Criteria and Abstract Test Cases together with example STEP Files But because the development of an ATS was very expensive and inefficient this requirement was dropped and replaced by the requirements to have an informal validation report and recommended practices how to use it Today the recommended practices are a primary source for those going to implement STEP br The Application Reference Models ARM is the mediator between the AAM and the AIM MIM Originally its purpose was only to document high level application objects and the basic relations between them IDEF X diagrams documented the AP of early APs in an informal way The ARM objects their attributes and relations are mapped to the AIM so that it is possible to implement an AP As APs got more and more complex formal methods were needed to document the ARM and so EXPRESS which was originally only developed for the AIM was also used for the ARM Over time these ARM models got very detailed till to the point that some implementations preferred to use the ARM instead of the formally required AIM MIM Today a few APs have ARM based exchange formats standardized outside of ISO TC SC br br PLM Services within the OMG for AP br ISO Data model for computerized numerical controllers for AP br PLCS DEXs within OASIS organization for AP br There is a bigger overlap between APs because they often need to refer to the same kind of products product structures geometry and more And because APs are developed by different groups of people it was always an issue to ensure interoperability between APs on a higher level The Application Interpreted Constructs AIC solved this problem for common specializations of generic concepts primarily in the geometric area To address the problem of harmonizing the ARM models and their mapping to the AIM the STEP modules were introduced They contain a piece of the ARM the mapping and a piece of the AIM called MIM Modules are built on each other resulting in an almost directed graph with the AP and conformance class modules at the very top The modular APs are br br AP Composite and metallic structural analysis and related design br AP Electronic assembly interconnect and packaging design br AP Functional data and schematic representation of process plants br AP Furniture product data and project data br AP Product life cycle support br AP Managed model based d engineering br The modular editions of AP and are explicit extensions of AP br br br Coverage of STEP Application Protocols AP br The STEP APs can be roughly grouped into the three main areas design manufacturing and life cycle support br Design APs br br Mechanical br AP Sheet metal die planning and design br AP Composite and metallic structural analysis

data and schematic representation of process plants br AP Generic Model for Life Cycle Support of AEC Facilities planned br The AP model is very similar to the ISO model whereas AP follows the STEP architecture and ISO has a different architecture They both use ISO as their common reference data library or dictionary of standard instances A further development of both standards resulted in Gellish English as general product modeling language that is application domain independent and that is proposed as a work item NWI for a new standard br The original intent of STEP was to publish one integrated data model for all life cycle aspects But due to the complexity different groups of developers and different speed in the development processes the splitting into several APs was needed But this splitting made it difficult to ensure that APs are interoperable in overlapping areas Main areas of harmonization are br br AP and for technical drawings with extension in AP and for schematic functionality br AP and for machining features and for Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing br For complex areas it is clear that more than one APs are needed to cover all major aspects br br AP and for electro mechanical products such as a car or a transformer This will be addressed by the second edition of AP that is currently under development br AP and for electro electronic mechanical products br AP for ships br AP and for the complete design and manufacturing process of piece parts br br br See also br Boundary representation br Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing br ISO
