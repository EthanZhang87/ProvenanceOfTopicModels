Computer Modern is the original family of typefaces used by the typesetting program TeX It was created by Donald Knuth with his Metafont program and was most recently updated in Computer Modern or variants of it remains very widely used in scientific publishing especially in disciplines that make frequent use of mathematical notation br br br Design br br Computer Modern is a Didone or modern serif font a genre that emerged in the late th century as a contrast to the more organic designs that preceded them Didone fonts have high contrast between thick and thin elements and their axis of stress or thickening is perfectly vertical Computer Modern was specifically based on the point size of the American Lanston Monotype Company s Modern Extended A part of a family Monotype originally released in This was one of many modern faces issued by typefounders and Monotype around this period and the standard style for body text printing in the late nineteenth century br In creating the TeX publishing system Knuth was influenced by the history of mathematics and a desire to achieve the classic style of books printed in metal type Modern faces were used extensively for printing mathematics especially before Times New Roman became popular for mathematics printing from the s br The most unusual characteristic of Computer Modern however is the fact that it is a complete type family designed with Knuth s Metafont system one of the few typefaces developed in this way The Computer Modern source files are governed by distinct parameters controlling the widths and heights of various elements the presence of serifs or old style numerals whether dots such as the dot on the i are square or rounded and the degree of superness in the bowls of lowercase letters such as g and o This allows Metafont designs to be processed in unusual ways Knuth has shown effects such as morphing in demonstrations where one font slowly transitions into another over the course of a text While it attracted attention for the concept Metafont has been used by few other font designers by Knuth commented asking an artist to become enough of a mathematician to understand how to write a font with parameters is too much while digital period font designer Jonathan Hoefler commented in that Knuth s idea that letters start with skeletal forms is flawed br br br Derived versions br br Knuth produced his original Computer Modern fonts using Metafont a program that reads stroke based definitions of glyphs and outputs ready to use fonts as bitmap image files He mostly left the font as with other components of TeX with the exception of the TeX and Metafont names themselves a stipulation Knuth made to maintain quality control in the public domain br The advance of publishing technology PostScript PDF laser printers has reduced the need for bitmap fonts The preferred formats are now outline fonts such as Type TrueType or OpenType which can be rendered efficiently at arbitrary resolution and using sophisticated anti aliasing techniques by printer firmware or on screen document viewers Therefore several other projects have ported the Computer Modern fonts into such formats Some of these projects have also complemented Computer Modern with br br additional characters euro accented characters Cyrillic and Greek script coverage br different font encodings to overcome problems with Knuth s original bit character sets br additional font style variants br Several such derivatives are now also widely used and included in TeX Live a modern TeX distribution br br br CMU br A current extended release of the Computer Modern family in the general purpose OpenType format is the CMU distribution for Computer Modern Unicode br br CMU Serif the main Computer Modern font family This includes the four traditional styles of font regular italic bold bold italic and also br CMU Serif upright italic an upright italic style similar to cursive upright handwriting br CMU Serif bold non extended a bold weight duplexed to have the same width as the regular style br CMU Serif roman and bold slanted two oblique styles br CMU Classical Serif an italic design with slightly simpler serif designs br Concrete Roman a slab serif font in the four standard styles br CMU Typewriter a typewriter style slab serif font br CMU Sans Serif a complementary sans serif font and CMU Bright a lighter style of the same design br CMU Sans demi condensed a condensed style of the same design br CMU is released under the SIL Open Font License br br br BlueSky br Computer Modern was first transformed to a PostScript Type font format by BlueSky Inc in and then to Type in to include font hinting The Type version has since then been donated to the American Mathematical Society AMS which distributes them freely under the Open Font License It is found in most standard TeX distributions br br br Latin Modern br The Latin Modern implementation maintained by Bogus aw Jackowski and Janusz M Nowacki of TeX User Group Poland GUST is now standard in the TeX community and was made through a Metafont MetaPost derivative called METATYPE It was derived from the BlueSky Type fonts which were converted back into outline based METATYPE programs from which then the extended Type and OpenType Latin Modern fonts were developed ConTeXt uses Latin Modern as default font instead of Computer Modern br The Type to METATYPE to Type round trip conversion process involved in the production of the Latin Modern fonts tried to preserve the hinting information of the BlueSky fonts however it introduced rounding errors that affect the quality of the hinting at low pixel sizes As a result on screen display of the Latin Modern fonts can result in a less even display of kerning and character heights than with the BlueSky fonts br The same process was later extended to some free PostScript font clones under the umbrella project TeX Gyre br The Latin Modern font has also gained an OpenType math table Unlike Computer Modern Math Latin Modern Math has no pairwise kerning information OpenType math rendering does not make use of this type of kerning making such information useless br br br New Computer Modern br The New Computer Modern font family is a large extension in terms of the number of additional glyphs of the Latin Modern fonts which adds support for several more languages such as Greek Cyrillic Hebrew Cherokee and Coptic This font family comes in two weights Regular and Book The book weight is supposed to look slightly heavier compared to the Regular Both the weights include support for typesetting mathematics complete coverage of unicode math blocks is provided along with some more glyphs needed for mathematics br br br MLModern br MLModern is based on the Latin Modern font It avoids the spindliness of most other Type versions of Computer Modern and hence looks thicker in comparison to Latin Modern or Computer Modern br A visual comparison of Computer Modern Latin Modern New Computer Modern Book and MLModern is shown here br br br Others br EC fonts look much like Computer Modern but have slightly different metrics These were the first TeX fonts to use the Cork encoding in LaTeX also known as T encoding that provides precomposed glyphs for West European languages The original EC fonts were only available as Metafont generated bitmaps br TC fonts the TeX Companion fonts provide a number of additional symbols commonly used in text br BaKoMa fonts another automatically generated Type version of Computer Modern by Basil K Malyshev dating to The fonts remain available for download after Malyshev s death br CM super a very large extension of Computer Modern available in a variety of encodings These fonts were automatically vectorized from Computer Modern or EC font bitmaps and therefore lack the hinting information in the BlueSky fonts br CM LGC a Latin Greek Cyrillic extension br br br See also br STIX Fonts a project to create Times New Roman
