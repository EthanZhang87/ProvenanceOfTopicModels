GeoGebra a portmanteau of geometry and algebra is an interactive geometry algebra statistics and calculus application intended for learning and teaching mathematics and science from primary school to university level GeoGebra is available on multiple platforms with apps for desktops Windows macOS and Linux tablets Android iPad and Windows and web It is presently owned by Indian edutech firm Byju s br br br History br GeoGebra s creator Markus Hohenwarter started the project in as part of his master s thesis at the University of Salzburg After a successful Kickstarter campaign GeoGebra expanded its offering to include an iPad an Android and a Windows Store app version In GeoGebra incorporated Bernard Parisse s Xcas into its CAS view The project is now freeware with open source portions and multi lingual and Hohenwarter continues to lead its development at the University of Linz br GeoGebra includes both commercial and not for profit entities that work together from the head office in Linz Austria to expand the software and cloud services available to users br In December GeoGebra was acquired by edtech conglomerate Byju s for approximately million USD br On January lenders began bankruptcy proceedings against GeoGebra s parent company Byju s in an effort to repay its loans On February Byju s U S division filed for Chapter bankruptcy in Delaware Byju s would raise around million in an effort to clear immediate liabilities and for other operational costs br br br Features br GeoGebra is an interactive mathematics software suite for learning and teaching science technology engineering and mathematics from primary school up to the university level Constructions can be made with points vectors segments lines polygons conic sections inequalities implicit polynomials and functions all of which can be edited dynamically later Elements can be entered and modified using mouse and touch controls or through an input bar GeoGebra can store variables for numbers vectors and points calculate derivatives and integrals of functions and has a full complement of commands like Root or Extremum Teachers and students can use GeoGebra as an aid in formulating and proving geometric conjectures br GeoGebra s main features are br br Interactive geometry environment D and D br Built in spreadsheet br Built in computer algebra system CAS br Built in statistics and calculus tools br Scripting hooks br Large number of interactive learning and teaching resources at GeoGebra Materials br br br GeoGebra Materials platform br The GeoGebra Materials platform is a cloud service that allows users to upload and share GeoGebra applets with others GeoGebra Materials was originally launched as GeoGebraTube in June and was renamed in As of April the service hosts more than million resources of which are public Materials include interactive worksheets simulations games and e books created using GeoGebraBook br GeoGebra Materials can be also exported in several formats including SVG Animated GIF Windows Metafile PNG PDF and EPS as well as copied directly to the clipboard GeoGebra can also generate code for use in LaTeX files br br br Licensing br Before version GeoGebra was published under the GNU General Public License GPL or later br After version the licensing was changed GeoGebra s source code except the installers web services user interface
