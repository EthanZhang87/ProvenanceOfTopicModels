PostScript often abbreviated as PS is a page description language and dynamically typed stack based programming language It is most commonly used in the electronic publishing and desktop publishing realm but as a Turing complete programming language it can be used for many other purposes as well PostScript was created at Adobe Systems by John Warnock Charles Geschke Doug Brotz Ed Taft and Bill Paxton from to The most recent version PostScript was released in br br br History br The concepts of the PostScript language were seeded in by John Gaffney at Evans Sutherland a computer graphics company At that time Gaffney and John Warnock were developing an interpreter for a large three dimensional graphics database of New York Harbor br Concurrently researchers at Xerox PARC had developed the first laser printer and had recognized the need for a standard means of defining page images In Bob Sproull and William Newman developed the Press format which was eventually used in the Xerox Star system to drive laser printers But Press a data format rather than a language lacked flexibility and PARC mounted the Interpress effort to create a successor br In John Gaffney and Martin Newell then at Xerox PARC wrote J M or JaM for John and Martin which was used for VLSI design and the investigation of type and graphics printing This work later evolved and expanded into the Interpress language br Warnock left with Chuck Geschke and founded Adobe Systems in December They together with Doug Brotz Ed Taft and Bill Paxton created a simpler language similar to Interpress called PostScript which went on the market in br Meanwhile in the spring of Steve Jobs came to visit Adobe and was dazzled by PostScript s potential especially for the new Macintosh computer he was developing at Apple To John Sculley s frustration Jobs licensed the PostScript technology from Adobe by offering a million advance against PostScript royalties plus million in exchange for percent of Adobe shares During a series of meetings in Jobs also repeatedly offered for Apple to buy Adobe outright but the founders kept turning him down In December the two companies finally signed off on the PostScript licensing deal and Adobe had to shift focus immediately from high end high resolution printing devices to the consumer oriented Apple LaserWriter laser printer br At that time the dpi Canon laser printing engine to be used in LaserWriters was seen as good enough only for proof printing i e for crude rough drafts of material whose final drafts would be sent to professional high resolution devices but Jobs presented Adobe with the challenge of making PostScript render high quality output to such a low resolution device which for most consumers would be their only printing device In response Warnock and Brotz solved the so called appearance problem of making the stem width of letters scale properly so that they look good at all resolutions Their breakthrough was so important that Adobe has never patented the technology in order to keep its details concealed as a trade secret Paxton worked on several other related improvements such as font hinting Adobe was also responsible for porting PostScript to the Canon s Motorola chip br Apple and Adobe announced the LaserWriter at Apple s annual stockholder meeting on January It was the first printer to ship with PostScript sparking the desktop publishing DTP revolution in the mid s The original PostScript royalty was five percent of the list price for each laser printer sold which was of the original LaserWriter list price of and such royalties provided nearly all of Adobe s income during its early years Apple later renegotiated the contract to pay a licensing fee based on volume of printers shipped The combination of technical merits and widespread availability made PostScript the language of choice for graphical output for printing applications An interpreter sometimes referred to as a RIP for Raster Image Processor for the PostScript language was a common component of laser printers during the s and s br However the cost of implementation was high computers output raw PS code that would be interpreted by the printer into a raster image at the printer s natural resolution This required high performance microprocessors and ample memory The LaserWriter used a MHz Motorola making it faster than any of the Macintosh computers to which it was attached When the laser printer engines themselves cost over a thousand dollars the added cost of PS was marginal But as printer mechanisms fell in price the cost of implementing PS became too great a fraction of overall printer cost In addition with desktop computers becoming more powerful during the s than their attached printers it no longer made sense to offload the rasterization work onto the resource constrained printer By few low end printer models came with onboard support for PostScript largely due to growing competition from much cheaper non PostScript inkjet printers and new software based methods to render PostScript images on computers making them suitable for any printer PDF a descendant of PostScript provides one such method and has largely replaced PostScript as the de facto standard for electronic document distribution br On high end printers PostScript processors remain common and their use can dramatically reduce the CPU work involved in printing documents transferring the work of rendering PostScript images from the computer to the printer br br br PostScript Level br The first version of the PostScript language was released to the market in The qualifier Level was added when Level was introduced br br br PostScript Level br PostScript Level was introduced in and included several improvements improved speed and reliability support for in Raster Image Processing RIP separations image decompression for example JPEG images could be rendered by a PostScript program support for composite fonts and the form mechanism for caching reusable content br br br PostScript br PostScript Adobe dropped the level terminology in favor of simple versioning came at the end of and along with many new dictionary based versions of older operators introduced better color handling and new filters which allow in program compression decompression program chunking and advanced error handling br PostScript was significant in terms of replacing the existing proprietary color electronic prepress systems then widely used for magazine production through the introduction of smooth shading operations with up to shades of grey rather than the available in PostScript Level as well as DeviceN a color space that allowed the addition of additional ink colors called spot colors into composite color pages br br br Use in printing br br br Before PostScript br Prior to the introduction of Interpress and PostScript printers were designed to print character output given the text typically in ASCII as input There were a number of technologies for this task but most shared the property that the glyphs were physically difficult to change as they were stamped onto typewriter keys bands of metal or optical plates br This changed to some degree with the increasing popularity of dot matrix printers The characters on these systems were drawn as a series of dots as defined by a font table inside the printer As they grew in sophistication dot matrix printers started including several built in fonts from which the user could select and some models allowed users to upload their own custom glyphs into the printer br Dot matrix printers also introduced the ability to print raster graphics The graphics were interpreted by the computer and sent as a series of dots to the printer using a series of escape sequences These printer control languages varied from printer to printer requiring program authors to create numerous drivers br Vector graphics printing was left to special purpose devices called plotters Almost all plotters shared a common command language HPGL but were of limited use for anything other than printing graphics In addition they tended to be expensive and slow and thus rare br br br PostScript printing br Laser printers combine the best features of both printers and plotters Like plotters laser printers offer high quality line art and like dot matrix printers they are able to generate pages of text and raster graphics Unlike either printers or plotters a laser printer makes it possible to position high quality graphics and text on the same page PostScript made it possible to fully exploit these characteristics by offering a single control language that could be used on any brand of printer br PostScript went beyond the typical printer control language and was a complete programming language of its own Many applications can transform a document into a PostScript program the execution of which results in the original document This program can be sent to an interpreter in a printer which results in a printed document or to one inside another application which will display the document on screen Since the document program is the same regardless of its destination it is called device independent br PostScript is noteworthy for implementing on the fly rasterization in which everything even text is specified in terms of straight lines and cubic B zier curves previously found only in CAD applications which allows arbitrary scaling rotating and other transformations When the PostScript program is interpreted the interpreter converts these instructions into the dots needed to form the output For this reason PostScript interpreters are occasionally called PostScript raster image processors or RIPs br br br Font handling br br Almost as complex as PostScript itself is its handling of fonts The font system uses the PS graphics primitives to draw glyphs as curves which can then be rendered at any resolution A number of typographic issues had to be considered with this approach br One issue is that fonts do not scale linearly at small sizes and features of the glyphs will become proportionally too large or small and start to look displeasing PostScript avoided this problem with the inclusion of font hinting in which additional information is provided in horizontal or vertical bands to help identify the features in each letter that are important for the rasterizer to maintain The result was significantly better looking fonts even at low resolution It had formerly been believed that hand tuned bitmap fonts were required for this task br At the time the technology for including these hints in fonts was carefully guarded and the hinted fonts were compressed and encrypted into what Adobe called a Type Font also known as PostScript Type Font PS T or Adobe Type Type was effectively a simplification of the PS system to store outline information only as opposed to being a complete language PDF is similar in this regard Adobe would then sell licenses to the Type technology to those wanting to add hints to their own fonts Those who did not license the technology were left with the Type Font also known as PostScript Type Font PS or T Type fonts allowed for all the sophistication of the PostScript language but without the standardized approach to hinting br The Type font format was designed to be used with Compact Font Format CFF charstrings and was implemented to reduce the overall font file size The CFF Type format later became the basis for handling PostScript outlines in OpenType fonts br The CID keyed font format was also designed to solve the problems in the OCF Type fonts for addressing the complex Asian language CJK encoding and very large character set issues The CID keyed font format can be used with the Type font format for standard CID keyed fonts or Type for CID keyed OpenType fonts br To compete with Adobe s system Apple designed their own system TrueType around Immediately following the announcement of TrueType Adobe published the specification for the Type font format Retail tools such as Altsys Fontographer acquired by Macromedia in January owned by FontLab since May added the ability to create Type fonts Since then many free Type fonts have been released for instance the fonts used with the TeX typesetting system are available in this format br Effective January support for Type fonts has ended br In the early s there were several other systems for storing outline based fonts developed by Bitstream and Metafont for instance but none included a general purpose printing solution and they were therefore not widely used br In the late s Adobe joined Microsoft in developing OpenType essentially a functional superset of the Type and TrueType formats When printed to a PostScript output device the unneeded parts of the OpenType font are omitted and what is sent to the device by the driver is the same as it would be for a TrueType or Type font depending on which kind of outlines were present in the OpenType font br br br Other implementations br In the s Adobe drew most of its revenue from the licensing fees for their implementation of PostScript for printers known as a raster image processor or RIP As a number of new RISC based platforms became available in the mid s some found Adobe s support of the new machines to be lacking br This and issues of cost led to third party implementations of PostScript becoming common particularly in low cost printers where the licensing fee was the sticking point or in high end typesetting equipment where the quest for speed demanded support for new platforms faster than Adobe could provide At one point Microsoft licensed to Apple a PostScript compatible interpreter it had bought called TrueImage and Apple licensed to Microsoft its new font format TrueType Apple ended up reaching an accord with Adobe and licensed genuine PostScript for its printers but TrueType became the standard outline font technology for both Windows and the Macintosh br Today third party PostScript compatible interpreters are widely used in printers and multifunction peripherals MFPs For example CSR plc s IPS PS interpreter formerly known as PhoenixPage is standard in many printers and MFPs including those developed by Hewlett Packard and sold under the LaserJet and Color LaserJet lines Other third party PostScript solutions used by print and MFP manufacturers include Jaws and the Harlequin RIP both by Global Graphics A free software version with several other applications is Ghostscript Several compatible interpreters are listed on the Undocumented Printing Wiki br Some basic inexpensive laser printers do not support PostScript instead coming with drivers that simply rasterize the platform s native graphics formats rather than converting them to PostScript first When PostScript support is needed for such a printer Ghostscript can be used There are also a number of commercial PostScript interpreters such as TeleType Co s T Script or Brother s BR Script br br br Use as a display system br br PostScript became commercially successful due to the introduction of the graphical user interface GUI allowing designers to directly lay out pages for eventual output on laser printers However the GUIs own graphics systems were generally much less sophisticated than PostScript Apple s QuickDraw for instance supported only basic lines and arcs not the complex B splines and advanced region filling options of PostScript In order to take full advantage of PostScript printing applications on the computers had to re implement those features using the host platform s own graphics system This led to numerous issues where the on screen layout would not exactly match the printed output due to differences in the implementation of these features br As computer power grew it became possible to host the PS system in the computer rather than the printer This led to the natural evolution of PS from a printing system to one that could also be used as the host s own graphics language There were numerous advantages to this approach not only did it help eliminate the possibility of different output on screen and printer but it also provided a powerful graphics system for the computer and allowed the printers to be dumb at a time when the cost of the laser engines was falling In a production setting using PostScript as a display system meant that the host computer could render low resolution to the screen higher resolution to the printer or simply send the PS code to a smart printer for offboard printing br However PostScript was written with printing in mind and had numerous features that made it unsuitable for direct use in an interactive display system In particular PS was based on the idea of collecting up PS commands until the showpage command was seen at which point all of the commands read up to that point were interpreted and output In an interactive system this was clearly not appropriate nor did PS have any sort of interactivity built in for example supporting hit detection for mouse interactivity obviously did not apply when PS was being used on a printer br When Steve Jobs left Apple and started NeXT he pitched Adobe on the idea of using PS as the display system for his new workstation computers The result was Display PostScript or DPS DPS added basic functionality to improve performance by changing many string lookups into bit integers adding support for direct output with every command and adding functions to allow the GUI to inspect the diagram Additionally a set of bindings was provided to allow PS code to be called directly from the C programming language NeXT used these bindings in their NeXTStep system to provide an object oriented graphics system Although DPS was written in conjunction with NeXT Adobe sold it commercially and it was a common feature of most Unix workstations in the s br Sun Microsystems took another approach creating NeWS Instead of DPS s concept of allowing PS to interact with C programs NeWS instead extended PS into a language suitable for running the entire GUI of a computer Sun added a number of new commands for timers mouse control interrupts and other systems needed for interactivity and added data structures and language elements to allow it to be completely object oriented internally A complete GUI three in fact were written in NeWS and provided for a time on their workstations However the ongoing efforts to standardize the X system led to its introduction and widespread use on Sun systems and NeWS never became widely used br br br Portable Document Format br The PDF and PostScript share the same imaging model and both documents are mutually convertible to each other Both documents produce the same result when printed The difference between the PDF and PostScript is that the PDF lacks the general purpose programming language framework of the PostScript language A PDF document is a static data structure made for efficient access and embeds navigational information suitable for interactive viewing br br br The language br PostScript is a Turing complete programming language belonging to the concatenative group of programming languages It is an interpreted stack based language similar to Forth but with strong dynamic typing data structures inspired by those found in Lisp scoped memory and since language level garbage collection The language syntax uses reverse Polish notation which makes the order of operations unambiguous but reading a program requires some practice because one has to keep the layout of the stack in mind Most operators what other languages term functions take their arguments from the stack and place their results onto the stack Literals for example numbers have the effect of placing a copy of themselves on the stack Sophisticated data structures can be built on the array and dictionary types but cannot be declared to the type system which sees them all only as arrays and dictionaries so any further typing discipline to be applied to such user defined types is left to the code that implements them br The character is used to introduce comments in PostScript programs As a general convention every PostScript program should start with the characters PS as an interpreter directive so that all devices will properly interpret it as PostScript br Typically PostScript programs are not produced by humans but by other programs However it is possible to write computer programs in PostScript just like any other programming language br br br Hello world br A Hello World program the customary way to show a small example of a complete program in a given language might look like this in PostScript level br br or if the output device has a console br br br Units of length br PostScript uses the point as its unit of length However unlike some of the other versions of the point PostScript uses exactly points to the inch Thus br br point inch mm mm micrometers br For example in order to draw a vertical line of cm length it is sufficient to type br br More readably and idiomatically one might use the following equivalent which demonstrates a simple procedure definition and the use of the mathematical operators mul and div br br Technically most printers have a construction implied unprintable margin around the physical borders of the sheet and the coordinates are calibrated to its corner so you might have to use a different starting point to actually see something br Most implementations of PostScript use single precision reals bit mantissa so it is not meaningful to use more than decimal digits to specify a real number and performing calculations may produce unacceptable round off errors br br br Software br List of
