Web D also called D Web is a group of technologies to display and navigate websites using D computer graphics br br br Pre WebGL era br The emergence of Web D dates back to with the advent of VRML a file format designed to store and display D graphical data on the World Wide Web In October at Internet World Template Graphics Software demonstrated a D VRML plug in for the beta release of Netscape by Netscape Communications br The Web D Consortium was formed to further the collective development of the format VRML and its successor X D have been accepted as international standards by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission br The main drawback of the technology was the requirement to use third party browser plug ins to perform D rendering which slowed the adoption of the standard br Between and one of these plug ins Adobe Flash Player was widely installed on desktop computers and was used to display interactive web pages and online games and to play video and audio content Several Flash based frameworks appeared that used software rendering and ActionScript to perform D computations such as transformations lighting and texturing Most notable among them were Papervision D and Away D br Eventually Abobe developed Stage D an API for rendering interactive D graphics with GPU acceleration for its Flash player and AIR products which was adopted by software vendors br In an open source D web technology called O D was introduced by Google It also required a browser plug in but contrary to Flash Stage D was based on JavaScript API O D was geared not only for games but also for advertisements D model viewers product demos simulations engineering applications control and monitoring systems br br br WebGL and glTF br WebGL short for Web Graphics Library evolved out of the Canvas D experiments started by Vladimir Vuki evi at Mozilla Foundation Vuki evi first demonstrated a Canvas D prototype in By the end of both Mozilla and Opera had made their own separate implementations br In early the nonprofit technology consortium Khronos Group started the WebGL Working Group with initial participation from Apple Google Mozilla Opera and others Version of the WebGL specification was released in March br Major advantages of the new technology include conformity with web standards and near native D performance without the use of any browser plug ins Since WebGL is based on OpenGL ES it works on mobile devices without any additional abstraction layers For other platforms WebGL implementations leverage ANGLE to translate OpenGL ES calls to DirectX OpenGL or Vulkan API calls br Among notable WebGL frameworks are A Frame which uses HTML based markup for building virtual reality experiences PlayCanvas an open source engine alongside a proprietary cloud hosted creation platform for building browser games Three js an MIT licensed framework used to create demoscene from the early s Unity which obtained a WebGL back end in version and Verge D which integrates with Blender ds Max and Maya to create D web content br With the rapid adoption of WebGL a new problem arose the lack of a D file format optimized for the Web This issue was addressed by glTF a format that was conceived in by members of the COLLADA working group At SIGGRAPH Khronos presented a demo of glTF which was then called WebGL Transmissions Format WebGL TF On October the glTF specification was released Version glTF uses a physically based rendering material model proposed by Fraunhofer Other upgrades include sparse accessors and morph targets for techniques such as facial animation and schema tweaks and breaking changes for corner cases or performance such as replacing top level glTF object properties with arrays for faster index based access br br br Future br WebGPU is the working name for a potential web standard and JavaScript API for accelerated graphics and computing aiming to provide modern D graphics and computation capabilities It is developed by the W C GPU for the Web Community Group with engineers from Apple Mozilla Microsoft and Google among others br WebGPU will not be based on any existing D API and will use Rust like syntax for shaders br br br See also br Web D Consortium br List of WebGL frameworks br List of vector graphics markup languages br br br
