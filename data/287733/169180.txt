Typesetting is the composition of text for publication display or distribution by means of arranging physical type or sort in mechanical systems or glyphs in digital systems representing characters letters and other symbols Stored types are retrieved and ordered according to a language s orthography for visual display Typesetting requires one or more fonts which are widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for typefaces br One significant effect of typesetting was that authorship of works could be spotted more easily making it difficult for copiers who have not gained permission br br br Pre digital era br br br Manual typesetting br br During much of the letterpress era movable type was composed by hand for each page by workers called compositors A tray with many dividers called a case contained cast metal sorts each with a single letter or symbol but backwards so they would print correctly The compositor assembled these sorts into words then lines then pages of text which were then bound tightly together by a frame making up a form or page If done correctly all letters were of the same height and a flat surface of type was created The form was placed in a press and inked and then printed an impression made on paper Metal type read backwards from right to left and a key skill of the compositor was their ability to read this backwards text br Before computers were invented and thus becoming computerized or digital typesetting font sizes were changed by replacing the characters with a different size of type In letterpress printing individual letters and punctuation marks were cast on small metal blocks known as sorts and then arranged to form the text for a page The size of the type was determined by the size of the character on the face of the sort A compositor would need to physically swap out the sorts for a different size to change the font size br During typesetting individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand and set from left to right into a composing stick held in the left hand appearing to the typesetter as upside down As seen in the photo of the composing stick a lower case q looks like a d a lower case b looks like a p a lower case p looks like a b and a lower case d looks like a q This is reputed to be the origin of the expression mind your p s and q s It might just as easily have been mind your b s and d s br A forgotten but important part of the process took place after the printing after cleaning with a solvent the expensive sorts had to be redistributed into the typecase called sorting or dissing so they would be ready for reuse Errors in sorting could later produce misprints if say a p was put into the b compartment br The diagram at right illustrates a cast metal sort a face b body or shank c point size shoulder nick groove foot Wooden printing sorts were used for centuries in combination with metal type Not shown and more the concern of the casterman is the set or width of each sort Set width like body size is measured in points br In order to extend the working life of type and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text freeing the costly type for other work This was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press In this process called stereotyping the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of Paris or papier m ch to create a flong from which a positive form is cast in type metal br Advances such as the typewriter and computer would push the state of the art even farther ahead Still hand composition and letterpress printing have not fallen completely out of use and since the introduction of digital typesetting it has seen a revival as an artisanal pursuit However it is a small niche within the larger typesetting market br br br Hot metal typesetting br br The time and effort required to manually compose the text led to several efforts in the th century to produce mechanical typesetting While some such as the Paige compositor met with limited success by the end of the th century several methods had been devised whereby an operator working a keyboard or other devices could produce the desired text Most of the successful systems involved the in house casting of the type to be used hence are termed hot metal typesetting The Linotype machine invented in used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices and cast an entire line of type at a time hence its name In the Monotype System a keyboard was used to punch a paper tape which was then fed to control a casting machine The Ludlow Typograph involved hand set matrices but otherwise used hot metal By the early th century the various systems were nearly universal in large newspapers and publishing houses br br br Phototypesetting br br Phototypesetting or cold type systems first appeared in the early s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines These devices consisted of glass or film disks or strips one per font that spun in front of a light source to selectively expose characters onto light sensitive paper Originally they were driven by pre punched paper tapes Later they were connected to computer front ends br One of the earliest electronic photocomposition systems was introduced by Fairchild Semiconductor The typesetter typed a line of text on a Fairchild keyboard that had no display To verify correct content of the line it was typed a second time If the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a punched paper tape corresponding to the text With the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device that mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative film Photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film resulting in a column of black type on white paper or a galley The galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or paste up of a whole page A large film negative of the page is shot and used to make plates for offset printing br br br Digital era br br The next generation of phototypesetting machines to emerge were those that generated characters on a cathode ray tube display Typical of the type were the Alphanumeric APS IBM I I I VideoComp Autologic APS and Linotron These machines were the mainstay of phototypesetting for much of the s and s Such machines could be driven online by a computer front end system or took their data from magnetic tape Type fonts were stored digitally on conventional magnetic disk drives br Computers excel at automatically typesetting and correcting documents Character by character computer aided phototypesetting was in turn rapidly rendered obsolete in the s by fully digital systems employing a raster image processor to render an entire page to a single high resolution digital image now known as imagesetting br The first commercially successful laser imagesetter able to make use of a raster image processor was the Monotype Lasercomp ECRM Compugraphic later purchased by Agfa and others rapidly followed suit with machines of their own br Early minicomputer based typesetting software introduced in the s and early s such as Datalogics Pager Penta Atex Miles Xyvision troff from Bell Labs and IBM s Script product with CRT terminals were better able to drive these electromechanical devices and used text markup languages to describe type and other page formatting information The descendants of these text markup languages include SGML XML and HTML br The minicomputer systems output columns of text on film for paste up and eventually produced entire pages and signatures of or more pages using imposition software on devices such as the Israeli made Scitex Dolev The data stream used by these systems to drive page layout on printers and imagesetters often proprietary or specific to a manufacturer or device drove development of generalized printer control languages such as Adobe Systems PostScript and Hewlett Packard s PCL br br Computerized typesetting was so rare that BYTE magazine comparing itself to the proverbial shoemaker s children who went barefoot did not use any computers in production until its August issue used a Compugraphics system for typesetting and page layout The magazine did not yet accept articles on floppy disks but hoped to do so as matters progress Before the s practically all typesetting for publishers and advertisers was performed by specialist typesetting companies These companies performed keyboarding editing and production of paper or film output and formed a large component of the graphic arts industry In the United States these companies were located in rural Pennsylvania New England or the Midwest where labor was cheap and paper was produced nearby but still within a few hours travel time of the major publishing centers br In with the new concept of WYSIWYG for What You See Is What You Get in text editing and word processing on personal computers desktop publishing became available starting with the Apple Macintosh Aldus PageMaker and later QuarkXPress and PostScript and on the PC platform with Xerox Ventura Publisher under DOS as well as Pagemaker under Windows Improvements in software and hardware and rapidly lowering costs popularized desktop publishing and enabled very fine control of typeset results much less expensively than the minicomputer dedicated systems At the same time word processing systems such as Wang WordPerfect and Microsoft Word revolutionized office documents They did not however have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complicated book layout graphics mathematics or advanced hyphenation and justification rules H and J br By this industry segment had shrunk because publishers were now capable of integrating typesetting and graphic design on their own in house computers Many found the cost of maintaining high standards of typographic design and technical skill made it more economical to outsource to freelancers and graphic design specialists br The availability of cheap or free fonts made the conversion to do it yourself easier but also opened up a gap between skilled designers and amateurs The advent of PostScript supplemented by the PDF file format provided a universal method of proofing designs and layouts readable on major computers and operating systems br QuarkXPress had enjoyed a market share of in the s but lost its dominance to Adobe InDesign from the mid s onward br br br SCRIPT variants br br IBM created and inspired a family of typesetting languages with names that were derivatives of the word SCRIPT Later versions of SCRIPT included advanced features such as automatic generation of a table of contents and index multicolumn page layout footnotes boxes automatic hyphenation and spelling verification br NSCRIPT was a port of SCRIPT to OS and TSO from CP CMS SCRIPT br Waterloo Script was created at the University of Waterloo UW later One version of SCRIPT was created at MIT and the AA CS at UW took over project development in The program was first used at UW in In the s SCRIPT was the only practical way to word process and format documents using a computer By the late s the SCRIPT system had been extended to incorporate various upgrades br The initial implementation of SCRIPT at UW was documented in the May issue of the Computing Centre Newsletter which noted some the advantages of using SCRIPT br br The article also pointed out SCRIPT had over commands to assist in formatting documents though to of these commands were sufficient to complete most formatting jobs Thus SCRIPT had many of the capabilities computer users generally associate with contemporary word processors br SCRIPT VS was a SCRIPT variant developed at IBM in the s br DWScript is a version of SCRIPT for MS DOS named after its author D D Williams but was never released to the public and only used internally by IBM br Script is still available from IBM as part of the Document Composition Facility for the z OS operating system br br br SGML and XML systems br The standard generalized markup language SGML was based upon IBM Generalized Markup Language GML GML was a set of macros on top of IBM Script DSSSL is an international standard developed to provide a stylesheets for SGML documents br XML is a successor of SGML XSL FO is most often used to generate PDF files from XML files br The arrival of SGML XML as the document model made other typesetting engines popular br Such engines include Datalogics Pager Penta Miles s OASYS Xyvision s XML Professional Publisher FrameMaker and Arbortext XSL FO compatible engines include Apache FOP Antenna House Formatter and RenderX s XEP br These products allow users to program their SGML XML typesetting process with the help of scripting languages br YesLogic s Prince is another one which is based on CSS Paged Media br br br Troff and successors br br During the mid s Joe Ossanna working at Bell Laboratories wrote the troff typesetting program to drive a Wang C A T phototypesetter owned by the Labs it was later enhanced by Brian Kernighan to support output to different equipment such as laser printers While its use has fallen off it is still included with a number of Unix and Unix like systems and has been used to typeset a number of high profile technical and computer books Some versions as well as a GNU work alike called groff are now open source br br br TeX and LaTeX br br The TeX system developed by Donald E Knuth at the end of the s is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system that has set high standards especially for typesetting mathematics LuaTeX and LuaLaTeX are variants of TeX and of LaTeX scriptable in Lua TeX is considered fairly difficult to learn on its own and deals more with appearance than structure The LaTeX macro package written by Leslie Lamport at the beginning of the s offered a simpler interface and an easier way to systematically encode the structure of a document LaTeX markup is widely used in academic circles for published papers and books Although standard TeX does not provide an interface of any sort there are programs that do These programs include Scientific Workplace and LyX which are graphical interactive editors TeXmacs while being an independent typesetting system can also aid the preparation of TeX documents through its export capability br br br Other text formatters br GNU TeXmacs whose name is a combination of TeX and Emacs although it is independent from both of these programs is a typesetting system which is at the same time a WYSIWYG word processor br SILE borrows some algorithms from TeX and relies on other libraries such as HarfBuzz and ICU with an extensible core engine developed in Lua br By default SILE s input documents can be composed in a custom LaTeX inspired markup SIL or in XML Via the adjunction of rd party modules composition in Markdown or Djot is also possible br A new typesetting system Typst tries to combine a simple markup of the input and the possibility of using common programming constructs with a high typographical quality of the output This system has been in beta testing since March and was presented in July at the Tex Users Group TUG conference br Several other text formatting software packages exist notably
