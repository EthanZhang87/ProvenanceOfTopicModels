the first typefaces to be part of Adobe s Originals programme designed to feature a large range of styles for professional use With a reasonably solid design Utopia was sometimes used by newspapers br Current versions of the typeface are released in the OpenType format and include features such as ligatures and small capitals It is released in four optical variants for display headline regular and caption text sizes each in regular semibold and bold weights A black extra bold weight is available in the headline size Slimbach made some changes to the font when revisiting it for the OpenType release and Adobe does not guarantee identical character metrics This means documents developed using one font file should not be switched to using another at risk of lines breaking in different places br br br Free software release br Uniquely for Adobe s professional typefaces a basic set of Utopia s styles has been open sourced by Adobe allowing it to be used for free This comprises regular italic bold and bold italic styles of the regular size with glyphs for each including ligatures but not small capitals Adobe donated the Utopia typeface in the form of PostScript Type files to

for use at small text sizes with a large x height and quite thick stroke widths Adobe retains rights to the Utopia name and prohibits modified fonts from being redistributed without the name being changed br The OpenType version that Adobe now distributes commercially was modified from the open sourced PostScript fonts and Adobe does not guarantee that the font metrics are the same br br br Initial donation to the X Consortium br There was controversy around the license regarding the status of the font files as free software Many distributors with one of the prominent being the Debian project to prevent being sued opted to state clearly that the fonts had a non clear license which prevented it from being freely redistributable with modifications After considerable debate Adobe formally donated the Type version of the font on October to the TeX Users Group TUG with clarified concerns regarding its use licensing so that it could be used with for instance Donald Knuth s program TeX a digital typesetting system for computers The version donated consisted of the Roman Regular Italic Bold and Bold Italic versions of the typeface differently from the commercial version offered as part of the Adobe Originals Pack On November Karl Berry the TeX Users Group President gave irrevocable permissions of the font to any third party and it constitutes free software br br br Derived typefaces br The original Utopia typeface has since being released as free software been modified to support glyphs in scripts other than the basic Latin script at least three projects have emerged from the sources that Adobe has donated one being an adaptation to Vietnamese called Vntopia by H n Th Th nh br Another further development of the original was made by Andrey V Panov in an OpenType derivative called Heuristica also with the primary intent of adding Cyrillic symbols Andrey has also incorporated H n Th Th nh s Vietnamese glyphs in Heuristica and the development of the project is open br From the Heuristica font family Andreas Nolda created Utopia Nova font family in changing this reserved name to Lingua Franca OpenType and Web Open Font Format fonts in Andreas Nolda added proportional figures and a stylistic set with longer slashes matching the parentheses in height and depth to Lingua Franca OpenType and Web Open Font Format fonts br In Stefan Peev created
