Universal D U D is a compressed file format standard for D computer graphics data br The format was defined by a special consortium called D Industry Forum that brought together a diverse group of companies and organizations including Intel Boeing HP Adobe Systems Bentley Systems Right Hemisphere and others whose main focus had been the promotional development of D graphics for use in various industries specifically at this time manufacturing as well as construction and industrial plant design The format was later standardized by Ecma International in August as ECMA br The goal is a universal standard for three dimensional data of all kinds to facilitate data exchange The consortium promoted also the development of an open source library for facilitating the adoption of the format br The format is natively supported by the PDF format and D objects in U D format can be inserted into PDF documents and interactively visualized by Acrobat Reader since version br br br Editions br There are four editions to date br The first edition is supported by many all of the various applications mentioned below It is capable of storing vertex based geometry color textures lighting bones and transform based animation br The second and third editions correct some errata in the first edition and the third edition also adds the concept of vendor specified blocks One such block widely deployed is the RHAdobeMesh block which provides a more compressed alternative to the mesh blocks defined in the first edition Deep Exploration Tetra D for Acrobat Pro and PDF D SDK can author this data and Adobe Acrobat and Reader can read this data br The fourth edition provides definitions for higher order primitives curved surfaces br br br Application support br Applications which support PDFs with embedded U D objects include br br Adobe Acrobat Pro allows PDF creation and conversion of various file formats to U D within the PDF Acrobat Pro allows PDF creation and embedding of pre created U D files br Adobe Photoshop CS CS and CS Extended are able to export a D Layer as a U D file br Adobe Substance D rendering software br ArchiCAD allows export of U D files br Bluebeam Revu Allows PDF creation and embedding of U D within the PDF Comes packaged with plugins that can export D PDFs from Revit and Solidworks br Daz Studio Allows export to U D br iText open source Java library allows creation of PDF containing U D br Jreality an open source mathematical visualization package with D PDF and U D export br MeVisLab supports export of U D models for biomedical images br MicroStation allows export of PDF containing U D br Poser br Autodesk Inventor allows saving of files to D PDF containing U D Soon available since version br KeyCreator allows reading of U D data from U D and PDF files and exporting models to U D and embedding in D PDF br Siemens Solid Edge allows exorting and saving of files to D PDF containing U D And also other D file Docs br SolidWorks allows saving of files to D PDF containing U D up to release br ArtiosCAD allows saving of files to D PDF containing U D br SpaceClaim allows the opening and saving of D PDF format comprising U D br br br See also br glTF br COLLADA br PRC File format br X D br DMLW br LibHaru br br br br br br External links br Official website br Universal D Sample Software formerly at www dif org br Embedding interactive D object in a PDF using MeshLab and U D PDF Visual Computing Group Scanned mesh of a Ippolita Sforza s statue by Francesco Laurana at Institute of Science and Technology ISTI CNR br Tutorial on embedding a U D file into a PDF with Meshlab and Miktex in German
