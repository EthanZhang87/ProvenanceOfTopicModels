title: History of Western typography
id: 7163194
Modern typographers view typography as a craft with a very long history tracing its origins back to the first punches and dies used to make seals and coinage currency in ancient times The basic elements of typography are at least as old as civilization and the earliest writing systems a series of key developments that were eventually drawn together into one systematic craft While woodblock printing and movable type had precedents in East Asia typography in the Western world developed after the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid th century The initial spread of printing throughout Germany and Italy led to the enduring legacy and continued use of blackletter roman and italic types br br br Medieval design roots br br Typography type founding and typeface design began as closely related crafts in mid th century Europe with the introduction of movable type printing at the junction of the medieval era and the Renaissance Handwritten letterforms of the mid th century calligraphy were the natural models for letterforms in systematized typography The scribal letter known as textur or textualis produced by the strong gothic spirit of blackletter from the hands of German area scribes served as the model for the first text types br Johannes Gutenberg around invented a lead type mold applied it to an alphabet of about characters and used known press technology to print ink on paper Prior printing had been done with woodblocks but movable type was impossible due to fragility of wood at small sizes Gutenberg employed the scribe Peter Sch ffer to help design and cut the letterpunches for the first typeface the D K type of characters used to print the first printed books in Europe A second typeface of about characters designed for the line Bible c was probably cut by the goldsmith Hans Dunne with the help of two others G tz von Shlettstadt and Hans von Speyer br Cultural tradition ensured that German typography and type design remained true to the gothic blackletter spirit but the parallel influence of the humanist and neo classical typography in Italy the first country outside of Germany with a printing press catalyzed texture into four additional sub styles that were distinct structurally rich and highly disciplined Bastarda fraktur rotunda and Schwabacher Notably early printed books matched the style of handwritten manuscripts and did not contain title pages page numbers or headings br The rapid spread of movable type printing across Europe produced additional Gothic half Gothic and Gothic to Roman transitional types Johann B mler s Schwabacher Augsburg appeared in The half Gothic Rotunda type of Erhard Ratdolt c was cut to suit Venetian taste In William Caxton having learned his craft on the Continent printed the first books in England with a so called B tarde type an early Schwabacher design but soon abandoned it br The early printers in Spain were Germans who began printing in contemporary roman types but soon gave these up and adopted Gothic typefaces based on the letterforms of Spanish manuscripts Valencia in the Kingdom of Aragon was the location of the first press established in From there printers moved to other cities to set up presses Roman types were used by the printers of Salamanca for their editions of classical authors Printing in Portuguese began at Lisbon in the first book printed in Portugal was a Hebrew book printed in br br br Classical revival br In Italy the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by Venetian or old style Latin types also called antiqua The inscriptional capitals on Roman buildings and monuments were structured on a euclidean geometric scheme and the discrete component based model of classical architecture Their structurally perfect design near perfect execution in stone balanced angled stressing contrasting thick and thin strokes and incised serifs became the typographic ideal for western civilization The best known example of Roman inscriptional capitals exists on the base of Trajan s Column inscribed c br br In their enthusiastic revival of classical culture Italian scribes and humanist scholars of the early th century searched for ancient lower case letters to match the Roman inscriptional capitals Practically all of the available manuscripts of classical writers had been rewritten during the Carolingian Renaissance and with a lapse of three hundred years since the widespread use of this style the humanist scribes mistook Carolingian minuscule as the authentic writing style of the ancients as opposed to blackletter incorrectly seen as the lettering of the Goths that conquered Rome Dubbing it lettera antica they began by copying the minuscule hand almost exactly combining it with Roman capitals in the same manner as the manuscripts they were copying br br Upon noticing the stylistic mismatch between these two very different letters the scribes redesigned the small Carolingian letter lengthening ascenders and descenders and adding incised serifs and finishing strokes to integrate them with the Roman capitals By the time moveable type reached Italy several decades later the humanistic writing had evolved into a consistent model known as humanistic minuscule which served as the basis for type style we know today as Venetian br br br Transition from humanistic minuscule to roman type br The classically endowed city of Rome attracted the first printers known to have set up shop outside Germany Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim closely followed by the brothers Johann and Wendelin of Speyer de Spira and the Frenchman Nicolas Jenson The sequence of appearance and production dates for types used by these printers have yet to be established with certainty all four are known to have printed with types ranging from textur Gothic to fully developed romans inspired by the earlier humanistic writing and within a few years the center of printing in Italy shifted from Rome to Venice br Some time before in Venice Johann and Wendelin issued material printed with a half Gothic half roman type known as Gotico antiqua This design paired simplified Gothic capitals with a rationalized humanistic minuscule letter set itself combining Gothic minuscule forms with elements of Carolingian in a one step forward half step back blending of styles br Around the same time in Rome Pannartz and Sweynheim were using another typeface that closely mimicked humanistic minuscule known as Lactantius Unlike the rigid fractured forms of Speyer s half Gothic the Lactantius is characterized by smoothly rendered letters with a restrained organic finish The Lactantius a departed from both the Carolingian and Gothic models a vertical backstem and right angled top replaced the diagonal Carolingian structure and a continuous curved stroke replaced the fractured Gothic bowl element br For details on the evolution of lower case letterforms from Latin capitals see Latin alphabet br br br Development of roman type br br Nicolas Jenson began printing in Venice with his original roman font from Jenson s design and the very similar roman types cut by Francesco Griffo c and Erhard Ratdolt c are acknowledged as the definitive and archetypal roman faces that set the pattern for the majority of western text faces that followed br The Jenson roman was an explicitly typographic letter designed on its own terms that declined to imitate the appearance of hand lettering Its effect is one of a unified cohesive whole a seamless fusion of style with structure and the successful convergence of the long progression of preceding letter styles Jenson adapted the structural unity and component based modular integration of Roman capitals to humanistic minuscule forms by masterful abstract stylization The carefully modelled serifs follow an artful logic of asymmetry The ratio of extender lengths to letter bodies and the distance between lines results in balanced harmonious body of type Jenson also mirrors the ideal expressed in renaissance painting of carving up space typographic white space with figures letters to articulate the relationship between the two and make the white space dynamic br br The name roman is customarily applied uncapitalized to distinguish early Jenson and Aldine derived types from classical Roman letters of antiquity Some parts of Europe call roman antiqua from its connection with the humanistic lettera antica medieval and old style are also employed to indicate roman types dating from the late th century especially those used by Aldus Manutius Italian Manuzio Roman faces based on those of Speyer and Jenson are also called Venetian br br br Italic type br br The humanist spirit driving the Renaissance produced its own unique style of formal writing known as cursiva humanistica This slanted and rapidly written letter evolved from humanistic minuscule and the remaining Gothic current cursive hands in Italy served as the model for cursive or italic typefaces As books printed with early roman types forced humanistic minuscule out of use cursiva humanistica gained favor as a manuscript hand for the purpose of writing The popularity of cursive writing itself may have created some demand for a type of this style The more decisive catalyst was probably the printing of pocket editions of Latin classics by Aldus Manutius However even as printing overtook production of previously handwritten materials increased literacy created a greater demand for documents and thus calligraphers saw increased work br The Aldino italic type commissioned by Manutius and cut by Francesco Griffo in was a closely spaced condensed type Griffo s punches are a delicate translation of the Italian cursive hand featuring letters of irregular slant angle and uneven height and vertical position with some connected pairs ligatures and unslanted small roman capitals the height of the lower case t The fame of Aldus Manutius and his editions made the Griffo italic widely copied and influential although it was not the finest of the pioneer italics The Aldino style quickly became known as italic from its Italian origin br Around the Vatican chancellery scribe Ludovico Arrighi designed a superior italic type and had the punches cut by Lauticio di Bartolomeo dei Rotelli The more modular structure of Arrighi s italic and its few ligatures made it less a copy of the cursive hand than Griffo s Its slightly taller roman capitals a gentler slant angle taller ascenders and wider separation of lines gave the elegant effect of refined handwriting br br Surviving examples of th century Italian books indicate the bulk of them were printed with italic types By mid century the popularity of italic types for sustained text setting began to decline until they were used only for in line citations block quotes preliminary text emphasis and abbreviations Italic types from the th century up to the present are much indebted to Arrighi and his influence on French designers br Swiss art historian Jakob Burckhardt described the classically inspired Renaissance modello of dual case roman and cursive italic types as The model and ideal for the whole western world Venetian pre eminence in type design was brought to an end by the political and economic turmoil that concluded the Renaissance in Italy with the sack of Rome in br br br Renaissance Germany and Switzerland br Soon after roman typefaces began to gain popularity north of the Alps for printing of Latin literature Johann Froben of Basel Switzerland set up his press in and by about when he printed Erasmus s famous edition of the Greek New Testament he had established a set of standards for humanistic printing which were widely copied throughout the German speaking world and also in Spain and to a lesser extent in England His principal type is wholly roman in the shape of the characters but retains an echo of gothic influence in the angled serifs and the way the thick and thin strokes are organized it was coupled with mated sets of woodcut initials often designed by distinguished artists and with two larger sizes of uppercase letters for use in title pages and headings Froben was the first to use such display typefaces consistently breaking away from the Italian tradition in which title pages and headings tended to be set in the same size as the main text By using these large faces Froben developed the title page as a fully organized artistic whole Froben s italic face is based on that of Aldus but more even and uniform in effect These Swiss books are the first to have been designed in every detail as printed artifacts rather than as adaptations of manuscript technique br After about this Swiss German tradition was gradually overwhelmed by French influence Towards the end of the th century the Wechel family of Frankfurt previously based in Paris was producing fine books which used French typefaces in conjunction with heavy but resplendent woodcut ornaments to achieve a splendid page effect but soon after there was a general marked decline in the quality of both skill and materials from which German printing did not recover until the th century br br br th century France br Typography was introduced to France by the German printers Martin Crantz Michael Freyburger and Ulrich Gering who set up a press in Paris in where they printed with an inferior copy of the Lactantius type Gothic types dominated in France until the end of the th century when they were gradually supplanted by roman designs Jodocus Badius Ascensius Josse Bade in partnership with Henri Estienne established a press in Paris in Printing with undeveloped Roman and half Gothic types the French pair were too occupied meeting the demand for Humanistic and classical texts to design any original types of their own French books nonetheless began to follow the format established by Italian printers and Lyon and Paris became the new centers of activity Eventually the French government fixed a standard height for all type to ensure that different batches could be used together br br br De Colines Estienne and Augereau br After their invasion of Italy the French were greatly influenced by Renaissance culture and later set about converting French culture from Gothic to neo classical The required phonetic and orthographic changes to French language hindered the evolution of type design in France until the late s At the end of this period roman types introduced by Robert Estienne Simon de Colines and Antoine Augereau began a phase of type design with a distinctly French character Robert Estienne carried on the establishment of his father Henri Estienne who had died in Simon de Colines had been the elder Estienne s assistant married his widow and set up his own press br The de Colines roman of resembled Griffo s roman but did not copy it closely Narrower forms and tighter letter fit a with low angled bowl elevated triangular stem serifs on i j m n and r flattened baseline serifs delicately modeled ascender serifs and graceful fluid lines characterize the French style Robert Estienne s roman of was similar to the de Colines face which Estienne complemented with a fine italic type based on that of Arrighi The craftsmen who cut the punches for the romans used by Estienne and de Colines remain unidentified In Antoine Augereau cut the punches for a roman type very close to Estienne s The lower cases of the Estienne and Augereau types became the basis for post Renaissance old style typography and were copied by French typographers for the next years br br br Garamond br br The svelte French style reached its fullest refinement in the roman types attributed to the best known figure of French typography Claude Garamond also Garamont In Robert Estienne printer to the king helped Garamond obtain commissions to cut the sequence of Greek fonts for King Francis I of France known as the grecs du roi A number of roman faces used in Garamond s publishing activities can be positively attributed to him as punch cutter From the dates of their appearance and their similarity to romans used by Estienne Christoffel Plantijn and the printer Andr Wechel the types known as Canon de Garamond and Petit Canon de Garamond shown on a specimen sheet issued by the Egenolff Berner foundry in are generally accepted as Claude Garamond s final roman types br br br Robert Granjon br br Robert Granjon worked in the second half of the th century mainly at Lyon but was also recorded at Paris Rome and Antwerp He is still famous because of his Civilit types imitating French gothic cursive calligraphy His main contribution was an italic type known as Parangon de Granjon Italic type design had apparently become corrupted since the Arrighi and Aldine models Granjon s italic had a greater slant angle slanted roman capitals and reduced weight and rigor These qualities and its contrasting thick and thin strokes gave it a dazzling appearance that made it difficult to read It was nevertheless the main influence for italic type design until the Arrighi model was revived in br In the th century Western printers also developed Oriental types such as Fran ois Savary de Br ves or Robert Granjon usually with the objective of proselytizing the Catholic faith br br br Transition to modern type th and th century br Baroque and rococo aesthetic trends use of the pointed pen for writing and steel engraving techniques effected a gradual shift in typographic style Contrast between thick and thin strokes increased Tilted stressing transformed into vertical stressing full rounds were compressed Blunt bracketed serifs grew sharp and delicate until they were fine straight lines Detail became clean and precise br Transitional roman types combined the classical features of lettera antiqua with the vertical stressing and higher contrast between thick and thin strokes characteristic of the true modern romans to come br The roman types used c by the Dutch printing firm of Elzevir in Leyden reiterated the th century French style with higher contrast less rigor and a lighter page effect After most Elzevir faces were cut by the highly regarded Christoffel van Dyck whose precise renditions were regarded by some experts at the time as finer than Garamond s br br br Fell types br br From mid th century until the end of the th interference with printing by the Crown thwarted the development of type founding in England most type used by th century English printers was of Dutch origin The lack of material inspired Bishop of Oxford Doctor John Fell to purchase punches matrices from Holland c for use by the Oxford University Press The so named Fell types presumed to be the work of Dutch punchcutter Dirck Voskens mark a noticeable jump from previous designs with considerably shorter extenders higher stroke contrast narrowing of round letters and flattened serifs on the baseline and descenders The design retained a retrogressive old style irregularity smooth modeling from vertical to horizontal and angled stressing of rounds except a vertically stressed o Fell capitals were condensed even width with wide flattened serifs all characteristics of the definitive modern romans of the late th century Fell italic types were distinguished by high contrast matching the Fell romans wider ovals a split branching stroke from the stems of m n r and u and long flat serifs prefiguring modern They repeated the non uniform slant of French models and the capitals included swash J and Q forms br An open source digitisation of the Fell Types has been released by designer and engineer Igino Marini br br br Caslon br br The first major figure in English typography is reckoned by type historians to have ended the monopoly of Dutch type founding almost single handedly The gun engraver turned punchcutter William Caslon spent years creating the stable of typefaces on the specimen sheet issued in The complete canon included roman italic Greek Hebrew Arabic etc Caslon s Great Primer roman and English roman were retrogressive designs that very closely followed the Fell types and the roman of Mikl s Nicholas Kis c falsely attributed to Anton Janson Caslon s slightly bracketed serifs and old style irregularity were not novel but a precise cut and perpendicularity gave legibility to the forms Caslon s italic structures follow the Fell italics but at a condensed width and with conventional branching from stems br William Caslon s prodigious output was influential worldwide Caslon type and its imitations were used throughout the British Empire It was the dominant type in the thirteen American colonies of British America introduced by Benjamin Franklin for the second half of the th century and was used for the United States Declaration of Independence Caslon marks the rise of England as the center of typographic activity br br br Fleischmann br Joan Micha l Fleischman was born in N rnberg where he trained as a punchcutter He found employment with Dutch type founders in Holland and settled there c At the Ensched foundry in Haarlem he cut punches for a large amount of material Some time after he produced a distinguished roman design related to the preceding transitional types but departing from them It prefigured modern romans with sparse transaxial modeling joining the vertical stressing to hairline thins and ball ends Fleischmann borrowed from the general mode of Phillipe Grandjean s and Louis Simonneau s Romain du Roi commissioned by Louis XIV in for the Imprimerie Royale but did not imitate that face Fleischmann s capitals were a new variety an even width scheme compressed rounds all vertical stressing and triangular beak ends of E F L T and Z all characteristics prefiguring the classical moderns of Bodoni and Didot Fleischmann s italic bore some resemblance to Granjean s but had longer ascenders and followed the established Dutch structures for h v and w br Fleischmann was held in great esteem by his contemporaries his designs exerting a decisive influence in the last quarter of the th century Renowned French punchcutter Pierre Simon Fournier confessed to having copied Fleischmann s design and was first to dub contrast types like the Fells Caslon and Fleischmann modern Fournier s rococo influenced designs Fournier and Narcissus and his Mod les des Caract res continued the romaine du roi style and adapted it for his own modern age Like Baskerville his italics were inspired by handwriting and the engraved lettering known as copperplate hand Fournier also published a two volume Manuel Typographique in which he recorded much European typographic history and introduced the first standardized system of type size measurement the point br br br Baskerville br br About John Baskerville having found financial success in producing goods from sheet metal moved into the printing business His roman and italic types appeared later than Fleischman s but are considered transitional and partly retrogressive with a return to lower contrast smooth transaxial modeling finely modeled bracketed serifs and long stems The exquisite design and finish of Baskerville s roman however combining elegance and strength was modern His roman design and especially his italic were rococo influenced His letterforms are an intentional transition between old style forms and modern styles They were informed by his prior experience as a writing master and the influences of his time The types of Joseph Fry Alexander Wilson and John Bell closely followed Baskerville and through his correspondence with European type founders Baskerville s influence penetrated most of western Europe Baskerville was a meticulous artist who controlled all aspects of his creation devising more accurate presses blacker inks and paper sealed with hot rollers to ensure crisp impressions Of particular note the lower storey of his lowercase g does not fully close Derivatives of Baskerville are often identified thus A modern revival of Baskerville a font called Mrs Eaves is named after Baskerville s mistress turned wife Sarah Eaves the widow of Richard Eaves br br br Modern romans br br True modern romans arrived with the types of the Italian Giambattista Bodoni and the French Didots Completing trends begun by the Fell types Fleischman Fournier and Baskerville the so called classical modern romans eschewed chirographic and organic influences their synthetic symmetric geometry answering to a rationalized and reformed classical model driven by the strict cartesian grid philosophy of Ren Descartes and the predictable clockwork universe of Isaac Newton br The classical appellation of modern romans stems from their return to long ascenders and descenders set on widely spaced lines and a corresponding light page effect reminiscent of old style occurring at a time of classical revival br Bodoni was foremost in progressing from rococo to the new classical style He produced an italic very close to Baskerville s and a French cursive script type falling in between italic type and joined scripts The roman types of Francois Ambroise Didot and son Firmin Didot closely resemble the work of Bodoni and opinion is divided over whether the Didots or Bodoni originated the first modern romans At any rate the Didots mathematical precision and vanishing of rococo design reflected the enlightenment of post revolution France under Napoleon Francois Ambroise also designed maigre and gras types corresponding to later condensed and expanded font formats br The Spanish designer Joaqu n Ibarra s roman was influenced by Baskerville Didot and Bodoni but hewn nearer to old style and used in the same classical manner including spaced capitals In England modern romans resembling Bodoni s were cut for the printer William Bulmer c by the punchcutter William Martin who had been apprenticed to Baskerville and influenced by him Martin s italic mirrored the open tail g and overall finesse of Baskerville s br In Britain and the United States modern romans emerging around and totally dominant by the s took a somewhat more rounded less geometrical form than the designs of Didot and Bodoni an obvious difference is that in Anglo American faces the upper case C has only one serif at the top whereas in European designs it has two br br br th and th century typography br br br Industrialization br The th century brought fewer stylistic innovations The most notable invention was the rise of typefaces with strengthened serifs Forerunners were the so called Egyptienne fonts which were used already at the beginning of the th century Their name likely comes from the enthusiasm of the Napoleonic era for the orient which in turn was started by Napoleon s invasion in Egypt In fact slab serif fonts e g Clarendon from were newspaper fonts whose serifs were strengthened in order to prevent damage during the printing process Stylistically the serif fonts of the mid th century appeared very robust and otherwise had more or less neo classical design features which changed during the course of time By the application of the slab serif design feature and by appending serifs to more and more typefaces an independent intermediate group of heterogeneous fonts emerged during the th century Meanwhile the slab serifs are listed as an independent group in most typeface classifications besides both main groups serif and sans serif br Slab serif and sans serif types were rarely used for continuous bodies of text their realm was that of advertisements title pages and other attention catching pieces of print By about most western countries were using modern romans and italics for continuous texts This remained true until the s when so called old style faces a largely English speaking phenomenon came into use These went to the opposite extreme from the modern faces thick strokes were attenuated and serifs at the end of thin strokes as in C E L and T were narrow and angled whereas in modern faces they were broad and vertical or nearly so All the upper case characters were somewhat condensed narrowed Old style faces remained popular until about br Above all the th century was innovative regarding technical aspects Automatic manufacturing processes changed the print as well as the graphical illustrations The illustration of printed matters could be considerably standardised due to the lithography technique invented by Alois Senefelder Finally another invention was photography whose establishment at the end of the th century led to the first halftoning and reproduction procedures The step by step development of a modern mass society provided a growing demand of printed matters Besides the traditional letterpress beginnings of a newspaper landscape as well as a broad market for publications advertisements and posters of all kinds appeared The challenges had changed since printing and typography had been a straightforward craft for centuries it now had to face the challenges of an industry ruled mass society br br br Hot type and phototypesetting in the th century br br The years between and coined typography until now The craft of printing became an industry the sixth largest in the United States br The fabrication and application of typefaces more and more were affected by industrial manufacturing processes Significant incidents were the invention of the hot type machine by Ottmar Mergenthaler Linotype machine and Tolbert Lanston Monotype machine and a few decades later the emergence of phototypesetting The result Compilation and typographical design of the text could be more and more controlled by keyboards in contrast to manual typesetting br A result of the industrialisation process was the unimagined number and distribution of new typefaces Whether digital variants of Garamond and Bodoni or new contemporary type designs like Futura Times and Helvetica nearly all currently used typefaces have their origin either in the following and ongoing digital typesetting era or are based on designs of this epoch The basis was the appearance of large type foundries and type manufacturers The result Successful typefaces could quickly gain the status of a trademark and therefore were able to assign a unique branding to products or publications br Chicago contributed much to typography design at this time as Frederic Goudy designer of typefaces founded several presses Oswald Cooper designer of Cooper Black studied under Goudy br Besides the traditional typography of books graphic design became a more or less independent branch The tensions between those two branches significantly determined the stylistic development of th century s typography br br br Art nouveau and New Book Art br br Since impressionism the modern art styles were reflected in graphic design and typography too Around art nouveau became popular Its floral ornaments the curved forms as well as the emphasis on graphical realisation inspired the type designers of the start of the th century A popular art nouveau font was Eckmann designed by graphic artist Otto Eckmann Furthermore the influence of art nouveau was expressed in a lot of book illustrations and ex libris designs br Altogether the return to the roots of book art become stronger around the start of the th century It was initiated by British typographer socialist and private press publisher William Morris as well as by the Arts and Crafts Movement which refers to him Essentially this movement initiated three things a return to the antiqua models of the Renaissance clarity and simplicity of book illustrations and straightforward technical processes during the production of printed matters An immediate consequence of the Arts and Crafts Movement was the establishment of the private press movement which more or less was committed to Morris ideals and whose remains partially are still present today An established meeting point of this scene in Germany for example is the Mainzer Minipressen Messe which actually is held every two years br Especially the New Book Art movement which formed in the decade before World War I was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement The young type designers of the pre war era among them Fritz Helmuth Ehmcke and Friedrich Wilhelm Kleukens rejected both the late typographical classicism and the ornaments of the popular art nouveau The new ideal became a tidy and straightforward book typography which dedicated itself to the ideas of the Renaissance Walter Tiemann in Leipzig Friedrich Hermann Ernst Schneidler in Stuttgart and Rudolf Koch in Offenbach as instructors were the mentors of this kind of typography They stayed influential in the field of book typesetting until a long time after the end of World War II br br br European avant garde typography br During the s typographers in central and eastern Europe experimented with forms of avant garde typography The main places of development of avant garde artists had been Budapest Zagreb Belgrade and after also Prague However since avant garde typography had been spreading to the cities of western and eastern Europe and as a result the previous cities gradually lost their relevance br In two exhibitions important for development of avant garde typography were organized one by Ljubomir Mici the First International Zenitistic Exhibition of New Art in Belgrade and the other by Ion Vinea and Marcel Iancu the First International Exhibition Contimporanul br br br Avant garde typography in Poland br Among the most important Polish artists were W adys aw Strzemi ski and Mieczys aw Szczuka in their works they were referring to poetry and valued the art of publishing printing books more than other forms of art W adys aw Strzemi ski is recognized as the precursor of avant garde typography in Poland he was one of the first artists to set aside the primal shape of letters He thought the content was not as important as the way it was presented because in order to understand the message of a poster cover one had to understand what the artist tried to communicate with the arrangement of words or each letter The inscriptions started to be constructed in a way to catch the eye unlike traditional typography which was perceived as an addition to a text As a form of inspiration architecture also began to lose its value because avant garde artists were drawing their ideas from paintings and graphics Jan Tschichold the creator of one of many definitions and the most known theoretician of avant garde typography stated that its basic rules should be lack of symmetry contrast and total freedom of creation Contrary to other genres of art avant garde creators were also its theoreticians and researchers br br br See also br br br General br Movable type br Printing br Printing press br Punchcutting br Typesetting br Typometry
