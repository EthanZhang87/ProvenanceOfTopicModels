title: SWF
id: 676915
SWF is a defunct Adobe Flash file format that was used for multimedia vector graphics and ActionScript br Originating with FutureWave Software then transferred to Macromedia and then coming under the control of Adobe SWF files can contain animations or applets of varying degrees of interactivity and function They may also occur in programs commonly browser games using ActionScript br Programmers can generate SWF files from within several Adobe products including Flash Flash Builder an IDE Adobe Animate a rename of Adobe Flash since and After Effects as well as through MXMLC a command line application compiler which forms part of the freely available Flex SDK Although Adobe Illustrator can generate SWF format files through its export function it cannot open or edit them Other than using Adobe products one can build SWFs with open source Motion Twin ActionScript Compiler MTASC the open source Ming library and the free software suite SWFTools Various other third party programs can also produce files in this format such as Multimedia Fusion Captivate and SWiSH Max br The term SWF has originated as an abbreviation for ShockWave Flash This usage was changed to the backronym Small Web Format to eliminate confusion with a different technology Shockwave from which SWF derived There is no official resolution to the initialism SWF by Adobe br Adobe declared its Flash player EOL on December On January it pushed an update to its Flash player that blocked all Flash content from running br br br History br The small company FutureWave Software originally defined the file format with one primary objective to create small files for displaying entertaining animations br The idea involved a format which player software could run on any system and which would work with slower network connections FutureWave released FutureSplash Animator in May In December Macromedia acquired FutureWave and FutureSplash Animator became Macromedia Flash br The original naming of SWF came out of Macromedia s desire to capitalize on the well known Macromedia Shockwave brand Macromedia Director produced Shockwave files for the end user so the files created by their newer Flash product tried to capitalize on the already established brand As Flash became more popular than Shockwave itself this branding decision became more of a liability so the format started to be referred to as simply SWF br Adobe acquired Macromedia in br On May Adobe dropped its licensing restrictions on the SWF format specifications as part of the Open Screen Project However Rob Savoye a member of the Gnash development team has pointed to some parts of the Flash format which remain closed On July Adobe released code to Google and Yahoo which allowed their search engines to crawl and index SWF files br br br Description br The main graphical primitive in SWF is the path which is a chain of segments of primitive types ranging from lines to splines or bezier curves Additional primitives like rectangles ellipses and even text can be built from these The graphical elements in SWF are thus fairly similar to SVG and MPEG BIFS SWF also uses display lists and allows naming and reusing previously defined components br The binary stream format SWF uses is fairly similar to QuickTime atoms with a tag length and payload an organization that makes it very easy for older players to skip contents they don t support br Originally limited to presenting vector based objects and images in a simple sequential manner the format in its later versions allows audio since Flash and video since Flash br Adobe introduced a new low level D API in version of the Flash Player Initially codenamed Molehill the official name given to this API was ultimately Stage D It was intended to be an equivalent of OpenGL or Direct D In Stage D shaders are expressed in a low level language called Adobe Graphics Assembly Language AGAL br br br Adoption br br Adobe makes available plugins such as Adobe Flash Player and Adobe Integrated Runtime to play SWF files in web browsers on many desktop operating systems including Microsoft Windows Mac OS X and Linux on the x architecture and ARM architecture ChromeOS only br GNU has started developing a free software SWF player called Gnash under the GNU General Public License GPL Despite being a declared high priority GNU project funding for Gnash was fairly limited Another player is the LGPL licensed Swfdec Lightspark is a continuation of Gnash supporting more recent SWF versions br Adobe has incorporated SWF playback and authoring in other product and technologies of theirs including in Adobe Shockwave which renders more complex documents SWF can also be embedded in PDF files these are viewable with Adobe Reader or later InDesign CS can also produce some limited forms of SWF animations directly br Sony PlayStation Portable consoles can play limited SWF files in Sony s web browser beginning with firmware version Both the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PS consoles can run SWF files through their Internet browsers br Scaleform GFx is a commercial alternative SWF player that features full hardware acceleration using the GPU and has high conformance up to Flash and AS Scaleform GFx is licensed as a game middleware solution and used by many PC and console D games for user interfaces HUDs mini games and video playback br The newer D features of SWF have been seen as an alternative to WebGL with a spurt of D engines like Papervision D Away D Sandy D and Alternativa D targeting D SWF Although some of these projects started around until Flash Player however they had no support of GPU acceleration and even in that version of the Flash Player shaders could be used for same materials but vertex information still had to be processed on the CPU using BSP trees etc After version of the Flash Player added the new Stage D low level API some but not all of these projects migrated to the new API One that did migrate was Away D version br Based on an independent study conducted by Millward Brown and published by Adobe in over of desktop web browsers in the mature markets defined as United States Canada United Kingdom France Germany Japan Australia and New Zealand had a SWF plugin installed with around having the latest version of the Flash Player br Due to the increasing popularity of HTML for games and animations as well as the numerous security holes that had plagued Adobe s SWF player Adobe declared its Flash player EOL on December On January it pushed an update to its Flash player that blocked all Flash content from running br br br Published specifications br Adobe makes available a partial specification of SWF most recently updated in January to reflect changes in SWF version SWF versions have been decoupled from Flash player versions after Flash Afterwards the version number of the SWF progressed rapidly SWF version corresponds to the new features added in Flash Player Flash Player uses SWF version br In the specifications document was criticized by Rob Savoye the lead developer of the Gnash project as missing huge amounts of information needed to completely implement SWF omitting specifications for RTMP and Sorenson Spark The RTMP specification was released publicly in June The Sorenson Spark codec is not Adobe s property br br br Licensing br Until May implementing software that plays SWF was disallowed by the specification s license On that date as part of its Open Screen Project Adobe dropped all such restrictions on the SWF and FLV formats br Implementing software which creates SWF files has always been permitted on the condition that the resulting files render error free in the latest publicly available version of Adobe Flash Player br br br Related file formats and extensions br Other formats related to SWF authoring in the Adobe tool chain remain without a public specification One example is FLA which is the editable version of SWF used by Adobe s Flash but not by other Adobe tools that can also output SWF albeit with fewer features br br br See also br Adobe Flash br ActionScript br ActionScript code protection br Adobe Flash Player the
