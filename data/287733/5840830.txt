The STIX Fonts project or Scientific and Technical Information Exchange STIX is a project sponsored by several leading scientific and technical publishers to provide under royalty free license a comprehensive font set of mathematical symbols and alphabets intended to serve the scientific and engineering community for electronic and print publication The STIX fonts are available as fully hinted OpenType CFF fonts There is currently no TrueType version of the STIX fonts available but the STIX Mission Statement includes the intention to create one in the future However there exists an unofficial conversion of STIX Fonts from the beta version release to TrueType suitable for use with software without OpenType support br STIX fonts also include natural language glyphs for Latin Greek and Cyrillic The family is designed to be visually compatible with the Times New Roman family a popular choice in book publishing br br br Composition br Among the glyphs in STIX have been contributed by the project members The commercial TeX vendor and TeX font foundry MicroPress has been contracted to create the additional glyphs The STIX project will also create a TeX implementation Goals also include incorporating the characters into Unicode and ensuring that browsers can use them br Members of the STIX Fonts project known collectively as the STI Pub consortium include the American Institute of Physics the American Chemical Society the American Mathematical Society the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers the American Physical Society and Elsevier br br The Font contents were assembled from a list of every character glyph required for publication in the journals of the participating STI Pub companies Every scientific discipline is represented in this list as well as many other fields from the arts and humanities br Most of the glyphs in the STIX Fonts have been designed in Times compatible style In addition to Times compatible glyphs some portions of the STIX Fonts include other design styles such as sans serif monospace Fraktur Script and calligraphic br br br Development process br A beta version of the fonts was released on October This version does not include enough of the OpenType mathematical layout features present in Cambria Math so it is not usable to the fullest extent in Microsoft Office The Latin glyph set included in the beta version does not yet cover all the characters required to typeset in Eastern European languages br Final design changes were declared complete at the project website on June A release by end of May for the initial production release was announced still without the support for OpenType layout features of Office or TeX In September the fonts went to the final packaging stage However in October missing glyphs were discovered adding a delay The fonts were scheduled to be released in April and released on May br The project has taken considerably longer than forecast The website has been updated only intermittently and thus has regularly been out of date with forecast milestones often being overshot For example on July the main page on the official site stated Version which will include fonts packaged for use with Microsoft Office applications is scheduled for release by the end of This site was last updated on November Version was released February This version facilitates equation editing in recent versions of Microsoft Word br Version with LaTeX support was released on May br br br STIX br br On December the official project website announced the release of STIX version This was created by Ross Mills and John Hudson of Tiro Typeworks Unlike the previous version which closely matches Nimbus Roman No L it is an original design loosely inspired by a smaller point size of Times New Roman with a higher x height br In April the Type version of the STIX Two fonts for use in LaTeX was released At the same time the STIX project hosting platform has been migrated to GitHub https github com stipub stixfonts br br br Uptake br The STIX Fonts are included in OS X in versions from Lion onwards br The javascript framework MathJax uses the STIX fonts for including mathematics in web pages Installing the fonts on the local computer improves MathJax s typesetting speed br The Math Editor equation editor uses STIX fonts as its primary font br br br ESSTIX br A precursor to the STIX project is the ESSTIX Elsevier Science STIX font developed and later donated by Elsevier It is currently available from the World Wide Web Consortium as part of the Amaya web browser However the STIX fonts are not used in most of the peer reviewed journals published by Elsevier br br br See also br XITS font project br br br br br br External links br Official website br STIX Fonts at Everything Fonts br STIX Fonts project AMS Oct Historical outline of the Unicode facet of the STIX project br Math Editor on GitHub Free and open source equation editor utilizing STIX Fonts br STIX Two Math at Google Fonts
