VRML Virtual Reality Modeling Language pronounced vermal or by its initials originally before known as the Virtual Reality Markup Language is a standard file format for representing dimensional D interactive vector graphics designed particularly with the World Wide Web in mind It has been superseded by X D br br br WRL file format br VRML is a text file format where e g vertices and edges for a D polygon can be specified along with the surface color UV mapped textures shininess transparency and so on URLs can be associated with graphical components so that a web browser might fetch a webpage or a new VRML file from the Internet when the user clicks on the specific graphical component Animations sounds lighting and other aspects of the virtual world can interact with the user or may be triggered by external events such as timers A special Script Node allows the addition of program code e g written in Java or ECMAScript to a VRML file br VRML files are commonly called worlds and have the wrl extension for example island wrl VRML files are in plain text and generally compress well using gzip useful for transferring over the Internet more quickly some gzip compressed files use the wrz extension Many D modeling programs can save objects and scenes in VRML format br br br Standardization br The Web D Consortium has been formed to further the collective development of the format VRML and its successor X D have been accepted as international standards by the International Organization for Standardization ISO and the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC br The first version of VRML was specified in November This version was specified from and very closely resembled the API and file format of the Open Inventor software component originally developed by SGI Version development was guided by the ad hoc VRML Architecture Group VAG A working draft was published in August Formal collaboration between the VAG and SC of ISO IEC began in and VRML was submitted to ISO for adoption as an international standard The current and functionally complete version is VRML ISO IEC VRML has now been superseded by X D ISO IEC br br br Emergence popularity and rival technical upgrade br The term VRML was coined by Dave Raggett in a paper called Extending WWW to support Platform Independent Virtual Reality submitted to the First World Wide Web Conference in and first discussed at the WWW VRML BOF established by Tim Berners Lee where Mark Pesce presented the Labyrinth demo he developed with Tony Parisi and Peter Kennard VRML was introduced to a wider audience in the SIGGRAPH Course VRML Using D to Surf the Web in August In October at Internet World Template Graphics Software TGS demonstrated a D VRML plug in for the beta release of Netscape by Netscape Communications br In a new version of the format was finalized as VRML also known as VRML or VRML and became an ISO IEC standard VRML was used on the Internet on some personal homepages and sites such as CyberTown which offered D chat using Blaxxun Software as well as Sony s SAPARi program which was pre installed on Vaio computers from to The format was championed by SGI s Cosmo Software when SGI restructured in the division was sold to the VREAM Division of Platinum Technology which was then taken over by Computer Associates which did not develop or distribute the software To fill the void a variety of proprietary Web D formats emerged over the next few years including Microsoft Chrome and Adobe Atmosphere neither of which is supported today VRML s capabilities remained largely the same while realtime D graphics kept improving The VRML Consortium changed its name to the Web D Consortium and began work on the successor to VRML X D br SGI ran a web site at vrml sgi com on which was hosted a string of regular short performances of a character called Floops who was a VRML character in a VRML world Floops was a creation of a company called Protozoa br H Anim is a standard for animated Humanoids which is based around VRML and later X D The initial version of the H Anim standard was scheduled for submission at the end of March br VRML has never seen much serious widespread use One reason for this may have been the lack of available bandwidth At the time of VRML s popularity a majority of users both business and personal were using slow dial up Internet access br VRML experimentation was primarily in education and research where an open specification is most valued It has now been re engineered as X D The MPEG Interactive Profile ISO IEC was based on VRML now on X D and X D is largely backward compatible with it VRML is also widely used as a file format for interchange of D models particularly from CAD systems br A free cross platform runtime implementation of VRML is available in OpenVRML Its libraries can be used to add both VRML and X D support to applications and a GTK plugin is available to render VRML X D worlds in web browsers br In the s many companies like Bitmanagement improved the quality level of virtual effects in VRML to the quality level of DirectX c but at the expense of using proprietary solutions All main features like game modeling are already complete They include multi pass render with low level setting for Z buffer BlendOp AlphaOp Stencil Multi texture Shader with HLSL and GLSL support realtime Render To Texture Multi Render Target MRT and PostProcessing Many demos shows that VRML already supports lightmap normalmap SSAO CSM and Realtime Environment Reflection along with other virtual effects br br br Example br This example shows the same scene as X D Example br br br Early criticism br In a March ACM essay Playfulness in D Spaces Why Quake is better than VRML and what it means for software design Clay Shirky sharply criticised VRML as a technology in search of a problem whereas Quake does something well instead of many things poorly The VRML community has failed to come up with anything this compelling not despite the community s best intentions but because of them Every time VRML practitioners approach the problem of how to represent space on the screen they have no focused reason to make any particular trade off of detail versus rendering speed or making objects versus making spaces because VRML isn t for anything except itself Many times having a particular near term need to solve brings a project s virtues into sharp focus and gives it enough clarity to live on its own br br br Alternatives br DMLW D Markup Language for Web br COLLADA managed by the Khronos Group br O D
