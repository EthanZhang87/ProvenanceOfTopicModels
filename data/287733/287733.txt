MetaPost refers to both a programming language and the interpreter of the MetaPost programming language Both are derived from Donald Knuth s Metafont language and interpreter MetaPost produces vector graphic diagrams from a geometric algebraic description The language shares Metafont s declarative syntax for manipulating lines curves points and geometric transformations However br br Metafont is set up to produce fonts in the form of image files in gf format with associated font metric files in tfm format whereas MetaPost produces EPS SVG or PNG files br The output of Metafont consists of the fonts at a fixed resolution in a raster based format whereas MetaPost s output is vector based graphics lines B zier curves br Metafont output is monochrome whereas MetaPost uses RGB or CMYK colors br The MetaPost language can include text labels on the diagrams either strings from a specified font or anything else that can be typeset with TeX br Starting with version Metapost allows floating point arithmetic with bits default bit fixed point arithmetic br Many of the limitations of MetaPost derive from features of Metafont For instance MetaPost does not support all features of PostScript Most notably paths can have only one segment so that regions are simply connected and regions can be filled only with uniform colours PostScript level supports tiled patterns and PostScript supports Gouraud shading br br br Availability and usage br MetaPost is distributed with many distributions of the TeX and Metafont framework for example it is included in the MiKTeX and the TeX Live distributions br The encapsulated postscript produced by Metapost can be included in LaTeX ConTeXt and TeX documents via standard graphics inclusion commands The encapsulated postscript output can also be used with the PDFTeX engine thus directly giving PDF This ability is implemented in ConTeXt and in the LaTeX graphics package and can be used from plain TeX via the supp pdf tex macro file br ConTeXt and LuaTeX supports the inclusion of MetaPost code within the input file Inclusion of MetaPost code in LaTeX is also possible by using LaTeX packages for example gmp or mpgraphics br br br Examples br This is a single file example mp which when processed by the MetaPost interpreter via the command mpost on Linux produces three eps files example example example These are pictured on the right br br The resulting three eps files can be used in TeX via LaTeX s includegraphics command ConTeXt s externalfigure Plain TeX s epsfbox command or in Plain pdftex the convertMPtoPDF command from supp pdf tex To view or print the third diagram this inclusion is necessary as the TeX fonts Computer Modern are not included in the eps files produced by MetaPost by default br br br See also br br PSTricks br PGF TikZ br METATYPE br Asymptote br br br br br br External links br The TeX Users Group TUG http www tug org has a page devoted to MetaPost http www tug org metapost html
