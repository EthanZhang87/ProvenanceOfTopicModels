The DejaVu fonts are a superfamily of fonts designed for broad coverage of the Unicode Universal Character Set The fonts are derived from Bitstream Vera sans serif and Bitstream Charter serif two fonts released by Bitstream under a free license that allowed derivative works based upon them the Vera and Charter families were limited mainly to the characters in the Basic Latin and Latin Supplement portions of Unicode roughly equivalent to ISO IEC and Bitstream s licensing terms allowed the fonts to be expanded upon without explicit authorization The DejaVu fonts project was started with the aim to provide a wider range of characters while maintaining the original look and feel through the process of collaborative development The development of the fonts is done by many contributors and is organized through a wiki and a mailing list br The DejaVu fonts project was started by t p n Roh Over time it has absorbed several other projects that also existed to extend the Bitstream Vera typefaces these projects include the Olwen Font Family Bepa Arev Fonts only partially and the SUSE Linux standard fonts The full project incorporates the Bitstream Vera license an extended MIT License which restricts naming of modified distributions and prohibits individual sale of the typefaces although they may be embedded within a larger commercial software package terms also found in the later Open Font License to the extent that the DejaVu fonts changes can be separated from the original Bitstream Vera and Charter fonts these changes have been deeded to the public domain br br br Usage br DejaVu fonts can be obtained from the DejaVu project repo on GitHub Some operating systems OpenBSD Solaris Haiku AmigaOS Linux distributions such as Ubuntu Debian Fedora and RHEL include DejaVu fonts in their default installation sometimes even using them as their system fonts These fonts were also included in the proprietary BlackBerry OS since its version under the names BBAlphaSans and BBAlphaSerif until they were replaced in BlackBerry with Slate br DejaVu Serif Bold was used by designer Jonathan Barnbrook in the promotional and packaging materials for Blackstar the final album of English musician David Bowie before his death in January br br br Unicode coverage br DejaVu is a project which aims for complete coverage of the alphabetic scripts abjads and symbols with all characters that are part of the MES MES and hopefully MES subsets of Unicode The coverage is already considerable although some more work is needed to include more hinting rules for clear results at small sizes Some kerning rules are still being developed for the Sans and Serif styles for fine typography Some work is still also needed to create ligatures in these styles br As of version it included characters from the following Unicode blocks The fraction given is the number of characters in each block that are included in the DejaVu fonts br br br Styles br The styles provided by the original Bitstream Vera fonts have been augmented to styles br br Original styles are marked in bold br br br DejaVu Sans Mono br The DejaVu Sans Mono typeface in particular is suitable for technical contexts since it clearly distinguishes l lowercase L from one and from I uppercase i also it clearly distinguishes zero null from O uppercase o br One derivative of the DejaVu Sans Mono typeface the Menlo typeface is provided by Apple with the Mac OS X operating system Another is the Hack typeface which seeks to further optimize DejaVu Sans Mono for programming and which is as of the default monospace font for KDE on openSUSE br br br See also br List of typefaces br Unicode font br Open source Unicode typefaces br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Official website br DejaVu fonts on GitHub br Official website wiki archive The Wayback Machine final crawl before site was shut down br Shankland Stephen Open source casts new mold for type design CNET
