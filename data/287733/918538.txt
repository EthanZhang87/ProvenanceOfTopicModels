ConTeXt is a general purpose document processor Like LaTeX it is derived from TeX It is especially suited for structured documents automated document production very fine typography and multilingual typesetting It is based in part on the TeX typesetting system and uses a document markup language for manuscript preparation The typographical and automated capabilities of ConTeXt are extensive including interfaces for handling microtypography multiple footnotes and footnote classes and manipulating OpenType fonts and features Moreover it offers extensive support for colors backgrounds hyperlinks presentations figure text integration and conditional compilation It gives the user extensive control over formatting while making it easy to create new layouts and styles without learning the low level TeX macro language br While comparisons can be made between ConTeXt and LaTeX the primary objectives of the two systems are distinct From the onset ConTeXt has been a typography and typesetting system designed to give users straightforward and consistent access to advanced typographical control which is crucial for general purpose typesetting LaTeX s original vision on the other hand was to insulate the user from typographical decisions an approach particularly useful for tasks such as submitting articles to a scientific journal Although LaTeX has evolved from this original vision ConTeXt s unified design prevents the package clashes often experienced with LaTeX br ConTeXt provides a multilingual user interface with support for markup in English Dutch German French and Italian and support for output in many scripts including western European eastern European Arabic Chinese Japanese and Korean It also allows the user to use different TeX engines like pdfTeX XeTeX and LuaTeX without changing the user interface br As its native drawing engine ConTeXt integrates a superset of MetaPost called MetaFun which allows users to draw page backgrounds and ornaments with MetaPost MetaFun can also be used directly with MetaPost ConTeXt also supports the use of other external drawing engines like PGF TikZ and PSTricks br ConTeXt also provides a macro package for typesetting chemical structure diagrams with TeX called PPCHTeX as well as many other modules This package can also be used with plain TeX and LaTeX br Originally entitled pragmatex ConTeXt was given its name around by Hans Hagen from PRAGMA Advanced Document Engineering Pragma ADE a Netherlands based company br br br License br ConTeXt is free software the program code i e anything not under the doc subtree is distributed under the GNU GPL the documentation is provided under Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike license br The ConTeXt official manual and ConTeXt official mini tutorial are documents copyrighted by Pragma but there is a repository of the future new manual released under the GNU Free Documentation License As of April there is an up to date version of the fonts and typography chapters br br br Versions br The current version of ConTeXt is LMTX introduced in April as the successor to Mark IV MkIV Previous versions Mark II MkII and Mark I are no longer maintained br According to the developers the principal difference between LMTX and its predecessors is that the newest version uses a compilation and scripting engine that is specifically developed with ConTeXt in mind LuaMetaTeX which has been optimised heavily for ConTeXt use Previously MkIV used LuaTeX and MkII used pdfTeX br br br History br ConTeXt was created by Hans Hagen and Ton Otten of Pragma ADE in the Netherlands around due to the need for educational typesetting material br Around Hans Hagen coined the name ConTeXt meaning text with tex con tex t con is a Latin preposition meaning together with Before ConTeXt was used only within Pragma ADE but in it began to be adopted by a wider audience The first users outside Pragma were Taco Hoekwater Berend de Boer and Gilbert van den Dobbelsteen and the first user outside the Netherlands was Tobias Burnus br In July contextgarden net wiki page was created br ConTeXt low level code was originally written in Dutch Around the ConTeXt developers began translating this to English resulting in the version known as MKII which is now stable and frozen br In August Hans Hagen presented the MKIV version and the first public beta was released later that year br During the ConTeXt User Meeting Mojca Miklavec presented ConTeXt Minimals a distribution of ConTeXt containing the latest binaries and intended to have a small memory footprint thus demanding less bandwidth for updates In August this distribution was registered as a project in launchpad web site br In June Patrick Gundlach wrote the first post in ConTeXt blog br In July ConTeXt started git repository br In November the ConTeXt Group was created br In April LMTX ConTeXt LuaMetaTeX was announced br br br Example of code br Making ConTeXt documents is simple one makes a plain text file and compiles it with the context script The result of this process is a PDF file ConTeXt also can generate a DVI file An example is shown below br ConTeXt documents come with the file extension tex or an extension demarking the version required mkii mkiv or mkxl for regular TeX mkvi or mklx for a dialect that supports named macro parameters in addition to TeX s numeric
