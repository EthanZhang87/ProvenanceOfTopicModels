Linux Libertine is a digital typeface created by the Libertine Open Fonts Project which aims to create free and open alternatives to proprietary typefaces such as Times New Roman It was developed with the free font editor FontForge and is licensed under the GNU General Public License and the SIL Open Font License br In the project released Linux Biolinum it is a sans serif font designed to pair well with Libertine It resembles Optima br In a monospaced serif font face was released Linux Libertine Mono br Derivative works include the following br br The Libertinus font family forked in including br Libertinus Serif based on Linux Libertine br Libertinus Sans based on Linux Biolinum and Optima br Libertinus Mono based on Linux Libertine Mono br Libertinus Math based on Linux Libertine with additional glyphs for mathematics br Common Serif based on Libertinus Serif br br br Characteristics br Linux Libertine is a proportional serif typeface inspired by th century book type and is intended as a replacement for the Times font family br The typeface has five styles regular bold italic bold italic and small capitals all of which are available in TrueType and OpenType format as well as in source code The OpenType version allows automatic positioning and substitution including true fractions ligatures and kerning A display type variant while similar in letter form is lighter in weight and bears a closer resemblance to old style types such as Palatino br There is also a complementary humanist sans serif face Linux Biolinum similar to Optima or Candara It is available in bold and italic styles br br br Unicode coverage br Linux Libertine contains more than glyphs and encompasses character sets such as the Greek Alphabet Cyrillic script and Hebrew alphabet Additionally it offers several ligatures such as f f f i and c t and the capital It also includes special characters such as International Phonetic Alphabet arrows floral symbols Roman numbers text figures and small caps The Tux mascot is included at the Unicode code point U E br br br Usage br br In Linux Libertine was adopted as an open source substitute for the Hoefler Text typeface in the redesign of the Wikipedia logo making it possible to localize the Wikipedia identity into more than languages and character sets The W character which had previously been used in various other places in Wikipedia such as the favicon and was a distinctive part of the Wikipedia brand had crossed V glyphs in the original logo while Linux Libertine has a joined W letter shape As a solution the crossed W was added to Linux Libertine as an OpenType variant br Both the Linux Libertine and Linux Biolinum typefaces are used by the open source design publication Libre Graphics Magazine and the Association for Computing Machinery journals and conference proceedings br br br Derivative works br L szl N meth created a variant of fonts with additional Graphite font tables Linux Libertine G and Linux Biolinum G Both these fonts are bundled with LibreOffice as of the suite s release with some features added in the release br Khaled Hosny forked the Linux Libertine font family in that stemmed from a lack of a matching mathematical companion font for Linux Libertine He officially released the initial version of his fork in Due to licensing restrictions of Linux Libertine regarding the need to change the name of derivative works he renamed his version to Libertinus fonts including Libertinus Serif and Libertinus Sans Hosny also used this opportunity to unify the various font names Thus Linux Libertine became Libertinus Serif Linux Biolinum became Libertinus Sans and Linux Libertine Mono became Libertinus Mono His new mathematical font is called Libertinus Math While working on the mathematical companion Hosny fixed many technical issues of the already existing fonts This led him to a complete fork of Linux Libertine not just adding a complementing typeface to it Since Linux Libertine s releases came to a halt in the actively developed Libertinus fonts are de facto a continuation of the now stalled Linux Libertine project Khaled passed the role of maintainer on to Caleb Maclennan in br Stefan Peev forked the Libertinus Serif font to create the Common Serif font in br br br See also br Free software Unicode typefaces br List of typefaces br Unicode fonts br br br br br br External links br br Official website Archived December at the Wayback Machine br Download Linux Libertine fonts at fonts u com br Download Linux Libertine fonts at fontsquirrel com br Graphite versions of Linux Libertine G and Linux Biolinum G fonts br Samples of Linux Biolinum at dafont com br Download page of the Libertinus fonts at GitHub
