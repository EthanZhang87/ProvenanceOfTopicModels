Graphite is a programmable Unicode compliant smart font technology and rendering system developed by SIL International as free software distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License and the Common Public License br br br Capabilities and comparison to other smart font technologies br Graphite is based on the TrueType font format and adds three of its own tables It allows for a variety of rendering rules including ligatures glyph substitution glyph insertion glyph rearrangement anchoring diacritics kerning and justification Graphite rules may be sensitive to the context For instance there might be a glyph substitution rule that replaces every non final s by an br In a Graphite font all smart rendering information resides within the font file In order to display the Graphite smart rendering an application needs only Graphite support but no built in knowledge about the writing system s rendering This makes Graphite especially suited for minority writing systems that cannot rely on applications to provide built in rendering information In this regard Graphite is similar to AAT and different from OpenType which requires applications to provide built in rendering information br br br Graphite support br Graphite was originally implemented on Windows It has been ported to Linux It is also available on Mac OS X Snow Leopard although with AAT macOS already provides a technology suitable for minority scripts br Applications that support Graphite include the SIL WorldPad XeTeX OpenOffice org since version except for the macOS version LibreOffice formerly except for the macOS version since version Graphite is available on all platforms It was built into Thunderbird and Firefox and was turned on by default since version but was disabled in Firefox version and re enabled in version br Graphite support can be added to applications on Linux with the package pango graphite and on Windows with the experimental add on MultiScribe br br br See also br br OpenType br Apple Advanced Typography br Uniscribe br HarfBuzz br International Components for Unicode br br br br br br External links br Official website br List of Graphite enabled fonts Archived at the Wayback Machine br SIL Language Technology products which include Graphite and fonts br SIL Graphite Sourceforge website br Project SILA Archived at the Wayback Machine Graphite and Mozilla integration project br Presentation of Graphite for aKademy by S Correll br SIL Graphite Font Demo for testing browsers
