as original font designs with the European Union trademark and design office The German font foundry Linotype protested citing Segoe UI s similarity to its licensed Frutiger family of typefaces In its submission to the EU Microsoft claimed that Linotype had failed to prove that it had been selling Frutiger and Frutiger Next prior to The EU rejected these claims and the EU revoked Microsoft s registration Microsoft did not appeal the decision Microsoft still holds United States design patents for various Segoe based fonts br During the same period in late after six years under the Agfa Corporation TA Associates acquired the Monotype assets and incorporated the company as Monotype Imaging Later Monotype Imaging acquired Linotype By the end of the company that had challenged Microsoft
