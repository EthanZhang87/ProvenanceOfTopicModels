title: BSD licenses
id: 18933111
BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software This is in contrast to copyleft licenses which have share alike requirements The original BSD license was used for its namesake the Berkeley Software Distribution BSD a Unix like operating system The original version has since been revised and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses br BSD is both a license and a class of license generally referred to as BSD like The modified BSD license in wide use today is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code format or reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format The BSD license unlike some other licenses e g GPL does not require that source code be distributed at all br br br Terms br In addition to the original clause license used for BSD several derivative licenses have emerged that are also commonly referred to as a BSD license Today the typical BSD license is the clause version which is revised from the original clause version br In all BSD licenses as following year is the year of the copyright As published in BSD copyright holder is Regents of the University of California br br br Previous license br br Some releases of BSD prior to the adoption of the clause BSD license used a license that is clearly ancestral to the clause BSD license These releases include some parts of BSD Tahoe about files and Net Although largely replaced by the clause license this license can be found in BSD Reno Net and BSD Alpha br br Copyright c year copyright holder br All rights reserved br

known as the advertising clause This clause eventually became controversial as it required authors of all works deriving from a BSD licensed work to include an acknowledgment of the original source in all advertising material This was clause number in the original license text br Copyright c year copyright holder br All rights reserved br Redistribution and use in source and binary forms with or

OTHERWISE ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS br SOFTWARE EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE br br This clause was objected to on the grounds that as people changed the license to reflect their name or organization it led to escalating advertising requirements when programs were combined in a software distribution every occurrence of the license with a different name required a separate acknowledgment In arguing against it Richard Stallman has stated that he counted such acknowledgments in a version of NetBSD In addition the clause presented a legal problem for those wishing to publish BSD licensed software which relies upon separate programs using the GNU GPL the advertising clause is incompatible with the GPL which does not allow the addition of restrictions beyond those it already imposes because of this the GPL s publisher the Free Software Foundation recommends developers not use the license though it states there is no reason not to use software already using it br br br clause license BSD License Revised BSD License New BSD License or Modified BSD License br br The advertising clause was removed from the license text in the official BSD license on July by William Hoskins Director of the Office of Technology Licensing for UC Berkeley Other BSD distributions removed the clause but many similar clauses remain in BSD derived code from other sources and unrelated code using a derived license br While the original license is sometimes referred to as the BSD old the resulting clause version is sometimes referred to by BSD new Other names include new BSD revised BSD BSD or clause BSD This version has been vetted as an Open source license by the OSI as The BSD License The Free Software Foundation which refers to the license as the Modified BSD License states that it is compatible with the GNU GPL The FSF encourages users to be specific when referring to the license by name i e not simply referring to it as a BSD license or BSD style to avoid confusion with the original BSD license br This version allows unlimited redistribution for any purpose as long as its copyright notices and the license s disclaimers of warranty are maintained The license also contains a clause restricting use of the names of contributors for endorsement of a derived work without specific permission br br Copyright year copyright holder br Redistribution

DAMAGE br br br clause license Simplified BSD License or FreeBSD License br br An even more simplified version has come into use primarily known for its usage in FreeBSD It was in use there as early as April and likely well before The primary difference between it and the New BSD clause License is that it omits the non endorsement clause The FreeBSD version of the license also adds a further disclaimer about views and opinions expressed in the software though this is not commonly included by other projects br The Free Software Foundation which refers to the license as the FreeBSD License states that it is compatible with the GNU GPL In addition the FSF encourages users to be specific when referring to the license by name i e not simply referring to it as a BSD license or BSD style as it does with the modified new BSD license to avoid confusion with the original BSD license br br Copyright c year copyright holder br Redistribution and use in source and binary forms with or without

WHETHER IN CONTRACT STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE br Other projects such as NetBSD use a similar clause license This version has been vetted as an Open source license by the OSI as the Simplified BSD License br The ISC license without the and or wording is functionally equivalent and endorsed by the OpenBSD project as a license template for new contributions br br br clause license BSD Zero Clause License br br The BSD clause license goes further than the clause license by dropping the requirements to include the copyright notice license text or disclaimer in either source or binary forms Doing so forms a public domain equivalent license the same way as MIT No Attribution License It is known as BSD Zero Clause BSD or Free Public License It was created by Rob Landley and first used in Toybox when he was disappointed after using GPL license in BusyBox br br Copyright C year by copyright holder email br Permission to use copy modify and or distribute this software for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted br br THE SOFTWARE IS

OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE br br br Other variations br The SPDX License List contains extra BSD license variations Examples include br br BSD Clause a license with only the source code retaining clause used by Berkeley Software Design in the s and later used by the Boost Software License OSI approved since br BSD Clause Patent a variation of BSD Clause with a patent grant OSI approved since br BSD Clause No Nuclear Warranty a variation of BSD Clause that adds that a piece of software is not licensed for use in a nuclear facility br br br License compatibility br br br Commercial license compatibility br The FreeBSD project argues on the advantages of BSD style licenses for companies and commercial use cases due to their license compatibility with proprietary licenses and general flexibility stating that the BSD style licenses place only minimal restrictions on future behavior and are not legal time bombs unlike copyleft licenses The BSD License allows proprietary use and allows the software released under the license to be incorporated into proprietary products Works based on the material may be released under a proprietary license as closed source software allowing usual commercial usages under them br br br FOSS compatibility br The clause BSD license like most permissive licenses is compatible with almost all FOSS licenses and as well proprietary licenses br Two variants of the license the New BSD License Modified BSD License clause and the Simplified BSD License FreeBSD License clause have been verified as GPL compatible free software licenses by the Free Software Foundation and have been vetted as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative The original clause BSD license has not been accepted as an open source license and although the original is considered to be a free software license by the FSF the FSF does not consider it to be compatible with the GPL due to the advertising clause br br br Reception and usage br br The BSD license family is one of the oldest and most broadly used license families in the free and open source software ecosystem and has been the inspiration for a number of other licenses Many FOSS software projects use a BSD license for instance the BSD OS family FreeBSD etc Google s Bionic or Toybox As of the BSD clause license ranked in popularity number five according to Black Duck Software and sixth according to GitHub data br br br See also br br Comparison of free and open source software licenses br Software using the BSD license category br br br br
