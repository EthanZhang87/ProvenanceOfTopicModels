X D Extensible D is a set of royalty free ISO IEC standards for declaratively representing D computer graphics X D includes multiple graphics file formats programming language API definitions and run time specifications for both delivery and integration of interactive network capable D data X D version has been approved by Web D Consortium and is under final review by ISO IEC as a revised International Standard IS br X D is specifically designed to work across diverse devices by using the Web Architecture X D provides a range of D functionality through Profiles from basic asset Interchange and CADInterchange to Interactive MPEG Interactive Medical Immersive and Full Profiles Anatomically thorough support is also available for Humanoid Animation HAnim body structure and motion The X in X D means Extensible custom vendor and research component extensions can be added to standard functionality br X D file format support includes XML ClassicVRML Compressed Binary Encoding CBE and a draft JSON encoding Semantic Web support has also been demonstrated by a Turtle encoding X D became the successor to the Virtual Reality Modeling Language VRML in X D provides multiple extensions to VRML e g CAD geospatial humanoid animation NURBS etc the ability to encode the scene using an XML syntax as well as the Open Inventor like syntax of VRML or binary compression with strongly typed APIs including ECMAScript Java Python and other programming languages br X D rendering includes both classic e g Blinn Phong and modern physically based rendering PBR methods matching glTF capabilities Use of custom shaders using three platform specific shader languages is also defined Authors can employ rich multimedia capabilities including various image and movie formats Fully spatialized aural rendering applies W C Web Audio API capabilities plus audio inputs digitized using MIDI or other sound formats br All X D file encodings and programming language APIs have equivalent expressive power matching functional definitions in the X D Architecture standard Thus X D can work with open standards including XML Document Object Model DOM XPath and others br br br Example br br The VRML representation is the same as VRML Example except that the version numbers are changed to reflect the latest X D standard X D V utf An identifying DEF name is also applied as a node identifier id br For JSON and binary formats see Web D for a list of tools br br br Applications br There are several applications most of which are open source software which natively parse and interpret X D files including the D graphics and animation editor Blender and the Sun Microsystems virtual world client Project Wonderland An X D applet is a software program that runs within a web browser and displays content in D using OpenGL D graphics technology to display X D content in several different browsers IE Safari Firefox across several different operating systems Windows Mac OS X Linux However X D has not received as wide acceptance as that of other more notable software applications br In the s many companies such as Bitmanagement improved the quality level of virtual effects in X D to the quality level of DirectX c but at the expense of using proprietary solutions All main features including game modeling are already complete They include multi pass render with low level setting for Z buffer BlendOp AlphaOp Stencil Multi texture Shader with HLSL and GLSL support real time Render To Texture Multi Render Target MRT and post processing Many demos shows that X D already supports lightmap normal mapping SSAO CSM and real time environment reflection along with other virtual effects br br br X DOM br Striving to become the D standard for the Web X D is designed to be as integrated into HTML pages as other XML standards such as MathML and SVG X DOM is a proposed syntax model and its implementation as a script library that demonstrates how this integration can be achieved without a browser plugin using only WebGL and JavaScript br br br Standardization br X D defines several profiles sets of components for various levels of capability including X D Core X D Interchange X D Interactive X D CADInterchange X D Immersive and X D Full Browser makers can define their own component extensions prior to submitting them for standardisation by the Web D Consortium Formal review and approval is then performed by ISO IEC br Liaison and cooperation agreements are also in place between the Web D Consortium and the World Wide Web Consortium W C Open Geospatial Consortium OGC Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine DICOM and the Khronos Group br A subset of X D is XMT A a variant of XMT defined in MPEG Part It was designed to provide a link between X D and D content in MPEG BIFS br The abstract specification for X D ISO IEC was first approved by the ISO in The XML and ClassicVRML encodings for X D ISO IEC were first approved in br br br Alternatives br WebGL JavaScript API for rendering interactive D graphics and D graphics within any compatible web browser managed by the Khronos Group br DMLW D Markup Language for Web br glTF a standard file format for three dimensional scenes and models managed by the Khronos Group br COLLADA interchange file format for interactive D applications managed by the Khronos Group br O D
