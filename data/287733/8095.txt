Donald Ervin Knuth k NOOTH born January is an American computer scientist and mathematician He is a professor emeritus at Stanford University He is the recipient of the ACM Turing Award informally considered the Nobel Prize of computer science Knuth has been called the father of the analysis of algorithms br Knuth is the author of the multi volume work The Art of Computer Programming He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it In the process he also popularized the asymptotic notation In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of theoretical computer science Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system and the Computer Modern family of typefaces br As a writer and scholar Knuth created the WEB and CWEB computer programming systems designed to encourage and facilitate literate programming and designed the MIX MMIX instruction set architectures He strongly opposes the granting of software patents and has expressed his opinion to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and European Patent Organisation br br br Biography br br br Early life br Donald Knuth was born in Milwaukee Wisconsin to Ervin Henry Knuth and Louise Marie Bohning He describes his heritage as Midwestern Lutheran German His father owned a small printing business and taught bookkeeping While a student at Milwaukee Lutheran High School Knuth thought of ingenious ways to solve problems For example in eighth grade he entered a contest to find the number of words that the letters in Ziegler s Giant Bar could be rearranged to create the judges had identified such words With time gained away from school due to a fake stomachache Knuth used an unabridged dictionary and determined whether each dictionary entry could be formed using the letters in the phrase Using this algorithm he identified over words winning the contest As prizes the school received a new television and enough candy bars for all of his schoolmates to eat br br br Education br Knuth received a scholarship in physics to the Case Institute of Technology now part of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland Ohio enrolling in He also joined the Beta Nu Chapter of the Theta Chi fraternity While studying physics at Case Knuth was introduced to the IBM an early commercial computer After reading the computer s manual Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school because he believed he could do it better br In Knuth created a program to help his school s basketball team win its games He assigned values to players in order to gauge their probability of scoring points a novel approach that Newsweek and CBS Evening News later reported on br Knuth was one of the founding editors of the Case Institute s Engineering and Science Review which won a national award as best technical magazine in He then switched from physics to mathematics and received two degrees from Case in his Bachelor of Science and simultaneously a master of science by a special award of the faculty who considered his work exceptionally outstanding br In with mathematician Marshall Hall as his adviser he earned a PhD in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology with a thesis titled Finite Semifields and Projective Planes br br br Early work br In after receiving his PhD Knuth joined Caltech s faculty as an assistant professor br Knuth accepted a commission to write a book on computer programming language compilers While working on this project he decided that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming which became The Art of Computer Programming He originally planned to publish this as a single book but as he developed his outline for the book he concluded that he required six volumes and then seven to thoroughly cover the subject He published the first volume in br Just before publishing the first volume of The Art of Computer Programming Knuth left Caltech to accept employment with the Institute for Defense Analyses Communications Research Division then situated on the Princeton campus which was performing mathematical research in cryptography to support the National Security Agency br In Knuth attended a Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics conference and someone asked what he did At the time computer science was partitioned into numerical analysis artificial intelligence and programming languages Based on his study and The Art of Computer Programming book Knuth decided the next time someone asked he would say Analysis of algorithms br In Knuth left his position at Princeton to join the Stanford University faculty where he became Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science in He became Professor of The Art of Computer Programming in and has been emeritus since br br br Writings br Knuth is a writer as well as a computer scientist br br br The Art of Computer Programming TAOCP br br The best way to communicate from one human being to another is through story br In the s Knuth called computer science a totally new field with no real identity And the standard of available publications was not that high A lot of the papers coming out were quite simply wrong So one of my motivations was to put straight a story that had been very badly told br From to Knuth spent a year at the University of Oslo among people such as Ole Johan Dahl This is where he had originally intended to write the seventh volume in his book series which was to deal with programming languages But Knuth had finished only the first two volumes when he came to Oslo and thus spent the year on the third volume next to teaching The third volume came out just after Knuth returned to Stanford in br By Volume A had been published Concrete Mathematics A Foundation for Computer Science nd ed which originated with an expansion of the mathematical preliminaries section of Volume of TAoCP was published in In April Knuth said he anticipated that Volume will have at least parts A through F Volume B was published in October br br br Other works br Knuth is also the author of Surreal Numbers a mathematical novelette on John Conway s set theory construction of an alternate system of numbers Instead of simply explaining the subject the book seeks to show the development of the mathematics Knuth wanted the book to prepare students for doing original creative research br In Knuth wrote the foreword to the book A B by Marko Petkov ek Herbert Wilf and Doron Zeilberger He also occasionally contributes language puzzles to Word Ways The Journal of Recreational Linguistics br Knuth has delved into recreational mathematics He contributed articles to the Journal of Recreational Mathematics beginning in the s and was acknowledged as a major contributor in Joseph Madachy s Mathematics on Vacation br Knuth also appears in a number of Numberphile and Computerphile videos on YouTube where he discusses topics from writing Surreal Numbers to why he does not use email br br br Works about his religious beliefs br In addition to his writings on computer science Knuth a Lutheran is also the author of Bible Texts Illuminated in which he examines the Bible by a process of systematic sampling namely an analysis of chapter verse of each book Each verse is accompanied by a rendering in calligraphic art contributed by a group of calligraphers led by Hermann Zapf Knuth was invited to give a set of lectures at MIT on the views on religion and computer science behind his project resulting in another book Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About where he published the lectures God and Computer Science br br br Opinion on software patents br Knuth strongly opposes granting software patents to trivial solutions that should be obvious but has expressed more nuanced views for nontrivial solutions such as the interior point method of linear programming He has expressed his disagreement directly to both the United States Patent and Trademark Office and European Patent Organisation br br br Programming br br br Digital typesetting br In the s the publishers of TAOCP abandoned Monotype in favor of phototypesetting Knuth became so frustrated with the inability of the latter system to approach the quality of the previous volumes which were typeset using the older system that he took time out to work on digital typesetting and created TeX and Metafont br br br Literate programming br While developing TeX Knuth created a new methodology of programming which he called literate programming because he believed that programmers should think of programs as works of literature br br Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do br Knuth embodied the idea of literate programming in the WEB system The same WEB source is used to weave a TeX file and to tangle a Pascal source file These in their turn produce a readable description of the program and an executable binary respectively A later iteration of the system CWEB replaces Pascal with C C and Java br Knuth used WEB to program TeX and METAFONT and published both programs as books both originally published the same year TeX The Program and METAFONT The Program Around the same time LaTeX the now widely adopted macro package based on TeX was first developed by Leslie Lamport who later published its first user manual in br br br Personal life br Donald Knuth married Nancy Jill Carter on June while he was a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology They have two children John Martin Knuth and Jennifer Sierra Knuth br Knuth gives informal lectures a few times a year at Stanford University which he calls Computer Musings He was a visiting professor at the Oxford University Department of Computer Science in the United Kingdom until and an Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College br Knuth is an organist and a composer He and his father served as organists for Lutheran congregations Knuth and his wife have a rank organ in their home In he completed a piece for organ Fantasia Apocalyptica which he calls a translation of the Greek text of the Revelation of Saint John the Divine into music It was premi red in Sweden on January br br br Chinese name br Knuth s Chinese name is Gao Dena simplified Chinese traditional Chinese pinyin G o D n He was given this name in by Frances Yao shortly before making a three week trip to China In the Chinese translation of Volume of The Art of Computer Programming simplified Chinese traditional Chinese pinyin J su nj ch ngx sh j y sh Knuth explains that he embraced his Chinese name because he wanted to be known by the growing numbers of computer programmers in China at the time In his Chinese name was placed atop the Journal of Computer Science and Technology s header which Knuth says makes me feel close to all Chinese people although I cannot speak your language br br br Health concerns br In Knuth was diagnosed with prostate cancer He underwent surgery in December that year and said a little bit of radiation therapy as a precaution but the prognosis looks pretty good in his video autobiography br br br Humor br br Knuth used to pay a finder s fee of for any typographical errors or mistakes discovered in his books because pennies is one hexadecimal dollar and for valuable suggestions According to an article in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s Technology Review these Knuth reward checks are among computerdom s most prized trophies Knuth had to stop sending real checks in due to bank fraud and now gives each error finder a certificate of deposit from a publicly listed balance in his fictitious Bank of San Serriffe br He once warned a correspondent Beware of bugs in the above code I have only proved it correct not tried it br Knuth published his first scientific article in a school magazine in under the title The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures In it he defined the fundamental unit of length as the thickness of Mad No and named the fundamental unit of force whatmeworry Mad published the article in issue No June br To demonstrate the concept of recursion Knuth intentionally referred Circular definition and Definition circular to each other in the index of The Art of Computer Programming Volume br br The preface of Concrete Mathematics has the following paragraph When DEK taught Concrete Mathematics at Stanford for the first time he explained the somewhat strange title by saying that it was his attempt to teach a math course that was hard instead of soft He announced that contrary to the expectations of his colleagues he was not going to teach the Theory of Aggregates nor Stone s Embedding Theorem nor even the Stone ech compactification Several students from the civil engineering department got up and quietly left the room br At the TUG Conference Knuth announced a satirical XML based successor to TeX titled iTeX pronounced i t ks performed with a bell ringing which would support features such as arbitrarily scaled irrational units D printing input from seismographs and heart monitors animation and stereophonic sound br br br Awards and honors br In Knuth received the first ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award He has received various other awards including the Turing Award the National Medal of Science the John von Neumann Medal and the Kyoto Prize br Knuth was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society DFBCS in in recognition of his contributions to the field of computer science br In he was awarded the one of a kind academic title Professor of The Art of Computer Programming the title has since been revised to Professor Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming br Knuth was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in He was also elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in for organizing vast subject areas of computer science so that they are accessible to all segments of the computing community In he became an associate of the French Academy of Sciences Also that year he retired from regular research and teaching at Stanford University in order to finish The Art of Computer Programming He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society ForMemRS in br Knuth was elected as a Fellow first class of Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in for his outstanding contributions to mathematics He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters
