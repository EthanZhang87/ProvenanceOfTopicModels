title: Asymptote (vector graphics language)
id: 3469522
Asymptote is a descriptive vector graphics language developed by Andy Hammerlindl John C Bowman University of Alberta and Tom Prince which provides a natural coordinate based framework for technical drawing Asymptote runs on all major platforms Unix Mac OS Microsoft Windows It is free software available under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License LGPL br br br Syntax and notable features br Asymptote typesets labels and equations with LaTeX producing high quality PostScript PDF SVG or D PRC output It is inspired by MetaPost but has a C like syntax It provides a language for typesetting mathematical figures just as TeX LaTeX provides a language for typesetting equations It is mathematically oriented e g rotation of vectors by complex multiplication and uses the simplex method and deferred drawing to solve overall size constraint issues between fixed sized objects labels and arrowheads and objects that should scale with figure size br Asymptote fully generalizes MetaPost path construction algorithms to three dimensions and compiles commands into virtual machine code for speed without sacrificing portability High level graphics commands are implemented in the Asymptote language itself allowing them to be easily tailored to specific applications It also appears to be the first software package to lift TeX into three dimensions br This allows Asymptote to be used as a D vector file format br Asymptote is also notable for having a graphical interface coded in Python and the Tk widget set xasy py this allows an inexperienced user to quickly draw up objects and save them as asy source code which can then be examined or edited by hand br The program s syntax was originally described by using a Yacc compatible grammar br br br Application examples br The following source code allows you to draw a graph of the Heaviside function by means of the Asymptote language br br The code above yields the following pdf output br br br See also br br GeoGebra free Dynamic Mathematics program with Asymptote export br PSTricks br TikZ br PyX br br br br br br External links br Asymptote vector graphics language on SourceForge br Asymptote official website br Philippe Ivaldi s extensive Asymptote gallery br Asymptote Art of Problem Solving Wiki br An Asymptote Tutorial by Charles Staats
