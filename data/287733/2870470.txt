Bembo is a serif typeface created by the British branch of the Monotype Corporation in and most commonly used for body text It is a member of the old style of serif fonts with its regular or roman style based on a design cut around by Francesco Griffo for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius sometimes generically called the Aldine roman Bembo is named for Manutius s first publication with it a small book by the poet and cleric Pietro Bembo The italic is based on work by Giovanni Antonio Tagliente a calligrapher who worked as a printer in the s after the time of Manutius and Griffo br Monotype created Bembo during a period of renewed interest in the printing of the Italian Renaissance under the influence of Monotype executive and printing historian Stanley Morison It followed a previous more faithful revival of Manutius s work Poliphilus whose reputation it largely eclipsed Monotype also created a second much more eccentric italic for it to the design of calligrapher Alfred Fairbank which also did not receive the same attention as the normal version of Bembo br Since its creation Bembo has enjoyed continuing popularity as an attractive legible book typeface Prominent users of Bembo have included Penguin Books the Everyman s Library series Oxford University Press Cambridge University Press the National Gallery Yale University Press and Edward Tufte Bembo has been released in versions for phototypesetting and in several revivals as digital fonts by Monotype and other companies br br br History br br The regular roman style of Bembo is based on Griffo s typeface for Manutius Griffo sometimes called Francesco da Bologna of Bologna was an engraver who created designs by cutting punches in steel These were used as a master to stamp matrices the moulds used to cast metal type br Manutius at first printed works only in Greek His first printing in the Latin alphabet in February by the Venetian calendar was a book entitled Petri Bembi de Aetna Angelum Chabrielem liber This book usually now called De Aetna was a short page text about a journey to Mount Etna written by the young Italian humanist poet Pietro Bembo who would later become a Cardinal secretary to Pope Leo X and lover of Lucrezia Borgia br Griffo was one of the first punchcutters to fully express the character of the humanist hand that contemporaries preferred for manuscripts of classics and literary texts in distinction to the book hand humanists dismissed as a gothic hand or the everyday chancery hand One of the main characteristics that distinguished Griffo s work from most of the earlier Venetian tradition of roman type by Nicolas Jenson and others is the now normal horizontal cross stroke of the e a letterform which Manutius popularised Modern font designer Robert Slimbach has described Griffo s work as a breakthrough leading to an ideal balance of beauty and functionality as earlier has Harry Carter The type is sometimes known as the Aldine roman after Manutius name br In France his work inspired many French printers and punchcutters such as Robert Estienne and Claude Garamond from onwards even though the typeface of De Aetna with its original capitals was apparently used in only about twelve books between and Historian Beatrice Warde suggested in the s that its influence may have been due to the high quality of printing shown in the original De Aetna volume perhaps created as a small pilot project De Aetna was printed using a mixture of alternate characters perhaps as an experiment which included a lower case p in the same style as the capital letter with a flat top In Griffo recut the capitals changing the appearance of the typeface slightly This version was used to print Manutius famous illustrated volume Hypnerotomachia Poliphili br Griffo s roman typeface with several replacements of the capitals continued to be used by Manutius s company until the s when a refresh of its equipment brought in French typefaces which had been created by Garamond Pierre Haultin and Robert Granjon under its influence UCLA curators who maintain a large collection of Manutius s printing have described this as a wholesale change the press followed precedent popular in France these types rapidly spread over western Europe Ultimately old style fonts like all of these fell out of use with the arrival of the much more geometric Didone types of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries They returned to popularity later in the century with the arrival of the Arts and Crafts movement br In Manutius released the first books printed using italic type again designed by Griffo This was originally not intended as a complementary design as is used today but rather as an alternative more informal typeface suitable for small volumes br br br Italic br Bembo s italic is not based directly on the work of Griffo but on the work of calligrapher and handwriting teacher Giovanni Antonio Tagliente sometimes written Giovannantonio He published a writing manual The True Art of Excellent Writing in Venice in after the time of Manutius and Griffo with engravings and some text set in an italic typeface presumably based on his calligraphy Tagliente did not only publish on handwriting but also self help guides on learning to read arithmetic embroidery and a book of model love letters It too was imitated in France with imitations appearing from onwards Another influential italic type created around this time was that of Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi also a calligrapher who became involved in printing His almost upright italic design was also imitated in France and would also become influential to twentieth century font designs Morison continued to be interested in Tagliente s work and late in life curated a book Splendour of Ornament on Tagliente s decorative pattern designs br br br Monotype history br br Monotype Bembo is one of the most famous revivals of the Aldine typeface of It was created under the influence of Monotype executive and printing historian Stanley Morison by the design team at the Monotype factory in Salfords Surrey south of London While most printers of the Arts and Crafts movement of the previous sixty years had been more interested in the slightly earlier typefaces of Nicolas Jenson Morison greatly admired Aldus Manutius typeface above others of the period The main reasons for his admiration were the balance of the letter construction such as the evenness of the e with a level cross stroke and the way the capitals were made slightly lower than the ascenders of the tallest lower case letters He described the Aldine roman as inspired not by writing but by engraving not script but sculpture His friend printer Giovanni Mardersteig similarly suggested the appeal of the Aldine face in his commentary that Griffo rid himself of the influence of the characteristic round forms of letters written with a pen he developed instead a more narrow and it might be said a more modern form which was better suited to engraving whereas Jenson s style made a strong appeal to the sense of beauty prevalent in the period of Art Nouveau today our taste in architecture and typography inclines towards simpler and more disciplined forms br Bembo s development took place following a series of breakthroughs in printing technology which had occurred over the last fifty years without breaking from the use of metal type Pantograph engraving had allowed punches to be precisely machined from large plan drawings This gave a cleaner result than historic typefaces whose master punches had been hand carved out of steel at the exact size of the desired letter It also allowed rapid development of a large range of sizes In addition hand printing had been superseded by the hot metal typesetting systems of the period of which Monotype s was one of the most popular in competition with that of Linotype s Both allowed metal type to be quickly cast under the control of a keyboard eliminating the need to manually cast metal type and slot it into place into a printing press With no need to keep type in stock just the matrices used to cast the type printers could use a wider range of fonts and there was increasing demand for varied typefaces Artistically meanwhile the preference for using mechanical geometric Didone and modernised old style fonts introduced in the nineteenth century was being displaced by a revival of interest in true old style serif fonts developed before this a change that has proved to be lasting At the same time hot metal typesetting had imposed new restrictions in Monotype s system while less restrictive than Linotype s in order to mechanically count the number of characters that could be fitted on a line letters could only be certain widths and care was needed to produce letters that looked harmonious in spite of this br Morison was interested in the history of the th century Italian printing and had discussed the topic with his correspondent the printer Giovanni Mardersteig in correspondence with whom he wrote a series of letters discussing Bembo s development He also discussed the project in his letters with the Poet Laureate Robert Bridges who had some interest in printing For the project Morison bought a copy of De Aetna which he then sold to Monotype as a model br Bembo s technical production followed Monotype s standard method of the period The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the highly experienced drawing office team led and trained by American engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont and Fritz Stelzer both of whom Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female and in many cases recruited from the local area and the nearby Reigate art school From these drawings Benton pantographs were used to machine metal punches to stamp matrices It was Monotype s standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs from them to test overall balance of colour on the page before completing the remaining characters br Monotype s publicity team described the final italic as fine tranquil in a showing emphasising their desire to avoid a design that seemed too eccentric It was however not the only design considered Morison initially commissioned from the calligrapher Alfred Fairbank a nearly upright italic design based on the work of Arrighi and considered using it as Bembo s companion italic before deciding it was too eccentric for this purpose Monotype ultimately created a more conventional design influenced by Tagliente s typeface and sold Fairbank s design as Bembo Condensed Italic It was digitised as Fairbank in and sold independently of Monotype s Bembo digitisations Morison conceded in his memoir that the Fairbank design looked its best when given sole possession of the page Fairbank later complained that he had not been told that his italic was intended to be a complementary design and that he would have designed it differently if he had been br As was normal in metal type fonts of the period from Monotype and other companies the font was drawn differently at different sizes by modifying Griffo s original single size design a quite large letter at an approximate size of points The changes made were looser spacing higher x height taller lower case letters and a more solid colour of impression at smaller sizes and a finer more graceful and tightly spaced design at large sizes br br br Characteristics br br Among Bembo s more distinctive characteristics the capital Q s tail starts from the glyph s centre the uppercase J has a slight hook and the sides of the M splay outwards slightly The A has a flat top Many lowercase letters show subtle sinuous curves the termination of the arm of both the r and the e flare slightly upward and outward The lowercase c and e push slightly forwards Characters h m and n are not quite vertical on their right hand stems with a subtle curve towards the left going down the stroke In italic the k has an elegantly curved stroke in the lower right and descenders on the p q and y end with a flat horizontal stroke In the s Monotype noted that its features included serifs fine slab fine bracketed and in l c prolonged to right along baseline This meant that many of the serifs especially the horizontals for example on the W are fine lines of quite uniform width rather than forming an obvious curve leading into the main form of the letter The ascenders reach above the cap height br br In metal type Bembo includes two capital R s one with a long extended leg following Griffo s original engraving and another with a more tucked in leg for body text if a printer preferred it br Bembo does not attempt to strictly copy all the features of Renaissance printing instead blending them with a twentieth century sensibility and the expectations of contemporary design An eccentricity of Griffo s first De Aetna capitals was an asymmetrical M that does not seem to have a serif at top right So odd it has been suggested it may have been the result of faulty casting of type it was nonetheless often copied in French imitations by Garamond and his contemporaries The final release of Monotype s revival did not follow this although it was available by special order Monotype also did not copy the curving capital Y used by Manutius in the tradition of the Greek letter upsilon which had been used in some versions of Poliphilus and Blado although not in the digitisation of Poliphilus Nesbitt has described the capitals as a composite design in the spirit of Griffo s type Historian James Mosley reports that other changes from the earliest versions were reduction in the weight of the capitals and alteration of the G by adding the conventional right hand serif and widening the e and suggests that the numerals of Bembo were based on those Monotype had already developed for the typeface Plantin br In the italic the expansive ascenders of Tagliente s type were shortened and the curl to the right replaced with more conventional serifs Monotype also cut italic capitals sloped to match the lower case whereas in the Renaissance italics were used with upright capital letters in the Roman inscriptional tradition The bold Monotype s invention since Griffo and his contemporaries did not use bold type is extremely solid providing a very clear contrast to the regular styles and Monotype also added lining upper case height figures as well as the text figures at lower case height used in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries br Book designer Elizabeth Friedl nder drew some rarely seen swash capitals for Bembo for capital introductions to Churchill s history of the second world war br br br Related fonts br br br Poliphilus and Blado br br Monotype had already designed two other types inspired by the same period of Italian printing and calligraphy the roman Poliphilus and italic Blado both Made more eccentric and irregular than the sleek lines of Bembo to evoke the feel of antique printing these remained in Monotype s catalogue and have been digitised but are much less known today Bembo can therefore be seen as an iteration of a preexisting design concept towards mass market appeal taking the basic idea of the Griffo design and unlike Poliphilus updating its appearance to match the more sophisticated printing possible by the s Bembo s original working name was Poliphilus Modernised br Poliphilus is named after the book Hypnerotomachia Poliphili one of Manutius s most famous books in the Latin alphabet which was printed with the same roman as De Aetna but recut capitals it was made for the Medici Society who planned to create an English translation Blado is named after the printer Antonio Blado a colleague of Arrighi Morison preferred Bembo s roman and was somewhat dismissive of Poliphilus Unlike Bembo both in metal featured a Greek influenced Y with a curving head as in the original br br br Centaur br br Monotype licensed and released the font Centaur around the same time as Bembo It was drawn by the American book designer Bruce Rogers Its roman is based on a slightly earlier period of Italian renaissance printing than Bembo the work of Nicolas Jenson in Venice around Like Bembo its italic by Frederic Warde comes from the s being again loosely based on the work of Arrighi from around Compared to Bembo it is somewhat lighter in structure something particularly true in its digital facsimile Penguin often used it for headings and titles of classic editions particularly its capitals and italic its lower case does not so effectively harmonise with Bembo due to the different letter shapes such as the tilted e br br br Griffo and Dante br Although Bembo went on to dominate British book printing in the twentieth century in the words of John Dreyfus Morison was not entirely satisfied by the way Griffo s roman had been recut feeling that the real charm of the original had not been brought out in the mechanical recutting His friend printer Giovanni Mardersteig made two attempts at designing an alternative revival for use in his fine printing house the Officina Bodoni first in discussion with Morison and cut by hand by punchcutter Charles Malin who some years later had also cut a version of Perpetua for Morison This more delicate Griffo revival was used in handprinting and not developed for use outside Mardersteig s company br In the s Mardersteig developed plans for a second design Dante which was again cut by Malin slowly from onwards but taken also up by Monotype Monotype Dante Series Dante Semi Bold Series and Dante Titling Series were only produced in Didot sizes It was a more eccentric revival of the Aldine face than Bembo it did not attract as much popularity br br br Titling fonts br br Monotype created several titling designs based on Renaissance printing that could be considered complementary to Bembo Bembo Titling based directly on Bembo s capitals but more delicate to suit a larger text size and the more geometric Felix Titling in inspired by humanist capitals drawn by Felice Feliciano in In the hot metal type era Monotype also issued a titling version of Centaur which was often used by Penguin Monotype s digitisations of Centaur do not include it br br br Timeline br br br The Renaissance br br Griffo s roman br Griffo s italic development of italic type follows over the next fifty years br Death of Manutius br Death of Griffo br s

guide for outsourced printing jobs Cambridge University Press s history describes Bembo as one of its most commonly used typefaces Morison was closely connected to Cambridge and his personal archive as well as much of Monotype s went to the university after his death br Among reviews of typefaces writing in the anthology Typographic Specimens The Great Typefaces Jeff Price commented that Bembo became noted for its ability to provide a text that is extremely consistent in colour helping it to remain one of the most popular book types since its release Roger Black commented in For me Bembo is the all time classic roman if I were stuck on a desert island with only one typeface that would be it Digital font designer Nick Shinn has also commented Bembo has a sleek magnificence born of high precision technology at the service of accomplished production skills which honours the spirit of the original and an exotic grace of line which humbles most new designs made more ostensibly for the new technology Oxford University Press editor John Bell also borrowed the name for his set of comic verse lampooning publishing Mutiny on the Bembo br br br Digitisations and derivatives br br br Monotype digitisations br Monotype has released two separate digitisations named Bembo and more recently Bembo Book as well as the more slender caps only display font Bembo Titling and the alternate italic design Fairbank Bembo Book is considered to be superior by being thicker and more suitable for body text as well as for offering the alternate shorter R for better spaced body text br Monotype s original early digitisation of Bembo was widely seen as unsuccessful Two main problems have been cited with it being digitised from drawings it was much lighter in type colour than the original metal type which gained weight through ink spread much reduced on modern printing equipment In addition the digital Bembo was based on the pt metal drawings creating a font with different proportions to the metal type in the point sizes at which Bembo was most often used in books Sebastian Carter has pointed particularly to the M being drawn too wide This made the proportions of the digital font appear wrong failing to match the subtlety of the metal type and phototypesetting release which was released in three different optical sizes for different print sizes Future Monotype executive Akira Kobayashi commented that the original digitisation was a kind of compromise the types that were originally designed for hot metal often looked too light and feeble Bembo Book is more or less what I expected br While Bembo Book is considered the superior digitisation the original continues to offer the advantages of two extra weights semi and extra bold and infant styles with simplified a and g characters resembling handwriting its lighter appearance may also be of use on printing equipment with greater ink spread Cross licensing has meant that it is sold by a range of vendors often at very low prices As an example of this Fontsite obtained the rights to resell a derivative of the original digitisation using the alternative name Borgia and Bergamo upgrading it by additional OpenType features such as small capitals and historical alternative characters Neither version includes digitisations of the larger size versions of Bembo which had a more delicate and elegant design br br br Other Griffo inspired fonts br A major professional competitor to Bembo is Agmena created by Jovica Veljovi and released by Linotype in Intended as a unified serif design supporting Roman Greek and a range of Cyrillic alphabets such as Serbian it features a more calligraphic italic than Bembo with swash capitals and support for Greek ligatures br A looser interpretation of the Griffo designs is Iowan Old Style designed by John Downer and also released by Bitstream With a larger x height taller lower case letters than the print oriented Bembo and influences of signpainting Downer s former profession it was intended to be particularly clear for reading at distance in displays and in signage It is a default font in the Apple Books application br Not explicitly influenced by Bembo but also influenced by Griffo is Minion by Slimbach Released by Adobe a survey ranked it as one of the most popular typefaces used in modern fine printing br Besides designs with similar inspiration a number of unofficial releases and digitisations of Bembo have been made in the phototypesetting and digital periods reflecting the lack of effective intellectual property protection for typefaces Several unofficial versions were released during the phototypesetting period under alternate names for example one unofficial phototypesetting version was named Biretta after the hat worn by Roman Catholic clergy and another by Erhard Kaiser was created for the East German printing concern Typoart outside the reach of Western intellectual property laws In the digital period Rubicon created a version named Bentley intended for small sizes and Bitstream made a version under the name of Aldine Its licensee ParaType later created a set of Cyrillic characters for this in The name Bembo remains a Monotype trademark and may not be used to describe such clones br br br Free and open source fonts br Two open source designs based on Bembo are Cardo and ET Book The Cardo fonts developed by David J Perry for use in classical scholarship and also including Greek and Hebrew are freely available under the SIL Open Font License Unimpressed by the first Bembo digitisation statistician and designer Edward Tufte commissioned an alternative digitisation for his books in a limited range of styles and languages sometimes called ET Bembo He released it publicly as an open source font named ET Book in September br br br Privately used fonts br br Heathrow and other British airports used a highly divergent adaptation of Bembo for many years Designed by Shelley Winters and named BAA Bembo or BAA Sign it was very bold with a high x height br The National Gallery in London used Bembo then its corporate font as a plan for the carving of its name into its frontage br The Yale face developed by Matthew Carter as a corporate font for Yale University is based on Griffo s work Yale commissioned a custom font from Carter a member of the university faculty after being dissatisfied with digital versions of Bembo Carter commented on the design that John Gambell the Yale University printer who initiated and ran the project also liked the idea of an Aldine face Monotype Bembo had been used for University printing at an earlier time so there was a useful precedent It is available exclusively to Yale students employees and authorized contractors for use in Yale publications and communications It may not be used for personal or business purposes and it may not be distributed to non Yale personnel br In the pre digital period IBM offered Aldine a font inspired by Bembo as a font for the IBM Composer This was an ultra premium electric golfball typewriter system intended for producing copy to be photographically enlarged for small scale printing projects or for high quality office documents Ultimately the system proved a transitional product as it was displaced by cheaper phototypesetting and then in the s by word processors and general purpose computers br br br See also br
