Second Life is an online video game that allows people to create an avatar for themselves and then interact with other users and user created content within a multi user online virtual world Developed and owned by the San Francisco based firm Linden Lab and launched on June it saw rapid growth for some years and in it had approximately one million regular users Growth eventually stabilized and by the end of the active user count had declined to between and In many ways Second Life is similar to massively multiplayer online role playing games nevertheless Linden Lab is emphatic that their creation is not a game There is no manufactured conflict no set objective br The virtual world can be accessed freely via Linden Lab s own client software or via alternative third party viewers Second Life users also called residents create virtual representations of themselves called avatars and are able to interact with places objects and other avatars They can explore the world known as the grid meet other residents socialize participate in both individual and group activities build create shop and trade virtual property and services with one another br The platform principally features D based user generated content Second Life also has its own virtual currency the Linden Dollar L which is exchangeable with real world currency Second Life is intended for people ages and over with the exception of year old users who are restricted to the Second Life region of a sponsoring institution e g a school br br br History br br Philip Rosedale formed Linden Lab in with the intention of developing computer hardware to allow people to become immersed in a virtual world In its earliest form the company struggled to produce a commercial version of the hardware known as The Rig which in prototype form was seen as a clunky steel contraption with computer monitors worn on shoulders That vision changed into the software application Linden World in which people participated in task based games and socializing in a three dimensional online environment That effort eventually transformed into the better known user centered Second Life Although he was familiar with the metaverse of Neal Stephenson s novel Snow Crash Rosedale has said that his vision of virtual worlds predates that book and that he conducted early virtual world experiments during his college years at the University of California San Diego where he studied physics br Second Life began to receive significant media attention in and including a cover story in BusinessWeek magazine featuring the virtual world and Second Life avatar Anshe Chung By that time Anshe Chung had become Second Life s poster child and symbol for the economic opportunities that the virtual world offers to its residents At the same time the service saw a period of exponential growth of its user base br One of the principal developers Cory Ondrejka was forced to resign as chief technology officer in December with Rosedale citing irreconcilable differences in the way the company was run Nevertheless the platform continued to grow rapidly and by January residents spent a total of hours inworld and on average residents were logged in at any moment The maximum concurrency number of avatars inworld recorded was set at in the first quarter of br br Second Life was honored at the Technology Engineering Emmy Awards for advancing the development of online sites with user generated content in adding to the media attention Rosedale accepted the award although he had announced plans to step down from his position as Linden Lab CEO and to become chairman of Linden Lab s board of directors instead in March Rosedale announced Mark Kingdon as the new CEO effective May In Kingdon was replaced by Rosedale who took over as interim CEO After four months Rosedale abruptly stepped down from the Interim CEO position It was announced in October that Bob Komin Linden Lab s chief financial officer and chief operating officer would take over the CEO job for the immediate future br With the platform s failure to continue its high rate of growth after Linden Lab announced layoffs of of its workforce in Some million accounts were registered by this point although the company did not make public any statistics regarding actual long term consistent usage and numbers of dormant accounts br Despite speculation as to the actual size of the user base Second Life continued as a commercial success In Second Life users cashed out approximately million US dollars and Second Life had an estimated GDP of million US dollars higher than some small countries br Recognizing improvements in computing power and particularly in computer graphics Linden Lab began work on a successor to Second Life a VR experience called Sansar launching a public beta in July Uptake was low and Linden Lab halted development in to focus their attention fully on Second Life The rights to Sansar s assets were sold to Wookey Search Technologies who are expected to continue development on the title without Linden Lab Second Life the usage of which peaked in the first decade of the st century has been cited as the first example of the metaverse a concept which has been taken up by other major corporations such as Facebook in As a notable precursor which retains a small and loyal following it provides several examples of virtual reality social issues and lessons learned br br br Classification br br During a meeting with investors Rosedale noticed that the participants were particularly responsive to the collaborative creative potential of Second Life As a result the initial objective driven gaming focus of Second Life was shifted to a more user created community driven experience br Second Life s status as a virtual world a computer game or a talker is frequently debated Unlike traditional computer games Second Life does not have a designated objective nor traditional game play mechanics or rules It can also be argued that Second Life is a multi user virtual world because its virtual world facilitates interaction between multiple users As it does not have any stipulated goals it is irrelevant to talk about winning or losing in relation to Second Life Likewise unlike a traditional talker Second Life contains an extensive world that can be explored and interacted with and it can be used purely as a creative tool set if the user so chooses In March while speaking at Google TechTalks Rosedale said So we don t see this as a game We see it as a platform br Second Life used to offer two main grids one for adults and one for teens In August Linden Lab closed the teen grid due to operating costs Since then users and over can sign up for a free account Other limited accounts are available for educators who use Second Life with younger students br There are three activity based classifications called Ratings for sims in Second Life br br General formerly PG no extreme violence or nudity br Moderate formerly Mature some violence swearing adult situations some nudity br Adult may contain overt sexual activity nudity and violence br br br Residents and avatars br br There is no charge for creating a Second Life account or for making use of the world for any period of time Linden Lab reserves the right to charge for the creation of large numbers of multiple accounts for a single person per household per hours but at present does not do so A Premium membership US monthly US quarterly or US annually extends access to an increased level of technical support and also pays an automatic stipend of L week into the member s avatar account and after days that resident will receive a L bonus making it L for that week This amount has decreased since the original stipend of L which is still paid to older accounts Certain accounts created during an earlier period may receive L This stipend if changed into USD means that the actual cost for the benefit of extended tech support for an annual payment of US is only about US depending on the currency exchange rates However the vast majority of casual users of Second Life do not upgrade beyond the free basic account br Avatars may take any form users choose human animal vegetable mineral or a combination thereof or residents may choose to resemble themselves as they are in real life They may choose even more abstract forms given that almost every aspect of an avatar is fully customizable Second Life culture consists of many activities and behaviors that are also present in real life A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes Avatar forms like almost everything else in Second Life can be either created by the user or bought pre made A single person may also have multiple accounts and thus appear to be multiple Residents a person s multiple accounts are referred to as alts br br Avatars can travel via walking running vehicular access flying or teleportation Because Second Life is such a vast virtual world teleportation is used when avatars wish to travel instantly and efficiently Once they reach their destination they may travel in more conventional means at various speeds br Avatars can communicate via local chat group chat global instant messaging known as IM and voice public private and group Chatting is used for localized public conversations between two or more avatars and is visible to any avatar within a given distance IMs are used for private conversations either between two avatars or among the members of a group or even between objects and avatars Unlike chatting IM communication does not depend on the participants being within a certain distance of each other As of version Aug voice chat both local and IM was also available Instant messages may optionally be sent to a Resident s email when the Resident is logged off although message length is limited to bytes br Identities in Second Life can relate to the users personality or creating their own character It is based on their decisions on how to express themselves Most avatars are human but they can choose to be vampires or animals Sometimes what they choose does not relate to their offline selves br In Coming of Age in Second Life An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human anthropologist Tom Boellstorff notes that the interface of Second Life is designed with the purpose of disconnecting a player s virtual identity from their physical identity in mind As of Second Life has made it possible to display one s legal name in the player s profile or as their screen name but when Boellstorff first published the book in users were required to select a last name from a pre determined list of options Boellstorff describes this mentality as being in direct contrast to the one held by other mainstream social media websites where anonymity is shunned and users are encouraged to make the link between their online and physical presence clear br br br Content br br The ability to create content and shape the Second Life world is one of the key features that separate this from online games Built into the software is a D modeling tool based on simple geometric shapes that allows residents to build virtual objects There is also a procedural scripting language Linden Scripting Language which can be used to add interactivity to objects Sculpted prims sculpties D mesh textures for clothing or other objects animations and gestures can be created using external software and imported The Second Life terms of service provide that users retain copyright for any content they create and the server and client provide simple digital rights management DRM functions However Linden Lab changed their terms of service in August to be able to use user generated content for any purpose The new terms of service prevent users from using textures from third party texture services as some of them pointed out explicitly br br br Economy br br Second Life has an internal economy and closed loop virtual token called the Linden dollar L L can be used to buy sell rent or trade land or goods and services with other users The Linden Dollar is a closed loop virtual token for use only within the Second Life platform Linden Dollars have no monetary value and are not redeemable for monetary value from Linden Lab A resident with a surplus of Linden Dollars earned via a Second Life business or experiential play can request to refund their Linden Dollar surplus to PayPal Linden Lab reports that the Second Life economy generated US in economic activity during the month of September and in September Second Life was reported to have a GDP of million In the total size of the Second Life economy grew to US million about of the entire U S virtual goods market Gross resident earnings are US million in growth over In Linden Lab released an info graphic that showed that over years billion in transactions for virtual goods had exchanged between Second Life residents with an average of million daily transactions br There is a high level of entrepreneurial activity in Second Life Residents of Second Life are able to create virtual objects and other content Second Life is unique in that users retain all the rights to their content which means they can use Second Life to distribute and sell their creations with million items listed on its online marketplace At its height circa hundreds of thousands of dollars were changing hands daily as residents created and sold a wide variety of virtual commodities Second Life also quickly became profitable due to the selling and renting of virtual real estate also saw Second Life s first real world millionaire Ailin Graef better known as Anshe Chung her avatar converted an initial investment of US into over one million dollars over the course of two and a half years She built her fortune primarily by buying selling and renting virtual real estate br Major tech corporations have tried to use Second Life to market products or services to Second Life s tech savvy audience IBM for example purchased islands within Second Life for virtual training and simulations of key business processes but has since moved on to other platforms due to maintenance costs Others like musicians podcasters and news organizations including CNET Reuters NPR s The Infinite Mind and the BBC have all had a presence within Second Life br br Virtual goods include buildings vehicles devices of all kinds animations clothing skin hair jewelry flora and fauna and works of art Services include business management entertainment and custom content creation which can be broken up into the following six categories building texturing scripting animating art direction and the position of producer project funder L can be purchased using US dollars and other local currencies on the LindeX exchange provided by Linden Lab Customer USD wallets obtained from Linden Dollar sales on the Lindex are most commonly used to pay Second Life s own subscription and tier fees only a relatively small number of users earn enough profit to request a refund to PayPal According to figures published by Linden Lab about users made a profit in Second Life in February of whom made less than US while made more than US Profits are derived from selling virtual goods renting land and a broad range of services br br br Technology br br Second Life comprises the viewer also known as the client executing on the user s personal computer and several thousand servers operated by Linden Lab br br br Client br Linden Lab provides official viewers for the operating systems Windows macOS and most distributions of Linux where the more known ChromeOS has been excluded so far The viewer renders D graphics using OpenGL technology The viewer source code was released under the GPL in and moved to the LGPL in br There are now several mature third party viewer projects the most popular being Firestorm that contain features not available in the Linden Lab Official client target other platforms or cater to specialist accessibility needs The main focus of third party development is exploring new ideas and working with Linden Lab to deliver new functionality br An independent project libopenmetaverse offers a function library for interacting with Second Life servers libopenmetaverse has been used to create non graphic third party viewers br There are several Alternate Viewers published by Linden Lab used for software testing by volunteers for early access to upcoming projects Some of these clients only function on the beta grid consisting of a limited number of regions running various releases of unstable test server code br br br Server br br Each full region an area of meters in the Second Life grid runs on a single dedicated core of a multi core server Homestead regions share regions per core and Openspace Regions share regions per core running proprietary software on Debian Linux These servers run scripts in the region as well as providing communication between avatars and objects present in the region br Every item in the Second Life universe is referred to as an asset This includes the shapes of basic D polygon objects formally known as Primitive Mesh commonly known as primitives or prims for short the digital images referred to as textures that decorate primitives digitized audio clips avatar shape and appearance avatar skin textures LSL scripts information written on notecards and so on Each asset is referenced with a universally unique identifier or UUID br Assets are stored on Isilon Systems storage clusters comprising all data that has ever been created by anyone who has been in the Second Life world Infrequently used assets are offloaded to S bulk storage As of December the total storage was estimated to consume terabytes of server capacity The asset servers function independently of the region simulators though the region simulators act as a proxy for the client request object data from the asset servers when a new object loads into the simulator Region simulators areas are commonly known as sims by residents br Each server instance runs a physics simulation to manage the collisions and interactions of all objects in that region Objects can be nonphysical and non moving or actively physical and movable Complex shapes may be linked together in groups of up to separate primitives Additionally each player s avatar is treated as a physical object so that it may interact with physical objects in the world As of July Second Life simulators use the Havok physics engine for all in world dynamics This engine is capable of simulating thousands of physical objects at once br Linden Lab pursues the use of open standards technologies and uses free and open source software such as Apache MySQL Squid and Linux The plan is to move everything to open standards by standardizing the Second Life protocol Cory Ondrejka former CTO of Second Life stated in that a while after everything has been standardized both the client and the server will be released as free and open source software br In January Linden Lab completed the migration of all of its services and databases to AWS servers br br br OpenSimulator br br In January OpenSimulator was founded as an open source simulator project The aim of this project is to develop a full open source server software for Second Life clients OpenSIM is BSD Licensed and it is written in C and can run under Mono environment From alternative grids began to emerge and many of these allow cross visits from other grids through the hypergrid protocol using OpenSimulator br br br Applications br br br Arts br br Second Life residents express themselves creatively through virtual world adaptations of art exhibits live music live theater and machinima as well as other art forms br br br Competitive entertainment br A wide variety of recreational activities both competitive and non competitive take place on the Second Life Grid including both traditional sports and video game like scenarios br br br Education br br Second Life is used as a platform for education by many institutions such as colleges universities libraries and government entities Since the University of San Martin de Porres of Peru has been developing Second Life prototypes of Peruvian archeological buildings and training teachers for this new paradigm of education The West Virginia University WVU Department of Special Education has used Second Life widely in education and it provided teaching certification and certificates of degree in seven different distance education programs WVU started a pilot program in the college s computer lab in spring br br br Embassies br br The Maldives was the first country to open an embassy in Second Life The Maldives embassy is located on Second Life s Diplomacy Island where visitors will be able to talk face to face with a computer generated ambassador about visas trade and other issues Diplomacy Island also hosts Diplomatic Museum and Diplomatic Academy The Island is established by DiploFoundation as part of the Virtual Diplomacy Project br In May Sweden became the second country to open an embassy in Second Life Run by the Swedish Institute the embassy serves to promote Sweden s image and culture rather than providing any real or virtual services The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt stated on his blog that he hoped he would get an invitation to the grand opening br In September Publicis Group announced the project of creating a Serbia island as a part of a project Serbia Under Construction The project is officially supported by Ministry of Diaspora of Serbian Government It was stated that the island will feature the Nikola Tesla Museum the Gu a Trumpet Festival and the Exit Festival It was also planned on opening a virtual info terminals of Ministry of Diaspora br On Tuesday December Estonia became the third country to open an embassy in Second Life In September Colombia and Serbia opened embassies As of North Macedonia and the Philippines have opened embassies in the Diplomatic Island of Second Life In Albania opened an embassy in the Nova Bay location SL Israel was inaugurated in January in an effort to showcase Israel to a global audience though without any connection to official Israeli diplomatic channels In Malta opened an embassy on Second Life br br br Religion br br Religious organizations have also begun to open virtual meeting places within Second Life In early LifeChurch tv a Christian church headquartered in Edmond Oklahoma and with eleven campuses in the US created Experience Island and opened its twelfth campus in Second Life In July an Anglican cathedral was established in Second Life Mark Brown the head of the group that built the cathedral noted that there is an interest in what I call depth and a moving away from light fluffy Christianity br The First Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Second Life was established in Services have been held regularly making the FUUCSL Congregation one of the longest running active congregations in Second Life br The Egyptian owned news website Islam Online has purchased land in Second Life to allow Muslims and non Muslims alike to perform the ritual of Hajj in virtual reality form obtaining experience before actually making the pilgrimage to Mecca in person br Second Life also offers several groups that cater to the needs and interests of humanists atheists agnostics and freethinkers One of the most active groups is SL Humanism which has been holding weekly discussion meetings inside Second Life every Sunday since br br br Relationships br Romantic relationships are common in Second Life including some couples who have married online The social engagement offered by the online environment helps those who might be socially isolated In addition sex is often encountered However to access the adult sections requires age verification There are also large BDSM and Gorean communities br br Second Life relationships have been taken from virtual online relationships into personal real world relationships Booperkit Moseley and Shukran Fahid were possibly the first couple to meet in Second Life and then marry in real life Booperkit travelled to the United States to meet Shukran and he returned to England with her after one week They married in had twin boys in and are still married Some couples meet online form friendships and eventually move to finding one another in the real world Some even have their weddings on Second Life as well as in a real world setting Relationships in virtual worlds have an added dimension compared to other social media because avatars give a feeling of proximity making the voyeur experience more intense than simply a textual encounter The complexities of those encounters depend on the engagement levels of the people behind the avatars whether they are engaging disassociatively entertainment only immersively as if the avatar was them or augmentatively meaning they engage for a real life purpose br br br Science br Second Life is used for scientific research collaboration and data visualization Examples include SciLands American Chemical Society s ACS Island Genome Virginia Tech s SLATE and Nature Publishing Group s Elucian Islands Village br br br Social network br Second Life can be a real time immersive social space for people including those with physical or mental disabilities that impair their lives who often find comfort and security interacting through anonymous avatars Some academics believe using Second Life might even help improve motor ability for people with Parkinson s disease br An example of how Second Life has been used by disabled people is Wheelies the widely publicised disability themed virtual nightclub founded by Simon Stevens br br br Music streams br Shoutcast and Icecast radio stations can be streamed into a land parcel in Second Life The streaming codec is MP as AAC and Vorbis are not currently supported There are internet radio providers that offer these services or select from a list At the time of this writing media on a prim MOAP is not a reliable enough way of displaying media and such sites listed work best with Parcel Media or Parcel Audio br br br Work spaces br br Second Life gives companies the option to create virtual workplaces to allow employees to virtually meet hold events practice any kind of corporate communications conduct training sessions in D immersive virtual learning environment simulate business processes and prototype new products br In CEO of Second Life Ebbe Altberg announced a microsite for Second Life to serve as a space for digital meetings to take place amidst global social distancing self isolation and quarantine orders during the COVID pandemic br br br Notable events and influence br br br Second Life movie br In director David Fincher worked with screenwriter Peter Straughan to make a Second Life movie based on Tim Guest s novel Second Lives The movie was rumored to feature Sacha Baron Cohen as protagonist Plastic Duck a zany Second Life resident who drove founder Philip Rosedale bonkers br br br Ban of Woodbury University br br Linden Lab has twice in and banned a California educational institution Woodbury University from having a representation within Second Life On April four simulators belonging to the university were deleted and the accounts of several students and professors terminated according to The Chronicle of Higher Education Edward Clift dean of the School of Media Culture and Design at Woodbury University told The Chronicle of Higher Education that their campus was a living breathing campus in Second Life including educational spaces designed mostly by students such as a mock representation of the former Soviet Union and a replica of the Berlin Wall According to Clift the virtual campus did not conform to what Linden Lab wanted a campus to be br The article in The Chronicle of Higher Education concluded with Meanwhile many people in Second Life expressed on blogs that they were glad to see the virtual campus go arguing that it had been a haven for troublemakers in the virtual world br br br The Alphaville Herald br br In the newspaper The Alphaville Herald founded and edited by the philosopher Peter Ludlow migrated to Second Life and in the following years the newspaper played a prominent role in reporting on Second Life and in the public discussion of the game The newspaper which was known as The Second Life Herald from to was later edited by the Internet pioneer Mark P McCahill According to scholars Constantinescu and Decu The Alphaville Herald was the first virtual free press pioneering mass communication in virtual worlds br br br Virtual Riot br In January a virtual riot erupted between members of the French National Front FN who had established a virtual HQ on Second Life and anti racism activists including Second Life Left Unity a socialist and anti capitalist user group Since then several small Internet based organizations have claimed some responsibility for instigating the riots br br br Marketing br Corporate marketers especially during the height of Second Life in the cultural zeitgeist of have been accused of being overly credulous of the actual reach and influence of Second Life Journalists have theorized this might be partially due to blithely accepting total account statistics rather than harder to discern active player counts Reasons for account inflation can include in world systems which encourage the creation of bogus extra accounts such as traffic bots which simply remain stationary in a store causing the system to rank the store as popular because there are people there as well as simply idle and long inactive accounts One article in Wired featured a marketer for Coca Cola who found Second Life to be essentially deserted when personally inspecting it yet still funded a marketing campaign there anyway from fear of missing out br br br Griefing and denial of service attacks br br Second Life has been attacked several times by groups of residents abusing the creation tools to create objects that harass other users or damage the system This included grey goo objects which infinitely reproduce eventually overwhelming the servers orbiters which throw an avatar so far upwards they cannot get back down in a reasonable timeframe without teleporting cages which surround avatars preventing them from moving and similar tools Although combat between users is sanctioned in certain areas of the world these objects have been used to cause disruption in all areas Attacks on the grid itself such as Grey Goo are strictly forbidden anywhere on the grid It was possible to perpetrate denial of service attacks DoS on other users simply by scripting objects that spew screen filling characters from anywhere on the grid to another avatar s location thereby disabling a clear view to the virtual world Bugs in the client and server software were also exploited by griefers to kick users crash servers and revert content before being patched out br br br The Emerald client and in world logging scripts br The Emerald client was developed by a group of users based on Snowglobe an opensource fork of the Second Life client Several groups alleged that the Emerald viewer contained Trojan code which tracked user details and demographics in a way that the developers could later recover One of these groups was banned from Second Life by Linden Lab after publishing their discovery Shortly afterward a member of the Emerald team was accused of a DDOS attack against another website In response Linden Lab revoked Emerald s third party viewer approval and permanently banned several of Emerald s developers Due to what happened with Emerald Linden Lab instituted a new third party viewer policy br The support staff and one of the developers of the Emerald project who was not banned left to work on a new viewer project Phoenix using some of the Emerald codebase but without Off the Record Messaging nor any potentially malicious code The Phoenix team are now the developers behind Firestorm Viewer a fork of Second Life s viewer open source client br br br Criticism and controversy br Second Life has seen a number of controversies Issues range from the technical budgeting of server resources to moral pornography to legal legal position of the Linden Dollar Bragg v Linden Lab Security issues have also been a concern br br br Regulation br In the past large portions of the Second Life economy consisted of businesses that are regulated or banned Changes to Second Life s terms of service in this regard have largely had the purpose of bringing activity within Second Life into compliance with various international laws even though the person running the business may be in full compliance with the law in their own country br On July Linden Lab announced a ban on in world gambling due to federal and state regulations on Internet gambling that could affect Linden Lab if it was permitted to continue The ban was immediately met with in world protests br In August a in world Linden Dollar bank or Ponzi scheme called Ginko Financial collapsed due to a bank run triggered by Linden Lab s ban on gambling The aftershocks of this collapse caused severe liquidity problems for other virtual Linden Dollar banks which critics had long asserted were scams On Tuesday January Linden Lab announced the upcoming prohibition of payment of fixed interest on cash deposits in unregulated banking activities in world All banks without real world charters closed or converted to virtual joint stock companies by January After the ban a few companies continue to offer non interest bearing deposit accounts to residents such as the e commerce site XStreet which had already adopted a zero interest policy months before the Linden Lab interest ban br br br Technical issues br br Second Life has suffered from difficulties related to system instability These include increased system latency and intermittent client crashes However some faults are caused by the system s use of an asset server cluster on which the actual data governing objects is stored separately from the areas of the world and the avatars that use those objects The communication between the main servers and the asset cluster appears to constitute a bottleneck which frequently causes problems Typically when asset server downtime is announced users are advised not to build manipulate objects or engage in business leaving them with little to do but chat and generally reducing confidence in all businesses on the grid br Another problem is inventory loss in which items in a user s inventory including those which have been paid for can disappear without warning or permanently enter a state where they will fail to appear in world when requested giving an object missing from database error Linden Lab offers no compensation for items that are lost in this way although a policy change instituted in allows accounts to file support tickets when inventory loss occurs Many in world businesses will attempt to compensate for this or restore items although they are under no obligation to do so and not all are able to do so A recent change in how the company handles items which have lost their parent directory means that inventory loss is much less of a problem and resolves faster than in recent years Loss to recovery times have gone from months or never to hours or a day or two for the majority of users but inventory loss does still exist br Second Life functions by streaming all data to the user live over the Internet with minimal local caching of frequently used data The user is expected to have a minimum of kbit s of Internet bandwidth for basic functionality Due to the proprietary communications protocols it is not possible to use a network proxy service to reduce network load when many people are all using the same location such as when used for group activities in a school or business br br br Quality assurance br Criticism of quality assurance of Second Life states that Linden Lab focuses too much on bringing new features to the production environment instead of fixing long standing bugs that in the worst case cause financial loss for the users On April an open letter signed by over users was sent to Linden Lab to protest the quality assurance process of the company Linden Lab has responded to the open letter br br br Frame rate br Computer hardware and Internet connections capable of smoothly rendering high quality content in other MMOGs may perform poorly in Second Life resulting in low frame rates and unresponsive controls on even minimal graphical configurations The problem is especially prevalent when large numbers of avatars congregate in one area The problem is largely due to the fact that the world is entirely user created and the majority of content created by users is made without any sort of basic graphical optimization As a result objects with both unnecessarily high polygon counts and unnecessarily high resolution textures are prevalent It is not uncommon for users to have to download and use upwards of a dozen times the amount of resources than would actually be required for the equivalent visual result Certain areas have guidelines for script usage which helps reduce lag by reducing resources used server side but does nothing to alleviate the primary issue above br br br Congestion br br A single region m of land hosted on a single CPU is set to accommodate a limited number of Residents on mainland regions up to on private islands causing some popular locations such as teleportation points to become inaccessible at times It is possible for an area of land a Resident has paid for to become inaccessible because another area in the same region has exhausted the avatar limit br br br Customer security br On September Linden Lab released a news bulletin that revealed their Second Life database had been compromised and customer information including encrypted passwords and users real names had likely been accessed However it was later revealed that the hacker had in fact been focused on trying to cheat the in world money system and their access to personal information was believed incidental although a full alert was still raised for safety s sake br br br Fraud and intellectual property protection br Although Second Life s client and server incorporate digital rights management technology the visual data of an object must ultimately be sent to the client for it to be drawn thus unofficial third party clients can bypass them One such program CopyBot was developed in as a debugging tool to enable objects to be backed up but was immediately hijacked for use in copying objects additionally programs that generally attack client side processing of data such as GLIntercept can copy certain pieces of data Such use is prohibited under the Second Life TOS and could be prosecuted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act br Linden Lab may ban a user who is observed using CopyBot or a similar client but it will not ban a user simply for uploading or even selling copied content in this case Linden Lab s enforcement of intellectual property law is limited to that required by the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA which used to require a regular mail DMCA complaint However since an electronic DMCA complaint form is also available br A few high profile businesses in Second Life have filed such lawsuits none of the cases filed to date have gone to trial and most have been dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement reached between the parties Another case where settlement and dismissal was gained may be found in the matter of Eros LLC v Linden Research Inc As of October the case was transferred to private mediation and the plaintiffs filed for dismissal of charges on March br Most users in the world as paying private individuals are likewise effectively unprotected Common forms of fraud taking place in world include bogus investment and pyramid schemes fake or hacked vendors and failure to honor land rental agreements br A group of virtual landowners online have filed a class action lawsuit against the company claiming the company broke the law when it rescinded their ownership rights The plaintiffs say a change in the terms of service forced them to either accept new terms that rescinded their virtual property ownership rights or else be locked out of the site br br br OpenSpaces br br Linden Lab for a period offered Openspace regions to users regions which were purchased in packs of four with all four running on a single CPU core intended to be placed next to an existing region to create the effect of larger size The fee for Openspaces was identical to that for a single private region However in March this rule was modified to permit Openspaces to be bought individually and placed elsewhere as well as increasing the prim load each one could handle Openspaces were made available for a US downpayment plus a US monthly fee br In October Linden Lab announced that the Openspaces being used for this purpose were being misused there was in fact no technical throttle limiting their usage Linden Lab raised the monthly fee per Openspace to US the same cost as half a region added an avatar limit of and renamed it to Homestead br A week after the initial announcement Linden Lab stated its intention to add technical limits A revised Openspace product with far fewer prims a no residency rule and costing the same monthly amount was announced br In May Linden Lab announced they were grandfathering Openspace sims now rebranded as Homesteads after a protracted protest movement caused a major amount of negative publicity and funded potential litigation br br br Sex br Some media attention has been given to sexual activity involving avatars with a childlike appearance The United Kingdom and Germany are among the countries investigating new laws to combat simulated child pornography The USA has attempted to pass several laws forbidding simulated child pornography however each one has been struck down by the US Supreme Court as an infringement on the First Amendment right to free speech br As of May two such countries Germany and Belgium have launched a police investigation into age of consent related offenses in Second Life including both trading of non virtual photography and involuntary virtual sexual activity with childlike avatars by means of virtual identity theft Linden Lab responded by issuing a statement that any depiction of sexual or lewd acts involving minors was a bannable offence br In France a conservative family union Familles de France sued Linden Lab in June alleging that Second Life gave minors access to sexual content including bondage zoophilia and scatophilia as well as gambling and advertisements for alcohol drugs or tobacco Linden Lab pointed out that the virtual world is not meant for children people under the age of because of the mature content and interactions within Second Life However minors aged between and can access Second Life but they will be restricted to what they can see or do based on age The Second Life world is split into sections worlds and each one is given a maturity rating similar to films General Moderate and Adult Minors aged can access areas with a General Rating only br Second Life Main Grid regions are rated either General Moderate or Adult previously PG Mature or Adult Builds textures actions animations chat or businesses that are of an adult nature are regulated by the Second Life Terms of Service to only occur in simulators with a Moderate or Adult rating General rated sims exist as an alternative for residents who do not wish to reside in areas where adult oriented activities and businesses are permitted br Linden Lab has created an Adult rated mainland continent named Zindra in response to its other mainland continents being mostly General br br br Unauthorized copying of content br Second Life features a built in digital rights management system that controls the movement of textures sounds scripts and models with the Second Life servers at Linden Lab At some point though this data must be sent to a user s computer to be displayed or played an issue fundamental to any system attempting to apply restrictions to digital information br In November controversy arose over a tool called CopyBot developed as part of libsecondlife and was intended to allow users to legitimately back up their Second Life data For a brief period an unmodified CopyBot allowed any user to replicate SL items or avatars although not scripts which run only on the servers at Linden Lab Later changes to the SecondLife protocols prevented unmodified copies of CopyBot from working Nevertheless the basic issue of users being able to duplicate content that is sent to them remains br Residents who copy content belonging to other users face being banned from Second Life but Linden Lab has so far never sued any of these users for copyright infringement since the resident creators and not Linden Lab retain ownership of the rights it is not clear whether Linden Lab would legally be able to do so Linden Lab does however comply with DMCA takedown notices served to them against resident content serving a DMCA Takedown Notice is the normal procedure recommended by Linden Lab for having copyrighted content illegally resold on Second Life br Any user who uploads publishes or submits any content keeps the intellectual property rights of that content however both Linden Lab and other users gain their own rights from your content Linden Lab receives a content license from anything a user uploads to the server Section of the Second Life terms of service states you hereby automatically grant Linden Lab a non exclusive worldwide royalty free sub license able and transferable licence to use reproduce distribute prepare derivative works of display and perform the content solely for the purpose of providing and promoting the service br A user who uploads their content to a public area also gives a content licence to other users as well which allows other users to replicate and record for use in Machinima as outlined in section Snapshot and Machinima Policy br Regardless of what rights and licences are given Linden Lab takes no responsibility for the outcome of any dispute between users or the server regarding content Section states you release Linden Lab and its officers directors shareholders agents subsidiaries and employees from claims demands losses liabilities and damages actual and consequential of every kind nature known and unknown arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have or claim to have with one or more users including whether or not Linden Lab becomes involved in any resolution or attempted resolution of the dispute Section repeats a similar passage but regarding the responsibility of Linden Lab during any data or technical fault br br br Litigation br br br Bragg v Linden Lab br br In attorney Marc Bragg sued Linden Lab claiming that it had illegally deprived him of access to his account after he discovered a loophole in the online land auction system which allowed regions to be purchased at prices below reserve Although most users and commentators believed that Bragg would have no chance of winning a number of legal developments occurred as a result of the case including a court ruling that parts of the Second Life Terms of Service were unenforceable due to being an unconscionable contract of adhesion The case eventually ended with Bragg s virtual land and account being restored to him in a confidential out of court settlement Since the settlement created no legal precedent it left users with confusion as to what legal rights they truly had with respect to their virtual land items and account Many of Bragg s legal arguments rested on the claim advertised on Linden Lab web site that virtual land within Second Life could be owned by the purchasing user which was removed shortly after the settlement br br br Eros LLC and Grei v Linden Lab br Eros LLC and Shannon Grei brought forth a class action suit in US District Court in Northern California against Linden Research Inc on September Case cv PJH Court papers allege the defendants knowingly and profitably turned a blind eye to copyright and trademark violations within the Second Life service br br br Evans et al v Linden Lab br In a group of banned SL users filed suit against Linden Lab and CEO Philip Rosedale in the same Pennsylvania Federal District Court that the Bragg case was adjudicated in with the same judge to deal with further land seizures and account suspensions by the Lab against various customers Due to the Terms of Service agreement changes since the Bragg case defendants attorneys successfully argued to move the suit to federal court in California where the case lingered for several years The judge did rule that there was a basis to turn the litigation into a class action and that there were two classes under which claimants could file claims The primary class was those who suffered economic damages to their livelihoods through loss of their business revenues in SL The secondary class was those who suffered property losses from loss of land money on hand and virtual goods in avatar inventories In May attorney for defendants negotiated a settlement agreement with one of the lead attorneys that in plain language agreed to refund region setup fees for private island owners pay land owners Linden Dollars per square meter of virtual land refund all L and USD amounts in the plaintiffs accounts at the time of suspension and allow the plaintiffs the option of either receiving US as compensation for loss of accounts and inventory virtual goods OR restoration of their accounts to sell their goods on the SL Marketplace The settlement agreement went to final hearing in March with an objection from claimant Mike Lorrey as to the vagueness of certain terms in the settlement as to which fees exactly would be refunded With the resolution of that objection claimants who had filed claims prior to March began to receive settlement money a few months later br br br In popular culture br Since its debut in Second Life has been referred to by various popular culture media including literature television film and music In addition various personalities in such media have themselves used or employed Second Life for both their own works and for private purposes br In September former Governor of Virginia Mark Warner became the first politician to appear in a MMO when he gave a speech in Second Life Musicians followed suit with Redzone being credited by Wired and Reuters as the first band to tour in Second Life in February Then in June author Charles Stross held a conference in Second Life to promote an upcoming novel Second Life was also featured prominently and used as a tool to locate a suspect in the television show CSI NY in In the American sitcom The Office Dwight Schrute Rainn Wilson is known to play the game most notably in the episode Local Ad br br br Research br br Much of the published research conducted in Second Life is associated with education learning and data collection Unlike computer games Second Life does not have a pre defined purpose and allows for highly realistic enactment of real life activities online One such study tested the usefulness of SL as an action learning environment in a senior course for management information systems students Another presented a case study in which university students were tasked with building an interactive learning experience using SL as a platform Both problem based learning and constructionism acted as framing pedagogies for the task with students working in teams to design and build a learning experience which could be possible in real life br Situated learning has also been examined in SL to determine how the design and social dynamics of the virtual world support as well as constrain various types of learning The paper The future for second life and learning published in the British Journal of Educational Technology examines the potential of Second Life to further innovative learning techniques It notes trends within the SL innovation to date including the provision of realistic settings the exploitation of pleasant simulated environments for groups and the links with other learning technologies It also considers the creativity sparked by SL s potential to offer the illusion of D spaces and buildings and points to infinite imaginative educational possibilities br br Second Life has also offered educational research potential within the medical and healthcare fields Examples include in world research facilities such as the Second Life Medical and Consumer Health Libraries Healthinfo Island funded by a grant from the US National Library of Medicine and VNEC Virtual Neurological Education Centre developed at the University of Plymouth UK br There have also been healthcare related studies done of SL residents Studies show that behaviors from virtual worlds can translate to the real world One survey suggests that users are engaged in a range of health related activities in SL which are potentially impacting real life behaviors br Another focus of SL research has included the relationship of avatars or virtual personas to the real or actual person These studies have included research into social behavior and reported two main implications The first is that SL virtual selves shape users offline attitudes and behavior The research indicated that virtual lives and physical lives are not independent and our appearances and actions have both online and offline consequences The second deals with experimental research and supports the idea that virtual environments such as SL can enable research programs in that people behave in a relatively natural spread of behavioral patterns Remote data collection in SL must take into account issues related to research participant engagement burden and retention as well as accuracy of the data collected br br The SL avatar self relationship was also studied via resident interviews and various enactments of the avatar self relationship were identified The study concluded that SL residents enacted multiple avatar self relationships and cycled through them in quick succession suggesting that these avatar self relationships might be shaped and activated strategically to achieve the desired educational commercial or therapeutic outcomes br Anthropologist Tom Boellstorff describes the anthropological applications of studying Second Life and its userbase in Coming of Age in Second Life An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human Boellstorff explores the relationship between anonymity and community when everyone in a community belongs to varying degrees of anonymity and how this feeds into the idea of digital collectivity He also comments on the phenomenon of data becoming part of social context that has been observed both inside and outside of Second Life as surveillance becomes more integrated into everyday life He stresses the difference between the concepts of anonymity and pseudonymity identifying Second Life users as belonging to the latter group of people though their avatars are not directly linked to their real identities and reputations they have forged new ones in this online space a unique effect of creating an online persona in the digital age br br br See also br Libraries in virtual worlds Second Life libraries br Simulated reality br Social simulation game br Virtual reality br Metaverse br br br br
