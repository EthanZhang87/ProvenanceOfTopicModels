In computing Fudgets is a graphical user interface toolkit for the functional programming language Haskell and the X Window System Fudgets makes it easy to create client server applications that communicate via the Internet br Most of the work on Fudgets was done in by Thomas Hallgren and Magnus Carlsson br The authors claim that many of the advantages of Fudgets come from the fact that they are programmed in a lazy functional programming language br The main entity of toolkit is fudget implemented on low level through stream processors which has its own input and output Fudgets can be composed in parallel or sequence yielding new fudget which can be used in code as any other fudget br br br Example br factorialF stdoutF mapF show factorial read stdinF br factorial Integer Integer br factorial n product n br br The code is self describing considering that is sequential fudget plumbing and mapF is fudget that takes a function of one argument and makes a fudget which output is input applied to that function Note that fudget composition must be read from right to left as a simple function composition Now you can simply write br br main fudlogue factorialF br br compile and run For every given integer value it will print its factorial br br br License br The license of Fudgets claims that this software is free for non commercial use only br br br br br br External links br Fudgets home page latest release marked January br Fudgets Phd thesis by Hallgren and Carlsson
