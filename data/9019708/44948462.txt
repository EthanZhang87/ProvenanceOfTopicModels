Ur also called Ur Web is a multi paradigm high level pure strict functional programming language It is a dialect of the language ML designed for web development created by Adam Chlipala at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that one program can emit code for a server web browser client and SQL specific to a given database backend The full implementation is free and open source software released under an MIT License br Ur has its start and roots in a superseded progenitor language named Laconic Web in br br br Function br Ur supports a powerful kind of metaprogramming based on row data types br Ur Web is Ur plus a special standard library and associated rules for parsing and optimizing Ur Web supports construction of dynamic web pages and applications backed by SQL databases The signature of the standard library is such that well typed Ur Web programs don t go wrong in a very broad sense They do not crash during particular page generations and may not br br Suffer from any kinds of code injection attacks br Return invalid HTML br Contain dead intra application links br Have mismatches between HTML forms and the fields expected by their handlers br Include client side code that makes incorrect assumptions about the Ajax style services that the remote web server provides br Attempt invalid SQL queries br Use improper marshaling or unmarshaling in communication with SQL databases or between web browsers and web servers br This type safety is just the foundation of the Ur Web methodology It is also possible to use metaprogramming to build significant application pieces by analysis of type structure br The Ur Web compiler also produces very efficient object code that does not use garbage collection br SQL syntax templates embedded in the language facilitate the handling of tables br Although the syntax is based on Standard ML the language includes concepts from Haskell with added type manipulation br Ajax call response is serialized through a monad called transaction corresponds to Haskell s input output IO and its marshalling and decoding is encapsulated in the rpc function br The browser client side includes functional reactive programming facilities using the source a type and a signal monad br br br Example program br This is a demo program showing client server and database code with Ajax communication from the web demos with extra comments to outline each of the components br Interface file ML like signature with urs extension br br Implementation file ur extension br br Project file urp extension must contain an optional directive list followed by a listing of project modules br br hash prefixed line comments br rewrite url Module main set root URL to Module main function br exe myexename br database dbname test database attrib and parameters br sql noisy sql br br list stdlib modules prefixed with br module if used by module it must precede it br module main module br br server side page retrieving functions with no side effects http GET method are accessible through a URL as ModulePath functionName they should have type unit transaction page br To export a page which may cause side effects accessible only via HTTP POST include one argument of the page handler of type Basis postBody br Compile br br urweb module looks for module urp br br Execute as a web server other modes are CGI FastCGI br br module exe p h RTS options help br br br Libraries br The predefined API br The standard library br Per feature tests br Ur wiki Libraries and FFI bindings br br br Special features and problems br Record updating br br corresponding signature kind annotations implicit explicit br br Record fields ellipsis br br Error Substitution in constructor is blocked by a too deep unification variable br This error happens with types of arity in nested case or let clauses and disappears by type annotating the variables in the nested clauses br br br See also br Opa a language for combined frontend backend development br br br br br br External links br Official website br Ur Web on GitHub br Ur wiki
