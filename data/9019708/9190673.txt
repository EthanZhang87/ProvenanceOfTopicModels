QuickCheck is a software library specifically a combinator library originally written in the programming language Haskell designed to assist in software testing by generating test cases for test suites an approach known as property testing br br br Software br It is compatible with the compiler Glasgow Haskell Compiler GHC and the interpreter Haskell User s Gofer System Hugs It is free and open source software released under a BSD style license br In QuickCheck assertions are written about logical properties that a function should fulfill Then QuickCheck attempts to generate a test case that falsifies such assertions Once such a test case is found QuickCheck tries to reduce it to a minimal failing subset by removing or simplifying input data that are unneeded to make the test fail br The project began in Besides being used to test regular programs QuickCheck is also useful for building up a functional specification for documenting what functions should be doing and for testing compiler implementations br Re implementations of QuickCheck exist for several languages br br br See also br Metamorphic testing br SPIN model checker br Software testing Property testing br br br br br br Further reading br br br External links br br QuickCheck on Hackage
