Haskell Brooks Curry September September was an American mathematician and logician Curry is best known for his work in combinatory logic whose initial concept is based on a paper by Moses Sch nfinkel for which Curry did much of the development Curry is also known for Curry s paradox and the Curry Howard correspondence Named for him are three programming languages Haskell Brook and Curry and the concept of currying a method to transform functions used in mathematics and computer science br br br Life br Curry was born on September in Millis Massachusetts to Samuel Silas Curry and Anna Baright Curry who ran a school for elocution He entered Harvard University in to study medicine but switched to mathematics before graduating in After two years of graduate work in electrical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT he returned to Harvard to study physics earning a Master of Arts M A in Curry s interest in mathematical logic began during this period when he was introduced to the Principia Mathematica the attempt by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell to ground mathematics in symbolic logic Remaining at Harvard Curry pursued a Doctor of Philosophy Ph D in mathematics While he was directed by George David Birkhoff to work on differential equations his interests continued to shift to logic In while an instructor at Princeton University he discovered the work of Moses Sch nfinkel in combinatory logic Sch nfinkel s work had anticipated much of Curry s own research and as a consequence he moved to University of G ttingen where he could work with Heinrich Behmann and Paul Bernays who were familiar with Sch nfinkel s work Curry was supervised by David Hilbert and worked closely with Bernays receiving a Ph D in with a dissertation on combinatory logic br In before leaving for G ttingen Curry married Mary Virginia Wheatley The couple lived in Germany while Curry completed his dissertation then in moved to State College Pennsylvania where Curry accepted a position at Pennsylvania State College They had two children Anne Wright Curry July and Robert Wheatley Curry July Curry remained at Penn State for the next years He spent one year at University of Chicago in under a National Research Fellowship and one year in at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton In he took a leave of absence to do applied mathematics for the United States government during World War II notably at the Frankford Arsenal Immediately after the war he worked on the ENIAC project in and Under a Fulbright fellowship he collaborated with Robert Feys in Louvain Belgium After retiring from Penn State in Curry accepted a position at the University of Amsterdam In after finishing the second volume of his treatise on the combinatory logic Curry retired from the University of Amsterdam and returned to State College Pennsylvania br Haskell Curry died on September aged in State College Pennsylvania br br br Work br The focus of Curry s work were attempts to show that combinatory logic could provide a foundation for mathematics Towards the end of he learned of the Kleene Rosser paradox from correspondence with John Rosser The paradox developed by Rosser and Stephen Kleene had proved the inconsistency of a number of related formal systems including one proposed by Alonzo Church a system which had the lambda calculus as a consistent subsystem and Curry s own system However unlike Church Kleene and Rosser Curry did not give up on the foundational approach saying that he did not want to run away from paradoxes br By working in the area of Combinatory Logic for his entire career Curry essentially became the founder and biggest name in the field Combinatory logic is the foundation for one style of functional programming language The power and scope of combinatory logic are quite similar to that of the lambda calculus of Church and the latter formalism has tended to predominate in recent decades br In Curry also described one of the first high level programming languages and provided the first description of a procedure to convert a general arithmetic expression into a code for one address computer br He taught at Harvard Princeton and from to at the Pennsylvania State University In he published Curry s paradox In he became professor of logic and its history and philosophy of exact sciences at the University of Amsterdam the successor of Evert Willem Beth br Curry also wrote and taught mathematical logic more generally his teaching in this area culminated in his Foundations of Mathematical Logic His preferred philosophy of mathematics was formalism cf his book following his mentor Hilbert but his writings betray substantial philosophical curiosity and a very open mind about intuitionistic logic
