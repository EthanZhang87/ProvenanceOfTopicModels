RISC OS is a computer operating system originally designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge England First released in it was designed to run on the ARM chipset which Acorn had designed concurrently for use in its new line of Archimedes personal computers RISC OS takes its name from the reduced instruction set computer RISC architecture it supports br Between and RISC OS was included in every ARM based Acorn computer model including the Acorn Archimedes line Acorn s R line with RISC iX as a dual boot option RiscPC A and prototype models such as the Acorn NewsPad and Phoebe computer A version of the OS named NCOS was used in Oracle Corporation s Network Computer and compatible systems br After the break up of Acorn in development of the OS was forked and continued separately by several companies including RISCOS Ltd Pace Micro Technology and Castle Technology Since then it has been bundled with several ARM based desktop computers such as the Iyonix PC and A home As of March the OS remains forked and is independently developed by RISCOS Ltd and the RISC OS Open community br Most recent stable versions run on the ARMv ARMv RiscPC the ARMv Iyonix ARMv Cortex A processors such as that used in the BeagleBoard and Touch Book and Cortex A processors such as that used in the PandaBoard and the low cost educational Raspberry Pi computer SD card images have been released for downloading free of charge to Raspberry Pi users with a full graphical user interface GUI version and a command line interface only version RISC OS Pico at MB br br br History br br The first version of RISC OS was originally released in as Arthur The next version Arthur became RISC OS and was released in April RISC OS was released with the A in and contained many new features By RISC OS had been shipped on over systems br Acorn officially halted work on the OS in January renaming themselves Element In March a new company RISCOS Ltd licensed the rights to develop a desktop version of RISC OS from Element and continued the development of RISC OS releasing it as RISC OS in July Meanwhile Element had also kept a copy of RISC OS in house which they developed into NCOS for use in set top boxes In as part of the acquisition of Acorn Group plc by MSDW Investment RISC OS was sold to Pace Micro Technology who later sold it to Castle Technology Ltd br In May RISCOS Ltd launched RISC OS Select a subscription scheme allowing users access to the latest RISC OS updates These upgrades are released as soft loadable ROM images separate to the ROM where the boot OS is stored and are loaded at boot time Select was shipped in May with Select following in November and the final release of Select in June In the same month RISC OS dubbed RISC OS Adjust was released RISC OS Adjust was a culmination of all the Select Scheme updates to date released as a physical set of replaceable ROMs for the RiscPC and A series of machines br Meanwhile in October Castle Technology released the Acorn clone Iyonix PC This ran a bit in contrast to bit variant of RISC OS named RISC OS RISC OS is a separate evolution of RISC OS based upon the NCOS work done by Pace The following year Castle Technology bought RISC OS from Pace for an undisclosed sum In October Castle announced a shared source license plan managed by RISC OS Open Limited for elements of RISC OS br In October RISC OS was re licensed under the Apache license br In December the source code of RISC OS was leaked to The Pirate Bay br br br Supported hardware br Versions of RISC OS run or have run on the following hardware br br RISC OS Open Limited adopted the even numbers are stable version numbering scheme post version hence some table entries above include two latest releases the last stable one and the more recent development one br A special cut down RISC OS Pico for MiB cards and larger styled to start up like a BBC Micro was released for BASIC s th anniversary br RISC OS has also been used by both Acorn and Pace Micro Technology in various TV connected set top boxes sometimes referred to instead as NCOS br RISC OS can also run on a range of computer system emulators that emulate the earlier Acorn machines listed above br br br Features br br br OS core br The OS is single user and employs cooperative multitasking CMT While most current desktop OSes use preemptive multitasking PMT and multithreading RISC OS remains with a CMT system By many users had called for the OS to migrate to PMT The OS memory protection is not comprehensive br The core of the OS is stored in ROM giving a fast bootup time and safety from operating system corruption RISC OS and are stored in MB of flash memory or as a ROM image on SD Card on single board computers such as the Beagleboard or Raspberry Pi allowing the operating system to be updated without having to replace the ROM chip The OS is made up of several modules These can be added to and replaced including soft loading of modules not present in ROM at run time and on the fly replacement This design has led to OS developers releasing rolling updates to their versions of the OS while third parties are able to write OS replacement modules to add new features OS modules are accessed via software interrupts SWIs similar to system calls in other operating systems br Most of the OS has defined application binary interfaces ABIs to handle filters and vectors The OS provides many ways in which a program can intercept and modify its operation This simplifies the task of modifying its behaviour either in the GUI or deeper As a result there are several third party programs which allow customising the OS look and feel br br br File system br br The file system is volume oriented the top level of the file hierarchy is a volume disc network share prefixed by the file system type To determine file type the OS uses metadata instead of file extensions Colons are used to separate the file system from the rest of the path the root is represented by a dollar sign and directories are separated by a full stop Extensions from foreign file systems are shown using a slash example txt becomes example txt For example ADFS HardDisc is the root of the disc named HardDisc using the Advanced Disc Filing System ADFS file system RISC OS filetypes can be preserved on other systems by appending the hexadecimal type as xxx to filenames When using cross platform software filetypes can be invoked on other systems by naming appending extension to the filename under RISC OS br A file system can present a file of a given type as a volume of its own similar to a loop device The OS refers to this function as an image filing system This allows transparent handling of archives and similar files which appear as directories with some special properties Files inside the image file appear in the hierarchy underneath the parent archive It is not necessary for the archive to contain the data it refers to some symbolic link and network share file systems put a reference inside the image file and go elsewhere for the data br The file system abstraction layer API uses bit file offsets making the largest single file GiB minus byte long However prior to RISC OS the file system abstraction layer and many RISC OS native file systems limited support to bits just under GiB to avoid dealing with apparently negative file extents when expressed in two s complement notation br br br File formats br br The OS uses metadata to distinguish file formats Some common file formats from other systems are mapped to filetypes by the MimeMap module br br br Kernel br The RISC OS kernel is single tasking and controls handling of interrupts DMA services memory allocation and the video display the cooperative multi tasking is provided by the WindowManager module br br br Desktop br The WIMP interface is based on a stacking window manager and incorporates three mouse buttons named Select Menu and Adjust context sensitive menus window order control i e send to back and dynamic window focus a window can have input focus at any position on the stack The icon bar Dock holds icons which represent mounted disc drives RAM discs running applications system utilities and docked files directories or inactive applications These icons have context sensitive menus and support drag and drop operation They represent the running application as a whole irrespective of whether it has open windows br The GUI functions on the concept of files The Filer a spatial file manager displays the contents of a disc Applications are run from the Filer view and files can be dragged to the Filer view from applications to perform saves rather than opening a separate Save dialog box where the user must navigate to a location already visible in the Finder In addition files can be directly transferred between applications by dragging a save icon into another application s window br Application directories are used to store applications The OS differentiates them from normal directories through the use of an exclamation mark also called a pling or shriek prefix Double clicking on such a directory launches the application rather than opening the directory The application s executable files and resources are contained within the directory but normally they remain hidden from the user Because applications are self contained this allows drag and drop installing and removing br The RISC OS Style Guide encourages a consistent look and feel across applications This was introduced in RISC OS and specifies application appearance and behaviour Acorn s own main bundled applications were not updated to comply with the guide until RISCOS Ltd s Select release in br br br Font manager br RISC OS was the first operating system to provide scalable anti aliased fonts Anti aliased fonts were already familiar from Arthur and their presence in RISC OS was confirmed in an early preview featuring in the final RISC OS product launched in April br A new version of the font manager employing new style outline fonts was made available after the release of RISC OS offering full support for the printing of scalable fonts and was provided with Acorn Desktop Publisher It was also made available separately and bundled with other applications This outline font manager provides support for the rendering of font outlines to bitmaps for screen and printer use employing anti aliasing for on screen fonts utilising sub pixel anti aliasing and caching for small font sizes At the time of the introduction of Acorn s outline font manager the developers of rival desktop systems were either contemplating or promising outline font support for still unreleased products such as Macintosh System and OS version br Since in RISC OS it has been possible to use an outline anti aliased font in the WindowManager for UI elements rather than the bitmap system font from previous versions RISC OS does not support Unicode but RISC OS provides a Unicode Font Manager which is able to display Unicode characters and accept text in UTF UTF and UTF Other parts of the RISC OS kernel and core modules support text described in UTF br Support for the characters of RISC OS and some other historic computers was added to Unicode in br br br Bundled applications br br RISC OS is available in several distributions all of which include a small standard set of desktop applications but some of which also include a much wider set of useful programs Some of those richer distributions are freely available some are paid for br br br Backward compatibility br Limited software portability exists with subsequent versions of the OS and hardware Single tasking BBC BASIC applications often require only trivial changes if any Successive OS upgrades have raised more serious issues of backward compatibility for desktop applications and games Applications still being maintained by their author s or others have sometimes historically been amended to provide compatibility br The introduction of the RiscPC in and its later StrongARM upgrade raised issues of incompatible code sequences and proprietary squeezing data compression Patching of applications for the StrongARM was facilitated and Acorn s UnsqueezeAIF software unsqueezed images according to their AIF header The incompatibilities prompted release by The ARM Club of its Game On and StrongGuard software They allowed some formerly incompatible software to run on new and upgraded systems The version of the OS for the A home prevented the running of software without an AIF header in accord with Application Note to stop trashing the desktop br The Iyonix PC RISC OS and A home custom RISC OS saw further software incompatibility because of the deprecated bit addressing modes Most applications under active development have since been rewritten Static code analysis to detect bit only sequences can be undertaken using ARMalyser Its output can be helpful in making bit versions of older applications for which the source code is unavailable Some older bit software can be run without modification using the Aemulor emulator br Additional incompatibilities were introduced with newer ARM cores such as ARMv in the BeagleBoard and ARMv in the Raspberry Pi This includes changes to unaligned memory access in ARMv v and removal of the SWP instructions in ARMv br
