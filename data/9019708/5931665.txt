Bluespec Inc is an American semiconductor tool design company co founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT professor Arvind in June and based in Framingham Massachusetts Arvind had formerly founded Sandburst in which specialized in producing chips for Gigabit Ethernet GE routers for this task br Bluespec has two product lines which are primarily for application specific integrated circuit ASIC and field programmable gate array FPGA hardware designers and architects Bluespec supplies high level synthesis electronic system level ESL logic synthesis with register transfer level RTL The first Bluespec workshop was held on August at MIT br br br Bluespec SystemVerilog br br br Bluespec br br Arvind had developed the Bluespec language named Bluespec SystemVerilog BSV a high level functional programming hardware description programming language which was essentially Haskell extended to handle chip design and electronic design automation in general The main designer and implementor of Bluespec was Lennart Augustsson Bluespec is partially evaluated to convert the Haskell parts and compiled to the term rewriting system TRS It comes with a SystemVerilog frontend BSV is compiled to the Verilog RTL design files br br br Tools br BSV releases are shipped with the following hardware development kit br br BSV compiler br The compiler takes BSV source code as input and generates a hardware description for either Verilog or Bluesim as output It was opensourced by Bluespec inc in under New BSD License terms br Libraries br BSV is shipped with a set programming idioms and hardware structures br Verilog modules br Several primitive BSV elements such as first in first out FIFOs and processor registers are expressed as Verilog primitives br Bluesim br A cycle simulator for BSV designs br Bluetcl br A collection of Tcl extensions scripts and packages to link into a Bluespec design br br br br br Hudak Paul Yale University Hughes John Chalmers University Peyton Jones Simon Microsoft Research Wadler Philip Wadler University of Edinburgh June A history of Haskell being lazy with class HOPL III Proceedings of the third ACM SIGPLAN conference on History of programming languages San Diego California Association for Computing Machinery pp doi it is basically Haskell with some extra syntactic constructs for the term rewriting system TRS that describes what the hardware does The type system has been extended with types of numeric kind br Peyton Jones Simon June A History of Haskell being lazy with class Microsoft Research Report br br br External links br Official website br Bluespec User guide br An open source Bluespec compiler from University of Cambridge
