Paradox is a finite domain model finder for pure first order logic FOL with equality developed by Koen Lindstr m Claessen and Niklas S rensson at the Chalmers University of Technology It can a participate as part of an automated theorem proving system The software is primarily written in the Haskell programming language It is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License and is free br br br Features br The Paradox developers described the software as a Mace style method after the McCune s tool of that name The Paradox introduced new techniques which help to reduce the computational complexity of the model search problem br br term definitions new variable reduction technique br incremental satisfiability checker which works with small domains first then gradually increases the size of the domain reusing the information it obtained from previous failed searches br static symmetry reduction which adds extra constraints br sort inference which works with unsorted problems br Paradox was developed up to version the final version being effective in model finding for Web Ontology Language OWL br br br Competition br Paradox was a division winner in the annual CADE ATP System Competition an annual contest for automated theorem proving in the years to br br br
