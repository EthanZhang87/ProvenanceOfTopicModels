HaXml is a collection of utilities for parsing filtering transforming and generating Extensible Markup Language XML documents using the programming language Haskell br br br Overview br HaXml utilities include br br XML parser br XML validator br a separate error correcting parser for HTML br pretty printers for XML and HTML br stream parser for XML events br translator from DTD to Haskell br translator from XML Schema definitions to Haskell data types br HaXml provides a combinator library with a set of higher order functions which process the XML documents after they are represented using the native Haskell data types The basic data type is Content which represents the document subset of XML br HaXml allows converting XML to Haskell data and vice versa and XML to XML by transforming or filtering The common use of the HaXml s parser includes defining the method of traversing the XML data and it has the CFilter type content filter where type CFilter Content Content It means that this function defined by the user will take a fragment of an XML data and either return more fragments or none at all This approach allows to choose XML elements satisfying certain conditions e g tags with certain name or all children of a specified tag br br br Example br In the chapter Extended Example Web Client Programming of the Real World Haskell by Bryan O Sullivan Don Stewart and John Goerzen the following example is considered The XML file looks like this simplified version br br The following content filter is constructed br br This filter is later used to get the title of the channel br br br br br br External links br Official website
