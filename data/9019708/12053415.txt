Arvind Mithal May June known mononymously as Arvind was an Indian computer scientist the Johnson Professor of Computer Science and Engineering in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory CSAIL at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT He was a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE and the Association for Computing Machinery ACM He was also elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering in for contributions to dataflow and multithread computing and the development of tools for the high level synthesis of digital electronics hardware br br br Career br Arvind s research interests included formal verification of large scale digital systems using guarded atomic actions memory models and cache coherence protocols for parallel computing architectures and programming languages br Past work was instrumental in the development of dynamic dataflow architectures two parallel languages Id and pH and the compiling of such languages on parallel machines br At IIT Kanpur he earned a Bachelor of Science B Sc degree in technology with an emphasis in electrical engineering in In that process he discovered that he was keenly interested in computers Then at the University of Minnesota he earned a Master of Science M Sc in computer science in and a Doctor of Philosophy Ph D in computer science in br Arvind conducted his thesis research in operating systems on mathematical models of program behavior At the University of California Irvine where he taught from to he became interested in computer architecture and programming languages br Arvind taught at IIT s Kanpur campus in and In he joined the MIT faculty He served as the Chief Technical Advisor to the United Nations sponsored Knowledge Based Computer Systems project in India from to During he was the Fujitsu Visiting Professor at the University of Tokyo br In Arvind and his CSAIL team collaborated with Motorola in completing the Monsoon dataflow machine and associated software A dozen Monsoons were installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory and other universities before Monsoon was retired to the Computer History Museum in California In Arvind took two years off from teaching at MIT to build Sandburst Inc a fabless manufacturing semiconductor company He served as its president until his return to MIT in In Sandburst was acquired by Broadcom Corporation br In he cofounded Bluespec Inc headquartered in Waltham Massachusetts They produce proven electronic design automation EDA synthesis toolsets With Lennart Augustsson Arvind codeveloped the programming language Bluespec SystemVerilog BSV a high level functional programming hardware description language which is a Haskell variant extended to handle chip design and electronic design automation in general He also worked with the Bluespec related language Minispec br He served as the General Chair for the International Conference on Supercomputing held in Cambridge Massachusetts in June He has also served as the Engineering and Computer Science Jury Chair for the Infosys Prize from onwards br Arvind was the first to occupy the N Rama Rao Chair in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT He served as chair from to Also during this time he taught a few weeks each semester at the CSE department of IIT Kanpur br Arvind s later research used term rewriting systems TRSs for high level specification and description of architectures and protocols The Computation Structures Group at MIT which he headed uses TRSs to design faster hardware and allow for more exploration of designs br br br Death br Arvind died on June at the age of br br br Published works br Along with R S Nikhil Arvind published the book Implicit parallel programming in pH in pH is a programming language based on Haskell with special support for parallel processing br Among the most significant and or recent articles he authored or co authored that have been published br br James Hoe and Arvind Operation Centric Hardware Descriptions and Synthesis IEEE TCAD September br Hari Balakrishnan Srinivas Devadas Doug Ehlert and Arvind Rate Guarantees and Overload Protection in Input Queued Switches IEEE Infocom March br Dan Rosenband and Arvind Modular Scheduling of Guarded Atomic Actions DAC June br Arvind R S Nikhil Daniel Rosenband and Nirav Dave High level synthesis An Essential Ingredient for Designing Complex ASICs ICCAD November br Arvind also served on the editorial board of several journals including the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing and the Journal of Functional Programming br br br Awards br Arvind received the following awards the IEEE Computer Society Charles Babbage Award Distinguished Alumnus Award I I T Kanpur Distinguished Alumnus Award University of Minnesota and the Outstanding Achievement Award from the University of Minnesota br He was selected as an IEEE Fellow in and an ACM Fellow in He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in and was a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory CSAIL at MIT br br br
