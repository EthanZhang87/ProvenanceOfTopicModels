Usage of the word br The term eponym functions in multiple related ways all based on an explicit relationship between two named things Eponym may refer to a person or less commonly a place or thing

well as to self titled works named after their creators such as the album The Doors by the band the Doors br Walt Disney created the eponymous Walt Disney Company with his name similarly extended to theme parks such as Walt Disney World Medical eponymous terms are often called medical eponyms although that usage is deprecable br br br History br Periods have often been named after a ruler or other influential figure br br One of the first recorded cases of eponymy occurred in the second millennium BC when the Assyrians named each year after a high official limmu br In ancient Greece the eponymous archon was the highest magistrate in classical Athens Eponymous archons served a term of one year which took the name of that particular archon e g BC was named after Solon Later historians provided yet another case of eponymy by referring to the period of fifth century Athens as The Age of Pericles after its most influential statesman Pericles br In Ptolemaic Egypt the head priest of the Cult of Alexander and the Ptolemies was the eponymous priest after whom years were named br The Hebrew Bible explains the origins of peoples through individuals who bear their name Jacob is renamed Israel Gen and his sons or grandsons name the original tribes of Israel while Edomites Gen Moabites and Ammonites Gen Canaanites Gen and other tribes the Kenites named after Cain Cain s life is detailed in Gen are said to be named after other primal ancestors bearing their name In most cases the experiences and behavior of the ancestor is meant to indicate the characteristics of the people who take their name br In ancient Rome one of the two formal ways of indicating a year was to cite the two annual consuls who served in that year For example the year we know as BC would have been described as the consulship of Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus and Gaius Julius Caesar although that specific year was known jocularly as the consulship of Julius and Caesar because of the insignificance of Caesar s counterpart Under the empire the consuls would change as often as every two months but only the two consuls at the beginning of the year would lend their names to that year br During the Christian era itself eponymous many royal households used eponymous dating by regnal years The Roman Catholic Church however eventually used the Anno Domini dating scheme based on the birth of Christ on both the general public and royalty The regnal year standard is still used with respect to statutes and law reports published in some parts of the United Kingdom and in some Commonwealth countries England abandoned this practice in br Government administrations may become referred to eponymously such as Kennedy s Camelot and the Nixon Era br British monarchs have become eponymous throughout the English speaking world for time periods fashions etc Elizabethan Georgian Victorian and Edwardian are examples of these br Trends br br Political trends or movements are often named after a government leader Examples include Jacksonian democracy Stalinism Maoism Obamacare and Thatcherism br br br Other eponyms br In intellectual property law an eponym can refer to a generic trademark or brand name a form of metonymy such as aspirin heroin and thermos in the United States br In geography places and towns can also be given an eponymous name through a relationship to an important figure Peloponnesus for instance was said to derive its name from the Greek hero Pelops In historical times new towns have often been named and older communities renamed after their founders discoverers or notable individuals Examples include Vancouver British Columbia named after explorer George Vancouver and Prince Albert Saskatchewan originally called Isbister s Settlement but renamed after Queen Victoria s husband and consort in br In science and technology br Discoveries and innovations are often named after the discoverer or a figure influential in their advance Examples are the Avogadro constant the Diesel engine meitnerium Alzheimer s disease and the Apgar score For a different view of the process see Stigler s law of eponymy br In biological nomenclature organisms often receive scientific names that honor a person Examples are the plant Linnaea after Carl Linnaeus the baobab Adansonia after Michel Adanson and the moth Caligula after the Roman emperor Caligula br Relatedly biomedical terminology uses many eponymous terms and many also have noneponymous synonyms br Many astronomical objects are named after their discoverer or another person br In art br Plays books and other forms of entertainment may have eponymous names such as the ancient Greek epic The Odyssey derived from its principal character Odysseus and the novel Robinson Crusoe br The term is also used in the music industry usually with regard to record titles where it is prevalent and leads to confusion For example Bad Company s first album was entitled Bad Company and contained a popular song named Bad Company Parodying this the band R E M titled a compilation album Eponymous One especially convoluted case of eponyms is the song Black Sabbath named after the movie Black Sabbath the band that wrote the song changed their name to Black Sabbath and released it on the album Black Sabbath br In tribal antiquity both in ancient Greece and independently among the Hebrews tribes often took the name of a legendary leader as Achaeus for Achaeans or Dorus for Dorians The eponym gave apparent meaning to the mysterious names of tribes and sometimes as in the Sons of Noah provided a primitive attempt at ethnology as well in the genealogical relationships of eponymous originators br br br Orthographic conventions br br br Capitalized versus lowercase br Because proper nouns are capitalized in English the usual default for eponyms is to capitalize the eponymous part of a term When used as proper adjectives they are normally capitalized for example Victorian Shakespearean and Kafkaesque br However some eponymous adjectives and noun adjuncts are nowadays entered in many dictionaries as lowercase when they have evolved a common status no longer deriving their meaning from the proper noun origin For example Herculean when referring to Hercules himself but often herculean when referring to the figurative generalized extension sense and quixotic and diesel engine lowercase only For any given term one dictionary may enter only lowercase or only cap whereas other dictionaries may recognize the capitalized version as a variant either equally common as or less common than the first listed styling marked with labels such as or also often or sometimes The Chicago Manual of Style in its section Words derived from proper names gives some examples of both lowercase and capitalized stylings including a few terms styled both ways and says Authors and editors must decide for themselves but whatever choice is made should be followed consistently throughout a work br When the eponym is used together with a noun the common noun part is not capitalized unless it is part of a title or it is the first word in a sentence For example in Parkinson disease named after James Parkinson Parkinson is capitalized but disease is not In addition the adjectival form where one exists is usually lowercased for medical terms thus parkinsonian although Parkinson disease and gram negative gram positive although Gram stain Uppercase Gram positive or Gram negative however are also commonly used in scientific journal articles and publications In other fields the eponym derivative is commonly capitalized for example Newtonian in physics and Platonic in philosophy however use lowercase platonic when describing love The capitalization is retained after a prefix and hyphen e g non Newtonian br For examples see the comparison table below br br br Genitive versus attributive br English can use either genitive case or attributive position to indicate the adjectival nature of the eponymous part of the term In other words that part may be either possessive or non possessive Thus Parkinson s disease and Parkinson disease are both acceptable Medical dictionaries have been shifting toward nonpossessive styling in recent decades Thus Parkinson disease is more likely to be used in the latest medical literature especially in postprints than Parkinson s disease br br br National varieties of English br American and British English spelling differences may apply to eponyms For example British style would typically be caesarean section which is also found in American medical publications but c sarean section with a ligature is sometimes seen in mostly older British writing and cesarean is preferred by American dictionaries and some American medical works
