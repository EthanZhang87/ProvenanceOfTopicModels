TidalCycles also known as Tidal is a live coding environment which is designed for musical improvisation and composition In particular it is a domain specific language embedded in Haskell and is focused on the generation and manipulation of audiovisual patterns It was originally designed for heavily percussive and polyrhythmic grid based music but it now uses a flexible and functional reactive representation for patterns by using rational time Therefore Tidal may be applied to a wide range of musical styles although its cyclic approach to time means that it affords use in repetitive styles such as Algorave br br br Background br TidalCycles was created by Alex McLean who also coined the term Algorave and is a domain specific language embedded in Haskell which focuses on the generation and manipulation of audiovisual patterns Tidal s representation of rhythm is based on metrical cycles which is inspired by Indian classical music supporting polyrhythmic and polymetric structures using a flexible functional reactive representation for patterns and rational time This programme doesn t produce sound itself but via the SuperCollider sound environment through the SuperDirt framework via MIDI or Open Sound Control br Tidal is also used widely in academic research including representation in music AI as a language in network music and in electronic literature br Tidal is widely used at Algorave algorithmic dance music events as well as being used on high profile music releases It has been featured on BBC Radio s New Music Show br br br Artists using TidalCycles br Richard Devine br Beatrice Dillon br Lil Data br digital selves br MIRI KAT br Daniel M Karlsson br daysofstatic br Benjamin Wynn br Hsien Yu Cheng br br br br br br External links br TidalCycles on GitHub
