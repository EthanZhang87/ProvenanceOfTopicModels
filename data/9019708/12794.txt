title: Gopher (protocol)
id: 12794
The Gopher protocol is a communication protocol designed for distributing searching and retrieving documents in Internet Protocol networks The design of the Gopher protocol and user interface is menu driven and presented an alternative to the World Wide Web in its early stages but ultimately fell into disfavor yielding to Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP The Gopher ecosystem is often regarded as the effective predecessor of the World Wide Web br br br Usage br The Gopher protocol was invented by a team led by Mark P McCahill at the University of Minnesota It offers some features not natively supported by the Web and imposes a much stronger hierarchy on the documents it stores Its text menu interface is well suited to computing environments that rely heavily on remote text oriented computer terminals which were still common at the time of its creation in and the simplicity of its protocol facilitated a wide variety of client implementations More recent Gopher revisions and graphical clients added support for multimedia br br br br br br br Gopher s hierarchical structure provided a platform for the first large scale electronic library connections The Gopher protocol is still in use by enthusiasts and although it has been almost entirely supplanted by the Web a small population of actively maintained servers remains br br br Origins br The Gopher system was released in mid by Mark P McCahill Farhad Anklesaria Paul Lindner Daniel Torrey and Bob Alberti of the University of Minnesota in the United States Its central goals were as stated in RFC br br A file like hierarchical arrangement that would be familiar to users br A simple syntax br A system that can be created quickly and inexpensively br Extensibility of the file system metaphor allowing addition of searches for example br Gopher combines document hierarchies with collections of services including WAIS the Archie and Veronica search engines and gateways to other information systems such as File Transfer Protocol FTP and Usenet br The general interest in campus wide information systems CWISs in higher education at the time and the ease of setup of Gopher servers to create an instant CWIS with links to other sites online directories and resources were the factors contributing to Gopher s rapid adoption br The name was coined by Anklesaria as a play on several meanings of the word gopher The University of Minnesota mascot is the gopher a gofer is an assistant who goes for things and a gopher burrows through the ground to reach a desired location br br br Decline br The World Wide Web was in its infancy in and Gopher services quickly became established By the late s Gopher had ceased expanding Several factors contributed to Gopher s stagnation br br In February the University of Minnesota announced that it would charge licensing fees for the use of its implementation of the Gopher server Users became concerned that fees might also be charged for independent implementations Gopher expansion stagnated to the advantage of the World Wide Web to which CERN disclaimed ownership In September the University of Minnesota re licensed its Gopher software under the GNU General Public License br Gopher client functionality was quickly duplicated by the early Mosaic web browser which subsumed its protocol br Gopher has a more rigid structure than the free form HyperText Markup Language HTML of the Web Every Gopher document has a defined format and type and the typical user navigates through a single server defined menu system to get to a particular document This can be quite different from the way a user finds documents on the Web br Failure to follow the open systems model bad publicity br Gopher remains in active use by its enthusiasts and there have been attempts to revive Gopher on modern platforms and mobile devices One attempt is The Overbite Project which hosts various browser extensions and modern clients br br br Server census br br As of there remained about gopher servers indexed by Veronica reflecting a slow growth from when there were fewer than They are typically infrequently updated On these servers Veronica indexed approximately million unique selectors A handful of new servers were being set up every year by hobbyists with over having been set up and added to Floodgap s list since A snapshot of Gopherspace in circulated on BitTorrent and was still available in Due to the simplicity of the Gopher protocol setting up new servers or adding Gopher support to browsers is often done in a tongue in cheek manner principally on April Fools Day br In November Veronica indexed gopher servers reflecting a small drop from but within these servers Veronica indexed approximately million unique selectors br In March Veronica indexed gopher servers within which it indexed approximately million unique selectors br In March Veronica indexed gopher servers within which it indexed approximately million unique selectors br In May Veronica indexed gopher servers within which it indexed approximately million unique selectors br In May Veronica indexed gopher servers within which it indexed approximately million unique selectors br In January Veronica indexed gopher servers within which it indexed approximately million unique selectors br In February Veronica indexed gopher servers within which it indexed approximately million unique selectors br In February Veronica indexed gopher servers within which it indexed approximately million unique selectors br br br Technical details br The conceptualization of knowledge in Gopher space or a cloud as specific information in a particular file and the prominence of the FTP influenced the technology and the resulting functionality of Gopher br br br Gopher characteristics br Gopher is designed to function and to appear much like a mountable read only global network file system and software such as gopherfs is available that can actually mount a Gopher server as a FUSE resource At a minimum whatever can be done with data files on a CD ROM can be done on Gopher br A Gopher system consists of a series of hierarchical hyperlinkable menus The choice of menu items and titles is controlled by the administrator of the server br Similar to a file on a Web server a file on a Gopher server can be linked to as a menu item from any other Gopher server Many servers take advantage of this inter server linking to provide a directory of other servers that the user can access br br br Protocol br The Gopher protocol was first described in RFC Internet Assigned Numbers Authority IANA has assigned Transmission Control Protocol TCP port to the Gopher protocol The protocol is simple to negotiate making it possible to browse without using a client br br br User request br First the client establishes a TCP connection with the server on port the standard gopher port The client then sends a string followed by a carriage return followed by a line feed a CR LF sequence This is the selector which identifies the document to be retrieved If the item selector were an empty line the default directory would be selected br br br Server response br The server then replies with the requested item and closes the connection According to the protocol before the connection closes the server should send a full stop i e a period character on a line by itself However not all servers conform to this part of the protocol and the server may close a connection without returning a final full stop The main type of reply from the server is a text or binary resource Alternatively the resource can be a menu a form of structured text resource providing references to other resources br Because of the simplicity of the Gopher protocol tools such as netcat make it possible to download Gopher content easily from a command line br br The protocol is also supported by cURL as of DEV br br br Search request br The selector string in the request can optionally be followed by a tab character and a search string This is used by item type br br br Source code of a menu br Gopher menu items are defined by lines of tab separated values in a text file This file is sometimes called a gophermap As the source code to a gopher menu a gophermap is roughly analogous to an HTML file for a web page Each tab separated line called a selector line gives the client software a description of the menu item what it is what it is called and where it leads to The client displays the menu items in the order that they appear in the gophermap br The first character in a selector line indicates the item type which tells the client what kind of file or protocol the menu item points to This helps the client decide what to do with it Gopher s item types are a more basic precursor to the media type system used by the Web and email attachments br The item type is followed by the user display string a description or label that represents the item in the menu the selector a path or other string for the resource on the server the hostname the domain name or IP address of the server and the network port br All lines in a gopher menu are terminated by CR LF br Example of a selector line in a menu source The following selector line generates a link to the home directory at the subdomain gopher floodgap com on port The item type of indicates that the linked resource is a Gopher menu itself The string Floodgap Home is what the client will show to the user when visiting the example menu br br Floodgap Home home gopher floodgap com br br br Item types br In a Gopher menu s source code a one character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect This code may either be a digit or a letter of the alphabet letters are case sensitive br The technical specification for Gopher RFC defines item types The later gopher specification defined an additional types A one character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect Item type is an error code for exception handling Gopher client authors improvised item types h HTML i informational message and s sound file after the publication of RFC Browsers like Netscape Navigator and early versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer would prepend the item type code to the selector as described in RFC so that the type of the gopher item could be determined by the url itself Most gopher browsers still available use these prefixes in their urls br br Here is an example gopher session where the user requires a gopher menu Reference on the first line br br

of which describes an item that can be retrieved Most clients will display these as hypertext links and so allow the user to navigate through gopherspace by following the links br This menu includes a text resource itemtype on the third line multiple links to submenus itemtype on the second line as well as lines and a non standard information message from line on broken down to multiple lines by providing dummy values for selector host and port br br br External links br Historically to create a link to a Web server GET was used as a pseudo selector to emulate an HTTP GET request John Goerzen created an addition to the Gopher protocol commonly referred to as URL links that allows links to any protocol that supports URLs For example to create a link to http gopher quux org the item type is h the display string is the title of the link the item selector is URL http gopher quux org and the domain and port are that of the originating Gopher server so that clients that do not support URL links will query the server and receive an HTML redirection page br br br Gopher br Gopher is a forward compatible enhancement to the Gopher protocol Gopher works by sending metadata between the client and the server The enhancement was never widely adopted by Gopher servers br The client sends a tab followed by a A Gopher server will respond with a status line followed by the content the client requested An item is marked as supporting Gopher in the Gopher directory listing by a tab after the port this is the case of some of the items in the example above br Other features of Gopher include br br Item attributes which can include the items br Administrator br Last date of modification br Different views of the file like PostScript or plain text or different languages br Abstract

personal digital assistants PDAs the early s saw a renewed interest in native Gopher clients for popular smartphones br Gopher popularity was at its height at a time when there were still many equally competing computer architectures and operating systems As a result there are several Gopher clients available for Acorn RISC OS AmigaOS Atari MiNT Conversational Monitor System CMS DOS classic Mac OS
