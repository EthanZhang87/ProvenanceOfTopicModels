title: Cardano (blockchain platform)
id: 52920286
Cardano is a public blockchain platform It is open source and decentralized with consensus achieved using proof of stake It can facilitate peer to peer transactions with its internal cryptocurrency ADA br Cardano s development began in led by Ethereum co founder Charles Hoskinson The project is overseen and supervised by the Cardano Foundation based in Zug Switzerland When launched in it was the largest cryptocurrency to use a proof of stake blockchain which is seen as a greener alternative to proof of work protocols br br br History br After leaving Ethereum in Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood set out their plans for Cardano in Hoskinson had left Ethereum after a dispute with another co founder Vitalik Buterin Hoskinson wanted to accept venture capital and create a company while Buterin wanted to keep it as a nonprofit organization Woods and Hoskinson co founded the business IOHK to develop blockchains for use by corporations governments and education institutions br Cardano was initially released to the public in That year IOHK partnered with the University of Edinburgh to launch the Blockchain Technology Laboratory The lab had six post doctoral and professorial positions with up to jobs created in total and was led by Aggelos Kiayias developer of the Ouroboros protocol br Cardano reached a market cap of billion in May which was the fourth highest for a cryptocurrency at that time br Advertising agency MBLM ranked Cardano th for brand intimacy out of brands in August in between Ford and Nestl and the highest rank for a cryptocurrency Citing an MBLM partner advertising industry magazine Ad Age said Cardano s high ranking can likely be chalked up to the gambling element of crypto br br br Design br br br Governance br Cardano is controlled by three entities br br Cardano foundation aims to standardize and promote the ecosystem based in Switzerland br IOHK an engineering company responsible for building the Cardano blockchain br Emurgo responsible for commercial applications br As of Frederik Gregaard is known to be the CEO of the Cardano Foundation br The platform is named after Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano while the cryptocurrency itself is named after the English mathematician Ada Lovelace The Ada sub unit is the Lovelace one Ada Lovelaces Cardano is focused on scientific research with universities br br br Technical design br Atypically Cardano does not have a white paper Instead it uses design principles intended to overcome issues such as scalability interoperability and a lack of regulatory compliance faced by earlier cryptocurrencies Cardano claims that it overcomes problems found in other cryptocurrencies mainly that Bitcoin is too slow and inflexible and that Ethereum is not safe or scalable Like Bitcoin Cardano uses a UTXO ledger model though it is an extended version EUTXO to facilitate smart contracts and scripting languages br Cardano uses a proof of stake PoS protocol named Ouroboros this was in contrast to Bitcoin and Ethereum which used proof of work protocols though the latter switched over in Proof of stake blockchains use far less energy than proof of work chains This is achieved by eliminating the computing resources that a proof of work algorithm requires In February Hoskinson estimated the Cardano network used GWh annually less than of the TWh used by the Bitcoin network as calculated by the University of Cambridge br br Within the Cardano platform Ada exists on the settlement layer This layer keeps track of transactions The second layer is the computation layer and is designed to be similar to Ethereum enabling smart contracts and applications to run on the platform Like other cryptocurrencies Ada ADA can be stored on a digital wallet Cardano s native digital wallet is named Daedalus The Daedalus wallet downloads a full copy of the entire transaction history of the Cardano blockchain Wallet users face the risk of losing access to funds if the wallet s seed phrase is lost or stolen br Development phases of Cardano or eras are named after notable figures in poetry and computer science Byron Shelley Goguen Basho and Voltaire The first three stages implemented a basic blockchain and then implemented decentralisation and smart contracts The Basho era focuses on scaling the blockchain Voltaire the final era adds voting and treasury management functionality to the blockchain br Once Voltaire is complete IOHK has said it plans to release the development of the network entirely to the community The Cardano improvement proposal CIP is the first step towards on chain governance It intends to allow ADA token holders to create proposals that may be voted upon by the community and if successful implemented br As with other proof of stake cryptocurrencies Cardano offers staking which allows token holders to set aside delegate tokens to potentially validate transactions on the same blockchain Figure The quantity of tokens staked corresponds with the likelihood of being chosen to validate a transaction and thus be rewarded by the algorithm with more of the same token Cardano s Daedalus wallet allows for staking For Cardano users participate in staking pools with other token holders br br br Applications br br Applications of the Cardano blockchain include br br In IOHK signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Ethiopia to consider the use of Cardano in its coffee supply chain The partnership with the Ethiopian government also investigate other ways to deploy Cardano in the country br In the Ministry of Education in the country of Georgia signed a memorandum of understanding with the Free University of Tbilisi to use Cardano and Atala IOHK s decentralized identity software to build a credential verification system for Georgia br In New Balance announced a pilot program on the Cardano blockchain so buyers could track the authenticity of OMN S Kawhi Leonard basketball shoes br In April IOHK and the Ethiopia Ministry of Education announced plans for an identity and record keeping system on Cardano and Atala for the country s five million school pupils br In Hoskinson began working with electronic dance music DJ Paul Oakenfold to release an album Zombie Lobster on the Cardano blockchain br In IOHK and Dish Network announced a collaboration to investigate the use of distributed ledger technology br The Cardano blockchain was cited in Quartz as having the potential to help citizens in Zanzibar Ethiopia and Burundi get digital IDs br World Mobile Token WMT a project built on Cardano offers remote mobile network access in Africa with approximately nodes in East Africa Mark Cuban is cited as being skeptical about the project and Cardano adoption br In a Ghanaian startup named Mazzuma received funding from the Adaverse a Cardano ecosystem accelerator MassumaGPT aims to use AI in its contract creation platform br br br Decentralized finance br Cardano implemented decentralized finance DeFi services on September including an upgrade to enable smart contracts and the ability to build decentralized applications DApps Also included is Plutus a smart contract language written in Haskell and Marlowe a domain specific language designed by Simon Thompson for non programmers in the financial sector br br br Partner chains br In November Cardano began introducing sidechains referred to by the project as partner chains Sidechains are intended to perform off chain computations known as smart contracts while using the Cardano network for settlement The first example of such a chain named Midnight will make use of the Polkadot framework in combination with Cardano br br br Non fungible tokens NFTs br br Cardano also enables creating non fungible tokens NFTs Snoop Dogg released several thousand NFTs in a project named Baked Nation for the Cardano chain in April In a digital artist from the UK sold individual works of humanoid deer for almost on Cardano br br br Legal status and regulation br In the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC a US regulator issued a complaint against the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for offering unregistered securities in violation of the Securities Act and promising returns on investment for staking in multiple proof of stake cryptocurrencies including Cardano Without any admission of wrongdoing Kraken agreed to pay a fine of million and halt its staking program in response br In June the SEC sued Binance Among the allegations was that Cardano was a security and so the cryptocurrency exchange was trading illegally in the US IOG responded that the filing was inaccurate and that Ada was not a security Robinhood Markets said it would remove Cardano and two other proof of stake coins from its platform The Ada price fell from to in a day on the FT Wilshire index Both the Wall Street Journal and The Times linked a fall in the price of Cardano per cent in June and a slide for other major coins to the SEC s actions br br br br br br External links br Official website
