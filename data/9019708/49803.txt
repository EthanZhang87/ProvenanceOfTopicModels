title: IBM PCâ€“compatible
id: 49803
IBM PC compatible computers are technically similar to the original IBM PC XT and AT all from computer giant IBM that are able to use the same software and expansion cards Such computers were referred to as PC clones IBM clones or IBM PC clones The term IBM PC compatible is now a historical description only since IBM no longer sells personal computers after it sold its personal computer division in to Chinese technology company Lenovo The designation PC as used in much of personal computer history has not meant personal computer generally but rather an x computer capable of running the same software that a contemporary IBM PC could The term was initially in contrast to the variety of home computer systems available in the early s such as the Apple II TRS and Commodore Later the term was primarily used in contrast to Apple s Macintosh computers br These clones duplicated almost all the significant features of the original IBM PC architectures This was facilitated by IBM s choice of commodity hardware components which were cheap and by various manufacturers ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a clean room design technique Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer the MPC by a clean room reverse engineered implementation of its BIOS Other rival companies Corona Data Systems Eagle Computer and the Handwell Corporation were threatened with legal action by IBM who settled with them Soon after in Compaq released the very successful Compaq Portable also with a clean room reverse engineered BIOS and also not challenged legally by IBM br Early IBM PC compatibles used the same computer buses as their IBM counterparts switching from the bit IBM PC and XT bus to the bit IBM AT bus with the release of the AT IBM s introduction of the proprietary Micro Channel architecture MCA in its PS series resulted in the establishment of the Extended Industry Standard Architecture bus open standard by a consortium of IBM PC compatible vendors redefining the bit IBM AT bus as the Industry Standard Architecture ISA bus Additional bus standards were subsequently adopted to improve compatibility between IBM PC compatibles including the VESA Local Bus VLB Peripheral Component Interconnect PCI and the Accelerated Graphics Port AGP br Descendants of the x IBM PC compatibles namely bit computers based on x AMD chips comprise the majority of desktop computers on the market as of with the dominant operating system being Microsoft Windows Interoperability with the bus structure and peripherals of the original PC architecture may be limited or non existent Many modern computers are unable to use old software or hardware that depends on portions of the IBM PC compatible architecture which are missing or do not have equivalents in modern computers For example computers which boot using Unified Extensible Firmware Interface based firmware that lack a Compatibility Support Module or CSM required to emulate the old BIOS based firmware interface or have their CSMs disabled cannot natively run MS DOS since MS DOS depends on a BIOS interface to boot br Only the Macintosh had kept significant market share without having compatibility with the IBM PC although that changed during the Intel Macs era running Mac OS X often dual booting Windows with Boot Camp br br IBM decided in to market a low cost single user computer as quickly as possible On August the first IBM PC went on sale There were three operating systems OS available for it The least expensive and most popular was PC DOS made by Microsoft In a crucial concession IBM s agreement allowed Microsoft to sell its own version MS DOS for non IBM computers The only component of the original PC architecture exclusive to IBM was the BIOS Basic Input Output System br IBM at first asked developers to avoid writing software that addressed the computer s hardware directly and to instead make standard calls to BIOS functions that carried out hardware dependent operations This software would run on any machine using MS DOS or PC DOS Software that directly addressed the hardware instead of making standard calls was faster however this was particularly relevant to games Software addressing IBM PC hardware in this way would not run on MS DOS machines with different hardware for example the PC The IBM PC was sold in high enough volumes to justify writing software specifically for it and this encouraged other manufacturers to produce machines that could use the same programs expansion cards and peripherals as the PC The x computer marketplace rapidly excluded all machines which were not hardware compatible or software compatible with the PC The KB barrier on conventional system memory available to MS DOS is a legacy of that period other non clone machines while subject to a limit could exceed KB br Rumors of lookalike compatible computers created without IBM s approval began almost immediately after the IBM PC s release InfoWorld wrote on the first anniversary of the IBM PC that br br The dark side of an open system is its imitators If the specs are clear enough for you to design peripherals they are clear enough for you to design imitations Apple has patents on two important components of its systems IBM which reportedly has no special patents on the PC is even more vulnerable Numerous PC compatible machines the grapevine says or more have begun to appear in the marketplace br By June PC Magazine defined PC clone as a computer that can accommodate the user who takes a disk home from an IBM PC walks across the room and plugs it into the foreign machine Because of a shortage of IBM PCs that year many customers purchased clones instead Columbia Data Products produced the first computer more or less compatible with the IBM PC standard during June soon followed by Eagle Computer Compaq announced its first product an IBM PC compatible in November the Compaq Portable The Compaq was the first sewing machine sized portable computer that was essentially PC compatible The court decision in Apple v Franklin was that BIOS code was protected by copyright law but it could reverse engineer the IBM BIOS and then write its own BIOS using clean room design Note this was over a year after Compaq released the Portable The money and research put into reverse engineering the BIOS was a calculated risk br br At the same time many manufacturers such as Tandy RadioShack Xerox Hewlett Packard Digital Equipment Corporation Sanyo Texas Instruments Tulip Wang and Olivetti introduced personal computers that supported MS DOS but were not completely software or hardware compatible with the IBM PC br Tandy described the Tandy for example as having a next generation true bit CPU and with More speed More disk storage More expansion than the IBM PC or other MS DOS computers While admitting in that many PC DOS programs did not work on the computer the company stated that the most popular sophisticated software on the market was available either immediately or over the next six months br Like IBM Microsoft s apparent intention was that application writers would write to the application programming interfaces in MS DOS or the firmware BIOS and that this would form what would now be termed a hardware abstraction layer Each computer would have its own Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM version of MS DOS customized to its hardware Any software written for MS DOS would operate on any MS DOS computer despite variations in hardware design br This expectation seemed reasonable in the computer marketplace of the time Until then Microsoft s business was based primarily on computer languages such as BASIC The established small system operating software was CP M from Digital Research which was in use both at the hobbyist level and by the more professional of those using microcomputers To achieve such widespread use and thus make the product viable economically the OS had to operate across a range of machines from different vendors that had widely varying hardware Those customers who needed other applications than the starter programs could reasonably expect publishers to offer their products for a variety of computers on suitable media for each br Microsoft s competing OS was intended initially to operate on a similar varied spectrum of hardware although all based on the processor Thus MS DOS was for several years sold only as an OEM product There was no Microsoft branded MS DOS MS DOS could not be purchased directly from Microsoft and each OEM release was packaged with the trade dress of the given PC vendor Malfunctions were to be reported to the OEM not to Microsoft However as machines that were compatible with IBM hardware thus supporting direct calls to the hardware became widespread it soon became clear that the OEM versions of MS DOS were virtually identical except perhaps for the provision of a few utility programs br MS DOS provided adequate functionality for character oriented applications such as those that could have been implemented on a text only terminal Had the bulk of commercially important software been of this nature low level hardware compatibility might not have mattered However in order to provide maximum performance and leverage hardware features or work around hardware bugs PC applications quickly developed beyond the simple terminal applications that MS DOS supported directly Spreadsheets WYSIWYG word processors presentation software and remote communication software established new markets that exploited the PC s strengths but required capabilities beyond what MS DOS provided Thus from very early in the development of the MS DOS software environment many significant commercial software products were written directly to the hardware for a variety of reasons br br MS DOS itself did not provide any way to position the text cursor other than to advance it after displaying each letter teletype mode While the BIOS video interface routines were adequate for rudimentary output they were necessarily less efficient than direct hardware addressing as they added extra processing they did not have string output but only character by character teletype output and they inserted delays to prevent CGA hardware snow a display artifact of CGA cards produced when writing directly to screen memory an especially bad artifact since they were called by IRQs thus making multitasking very difficult A program that wrote directly to video memory could achieve output rates to times faster than making system calls Turbo Pascal used this technique from its earliest versions br Graphics capability was not taken seriously in the original IBM design brief graphics were considered only from the perspective of generating static business graphics such as charts and graphs MS DOS did not have an API for graphics and the BIOS only included the rudimentary graphics functions such as changing screen modes and plotting single points To make a BIOS call for every point drawn or modified increased overhead considerably making the BIOS interface notoriously slow Because of this line drawing arc drawing and blitting had to be performed by the application to achieve acceptable speed which was usually done by bypassing the BIOS and accessing video memory directly Software written to address IBM PC hardware directly would run on any IBM clone but would have to be rewritten especially for each non PC compatible MS DOS machine br Video games even early ones mostly required a true graphics mode They also performed any machine dependent trick the programmers could think of in order to gain speed Though initially the major market for the PC was for business applications games capability became an important factor motivating PC purchases as prices decreased The availability and quality of games could mean the difference between the purchase of a PC compatible or a different platform with the ability to exchange data like the Amiga br Communications software directly accessed the UART serial port chip because the MS DOS API and the BIOS did not provide full support and was too slow to keep up with hardware which could transfer data at bit s br Even for standard business applications speed of execution was a significant competitive advantage Integrated software Context MBA preceded Lotus to market and included more functions Context MBA was written in UCSD p System making it very portable but too slow to be truly usable on a PC was written in x assembly language and performed some machine dependent tricks It was so much faster that it quickly surpassed Context MBA s sales br Disk copy protection schemes in common use at the time worked by reading nonstandard data patterns on the diskette to verify originality These patterns were impossible to detect using standard DOS or BIOS calls so direct access to the disk controller hardware was necessary for the protection to work br Some software was designed to run only on a true IBM PC and checked for an actual IBM BIOS br br The first thing to think about when considering an IBM compatible computer is How compatible is it br In May Future Computing defined four levels of compatibility br br Operationally Compatible Can run the top selling IBM PC software use PC expansion boards and read and write PC disks Has complementary features like portability or lower price that distinguish computer from the PC which is sold in the same store Examples Best Columbia Data Products Compaq Better Corona Good Eagle br Functionally Compatible Runs own version of popular PC software Cannot use PC expansion boards but can read and write PC disks Cannot become Operationally Compatible Example TI Professional br Data Compatible May not run top PC software Can read and or write PC disks Can become Functionally Compatible Examples NCR Decision Mate Olivetti M Wang PC Zenith Z br Incompatible Cannot read PC disks Can become Data Compatible Examples Altos DEC Rainbow Grid Compass Victor br br During development Compaq engineers found that Microsoft Flight Simulator would not run because of what subLOGIC s Bruce Artwick described as a bug in one of Intel s chips forcing them to make their new computer bug compatible with the IBM PC At first few clones other than Compaq s offered truly full compatibility Jerry Pournelle purchased an IBM PC in mid rotten keyboard and all because he had four cubic feet of unevaluated software much of which won t run on anything but an IBM PC Although a lot of machines claim to be percent IBM PC compatible I ve yet to have one arrive Alas a lot of stuff doesn t run with Eagle Z Compupro or anything else we have around here Columbia Data Products s November sales brochure stated that during tests with retail purchased computers in October its own and Compaq s products were compatible with all tested PC software while Corona and Eagle s were less compatible Columbia University reported in January that Kermit ran without modification on Compaq and Columbia Data Products clones but not on those from Eagle or Seequa Other MS DOS computers also required custom code br By December Future Computing stated that companies like Compaq Columbia Data Products and Corona that emphasized IBM PC compatibility had been successful while non compatible computers had hurt the reputations of others like TI and DEC despite superior technology At a San Francisco meeting it warned attendees from many American and foreign computer companies as well as IBM itself to Jump on the IBM PC compatible bandwagon quickly and as compatibly as possible Future Computing said in February that some computers were press release compatible exaggerating their actual compatibility with the IBM PC Many companies were reluctant to have their products PC compatibility tested When PC Magazine requested samples from computer manufacturers that claimed to produce compatibles for an April review of declined Corona Data Systems specified that Our systems run all software that conforms to IBM PC programming standards And the most popular software does When a BYTE journalist asked to test Peachtext at the Spring COMDEX Corona representatives hemmed and hawed a bit but they finally led me off in the corner where no one would see it should it fail The magazine reported that Their hesitancy was unnecessary The disk booted up without a problem Zenith Data Systems was bolder bragging that its Z ran all applications people brought to test with at the West Coast Computer Faire br Creative Computing in stated we reiterate our standard line regarding the IBM PC compatibles try the package you want to use before you buy the computer Companies modified their computers BIOS to work with newly discovered incompatible applications and reviewers and users developed stress tests to measure compatibility by the ability to operate Lotus and Flight Simulator became the standard with compatibles specifically designed to run them br IBM believed that some companies such as Eagle Corona and Handwell infringed on its copyright and after Apple Computer Inc v Franklin Computer Corp successfully forced the clone makers to stop using the BIOS The Phoenix BIOS in however and similar products such as AMI BIOS permitted computer makers to legally build essentially compatible clones without having to reverse engineer the PC BIOS themselves A September InfoWorld chart listed seven compatibles with KB RAM two disk drives and monochrome monitors for to while the equivalent IBM PC cost The inexpensive Leading Edge Model D is even compatible with IBM proprietary diagnostic software unlike the Compaq Portable By Compute stated that clones are generally reliable and about percent compatible and a survey in the magazine of the clone industry did not mention software compatibility stating that PC by now has come to stand for a computer capable of running programs that are managed by MS DOS br br The main reason why an IBM standard is not worrying is that it can help competition to flourish IBM will soon be as much a prisoner of its standards as its competitors are Once enough IBM machines have been bought IBM cannot make sudden changes in their basic design what might be useful for shedding competitors would shake off even more customers br In February Byte wrote that IBM s burgeoning influence in the PC community is stifling innovation because so many other companies are mimicking Big Blue but The Economist stated in November The main reason why an IBM standard is not worrying is that it can help competition to flourish br br By IBM had about of sales of personal computers between and and computers with some PC compatibility were another As the market and competition grew IBM s influence diminished In November PC Magazine stated Now that it has created the PC market the market doesn t necessarily need IBM for the machines It may depend on IBM to set standards and to develop higher performance machines but IBM had better conform to existing standards so as to not hurt users In January Bruce Webster wrote in Byte of rumors that IBM would introduce proprietary personal computers with a proprietary operating system Who cares If IBM does it they will most likely just isolate themselves from the largest marketplace in which they really can t compete anymore anyway The magazine predicted that in the market will complete its transition from an IBM standard to an Intel MS DOS expansion bus standard Folks aren t so much concerned about IBM compatibility as they are about Lotus compatibility By Macworld stated that because of clones IBM lost control of its own market and became a minor player with its own technology br The Economist predicted in that IBM will soon be as much a prisoner of its standards as its competitors are because Once enough IBM machines have been bought IBM cannot make sudden changes in their basic design what might be useful for shedding competitors would shake off even more customers After IBM announced the OS oriented PS line in early sales of existing DOS compatible PC compatibles rose in part because the proprietary operating system was not available In Gartner Group estimated that the public purchased clones for every IBM PC By Compaq was so influential that industry executives spoke of Compaq compatible with observers stating that customers saw the company as IBM s equal or superior br After IBM PC compatibles dominated both the home and business markets of commodity computers with other notable alternative architectures being used in niche markets like the Macintosh computers offered by Apple Inc and used mainly for desktop publishing at the time the aging bit Commodore which was selling for by this time and became the world s bestselling computer the bit Commodore Amiga line used for television and video production and the bit Atari ST used by the music industry However IBM itself lost the main role in the market for IBM PC compatibles by A few events in retrospect are important br br IBM designed the PC with an open architecture which permitted clone makers to use freely available non proprietary components br Microsoft included a clause in its contract with IBM which permitted the sale of the finished PC operating system PC DOS to other computer manufacturers These IBM competitors licensed it as MS DOS in order to offer PC compatibility for less cost br The introduction of the Columbia Data Products MPC the first IBM PC compatible computer br The introduction of the Compaq Portable providing portability unavailable from IBM at the time br An Independent Business Unit IBU within IBM developed the IBM PC and XT IBUs did not share in corporate R D expense After the IBU became the Entry Systems Division it lost this benefit greatly decreasing margins br The availability by of sub Turbo XT PC XT compatibles including early offerings from Dell Computer reducing demand for IBM s models It was possible to buy two of these generic systems for less than the cost of one IBM branded PC AT and many companies did just that br By integrating more peripherals into the computer itself compatibles like the Model D have more free ISA slots than the PC br Compaq was the first to release an Intel based computer almost a year before IBM with the Compaq Deskpro Bill Gates later said that it was the first time people started to get a sense that it wasn t just IBM setting the standards br IBM s introduction of the incompatible and proprietary MicroChannel Architecture MCA computer bus for its Personal System PS line br The split of the IBM Microsoft partnership in development of OS Tensions caused by the market success of Windows ruptured the joint effort because IBM was committed to the s protected mode which stunted OS s technical potential Windows could take full advantage of the modern and increasingly affordable SX architecture As well there were cultural differences between the partners and Windows was often bundled with new computers while OS was only available for extra cost The split left IBM the sole steward of OS and it failed to keep pace with Windows br The introduction by the Gang of Nine companies of a rival bus Extended Industry Standard Architecture intended to compete with rather than copy MCA br The duelling expanded memory EMS and extended memory XMS standards of the late s both developed without input from IBM br Despite popularity of its ThinkPad set of laptop PC s IBM finally relinquished its role as a consumer PC manufacturer during April when it sold its laptop and desktop PC divisions ThinkPad ThinkCentre to Lenovo for US billion br As of October Hewlett Packard and Dell had the largest shares of the PC market in North America They were also successful overseas with Acer Lenovo and Toshiba also notable Worldwide a huge number of PCs are white box systems assembled by myriad local systems builders Despite advances of computer technology the IBM PC compatibles remained very much compatible with the original IBM PC computers although most of the components implement the compatibility in special backward compatibility modes used only during a system boot It was often more practical to run old software on a modern system using an emulator rather than relying on these features br In Lenovo acquired IBM s x based server System x business for US billion br br One of the strengths of the PC compatible design is its modular hardware design End users could readily upgrade peripherals and to some degree processor and memory without modifying the computer s motherboard or replacing the whole computer as was the case with many of the microcomputers of the time However as processor speed and memory width increased the limits of the original XT AT bus design were soon reached particularly when driving graphics video cards IBM did introduce an upgraded bus in the IBM PS computer that overcame many of the technical limits of the XT AT bus but this was rarely used as the basis for IBM compatible computers since it required license payments to IBM both for the PS bus and any prior AT bus designs produced by the company seeking a license This was unpopular with hardware manufacturers and several competing bus standards were developed by consortiums with more agreeable license terms Various attempts to standardize the interfaces were made but in practice many of these attempts were either flawed or ignored Even so there were many expansion options and despite the confusion of its users the PC compatible design advanced much faster than other competing designs of the time even if only because of its market dominance br br During the s IBM s influence on PC architecture started to decline IBM PC compatible becomes Standard PC in s and later ACPI PC in s An IBM brand PC became the exception rather than the rule Instead of placing importance on compatibility with the IBM PC vendors began to emphasize compatibility with Windows In a version of Windows NT was released that could operate on processors other than the x set While it required that applications be recompiled which most developers did not do its hardware independence was used for Silicon Graphics SGI x workstations thanks to NT s Hardware abstraction layer HAL they could operate NT and its vast application library br No mass market personal computer hardware vendor dared to be incompatible with the latest version of Windows and Microsoft s annual WinHEC conferences provided a setting in which Microsoft could lobby for and in some cases dictate the pace and direction of the hardware of the PC industry Microsoft and Intel had become so important to the ongoing development of PC hardware that industry writers began using the word Wintel to refer to the combined hardware software system br This terminology itself is becoming a misnomer as Intel has lost absolute control over the direction of x hardware development with AMD s AMD Additionally non Windows operating systems like macOS and Linux have established a presence on the x architecture br br Although the IBM PC was designed for expandability the designers could not anticipate the hardware developments of the s nor the size of the industry they would engender To make things worse IBM s choice of the Intel for the CPU introduced several limitations for developing software for the PC compatible platform For example the processor only had a bit memory addressing space To expand PCs beyond one megabyte Lotus Intel and Microsoft jointly created expanded memory EMS a bank switching scheme to allow more memory provided by add in hardware and accessed by a set of four kilobyte windows inside the bit addressing Later Intel CPUs had larger address spaces and could directly address MB or more causing Microsoft to develop extended memory XMS which did not require additional hardware br Expanded and extended memory have incompatible interfaces so anyone writing software that used more than one megabyte had to provide for both systems for the greatest compatibility until MS DOS began including EMM which simulated EMS memory using XMS memory A protected mode OS can also be written for the but DOS application compatibility was more difficult than expected not only because most DOS applications accessed the hardware directly bypassing BIOS routines intended to ensure compatibility but also that most BIOS requests were made by the first interrupt vectors which were marked as reserved for protected mode processor exceptions by Intel br Video cards suffered from their own incompatibilities There was no standard interface for using higher resolution SVGA graphics modes supported by later video cards Each manufacturer developed their own methods of accessing the screen memory including different mode numberings and different bank switching arrangements The latter were used to address large images within a single KB segment of memory Previously the VGA standard had used planar video memory arrangements to the same effect but this did not easily extend to the greater color depths and higher resolutions offered by SVGA adapters An attempt at creating a standard named VESA BIOS Extensions VBE was made but not all manufacturers used it br When the was introduced again a protected mode OS could be written for it This time DOS compatibility was much easier because of virtual mode Unfortunately programs could not switch directly between them so eventually some new memory model APIs were developed VCPI and DPMI the latter becoming the most popular br Because of the great number of third party adapters and no standard for them programming the PC could be difficult Professional developers would operate a large test suite of various known to be popular hardware combinations br Meanwhile consumers were overwhelmed by the competing incompatible standards and many different combinations of hardware on offer To give them some idea of what sort of PC they would need to operate their software the Multimedia PC MPC standard was set during A PC that met the minimum MPC standard could be marketed with the MPC logo giving consumers an easy to understand specification to look for Software that could operate on the most minimally MPC compliant PC would be guaranteed to operate on any MPC The MPC level and MPC level standards were set later but the term MPC compliant never became popular After MPC level during no further MPC standards were established br br By the late s the success of Microsoft Windows had driven rival commercial operating systems into near extinction and had ensured that the IBM PC compatible computer was the dominant computing platform This meant that if a developer made their software only for the Wintel platform they would still be able to reach the vast majority of computer users The only major competitor to Windows with more than a few percentage points of market share was Apple Inc s Macintosh The Mac started out billed as the computer for the rest of us but high prices and closed architecture drove the Macintosh into an education and desktop publishing niche from which it only emerged in the mid s By the mid s the Mac s market share had dwindled to around and introducing a new rival operating system had become too risky a commercial venture Experience had shown that even if an operating system was technically superior to Windows it would be a failure in the market BeOS and OS for example In Steve Jobs said of his new NeXT system It will either be the last new hardware platform to succeed or the first to fail Four years later in NeXT announced it was ending production of the NeXTcube and porting NeXTSTEP to Intel processors br Very early on in PC history some companies introduced their own XT compatible chipsets For example Chips and Technologies introduced their C XT Controller which integrated and replaced six of the original XT circuits one DMA controller one interrupt timer one parallel interface controller one interrupt controller one clock generator and one bus controller Similar non Intel chipsets appeared for the AT compatibles for example OPTi s C or C XLC which were found in many and early Pentium systems The x chipset market was very volatile though In VLSI Technology had become the dominant market player only to be virtually wiped out by Intel a year later Intel has been the uncontested leader ever since As the Wintel platform gained dominance Intel gradually abandoned the practice of licensing its technologies to other chipset makers in Intel was involved in litigation related to their refusal to license their processor bus and related technologies to other companies like Nvidia br Companies such as AMD and Cyrix developed alternative x CPUs that were functionally compatible with Intel s Towards the end of the s AMD was taking an increasing share of the CPU market for PCs AMD even ended up playing a significant role in directing the development of the x platform when its Athlon line of processors continued to develop the classic x architecture as Intel deviated with its NetBurst architecture for the Pentium CPUs and the IA architecture for the Itanium set of server CPUs AMD developed AMD the first major extension not created by Intel which Intel later adopted as x During Intel began abandoning NetBurst with the release of their set of Core processors that represented a development of the earlier Pentium III br A major alternative to Wintel domination is the rise of alternative operating systems since the early s which marked as the start of the post PC era This would include both the rapid growth of the smart phone using Android or iOS as an alternative to the personal computer and the increasing prevalence of Linux and Unix like operating systems in the server farms of large corporations such as Google or Amazon br br The term IBM PC compatible is not commonly used presently because many current mainstream desktop and laptop computers are based on the PC architecture and IBM no longer makes PCs The competing hardware architectures have either been discontinued or like the Amiga have been relegated to niche enthusiast markets In the past the most successful exception was Apple s Macintosh platform which used non Intel processors from its inception Although Macintosh was initially based on the Motorola series then transitioned to the PowerPC architecture Macintosh computers transitioned to Intel processors beginning in Until Macintosh computers shared the same system architecture as their Wintel counterparts and could boot Microsoft Windows without a DOS Compatibility Card However with the announcement of the internally developed ARM based M CPU they are again the exception to IBM compatibility br The processor speed and memory capacity of modern PCs are many orders of magnitude greater than they were for the original IBM PC and yet backwards compatibility has been largely maintained a bit operating system released during the s can still operate many of the simpler programs written for the OS of the early s without needing an emulator though an emulator like DOSBox now has near native functionality at full speed and is necessary for certain games which may run too fast on modern processors Additionally many modern PCs can still run DOS directly although special options such as USB legacy mode and SATA to PATA emulation may need to be set in the BIOS setup utility Computers using the UEFI might need to be set at legacy BIOS mode to be able to boot DOS However the BIOS UEFI options in most mass produced consumer grade computers are very limited and cannot be configured to truly handle OSes such as the original variants of DOS br The spread of the x architecture has further distanced current computers and operating systems internal similarity with the original IBM PC by introducing yet another processor mode with an instruction set modified for bit addressing but x capable processors also retain standard x compatibility br br AT form factor br ATX form factor br Baby
