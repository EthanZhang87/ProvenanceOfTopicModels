John Launchbury is an American and British computer scientist who is currently Chief Scientist at Galois Inc Previously he directed one of DARPA s technical offices where he oversaw nation scale scientific and engineering research in cybersecurity data analysis and artificial intelligence He is known for research and entrepreneurship in the implementation and application of functional programming languages In Launchbury was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery br br br Education br Launchbury received first class honors in mathematics from Oxford University in and an M Sc in computation in He holds a Ph D in computing science from the University of Glasgow In the Cambridge University Press published his thesis Projection Factorizations in Partial Evaluation after it won the British Computer Society s distinguished dissertation prize br br br Career and research br As a lecturer at the University of Glasgow Launchbury focused his early research on the semantics and analysis of lazy functional languages and was one of the contributing designers of the Haskell programming language br In Launchbury provided a formal description of lazy evaluation addressing challenges in analyzing a program s storage requirements The operational semantics is widely cited in later research on Haskell In the context of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler team Launchbury established an effective partnership with Simon L Peyton Jones to write a number of papers that dramatically influenced the design of Haskell Their paper on State in Haskell introduced the IO monad as a mathematically clean practical way of expressing effects on the external world and solidified the do notation Launchbury had introduced earlier Their papers on unboxed values and removal of intermediate data structures addressed many of the efficiency challenges inherent in lazy evaluation br In Launchbury relocated to the West Coast of the United States becoming a full professor at the Oregon Graduate Institute in His research there addressed the creation and optimization of domain specific programming languages DSLs ranging from fundamental research in combining disparate semantic elements through embedding DSLs in Haskell to applied research for modeling and reasoning about very large scale integration VLSI micro architectures br Launchbury founded Galois Inc in to address challenges in information assurance through the application of functional programming and formal methods He served as the company s CEO and Chief Scientist from to Under Launchbury s direction Galois Inc developed the Cryptol domain specific language for specifying and verifying cryptographic implementations Originally designed for use by the National Security Agency the language was made available to the public in br Launchbury is the holder of two patents on cryptographic structures in data storage and one on effective mechanisms for configuring programmable cryptographic components br In Launchbury joined DARPA initially as a program manager and then as director of the Information Innovation Office I O in While at DARPA Launchbury led programs in homomorphic cryptography PROCEED cybersecurity for vehicles and other embedded systems HACMS and data privacy Brandeis He also defined and described the Three Waves of AI Handcrafted Knowledge Statistical Learning and Contextual Adaptation br In Launchbury rejoined Galois as Chief Scientist br br br Other publications br Launchbury published a theological perspective on the Moral Exemplar interpretation of the doctrine of atonement entitled Change Us Not God Biblical Meditations on the Death of Jesus br br br
