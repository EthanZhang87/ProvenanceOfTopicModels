title: Computing platform
id: 81196
A computing platform digital platform or software platform is the infrastructure on which software is executed While the individual components of a computing platform may be obfuscated under layers of abstraction the summation of the required components comprise the computing platform br Sometimes the most relevant layer for a specific software is called a computing platform in itself to facilitate the communication referring to the whole using only one of its attributes i e using a metonymy br For example in a single computer system this would be the computer s architecture operating system OS and runtime libraries In the case of an application program or a computer video game the most relevant layer is the operating system so it can be called a platform itself hence the term cross platform for software that can be executed on multiple OSes in this context br In a multi computer system such as in the case of offloading processing it would encompass both the host computer s hardware operating system OS and runtime libraries along with other computers utilized for processing that are accessed via application programming interfaces or a web browser As long as it is a required component for the program code to execute it is part of the computing platform br br Platforms may also include br br Hardware alone in the case of small embedded systems Embedded systems can access hardware directly without an OS this is referred to as running on bare metal br A browser in the case of web based software The browser itself runs on a hardware OS platform but this is not relevant to software running within the browser br An application such as a spreadsheet or word processor which hosts software written in an application specific scripting language such as an Excel macro This can be extended to writing fully fledged applications with the Microsoft Office suite as a platform br Software frameworks that provide ready made functionality br Cloud computing and Platform as a Service Extending the idea of a software framework these allow application developers to build software out of components that are hosted not by the developer but by the provider with internet communication linking them together The social networking sites Twitter and Facebook are also considered development platforms br A virtual machine VM such as the Java virtual machine or NET CLR Applications are compiled into a format similar to machine code known as bytecode which is then executed by the VM br A virtualized version of a complete system including virtualized hardware OS software and storage These allow for instance a typical Windows program to run on what is physically a Mac br Some architectures have multiple layers with each layer acting as a platform for the one above it In general a component only has to be adapted to the layer immediately beneath it For instance a Java program has to be written to use the Java virtual machine JVM and associated libraries as a platform but does not have to be adapted to run on the Windows Linux or Macintosh OS platforms However the JVM the layer beneath the application does have to be built separately for each OS br br
