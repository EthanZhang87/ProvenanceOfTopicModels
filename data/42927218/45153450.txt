Windows Mobile is a discontinued mobile operating system developed by Microsoft First released in it is a successor to Windows Phone but was marketed by Microsoft as being an edition of its PC operating system Windows br Windows Mobile aimed to provide greater consistency with its counterpart for PCs including more extensive synchronization of content Universal Windows Platform apps as well as the capability on supported hardware to connect devices to an external display and use a desktop interface with mouse and keyboard input support reminiscent of Windows on PCs Microsoft built tools for developers to port iOS Objective C apps with minimal modifications Windows Phone smartphones are eligible for upgrade to Windows Mobile pursuant to manufacturer and carrier support Some features vary depending on hardware compatibility br Windows Mobile was designed for use on smartphones and phablets running on bit ARM processor architectures Microsoft also intended for the platform to be used on ARM tablets with screens inches or smaller in size but such devices were rarely commercially released Windows Mobile entered public beta for selected Lumia smartphones on February The first Lumia smartphones powered by Windows Mobile were released on November while eligible Windows Phone devices began receiving updates to Windows Mobile on March pursuant to manufacturer and carrier support br The platform never achieved any significant degree of popularity or market share in comparison to Android or iOS By Microsoft had already begun to downplay Windows Mobile having discontinued active development beyond maintenance releases due to a lack of user and developer interest in the platform and focused on serving incumbent mobile operating systems as part of its software and services strategy Support for Windows Mobile ended on January As of November Windows Mobile had approximately a share of the mobile operating system market br br br Development br Microsoft had already begun the process of unifying the Windows platform across device classes in Windows Phone dropped the Windows CE based architecture of its predecessor Windows Phone for a platform built upon the NT kernel that shared much of the same architecture with its PC counterpart Windows including file system NTFS networking stack security elements graphics engine DirectX device driver framework and hardware abstraction layer At Build Microsoft also unveiled the concept of Universal Windows Apps With the addition of Windows Runtime support to these platforms apps created for Windows could now be ported to Windows Phone and Xbox One while sharing a common codebase with their PC counterparts User data and licenses for an app could also be shared between multiple platforms br In July Microsoft s then new CEO Satya Nadella explained that the company was planning to streamline the next version of Windows from three operating systems into one single converged operating system for screens of all sizes unifying Windows Windows Phone and Windows Embedded around a common architecture and a unified application ecosystem However Nadella stated that these internal changes would not have any effect on how the operating systems are marketed and sold br On September Microsoft unveiled Windows Terry Myerson explained that Windows would be Microsoft s most comprehensive platform ever promoting plans to provide a unified platform for desktop computers laptops tablets smartphones and all in one devices Windows on phones was publicly unveiled during the Windows The Next Chapter press event on January unlike previous Windows Phone versions it would also expand the platform s focus to small ARM based tablets Microsoft s previous attempt at an operating system for ARM based tablets Windows RT which was based upon the PC version of Windows was commercially unsuccessful br During the Build keynote Microsoft announced the middleware toolkit Islandwood later known as Windows Bridge for iOS which provides a toolchain that can assist developers in porting Objective C software primarily iOS projects to build as Universal Windows Apps An early build of Windows Bridge for iOS was released as open source software under the MIT License on August Visual Studio can also convert Xcode projects into Visual Studio projects Microsoft also announced plans for a toolkit codenamed Centennial which would allow desktop Windows software using Win APIs to be ported to Windows Mobile br br br Project Astoria br br At Build Microsoft had also announced an Android runtime environment for Windows Mobile known as Astoria which would allow Android apps to run in an emulated environment with minimal changes and have access to Microsoft platform APIs such as Bing Maps and Xbox Live as nearly drop in replacements for equivalent Google Mobile Services Google Mobile Services and certain core APIs would not be available and apps with deep integration into background tasks were said to poorly support the environment br On February after already having delayed it in November Microsoft announced that Astoria would be shelved arguing that it was redundant to the native Windows Bridge toolkit since iOS is already a primary target for mobile app development The company also encouraged use of products from Xamarin which they had acquired the previous day for multi platform app development using C programming language instead Portions of Astoria were used as a basis for the Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL platform on the PC version of Windows br br br Naming br To promote it as being unified with its desktop equivalent Microsoft promoted the operating system as being an edition of Windows Microsoft had begun to phase out specific references to the Windows Phone brand in its advertising in mid but critics have still considered the operating system to be an iteration and continuation of Windows Phone due to its lineage and similar overall functionality Microsoft referred to the OS as Windows for phones and small tablets during its unveiling and leaked screenshots from a Technical Preview build identified the operating system as Windows Mobile The technical preview was officially called the Windows Technical Preview for phones while the user agent of Microsoft Edge contained a reference to Windows Phone br On May Microsoft officially confirmed the platform would be known as Windows Mobile br br br Features br A major aspect of Windows Mobile is a focus on harmonizing user experiences and functionality between different classes of devices specifically devices running the PC oriented version of Windows Under the Universal Windows Platform concept Windows Runtime apps for Windows on PC can be ported to other platforms in the Windows family with nearly the same codebase but with adaptations for specific device classes Windows Mobile also shares user interface elements with its PC counterpart such as the updated Action Center and settings menu During its initial unveiling Microsoft presented several examples of Windows apps that would have similar functionality and user interfaces between Windows on desktops and mobile devices including updated Photos and Maps apps and new Microsoft Office apps Although marketed as a converged platform and as with Windows Phone using a Windows NT based kernel Windows Mobile still cannot run Win desktop applications but is compatible with software designed for Windows Phone br Notifications can be synced between devices dismissing a notification on for example a laptop will also dismiss it from a phone Certain types of notifications now allow inline replies The start screen now has the option to display wallpapers as a background of the screen behind translucent tiles rather than within the tiles The messaging app adds support for internet based Skype messaging alongside SMS similarly to Apple s iMessage and can synchronize these conversations with other devices The camera app has been updated to match the Lumia Camera app previously exclusive to Lumia products and a new Photos app aggregates content from local storage and OneDrive and can perform automatic enhancements to photos The on screen keyboard now contains a virtual pointing stick for manipulating the text editing cursor a dedicated voice input button and can be shifted towards the left or right of the screen to improve one handed usability on larger devices br Windows Mobile supports Continuum a feature that allows supported devices to connect to an external display and scale its user interface and apps into a PC like desktop interface with support for mouse and keyboard input over USB or Bluetooth Devices can connect directly to external displays wirelessly using Miracast via USB C or via docking station accessories with USB ports as well as HDMI and DisplayPort outputs br A new iteration of the Office Mobile suite Office for Windows is also bundled Based upon the Android and iOS versions of Office Mobile they introduce a new user interface with a variation of the ribbon toolbar used by the desktop version and a new mobile version of Outlook Outlook utilizes the same rendering engine as the Windows desktop version of Microsoft Word Microsoft Edge replaces Internet Explorer Mobile as the default web browser br br br Release br Windows Mobile s first party launch devices the Lumia Lumia XL and Lumia were released in November being the first phones to ship with Windows Mobile Monthly updates to the OS software are being released to address bugs and security issues These updates are distributed to all Windows Mobile devices and do not require the intervention of a user s wireless carrier in order to authorize their distribution Firmware upgrades will still require authorization by the user s carrier br The Windows Insider program adopted to provide a public beta for the PC version of Windows is used to provide a public beta version of Windows Mobile for selected devices A build released on April was to support most second and third generation Lumia products but the Lumia Lumia Icon and Lumia XL did not receive the update due to scaling bugs and delivery was suspended as a whole due to backup and restore issues on some models An update to the Windows Phone Recovery Tool resolved these concerns and delivery of Windows updates was restored to the with build and to the with build br Build number was released on June with a migration bug that required that existing devices on build be reverted to Windows Phone using the Recovery Tool before the installation of could proceed This migration bug was fixed a week later with the release of build Mobile builds of the Redstone branch till were halted for the device Lumia GB RAM due to bugs br br br Upgrade release br Some Windows Phone smartphones can be upgraded to Windows Mobile pursuant to hardware compatibility manufacturer support and carrier support Not all phones can receive the update nor support all of its features Microsoft originally stated that stable upgrades for Windows Phone devices would be released in December however the release was ultimately delayed to March Among first party devices only the Lumia GB RAM XL and are supported The only third party devices supported are the BLU Products Win HD w u and Win HD LTE x q and the MCJ Madosma Q Windows Mobile does not officially support any HTC devices HTC One M for Windows HTC Windows Phone X HTC Windows Phone S although the HTC One M for Windows could be upgraded to the public release version of Windows Mobile through the Windows Insider program While Microsoft stated that the Nokia Lumia Icon may be upgraded at a later date the company stated that there will not be a second wave of officially supported devices Microsoft also removed statements which promoted the BLU Win JR LTE as being compatible with Windows br Microsoft originally stated that all Lumia smartphones running Windows Phone and would receive updates to but Microsoft later reiterated that only devices with the Lumia Denim firmware revision and at least GB of internal storage would receive the upgrade In February Joe Belfiore stated that Microsoft was working on support for devices with MB of RAM such as the popular Nokia Lumia but these plans have since been dropped Upon the official upgrade release some Lumia models particularly the Lumia and were excluded despite meeting the previously announced criteria Microsoft cited poor user feedback on the performance of preview builds on these models as reasoning On October Nearly years after the Windows release Microsoft released an Over The Cable OTC Updater tool to bring all Lumias up to date to the latest supported Windows build even older MB and GB RAM unlocked devices such as the etc which were updated using the tool to Build November Update br br br Devices br br As with Windows Phone Windows Mobile supports ARM system on chips from Qualcomm s Snapdragon line In March Ars Technica reported that the operating system will also introduce support for IA system on chips from Intel and AMD including Intel s Atom x and Cherry Trail Atom x and x and AMD s Carrizo These plans never materialized br Minimum specifications for Windows Mobile devices are similar to those of Windows Phone with a minimum screen resolution of if software buttons are in use GB of RAM and GB of internal storage Owing to hardware advancements and the operating system s support for tablets screen resolutions can now reach as high as QSXGA resolution and further as opposed to the p cap of Windows Phone The screen s resolution dictates the minimum amount of RAM required screens with a resolution or and higher require GB FHD or and higher require GB and and higher require GB br Microsoft unveiled flagship Lumia smartphones bundled with Windows during a media event on October including Lumia Lumia XL and the low end Lumia br br br Version history br br br First release version br Microsoft announced Windows Mobile during their January event The Next Chapter The first Windows Mobile build was rolled out on February as part of the Windows Insider Program to a subset of mobile devices running Windows Phone and As with the desktop editions of Windows this initial release was codenamed Threshold it was part of both the Threshold and Threshold development cycles Windows Mobile launched with the Microsoft Lumia and XL The rollout for Windows Phone devices started March br br br Anniversary Update version br On February Microsoft restarted the rollout of full builds for the first feature update officially known as the Anniversary Update or Version codenamed Redstone Like the start of the previous wave the first builds were not available to all devices that were included in the Windows Insider Program br br br Creators Update version and Fall Creators Update version br The Creators Update named after the equivalent update to Windows for PC also known as Redstone was first previewed on the Insider branch on August and began deployment on April It features mainly minor feature additions including an e book reader within Edge the ability to turn off the phone screen when using Continuum mode on an external display SMS support in Skype SD card encryption and other changes Despite the platform s synergy with Windows for PCs some of its features such as Night Light and Paint D were excluded Around the time that the Creators Update was finalized Windows Insider users began to be issued updates on a branch known as feature Microsoft stated that there were no plans to move Windows Mobile to be in sync with the other Windows platforms just yet media outlets considered this decision to be a sign that Microsoft was beginning to wind down active development of Windows Mobile beyond maintenance releases as development was no longer directly in sync with the PC version br The Creators Update was only offered to eleven existing Windows Mobile devices of which nine would later receive the Fall Creators Update br br Alcatel Idol S and S Pro br Alcatel OneTouch Fierce XL br HP Elite x br Lenovo Softbank LV br MCJ Madosma Q br Microsoft Lumia br Microsoft Lumia and XL br Microsoft Lumia br Microsoft Lumia and XL br Trinity NuAns Neo br VAIO Phone Biz VPB br indicates a phone that is incompatible with the Fall Creators Update br In early June a private build briefly deployed by accident by Microsoft revealed work on an updated interface for Windows Mobile known as CShell composable shell an implementation of the Windows shell across device classes using a modular system The build featured a Start screen Action Center and Continuum desktop interface that were nearly identical in functionality and appearance to their equivalents on Windows for PC However this iteration of the operating system was no longer backwards compatible with Windows Phone Silverlight apps br br br Reception br br Reception of Windows Mobile was mixed In its review of the Lumia XL The Verge felt that the platform was buggy and unfinished and that its user interface was inconsistent in operation and felt more like Android mixed with few of the distinct design elements that were hallmarks of Windows Phone It was noted that the OS still retained much of the performance of Windows Phone and that Microsoft had made efforts to create synergies with the PC version of Windows via its universal apps concept Continuum was regarded as potentially being a signature feature over time but that it was merely a parlor trick in its launch state due to a lack of support for desktop oriented interfaces among third party software TechRadar felt that the lack of apps was the biggest let down on Windows Phone and Windows Mobile alike After many user complaints Microsoft started allowing users to downgrade from Windows Mobile to Windows Phone br br br Financial results br According to Microsoft s fiscal year the revenue from the company s smartphone division was million a loss when compared to million in br br The year before Microsoft disclosed information on sales of its Microsoft Mobile subsidiary br br In addition as disclosed in the company s prior fiscal year Microsoft spent billion of integration and restructuring expenses primarily costs associated with restructuring plans which includes the cost of mass layoffs br br br Discontinuation br On October Microsoft executive Joe Belfiore revealed that the company would no longer actively develop new features or hardware for Windows phones citing its low market share and the resultant lack of third party software for the platform Microsoft had largely abandoned its mobile business having laid off the majority of Microsoft Mobile employees in sold a number of intellectual property and manufacturing assets including in particular the Nokia feature phone business to HMD Global and Foxconn which began producing Android based smartphones under the Nokia brand focused software efforts on providing apps and services compatible with the incumbent Android and iOS instead and having since released dual touchscreen Android smartphones under the Surface Duo brand Development of Windows Mobile would be limited to maintenance releases and patches By December Statcounter had reported Windows Mobile s market share to be br In January Microsoft announced that Windows Mobile would reach end of life on December after which no further security updates will be released and online services tied to the OS such as device backup have begun to be phased out However Microsoft quietly moved the EOL date to January aligned with the EOL date for Windows Windows Server R and Internet Explorer with one additional security update released br br br
