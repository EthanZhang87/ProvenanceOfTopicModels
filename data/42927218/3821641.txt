title: Two dots (diacritic)
id: 3821641
Diacritical marks of two dots placed side by side over or under a letter are used in several languages for several different purposes The most familiar to English language speakers are the diaeresis and the umlaut though there are numerous others For example in Albanian represents a schwa Such diacritics are also sometimes used for stylistic reasons as in the family name Bront or the band name M tley Cr e br In modern computer systems using Unicode the two dot diacritics are almost always encoded identically having the same code point For example U F LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS represents both o umlaut and o diaeresis Their appearance in print or on screen may vary between typefaces but rarely within the same typeface br The word trema French tr ma used in linguistics and also classical scholarship describes the form of both the umlaut diacritic and the diaeresis rather than their function and is used in those contexts to refer to either br br br Uses br br br Diaeresis br br As the diaeresis diacritic it is used to mark the separation of two distinct vowels in adjacent syllables when an instance of diaeresis or hiatus occurs so as to distinguish from a digraph or diphthong For example in the obsolete spelling co perate the diaeresis reminded the reader that the word has four syllables co op er ate not three It is used in several languages of western and southern Europe though rarely now in English One well known usage is in French the diaeresis is used in na ve which is commonly spelled in English without the diaeresis It is however obligatory in French to show that it is pronounced na iv rather than nev br br br Umlaut br br As the umlaut diacritic it indicates a sound shift also known as umlaut in which a back vowel becomes a front vowel It is a specific feature of German and other Germanic languages affecting the graphemes a o u and au which are modified to and u br It derives from the Sutterlin script formerly used widely in German handwriting in which the letter e is formed as two short parallel vertical lines very close together see under S tterlin Characteristics br br br Stylistic use br The two dot diacritic is also sometimes used for purely stylistic reasons For example the Bront family whose surname was derived from Gaelic and had been anglicised as Prunty or Brunty At some point the father of the sisters Patrick Bront born Brunty decided on the alternative spelling with a diaeresis diacritic over the terminal e to indicate that the name had two syllables br Similarly the metal umlaut is a diacritic that is sometimes used gratuitously or decoratively over letters in the names of hard rock or heavy metal bands for example those of Mot rhead and M tley Cr e and of parody bands such as Sp n al Tap br br br Other uses by language br A double dot is also used as a diacritic in cases where it functions as neither a diaeresis nor an umlaut In the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA a double dot above a letter is used for a centralized vowel a situation more similar to umlaut than to diaeresis In other languages it is used for vowel length nasalization tone and various other uses where diaeresis or umlaut was available typographically The IPA uses a double dot below a letter to indicate breathy murmured voice br br br Vowels br In Albanian Tagalog and Kashubian represents a schwa br In Aymara a double dot is used on for vowel length br In the Basque dialect of Soule represents y br In the DMG romanization of Tunisian Arabic and represent y and y br In Ligurian official orthography is used to represent the sound o br In M ori a diaeresis e g w hine was often used on computers in the past instead of the macron to indicate long vowels as the diaeresis was relatively easy to produce on many systems and the macron difficult or impossible br In Seneca are nasal vowels though is as in German umlaut br In Vur s Vanuatu and encode respectively and br In the Pahawh Hmong script a double dot is used as one of several tone marks br The double dot was used in the early Cyrillic alphabet which was used to write Old Church Slavonic The modern Cyrillic Belarusian and Russian alphabets include the letter yo although replacing it with the letter without the diacritic is allowed in Russian br Since the s Cyrillic letter yi has been used in the Ukrainian alphabet for iotated ji plain is not iotated i In Udmurt is used for uniotated i with for iotated ji br The form is common in Dutch handwriting and also occasionally used in printed text but is a form of the digraph ij rather than a modification of the letter y br Komi and Udmurt use a Cyrillic O with two dots for br The Swedish Finnish and Estonian languages use and to represent and br In the languages of J R R Tolkien s Middle Earth novels a diaeresis is used to separate vowels belonging to different syllables e g in E rendil and on final e to mark it as not a schwa e g in Manw Aul Orom etc There is no schwa in these languages but Tolkien wanted to make sure that readers wouldn t mistakenly pronounce one when speaking the names aloud br br br Consonants br Jacaltec a Mayan language and Malagasy are among the very few languages with a double dot on the letter n in both n is the velar nasal br In Udmurt a double dot is also used with the consonant letters d from d from z and t from t br When distinction is important and are used for representing and in the Kurdish Kurmanji alphabet which are otherwise represented by h and x These sounds are borrowed from Arabic br and is generally a vowel but it is used as the semi vowel consonant a w without the use of the lips in Tlingit This sound is also found in Coast Tsimshian where it is written br A number of languages in Vanuatu use double dots on consonants to represent linguolabial or apicolabial phonemes in their orthography Thus Araki contrasts bilabial p p with linguolabial p t bilabial m m with linguolabial m n and bilabial v with linguolabial v br Seneca uses s for br In Arabic the letter is used in the ISO transliteration for the t marb ah used to mark feminine gender in nouns and adjectives br Syriac uses a two dots above a letter called Siyame to indicate that the word should be understood as plural For instance bayta means house while bayte means houses The sign is used especially when no vowel marks are present which could differentiate between the two forms Although the origin of the Siyame is different from that of the diaeresis sign in modern computer systems both are represented by the same Unicode character This however often leads to wrong rendering of the Syriac text br The N Ko script used to write the Mand languages of West Africa uses a two dot diacritic among others to represent non native sounds The dots are slightly larger than those used for diaeresis or umlaut br br br Diacritic underneath br br The IPA specifies a subscript umlaut for example Hindi k m ar potter the ALA LC romanization system provides for its use and is one of the main schemes to romanize Persian for example rendering as z The notation was used to write some Asian languages in Latin script for example Red Karen br br br Computer encodings br br br In Unicode br Character encoding generally treats the umlaut and the diaeresis as the same diacritic mark Unicode refers to both as diaereses without making any distinction although the term itself has a more precise literary meaning For example U F LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS represents both o umlaut and o diaeresis while similar codes are used to represent all such cases br Unicode encodes a number of cases of letter with a two dots diacritic as precomposed characters and these are displayed below Unicode uses the term Diaeresis for all two dot diacritics irrespective of the actual term used for the language in question In addition many more symbols may be composed using the combining character facility U COMBINING DIAERESIS that may be used with any letter or other diacritic to create a customised symbol but this does not mean that the result has any real world application and are not shown in the table br br Both the combining character U and the pre composed codepoints may be regarded as an umlaut or a diaeresis according to context Compound diacritics are possible for example U DA LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS AND CARON used as a tonal marks for Hanyu Pinyin which uses both a two dots diacritic with a caron diacritic Conversely when the letter to be accented is an i the diacritic replaces the tittle thus br Sometimes there s a need to distinguish between the umlaut sign and the diaeresis sign For instance either may appear in a German name ISO IEC JTC SC WG recommends the following for these cases br br To represent the umlaut use the Combining Diaeresis U br To represent the diaeresis use Combining Grapheme Joiner CGJ U F Combining Diaeresis U br The same advice can be found in the official Unicode FAQ br Since version Unicode also provides U COMBINING LATIN SMALL LETTER E which can produce the older umlaut typography br Unicode provides a combining double dot below as U COMBINING DIAERESIS BELOW br Finally for use with the N Ko script there is U F NKO COMBINING DOUBLE DOT ABOVE br br br In ASCII ISO IEC and ISO br br ASCII a seven bit code with just printable characters has no provision for any kind of dot diacritic Subsequent standardisation treated ASCII as the US national variant of ISO IEC the French German and other national variants reassigned a few code points to specific vowels with diacritics as precomposed characters br The subsequent eight bit ISO character encoding includes the letters and their respective capital forms as well as in lower case only with added in the revised edition ISO and Windows br These standards are technically obsolete having been replaced by Unicode br br br Computer usage br Character encoding generally treats the umlaut and the diaeresis as the same diacritic mark Unicode refers to both as diaereses without making any distinction although the term itself has a more precise literary meaning For example U F LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS represents both o umlaut and o diaeresis while similar codes are used to represent all such cases br br br Keyboard input br br In countries where the local language s routinely include letters with a circumflex local keyboards are typically engraved with those symbols br If letters with double dots are not present on the keyboard there are a number of ways to input them into a computer system br br br Apple MacOS iOS br iOS provides accented letters through press and hold on most European Latin script keyboards including English Some keyboard layouts feature combining accent keys that can add accents to any appropriate letter A letter with double dots can be produced by pressing Option U then the letter This works on English and other keyboards and is documented further in the supplied manuals br br br Google ChromeOS br For ChromeOS with US International keyboard setting the combination is letter For ChromeOS with UK extended setting use AltGr Shift release then the letter Alternatively the Unicode codepoint may be entered directly using Ctrl Shift u release then the four digit code then Enter or Space br br br Microsoft Windows br AZERTY and QZERTY keyboards as used in much of Europe include precomposed characters accented letters as standard and these are fully supported by Microsoft Windows typically accessed using the AltGr key br For users with a US keyboard layout Windows includes a setting US International which supports creation of accented letters by changing the function of some keys into dead keys If the user enters nothing will appear on screen until the user types another character after which the characters will be merged if possible or added independently at once if not Alternatively the desired character may be generated using Alt codes br For users in the United Kingdom and Ireland with QWERTY keyboards Windows has an Extended setting such that an accented letter can be created using AltGr then the base letter br When using Microsoft Word for Windows or Outlook a letter with double dots can be produced by pressing Ctrl Shift and then the letter br br br Linux X Window System br X based systems Composea produces and similarly for many other letters including capital letters br In addition any Unicode code point can be entered for instance Ctrl Shift UF Space produces U F which is br br br Dedicated keys br The German keyboard has dedicated keys for Scandinavian and Turkish keyboards have dedicated keys for their respective language specific letters including for Swedish Finnish and Icelandic and both and for Turkish French and Belgian AZERTY keyboards have a dead key which adds a circumflex if without Shift or a diaeresis umlaut if with Shift to the letter key immediately following for instance Shift followed by e gives br br br Other scripts br For non Latin scripts Greek and Russian use press and hold for double dot diacritics on only a few characters The Greek keyboard has dialytica and dialytica tonos variants for upsilon and iota but not for following modern monotonic usage Russian keyboards feature separate keys for and br br br On screen keyboards br The early st century has seen noticeable growth in stylus and touch operated interfaces making the use of on screen keyboards operated by pointing devices mouse stylus or finger more important These soft keyboards may replicate the modifier keys found on hardware keyboards but they may also employ other means of selecting options from a base key such as right click or press and hold Soft keyboards may also have multiple contexts such as letter numeric and symbol br br br HTML br In HTML vowels with double dots can be entered with an entity reference of the form uml where can be any of a e i o u y or their majuscule counterparts For instance Auml produces br br br TeX and LaTeX br TeX and its derivatives most notably LaTeX also allows double dots to be placed over letters The standard way is to use the control sequence followed by the relevant letter e g u It is good practice to set the sequence off with curly braces u or u br TeX s German package can be used it adds the control sequence without the backslash to produce the Umlaut However this can cause conflicts if the main language of the document is not German Since the integration of Unicode through the development of XeTeX and XeLaTeX it is also possible to input the Unicode character directly into the document using one of the recognized methods such as Compose key or direct Unicode input br TeX s traditional control sequences can still be used and will produce the same output in very early versions of TeX these sequences would produce double dots that were too far above the letter s body br All these methods can be used with all available font variations underlined strikethrough etc br br br See also br Dot diacritic br Two dots disambiguation br br br Notes br br br br br br External
