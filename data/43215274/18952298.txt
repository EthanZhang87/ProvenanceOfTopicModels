over a thematic game board by the teams One team was Red with the other Yellow the latter which was traditionally Blue in most Nickelodeon team vs team game shows was likely changed due to the Video Zone s blue chroma key setup The game board was divided into squares and Mikey was moved around the board in one of four basic directions up down left or right toward a Goal space on the board When new squares were landed on various events would be uncovered including trivia quizzes video based puzzles bonus instant win prizes automatic point adding squares enemies and Video Challenges The latter involved one player of the team playing one of five video games in an attempt to beat a certain score or accomplish a certain objective within seconds Regardless of the outcome both teams kept any prizes won during the first two rounds of the game br More often than not the round would end before Mikey reached the goal space due to time constraints In such cases Mikey was moved directly to the goal and a question was asked the first team to buzz in with the correct answer received the Goal points After the round ends the contents of the remaining squares were revealed Round was played the same way but with point values doubled br br br Mikey s World br Mikey s World had different areas of exploration These areas included br br br Moving Mikey br There were eight different types of

picture and recalling a series of images flashed rapidly on the screen br Pop Quiz A question was asked that related to the area Mikey was traveling The teams could buzz in during the middle of the question If a team answered correctly they earned points in Round and control of Mikey In early episodes the team in control of Mikey would choose one of four categories br Prize The team that moved Mikey won a prize and kept control Any prize the team received was theirs to keep regardless of the game s outcome br Video Challenge One of the contestants from a team chose one of five video games on stage to play each of which could be played only once during an episode The goal was to beat the Wizard s Challenge renamed Expert s Challenge in Season which was usually to achieve a certain score within seconds for the game chosen The other team member had three seconds although it usually was not enforced to write using a Magna Doodle how much of their score they would gamble that the partner could complete the challenge If the player met or beat the challenge the wager was added to their score and the team kept control of Mikey If not they lost the wager and the other team gained control Teams could wager any amount from zero to their current score or the value of one question in that round whichever was greater In the event the other team member wagered more points than their current score the wager was rounded down to their current score only if the challenge was won Each game could be played only once during an episode and when it was chosen the marquee light was turned off

space that had already been landed on a Time Bomb would occur The team controlling Mikey had seconds to spell a word alternating letters back and forth between team members If a team correctly pong spelled a word they kept control otherwise the other team would gain control Regardless of the outcome no points were awarded br Goal The Goal worked in two ways If the team that moved Mikey moved him to the Goal they alone were asked a question based on a category their opponents chose from a list of four categories three in season A correct answer earned points in Round in Round and the Goal for that round If they answered incorrectly the opponents got half the points available and the Goal by default If time ran out before Mikey reached the goal a sudden death Pop Quiz question was asked for
