br br Ickis voiced by Charlie Adler is a small red violet monster who is often mistaken for a rabbit due to his large ears He is the son of Slickis a famous scarer He seems the most skittish of the monsters but is also a capable leader Ickis looms and grows in size to scare and comes from a long line of loomers Ickis s constant goofing off and blatant disregard for rules are usually the focal point and source of his group s troubles in most episodes Another running gag in the series is that Ickis nearly exposes the Monster World to humans accidentally which spells certain doom for monsterkind br Oblina voiced by Christine Cavanaugh is a black and white striped monster shaped like an upside down candy cane who comes from a wealthy monster family and is considered by The Gromble to be his best student When voicing Oblina Christine Cavanaugh attempted to make the voice sound like a British version of the actress Agnes Moorehead br Krumm voiced by David Eccles is an orange tan hairy monster whose eyeballs are not attached to his body and are usually carried in his hands If he requires the use of both hands he can carry them in his mouth When he sleeps he keeps his eyes in a glass of water next to his bed His most valuable tool in scaring is his overwhelming armpit stench as well as using his eyeballs A running gag in the series is that Krumm sometimes loses his eyeballs and has to get them back once going so far as to make a fake head to keep from losing them br The Gromble voiced by Gregg Berger is a green blue monster with two tufts of hair a beard and a tail He wears a belt around his waist and a red pump on each of his four feet While serving as the leader and principal of the dump The Gromble teaches young monsters and evaluates them using the Viewfinder a chair like projection device used to replay the scaring activities of students Along with Ickis he is one of the few monsters who can hear the Pool of Elders the source of monster existence that is made of the very substance of fears br The Snorch voiced by David Eccles is the disciplinarian of the Monster Academy who works for The Gromble and is often seen with Zimbo Though he mostly does not speak and only makes vocal effects he once wore a voicebox translator whose voice was provided by Brock Peters He operates three chambers labeled Something Bad a hissing boiler like room Something Really Bad a mechanical cyclops with sharp teeth and You don t want to know a cheerful pink house with colorful flora br Zimbo voiced by Tim Curry is a bee like monster with one mammal like leg and a humanoid face with green hair He is The Gromble s assistant in his class and is always seen on the head of The Snorch Zimbo appears to be petty and jealous of anyone becoming friends with The Snorch although he too has been punished by him for misbehavior br Simon voiced by Jim Belushi is the series recurring antagonist a human who is determined to prove that monsters exist and wants to exterminate them Before becoming a monster hunter he tried to capture Bigfoot and built a giant robot Belushi ad libbed much of Simon s dialogue br Bradley voiced by Brett Alexander is a human friend of the monsters br br br Production br Aaahh Real Monsters was created by G bor Csup and Peter Gaffney and was the third animated series produced by Csup s company Klasky Csupo which also created the animated shows Rugrats and Duckman on USA Network Before the final title was chosen which took over five years the series had the working titles Monsters and Real Monsters The show was conceived after Csup and his wife and creative partner Arlene Klasky were approached by the network Nickelodeon to create a follow up series to Rugrats Csup was inspired to write a show about monsters because his own young children loved them He also said he knew Nickelodeon would not want a series about human characters because everybody else was pitching shows about animals Csup drew some sketches of possible monsters on a piece of paper and successfully pitched the idea to the network I wanted them silly and not too skillful and the idea worked br Nickelodeon programming director Herb Scannell said the character design in Aaahh Real Monsters was partially inspired by Yellow Submarine a animated film that was in turn inspired by The Beatles The character Gromble in particular bears a close resemblance to the Blue Meanie characters from that film Director of the series Igor Kovalyov said the style was inspired by his earlier Soviet film Investigation Held by Kolobki which he and G bor Csup showed to the producers who then gave Kovalyov s team a lot of creative freedom with the art direction and storyboarding Csup said some elements of the show have a look similar to the film noir genre and called the city dump where the monster characters reside reminiscent of the visual style from the films Blade Runner and Brazil The characters guest starred in the Rugrats episode Ghost Story Before that David Eccles the voice of Krumm provided the monster voice coming from under Chuckie s bed br br br Reception br br br Reviews br Reviews for Aaahh Real Monsters were very positive Josef Adalian of The Washington Times praised the show s animation and sense of humor although it was not as hip and witty as The Ren Stimpy Show or The Simpsons Although he felt the show would appeal to children over nine as well as adults he said it may not appeal to those who react negatively to semi scary sights and gags about body odor physical punishment or abusive older siblings USA Today writer Matt Roush called it garish and blissfully silly and praised the show s outrageous characters have just enough Ren Stimpy grodiness but tempered with exceptional sweetness Ginny Holbert of the Chicago Sun Times called it a cute and clever series with wit and inventive creatures and compared the animation to the work of artist Peter Max Gannett News Service writer Mike Hughes called it a terrific cartoon series and said the show s wildly perverse humor had a distinctly European style that reflected G bor Csup s Hungarian background br The Plain Dealer writer Tom Feran called the show good fun and favorably compared the series premise to that of the animated film The Nightmare Before Christmas Boston Herald writer Frances Katz wrote If there was ever a great title for a cartoon it has to be Nickelodeon s Aaahh Real Monsters Not all reviews were positive The November issue of Parenting magazine listed Aaahh Real Monsters as in its top ten list of the worst new shows of the television season describing it as Graphic and scatological it s just plain gross Some media outlets pointed out similarities between Aaahh Real Monsters and The Brothers Grunt an MTV animated television series created by Danny Antonucci about a group of grotesque humanoid characters G bor Csup rejected these comparisons and claims his show was more story and character driven with a different visual style while Antonucci s show was idea driven Csup did not want Aaahh Real Monsters to be lumped together with The Brothers Grunt especially since that show received low ratings and negative reviews lasting for months and that Danny Antonucci called it MTV s dirty little secret br br br Awards br The pilot episode of Aaahh Real Monsters won first prize for film animation producer
