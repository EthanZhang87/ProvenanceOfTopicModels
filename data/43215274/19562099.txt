taller Rico has an unexplained scar over his mouth a double chin and a feathery Mohawk and Private is shorter younger and rounder Their personalities and abilities were also exaggerated The texture of the characters was also changed to be better suited for television work br br br Main br Skipper voiced by Tom McGrath is the leader of the penguins He devises tactics and gives orders Arrogant calculating strict energetic paranoid short tempered and nearly unflappable Skipper s raving paranoia and tendency to view even the most ordinary activities as a military operation combined with his experience in covert ops has driven him to prepare for nearly any situation no matter how bizarre or unlikely It is revealed in the episode Needle Point that Skipper is afraid of needles McGrath reprises his role from the films br Kowalski voiced by Jeff Bennett is the team s intelligence officer strategist and gadgeteer Kowalski is a brilliant inventor but he cannot read although he does carry around a clipboard upon which he records drawings of their plans He also tends to over analyze situations and has created many amazing devices which have put the team in danger It is revealed in the episode Needle Point that he is afraid of going to the dentist Bennett replaces Chris Miller from the movies br Rico voiced by John DiMaggio is the team s explosives specialist and weapons supplier who mainly communicates through grunts coughs and squeals but sometimes he can speak rather normally Slightly unhinged Rico swallows useful tools such as dynamite and regurgitates them when needed to the point of regularly regurgitating objects that appear to be too large for him to have swallowed in the first place He has been referred to as a psychopath in several episodes He is shown in some episodes to be in a relationship with a female doll called Miss Perky DiMaggio reprises his role from the short The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper br Private voiced by James Patrick Stuart is the emotionally sensitive mild mannered English accented rookie of the team Though younger and less experienced than the other penguins he is the most down to earth Private tends to offer simpler more commonsense solutions in response to Skipper and Kowalski s complex strategies often in an understated tone while those strategies are falling apart e g The Officer X Factor He often shows an eager interest in unicorns as evidenced by his love of a show called The Lunacorns e g Hello Dollface Operation Lunacorn Apocalypse for which he is often ridiculed Private is also a skilled fighter Stuart replaces Christopher Knights from the movies br King Julien XIII voiced by Danny Jacobs is a fun loving witty narcissistic ring tailed lemur Normally shortened to King Julien he is a comically conceited character who has little regard for others even his subjects Maurice and Mort He has a tendency to use malapropisms and misinterpret figures of speech King Julien considers himself to be the King of the Central Park Zoo but is oblivious to the other animals dislike of him He is very lazy childish immature dimwitted and spoiled to the point where he will not offer assistance to ensure his own safety but will help the penguins when push comes to shove He is also very proud of his bottom which he refers to as The Royal Booty Jacobs replaces Sacha Baron Cohen from the movies br Maurice voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson is an aye aye who is King Julien s royal advisor and assistant although he is rarely listened to Maurice accepts his life as a servant and supports Julien more often than in the movies but he occasionally shows disdain towards King Julien and his inconsiderate attitude He seems to be aware of human activities and inventions even though he has spent most of his life away from human civilization Richardson replaces Cedric the Entertainer from the movies br Mort voiced by Andy Richter is an excitable dimwitted accident prone mouse lemur who is Julien s biggest fan and Maurice s best friend Unlike Maurice Mort is fiercely devoted to Julien even displaying a massive obsession with the latter s feet Julien often treats him with contempt although the

size or cuteness Richter reprises his role from the films br Mason voiced by Conrad Vernon and Phil are two intelligent chimpanzees who often help out the penguins on their missions Mason can speak and is very civilized and refined Phil is mute but is the only animal in the zoo that can read Phil is often asked to read something and then he communicates the message to Mason through sign language which is interpreted by Mason Different episodes indicate that they are highly intelligent but they are not openly aware of this themselves Phil is considered for involvement with a space exploration program Vernon reprises his role from the films br Marlene voiced by Nicole Sullivan Dee Bradley Baker in wild form is a female otter who was transferred to the Central Park Zoo from the Monterey Bay Aquarium She is close friends with Skipper and sometimes tags along on his missions but she is often a neutral character who does not take sides between the penguins and the lemurs By being a levelheaded feminine voice of reason she is a counterpoint to Skipper s masculine covert ops character Since she was born in captivity once she sets out of the confines of the zoo she goes wild as she cannot cope with the lack of boundaries Later after Kowalski separated her wild side she becomes afraid as her feral side roams over the city The penguins later put the two Marlenes back together and

the zoo br Max Moon cat voiced by Wayne Knight is the penguins stray cat friend He first meets the four penguins in the episode Launchtime when the penguins end up on a rooftop across the street from

fighting They once beat up Mort which led to Mort growing after he was thrown into Kowalski s latest invention and they then got beat up by Mort to get a mango Julien once gave them many bananas but it is possible that they beat him up due to him giving too much to them They are occasionally used as bodyguards to various characters specifically anyone claiming to be the king Some episodes suggest that the penguins are afraid of the gorillas due to their power but these are outnumbered by episodes in which the penguins easily beat them typically without provocation They also tend to play up the stereotype of Italian American mobsters br Fred voiced by Fred Stoller is a squirrel that takes everything said literally and has a slow monotone speech pattern Fred lives in a park near the zoo He dated Marlene in Otter Things Have Happened but she broke up with him He does not get excited about much and consistently seems unhappy br Burt voiced by John DiMaggio is an Indian elephant who was

that he calls the penguins flightless and that he constantly rubs in the fact that he has far more superior technology than the penguins do br Hans voiced by John DiMaggio is a devious puffin with a history with Skipper that involves a mission in Denmark that somehow resulted in Skipper being declared Public Enemy Number One in the country in question During Huffin Puffin he appeared in New York
