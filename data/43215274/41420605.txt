Borst It was conceived as a four and a half minute animated short from DiRaffaele s efficiency apartment in Studio City Los Angeles dubbed the Doodle Chamber The two had previously met in Burbank while working on an animated series Mad in The protagonists originally unnamed were drawn by DiRaffaele as part of a collaboration with Borst Both were drawn tossing a piece of bread up in the air DiRaffaele explained that the premise came as an extension of his appetite for bread a staple of meals from his Italian American upbringing with friends sometimes calling him a duck The latter responded positively to the drawing saying that he could produce something from it br The short was written by Borst and produced by DiRaffaele in Adobe Flash Professional over the course of two months Daymond who provides the voice of SwaySway was found on a casting call website and invited into the apartment of DiRaffaele to audition Originally a one off Breadwinners premiered at the Midsummer Night Toons short film festival in New York City where they wanted to entertain their colleagues The short was uploaded to YouTube with positive reception and after obtaining to views on its first week Borst explained it just took on a life of its own The creators sent it to Nickelodeon after users expressed wanting more Upon receiving an inquiry from a Nickelodeon executive DiRaffaele was doubtful of the offer joking that he thought it was spam After several months the creators were hired to expand the short into a full fledged series br Actions in the series play out metronomically that is episodes are built around an underlying soundtrack scored by Tommy Sica who used to play in a band with DiRaffaele and recorded before the animation phase This process entails events in the show unfolding at a faster rate than most animated series like it Test audiences composed of children were shown to bounce accordingly to the beat Animation is outsourced to Canada through a Titmouse Inc studio in Vancouver like the short it is also produced in Adobe Animate A cartoony look was explicitly chosen as the art style DiRaffaele noted which gave way to elements such as dark heavy outlines around the characters In addition retro style video games were the inspiration for the art direction with a pixel texture applied to backgrounds and the character s shadows br

Upon its series premiere Breadwinners received negative reviews from critics and audiences alike common criticisms included the show s extensive usage of toilet humor poor visual style and dull episode plots br Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media assessed its reliance on toilet humor as questionable while giving credit to the strength of the protagonists friendship She enjoyed the bread related puns sometimes uttered by characters but acknowledged that they re not likely to strike the same chord of hilarity with your kids New York Daily News writer David Hinckley linked its style of humor as enticing to its target demographic He ultimately stated that it sprinkles in a few grownup jokes particularly bread related puns but it aims mostly at the younger set br Writing for the Los Angeles Times Robert Lloyd found its visual style oddly pleasant and identified a slew of potential influences and references While he saw the humor as loud and often gross the result was basically genial Tori Michel of About com dubbed its use of mixed media interesting yet headache inducing for parents While she called the concept and the characters definitely original she stressed that its crude humor may call for avoiding it altogether for some parents Tom Conroy of Media Life Magazine wrote poorly of the show finding it unfunny throughout He specified its noisy and violent content as too much for little kids as well as being too stupid for big kids br br br Home media br br br DVD releases br br br Explanatory notes br br br br br br External links br br Official website br
