The series centers around Dora M rquez a seven year old Latina girl with a love of embarking on quests related to an activity that she wants to partake of or a place that she wants to go to accompanied by her talking purple backpack and anthropomorphic monkey companion named Boots named for his beloved pair of red boots Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that occur along the way during Dora s travels along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have to solve with assistance from the viewing audience relating to riddles the Spanish language or counting Common rituals may involve Dora s encounters with Swiper a bipedal anthropomorphic masked thieving fox whose theft of the possessions of others must be prevented through fourth wall breaking interaction with the viewer To stop Swiper Dora must say Swiper no swiping three times However on occasions where Swiper steals the belongings of other people the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora locate the stolen items Another obstacle involves encounters with another one of the program s antagonists the Grumpy Old Troll dwelling beneath a bridge that Dora and Boots must cross who challenges them with a riddle that needs to be solved with the viewer s help before permitting them to pass Known for the constant breaking of the fourth wall depicted in every episode the audience is usually presented to two primary landmarks that must be passed before Dora can reach her destination normally being challenged with games or puzzles along the way The episode always ends with Dora successfully reaching the locale singing the We Did It song with Boots in triumph br br br Development br Development of the series came out of Nickelodeon s desire to come up with the next big hit similar to its other successful preschool shows at the time Little Bear and Blue s Clues The creators sought to combine the format of both shows with the narrative focus of Little Bear combined with the interactivity of Blue s Clues The creators further developed the concept by observing preschoolers with the creators coming to the conclusion that they are little explorers br Dora is a Latina According to a Nickelodeon spokesman she was developed to be pan Latina to represent the diversity of Latino cultures Initially the character was not planned to be Latina although after an executive at Nickelodeon attended a conference about the lack of Latino representation the creators were asked if they could include such elements At first there was hesitancy but eventually they realized that they had a great opportunity and the character s design remained Originally Nickelodeon did not want Swiper as researchers stated he was bad modeling and unsettling to kids The creators felt strongly about the inclusion of the antagonist as an integral part of the series he remained in the final show br On numerous occasions television specials have been aired for the series in which the usual events of regular episodes are altered threatened or replaced Usually said specials will present Dora with a bigger more whimsical adventure than usual or with a magical task that must be fulfilled or perhaps even offer a series of different adventures for Boots and Dora to travel through They might be presented with an unusual difficult task such as assisting Swiper in his attempts to be erased from Santa Claus s Naughty List that normally is not featured in average episodes or challenge Dora with a goal that must be achieved such as the emancipation of a trapped mermaid Sometimes the specials have involved the debut of new characters such as the birth of Dora s superpowered twin baby siblings and the introduction of the enchanted anthropomorphic stars that accompany Dora on many of her quests br br On March Mattel and Nickelodeon announced that Dora will receive a tweenage makeover switching from a young age to a teenage attending middle school Initially it was announced that the new look would not be revealed until late but after a short controversy the tween Dora was unveiled on March br On April a CGI opening
