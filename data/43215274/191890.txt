Jr Season sixteen brought three new judges singers Lionel Richie Katy Perry and Luke Bryan The show has been hosted by television presenter Ryan Seacrest throughout its run apart from the show s inaugural season when comedian Brian Dunkleman joined Seacrest as co host br The success of American Idol has been described as unparalleled in broadcasting history A rival TV executive said the series was the most impactful show in the history of television It became a recognized springboard for launching the career of many artists as bona fide stars According to Billboard magazine in its first ten years Idol has spawned Billboard chart toppers and a platoon of pop idols including Kelly Clarkson Carrie Underwood Chris Daughtry Fantasia Ruben Studdard Jennifer Hudson Clay Aiken Adam Lambert and Jordin Sparks while remaining a TV ratings juggernaut For an unprecedented eight consecutive years from the television season through the season either its performance show or result show was ranked number one in U S television ratings br br br History br br American Idol was based on the British show Pop Idol created by Simon Fuller which was in turn inspired by the New Zealand television singing competition Popstars Television producer Nigel Lythgoe saw a version in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain Fuller was inspired by the idea from Popstars of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition He then added other elements including telephone voting by the viewing public which at the time was already in use in shows such as the Eurovision Song Contest the drama of backstories and real life soap opera unfolding in real time Pop Idol debuted in Britain in with Lythgoe as showrunner the executive producer and production leader and Simon Cowell as one of the judges and was successful with the viewing public br In Fuller Cowell and TV producer Simon Jones attempted to sell the Pop Idol format to the United States but the idea was initially met with poor responses from all the television networks including UPN and Fox However Rupert Murdoch head of Fox s parent company was later persuaded to buy the series by his daughter Elisabeth who had seen the British show Although Fox s executives wanted to change the format Murdoch insisted that it should remain the same as the British one One change was nevertheless made due to the presence of multiple time zones in the United States that made it impractical for the country to vote in the same time period an additional half hour results show was therefore added the day following the performance show The show was renamed American Idol The Search for a Superstar and debuted in the summer of Cowell was initially offered the job of showrunner but turned down the offer Lythgoe then took over that position Much to the surprise of Cowell and Fox it became one of the biggest shows of the summer With its successful launch in the summer the show was then moved to January and expanded The show grew into a phenomenon largely due to its personal engagement with the contestants by prompting the viewers to vote and the presence of the acid tongued Cowell as a judge By it had become the most watched show on U S television a position it then held for seven consecutive seasons until br However after a few years of sharp declining ratings starting in with rating falls of over each season the fifteenth season would be its last on Fox ending its run in April In May ABC acquired the rights to the series and the program returned for the television season The first season of the

mote inconsequential Others however thought that the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed It was also described as a sadistic musical bake off and a romp in humiliation Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms The product placement in the show in particular was noted and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union Tribune charged that American Idol is a conniving multimedia monster that has absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil The decision to send the first season winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September attacks in was also poorly received by many Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that The terrorists have won and with a sideswipe at the show s commercialism and voting process that the decision as to who gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the Great American Idol Marketing Mandala is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit Them and a handful of phone redialer geeks who have been clocking up to calls each week for their contestant of choice but who according to Fox are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome br Some of the later writers about the show were more positive Michael Slezak again of Entertainment Weekly thought that for all its bloated synthetic product shilling money making trappings Idol provides a once a year chance for the average American to combat the evils of today s music business Singer Sheryl Crow who was later to act as a mentor on the show however took the view that the show undermines art in every way and promotes commercialism Pop music critic Ann Powers nevertheless suggested that Idol has reshaped the American songbook led us toward a new way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture and connects the classic Hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future Others focused on the personalities in the show Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek accused judge Simon Cowell s cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the wider world a culture of meanness that Simon Cowell has dragged the rest of us in the mud with him Some such as singer John Mayer disparaged the contestants suggesting that those who appeared on Idol are not real artists with self respect br Some in the entertainment industry were critical of the star making aspect of the show Usher a mentor on the show bemoaning the loss of the true art form of music thought that shows like American Idol made it seem so easy that everyone can do it and that it can happen overnight and that television is a lie Musician Michael Feinstein while acknowledging that the show had uncovered promising performers said that American Idol isn t really about music It s about all the bad aspects of the music business the arrogance of commerce this sense of I know what will make this person a star artists themselves don t know That American Idol is seen to be a fast track to success for its contestants has been a cause of resentment for some in the industry LeAnn Rimes commenting on Carrie Underwood winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over Faith Hill in said that Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others Elton John who had appeared as a mentor in the show but turned down an offer to be a judge on American Idol commenting on talent shows in general said that there have been some good acts but the only way to sustain a career is to pay your dues in small clubs American Idol revolutionized American pop culture and the pop idol process and has provided an opportunity for many to bypass the small club scene and allow a much larger audience to participate in and select the next potential chart topping performer br The success of the show s alumni however has led to a more positive assessment of the show and the show was described as having proven it has a valid way to pick talent and a proven way to sell records While the industry is divided on the show success its impact is felt particularly strongly in the country music format According to a CMT exec reflecting on the success of Idol alumni in the country genre if you want to try and get famous fast by going to a cattle call audition on TV Idol reasonably remains the first choice for anyone and that country music and Idol go together well br American Idol was nominated for the Emmy s Outstanding Reality Competition Program for nine years but never won Director Bruce Gower won a Primetime Emmy Award for

Aiken Kellie Pickler and Chris Daughtry who are all from North Carolina In an analysis of the contestants who have appeared in the finals of all seasons of the show up to that point found that have some connection to the Southern United States br The show itself was popular in the Southern United States with households in the Southeastern United States more likely to watch American Idol during the eighth season in and those in the East Central region such as Kentucky were percent more likely to tune into the series Data from Nielsen SoundScan a music sales tracking service showed that of the million CDs sold by Idol contestants through January percent were by contestants with ties to the American South br Theories given for the success of Southerners on Idol have been more versatility with musical genres as the Southern U S is home to several music genre scenes not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business text voting due to the South having the highest percentage of cell phone only households and the strong heritage of music and singing which is notable in the Bible Belt where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing Others also suggest that the Southern character of these contestants appeal to the South as well as local pride According to fifth season winner Taylor Hicks who is from the state of Alabama People in the South have a lot of pride So they re adamant about supporting the contestants who do well from their state or region br For five consecutive seasons starting in the seventh season the title was given to a white male who plays the guitar a trend that Idol pundits call the White guy with guitar or WGWG factor Just hours before the eleventh season finale where Phillip Phillips was named the winner Richard Rushfield author of the book American Idol The Untold Story said You have this alliance between young girls and grandmas and they see it not necessarily as a contest to create a pop star

looking white boys br br br Start order bias br Some fans call the final performance of the night the pimp spot because it usually receives a big boost in votes due to the recency effect By performing first a performer may benefit from the primacy effect but any other early performance may be stifled The second performance spot is sometimes called the un pimp spot because it is the least beneficial

producers A number of contestants have been disqualified for various reasons such as for having an existing contract or undisclosed criminal record although the show has also been accused of a double standard for disqualifying some but not others br Voting results have been a consistent source of controversy The mechanism of voting has aroused considerable criticism most notably in the second season when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote and in the eighth season when the massive increase in text votes fueled the texting controversy Concerns about power voting have been
