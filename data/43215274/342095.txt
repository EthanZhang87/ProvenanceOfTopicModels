s origin dated back during the production of Hanna Barbera s What a Cartoon where Seibert originally wanted Huber to develop a cartoon for the showcase and assigned him with Burnett who was writing for Cow and Chicken at the time to develop a pilot for a potential series Development fell through at the last minute from the result of Warner Bros Animation acquiring Hanna Barbera Cartoons The concept came back when Seibert developed Frederator Studios and was pitched as a short on Nickelodeon s Oh Yeah Cartoons before getting the greenlight in In ChalkZone became the first spin off of Oh Yeah Cartoons to enter production and be greenlit Despite this ChalkZone did not make it to the air until as the initial green light episodes were shortened to due to executive reasons all which were completed by The show s air date was up for debate until the lack of new programming and America s critical situation at the time led the decision to air the series in Frederator Studios announced in that the series had been cancelled at episodes br The show is remembered for featuring one minute music videos sung by Rudy and his friends at the end of each episode Several songs Bill Burnett composed before ChalkZone s production i e Insect Aside and Dream Alotta Dreams were implanted into the series A well liked rumor about the show is that it was based on Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings which Nickelodeon aired in the early s as part of Pinwheel Bill Burnett denied this in a interview claiming that he was not aware of the series existence until after ChalkZone entered production although Burnett did mention that Harold and the Purple Crayon was an influence on Larry s idea for the boy with magic chalk concept A one hour special The Big Blow Up premiered on August The final season featured new character designs with a slimmer line quality and a zooming chalk transition as new artists and overseas studios were used for the remainder of the series br The show had four different variations of the theme song released to the public one from the Nickelodeon album The Newest Nicktoons which used a synthesizer instead of a guitar and had an earlier version of Penny s voice which was a demo Bill Burnett created in order for the song to get the green light an earlier version of the final version from the album ChalkZone In the Zone where the guitar was used and Penny s earlier voice was still used and the final version which was shown on regular episodes Another variation was shown in the pilot which not only featured a slightly different opening sequence and logo from the final series but also features a preparatory track mix of the final version and the second demo albeit with some modified vocals also with Penny s final voice used Bill Burnett s original idea for the concepts score was something in akin to simplistic children s toy instrument melodies to fit the show s children s chalk drawing theme but the Nickelodeon crew suggested a more techno rock based score to give the show a huge contrast from the premise Steve Rucker was brought into the music composition team and some of his compositions were later re written upon request by Burnett and Moon to fit the series better much to his dismay br br br Broadcast br The pilot for the series first aired on December as part of Nickelodeon s annual New Year s Eve block but due to being delayed by Nickelodeon for executive reasons the series made its official premiere on March The premiere became the highest rated premiere in Nickelodeon s history up to that point br The show

Paramount br br br Reception br br br Critical br Joly Herman of Common Sense Media rated the series out of stars saying What makes this show interesting is that it acknowledges that worlds of imagination are available to all of us But while it s true that we love to get lost in a story for a young child getting as lost in a world as Rudy does can be scary Lana Berkowitz from The Houston Chronicle wrote There are flashes of fun in ChalkZone the action moves along and there s no violence But cartoon connoisseurs particularly those who stay tuned after loony SpongeBob SquarePants at p m probably will need something more intriguing to keep their attention Berkowitz further added After a clever setup Chalkzone settles into a predictable zone with stories that could easily be erased from memory Allison Fass of The New York Times praised the imagination and creativity in the series but she opined that series creator Bill Burnett s message We have to take responsibility for what we create may be a little mature for children br br br Awards and nominations br br br br br br External links br br ChalkZone at Frederator Studios br ChalkZone at IMDb
