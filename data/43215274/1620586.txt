the ocean by a storm He encased himself and his sky bison Appa in suspended animation in an iceberg near the South Pole Shortly afterward Fire Lord Sozin the ruler of the Fire Nation launched a world war to expand his nation s empire Knowing that the Avatar must be an Air Nomad he carried out a genocide against the Air Nomads which he timed with the arrival of a comet that gives firebenders tremendous power A hundred years later siblings Katara and Sokka teenagers of the Southern Water Tribe accidentally discover Aang and revive him br In the first season Aang travels with Katara and Sokka to the Northern Water Tribe so he can learn waterbending and be prepared to defeat the Fire Nation Prince Zuko the banished son of the current Fire Lord Ozai pursues them accompanied by his uncle Iroh hoping to capture the Avatar in order to restore his honor Aang is also pursued by Zhao a Fire Nation admiral aspiring to win Ozai s favor When his navy attacks the Northern Water Tribe

br br Development br br br Conception and production br br The co creators and producers of Avatar The Last Airbender Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko met at a Halloween party in during their time as students in the Rhode Island School of Design and began their professional partnership later that year when Konietzko assisted DiMartino in painting backgrounds and cels for the latter s student film DiMartino and Konietzko moved to Los Angeles in and respectively to pursue careers in the animation industry In between jobs DiMartino animated a short titled Atomic Love that he pitched as a TV series but was unsuccessful due to the amount of robot based animated series already in development During Konietzko s stint as art director on Invader Zim he and DiMartino formulated the idea of pitching a coming to age series based on their childhoods but were too busy with their respective jobs to solidify the concept When Invader Zim was abruptly canceled in January Konietzko declared to DiMartino his resolution to get their idea made at all cost br By this time Konietzko had established a good relationship with Nickelodeon head of development Eric Coleman who was interested in the prospect of Konietzko creating and pitching his own show Upon the end of his job on Invader Zim Konietzko met with Coleman introduced him to DiMartino and discussed their intent to create a series that held heart and integrity while meeting the network s commercial requirements Although their meeting went well Coleman revealed that the network was not looking for coming of age stories based on human characters He added that the network was following the success of the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter film series and was thus searching for non violent action and adventure concepts with an emphasis on legends and lore Lastly he established that the show would require the point of view of either a kid hero or a non human character emphasizing that middle aged human main characters would be off brand for Nickelodeon Konietzko concluded the meeting with the promise of a pitch along those directives within a month br DiMartino and Konietzko indiscriminately laid out their conceptual sketches in their effort to establish a new idea Among them was a sketch that Konietzko created during his time on Invader Zim which featured a robot cyclops monkey with an arrow on his head and holding a staff a balding middle aged man in a futuristic outfit and a bipedal polar bear dog hybrid Konietzko cited Cowboy Bebop as the sketch s primary influence describing the sketch as a half baked attempt at a similar science fiction adventure concept Recalling Coleman s advice against middle aged main characters Konietzko redrew the human character as a boy but retained his baldness and transferred the robot s staff and arrows to him After adding the new drawing to the collection of sketches Konietzko began drawing other fanciful animal hybrids which culminated in a drawing of a good natured and nomadic Huck Finnesque boy herding a group of flying bison manatee hybrids The sketch was influenced by the works of Hayao Miyazaki of whom Konietzko and DiMartino were fans br DiMartino drew inspiration for what would become the Southern Water Tribe from a documentary on the Imperial Trans Antarctic Expedition and he pitched Konietzko the idea of a group of people similarly trapped in the South Pole Two weeks after their meeting with Coleman Konietzko was suddenly inspired by DiMartino s idea and formulated a concept of a group of kids in the South Pole who were terrorized by fire people and rescued by the young nomad from his earlier drawing Konietzko and DiMartino reconvened that evening and began creating the series setting over the next two weeks Although DiMartino and Konietzko were themselves fans of the two successful British fantasy series that Nickelodeon sought to emulate the pair chose to differentiate their own series by inserting influences from Asian cultures and philosophies traditional martial arts yoga anime and Hong Kong cinema The co creators successfully pitched the concept to Coleman with early sketches of Aang Katara and Sokka three color images depicting the desired action adventure and magic aspects and a description of the series characters setting and full story arc The series was introduced to the public in a teaser reel at Comic Con and premiered on February br According to head writer Aaron Ehasz Konietzko and DiMartino originally envisioned the series being three seasons long but Nickelodeon asked Ehasz what his ideas for a fourth season would be and he later discussed these ideas with both Konietzko and DiMartino Ehasz believed that a fourth season would be created but this plan was interrupted when Konietzko and DiMartino became occupied with assisting M Night Shyamalan on the film The Last Airbender Ehasz says that Shyamalan insisted they create a fourth season instead but Konietzko and DiMartino wanted to focus on the live action film as they were executive producers on the project However Konietzko and DiMartino have denied this and claim that a fourth season was never considered by themselves nor by Nickelodeon br br br Pilot br A pilot episode for the series was made in It was animated by Tin House Inc written by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and directed by Dave Filoni Mitchel Musso voiced Aang in this pilot but was later replaced by Zach Tyler Eisen when the show began production In the episode Sokka and his sister Kya renamed to Katara by the time the series aired must travel the world to find masters for Aang who is the Avatar however they must evade a critical foe Prince Zuko of the Fire Nation who wants to capture Aang br This episode was first publicly released as one of the extras in the NTSC season DVD box set which were not available with the previously released individual volumes As the PAL box set lacks extras the episode was not made available on DVD in PAL regions The episode was released with audio commentary from the creators which unlike commentary on other episodes in the season is not possible to disable on the DVD set On June the unaired pilot was made available with and without commentary for the first time via the iTunes Store br In the pilot was shown on Twitch br br br Influences br br The series is notable for borrowing extensively from East Asian art and mythology for its universe especially Chinese culture Its creators employed cultural consultant Edwin Zane and Chinese calligrapher Siu Leung Lee to help determine its art direction and settings The creators have cited Chinese art and history Hinduism Taoism and Buddhism and yoga as the strongest influences on the series br Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn created the series music and sound design together in the early developmental stages and then went on to divide the tasks Zuckerman taking on the musical responsibility and Wynn the sound design They experimented with a wide range of instruments including the guzheng pipa and duduk to match the show s Asia influenced setting br The art style of the fictitious locations used in the series are based on real locations in Asia Sites such as the Forbidden City and the Great Wall of China in Beijing were inspirations for the Earth Kingdom city of Ba Sing Se and Water Tribe locations were based on Inuit and Sireniki cultures According to writer Aaron Ehasz early Fire Nation designs were based on Japanese culture To avoid accidentally making broad statements they redesigned many settings and peoples to be more broadly inspired For the final design the creators went with a more Chinese style for the Fire Nation s clothing and architecture For instance the Fire Temple was based on the Yellow Crane Tower as its flame like architectural elements were a perfect motif for the Fire Nation architecture according to the creators br The gestures used by the bender characters are derived from Chinese martial arts for which the creators employed Sifu Kisu of the Harmonious Fist Chinese Athletic Association as a consultant Each fighting style is unique to the benders who use them or characters who are aligned to a certain element For example practitioners of waterbending use movements influenced by tai chi and focused on alignment body structure breath and visualization Hung Gar was the inspiration for practitioners of earthbending and was chosen for its firmly rooted stances and powerful strikes as a representation of the solidity of earth Northern Shaolin which uses strong arm and leg movements was chosen to represent firebending Bagua which uses dynamic circular movements and quick directional changes was used for airbending The Chu Gar Southern Praying Mantis style can be seen practiced by the earthbender Toph who develops a unique fighting style as a result of her blindness Asian cinema influenced the presentation of these martial art bending moves br br br Themes br The series addresses many topics rarely touched on in youth entertainment including issues relating to war genocide imperialism colonialism and totalitarianism gender discrimination and female empowerment marginalization and oppression spirituality as well as the philosophical questions surrounding fate destiny and free will br The show is set during a period in which the world is engulfed in an imperialistic war initiated by the Fire Nation While war is a constant backdrop the show depicts these effects through the eyes of common people the oppressed Earth Kingdom citizens as well as indoctrinated Fire Nation schoolchildren to show how war makes victims of everyone And while the Fire Nation is presented as the instigator of violence the show also depicts the systemic inequality experienced by residents in the Earth Kingdom city of Ba Sing Se as well as the nefarious activities of the city s secret police These situations show the corrupting nature of power and the nuances of good and evil The show introduces viewers to genocide early on when protagonist Aang visits his former home in the Southern Air Temple He arrives to discover his people have been massacred and displays a range of emotions from rage to sadness br The character Zuko and his relationship with his father and Uncle Iroh is the main redemption arc of the series and represents the show s message that destiny and fate are not binding or set by other people but can be changed In season two Zuko struggles to conform to the destiny and path determined by his father but Iroh prods him asking who are you what do you want br The show also represents a diverse cast of characters in order to tackle the issue of marginalization For example in introducing a blind character like Toph and a paraplegic boy like Teo the show depicted characters with vulnerabilities overcoming their physical and societal limitations This is also true when it comes to the show s female characters For example female protagonist Katara faces systemic sexism when she reaches the Northern Water Tribe to learn waterbending In another instance her brother Sokka is initially dismissive of the all female Kyoshi Warriors but learns to respect and appreciate their skills According to Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku these themes represent the show s message that it is more important to be oneself than to hew to societal expectations br br br Reception br br br Ratings br Avatar The Last Airbender was the highest rated animated television series in its demographic at its premiere an average of million viewers watched each new episode It had million viewers for its highest rated episode and was a highly rated part of the Nicktoons lineup beyond its to year old target demographic A one hour special The
