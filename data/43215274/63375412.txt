late night talk shows talk variety shows such as The Tonight Show traditionally open with a comedy monologue performed by the program host Television stand up reached a peak of popularity on British schedules with the ITV programme The Comedians Their style of comedy was swept away almost entirely in the Britain of the early s when a new generation of stand ups challenged what they saw as racist and sexist humour and revolutionised the form under the banner alternative comedy In the US stand up comedy programs became popular on many cable television channels beginning in the mid s as such brick wall shows nicknamed for the stereotypical use of a fake brick wall as a backdrop were cheap to produce and air Stand up humour later had mixed fortunes on the small screen often shunted away to

on television Early children s programming often recycled theatrical cartoons later low budget animation produced especially for television dominated Saturday morning network programming in the US br br br Impact on society br br br Audience interpretations br Television comedy is described by media scholar Bore as a way to bring audiences to a collective sense in viewing and enjoying commonly watched programs across societies One specific way this can be done is through laugh tracks While some view laugh tracks as ways to allow audiences to lightheartedly poke fun at characters others see them as ways to restrict viewers to only laugh at certain moments For the latter it can also be seen as collectively taking over the real laughter of viewers watching from home br Another aspect of audience s interpretations of comedy on television refer to how far writers go when poking fun at characters or real life people Saturday Night Live found itself in controversy when a sketch was performed imitating politician David Paterson for both his political abilities and his blindness This brought up the idea of two central forms of humour that comedies will use one prioritizes the joke itself and how it generates laughter from an audience while the other prioritizes the personal characteristics of whom an actor is impersonating br br br Changing norms throughout comedy s history br Comedy has been a television genre prominent for introducing concepts that typically do not align with series respective social norms One of these concepts is same sex intimacy The appearance of these scenes were not popular in the early days of comedy and in shows such as Roseanne and Ellen ratings could be changed up to TV and receive a mature content warning as a result Ellen DeGeneres famously came out on her show although ABC cancelled Ellen one year later with some gay rights groups protesting this decision br I Love Lucy became the first sitcom to have a multilingual couple Lucy was American and spoke English while Ricky was Cuban and spoke Spanish The relationship between spouses in sitcoms has also changed throughout history In earlier shows the women would be the ones who made comedic errors while the men having more dominance would become upset at their wives Some more recent shows such as The King of Queens would have the opposite roles with the male characters making more mistakes while their more sophisticated wives would become upset at their husbands for their actions br br br See also br Britcom list of British sitcoms br German television comedy br Lists of
