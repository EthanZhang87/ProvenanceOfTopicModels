br br br Production br Craig Bartlett the show s creator was born in Seattle Washington which he used as inspiration for the backdrop of Hey Arnold He graduated from Anacortes High School and obtained a degree in communications from The Evergreen State College in Olympia Washington During high school and college he studied painting and sculpture at the Museum Art School in Portland Originally Bartlett intended to become a painter in the th century sense but he became interested in animation during a trip to Italy His first post graduation job was at Will Vinton Productions a claymation studio in Portland br In Bartlett relocated to Los Angeles where he joined a team developing claymation cutaways for the television program Pee wee s Playhouse The short segments centered on a character named Penny and her friend Arnold Bartlett later made three Arnold shorts Arnold Escapes from Church The Arnold Waltz and Arnold Rides a Chair the latter aired as a filler short on Sesame Street in The same year Arnold comic strips also appeared in Simpsons Illustrated magazine by Bartlett s brother in law Matt Groening the creator of The Simpsons br Bartlett later joined the staff for Rugrats where he served as story editor for three years In he teamed up with five writers from Rugrats to develop animated projects for Nickelodeon These meetings were generally difficult and the writers became frustrated Bartlett recalled Our ideas were OK but such a large and motley group couldn t get far at pitch meetings Network execs got migraines just counting us coming in the door As a last resort Bartlett played the Penny tapes intending to highlight the Penny character However the executives were more impressed by Arnold despite his status as a minor character After the meeting the group began developing Arnold creating his personality Bartlett stated We did a lot of talking about who Arnold is We came up with a reluctant hero who keeps finding himself responsible for solving something making the right choices doing the right thing After creating ideas for Arnold Bartlett began work on the supporting characters drawing influence from his childhood A lot of the characters are an amalgam of people I knew when I was a kid The girls in Hey Arnold are girls that either liked or didn t like me when I was in school br In Bartlett began work on the pilot episode of Hey Arnold A year later the network decided to begin work on the series The ten minute pilot episode titled Arnold was shown in theaters on July before Nickelodeon s first feature length film its adaptation of Harriet the Spy Apart from the animation style Nick s Arnold wears a sweater with his plaid shirt untucked resembling a kilt Only Arnold s cap remains unchanged from his original clay animation wardrobe br Hey Arnold was Nickelodeon s first animated series to feature kids voiced by actual children instead of adults As a result of this many of the boy characters including Arnold himself were recast at least once throughout the show s run due to the child actors reaching puberty One notable exception to this was Jamil Walker Smith the voice of Gerald After Smith s voice changed auditions for a new actor were held but the crew felt none of them were suitable replacements As a result Smith was kept on as the voice of Gerald whose voice subsequently changed in universe with the episode Gerald s Tonsils This would last until The Jungle Movie which featured Benjamin Flores Jr as the voice of Gerald instead br Production of Hey Arnold wrapped on December A dispute over

his friends demonstrated that the city is also a place with endless possibilities myths and characters Not that the show encouraged anything bad the kids always knew where to go and where not to go
