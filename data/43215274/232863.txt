to the creation of The Fairly OddParents Butch Hartman was working at Cartoon Network on Dexter s Laboratory and Johnny Bravo In Fred Seibert contacted Hartman about pitching ideas for Seibert s new company Frederator Incorporated as a part of their Oh Yeah Cartoons series which the studio was developing for Nickelodeon Hartman initially declined the offer Several months later Johnny Bravo finished and Hartman decided to create his own series instead of going back to working for other studios br br Hartman started developing his own series by drawing a picture of a little boy who would become Timmy Turner Hartman was originally going to name him Mike after his brother Mike Hartman but they had a fight that day so Hartman named him after his other brother Timmy Hartman instead Hartman wanted Timmy to be able to go anywhere because he never wanted to be stuck for a story transition Hartman was originally going to give Timmy science powers but decided against it due to Dexter s Laboratory having recently come out Instead he decided to give Timmy a magic friend He drew Venus later renamed Wanda first and then decided that because he had never heard of a fairy godfather before to draw Cosmo After coming up with the entire premise for the cartoon in about fifteen minutes Hartman first pitched the idea to Hanna Barbera and then to Cartoon Network both of whom turned it down Hartman then went back to Seibert at Nickelodeon and successfully pitched it to them for Oh Yeah Cartoons br While in early development the series was titled The Fairy GodParents and then it was briefly changed to Oh My GodParents Bill Burnett came up with the title The Fairly OddParents which they ended up sticking with Hartman originally created The Fairly OddParents as a seven minute short film which was one of the thirty nine short cartoons created for Oh Yeah Cartoons Hartman made ten seven minute short films of The Fairly OddParents in total for Oh Yeah Cartoons which aired on Nickelodeon from September to March Due to the success of the shorts Nickelodeon picked up The Fairly OddParents for a full length series alongside fellow Oh Yeah Cartoons ChalkZone and My Life as a Teenage Robot In Nickelodeon ordered seven minute episodes for the series first season which premiered on March just one week after the final Oh Yeah short in the half hour before fellow Nicktoon Invader Zim made its debut br Unlike the later series the animation in the original shorts is not as smooth and the designs are notably different including Timmy s parents Mr and Mrs Turner who are only seen from the neck down with their faces hidden in the pilot episodes and appear to be more intelligent than they appeared to be in the proceeding series yet still easily duped by Vicky s abhorrent actions Other notable differences include Timmy Turner who was voiced by Mary Kay Bergman in the Oh Yeah shorts rather than Tara Strong in the series Strong would dub over Bergman s dialogue in the Oh Yeah shorts to establish better continuity Cosmo is significantly more intelligent than he appears to be in the proceeding series while Wanda is shown to be ditzy Vicky is also much less evil than in the current series she has a little brother in the pilot episode before it was changed to a little sister later on in the shorts she also calls Timmy by his name as opposed to the more
