of first run episodes airing weekdays Reruns then aired until December Reruns later aired on Nick GAS from January to April br The first two seasons were hosted by Lew Schneider and taped in a small New York studio with no live audience and pre recorded crowd noise For the third season the show moved to the newly opened Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios in Orlando Florida this time with a studio audience and Robb Edward Morris taking Schneider s place as host New York based disc jockey Maria Milito was the announcer for the entire run br NOTE All times are Eastern br br br Gameplay br br br Main Game br Three contestants each seated at either a red green or blue desk competed to answer trivia questions and acquire squares on a x split flap game board Seven grade levels covering elementary school and grades through ran along the top of the board six categories plus a special elective ran down the left The contestants goal was to answer enough questions to light every category and grade level on the desk br In the first season each episode had a different set of seven categories In the second and third seasons one category was always a Special Elective represented by a checkmark br br br Categories br History br Music br Science br Home Ec br Geography br P E br Mathematics br English br Arts br Social Studies br Current Events br Most squares contained questions which were played as toss ups and were open to all three contestants If a contestant answered correctly they won that square and control of the board and the category and grade level lit up on their desk An incorrect response allowed either of the other two contestants a chance to buzz in once the host had re read the question If no one answered correctly the square turned black and could not be selected again br Several squares contained other items that altered the outcome of the game br br Take Allowed a contestant to steal one square from the opponent of their choice br Lose Forced a contestant to give up one square of their choice which would be placed back on the board as another question or item br Free Gave the square to the contestant who picked it without having to answer a question br Fire Triggered a Fire Drill physical challenge for all three contestants br The first contestant to light all squares on their desk or the contestant who had lit the most squares at the end of two rounds if no one had all won and advanced to the Honors Round In the event of a tie for most lights at the end of the game the contestant who had claimed the most squares in their current color on the category board won the game The other two contestants received and two or three consolation prizes All contestants received a pair of British Knights sneakers br br br Fire Drills br Like other Nickelodeon game shows Make the Grade allowed contestants to participate in sometimes messy challenge stunts called Fire Drills When a contestant uncovered a Fire square on the category board all three participated in this challenge The first contestant to complete the Fire Drill earned the right to claim any one of the three desks as their own the second place finisher selected one of the remaining two and the third place finisher took the last desk by default br Lit categories and grade levels corresponded to the desk at which they had been earned not to any particular contestant the same was true for squares marked on the category board Because of this rule a contestant could do well in answering questions but lose their lead if they failed to win a Fire Drill br br br Honors Round br The day s champion had a chance to win cash and or prizes by answering seven questions in seconds Three categories were offered each containing questions from all subjects used in the main game and the champion selected one at the beginning of the round br br br First season br Each subject contained only one question Missing or passing a question moved the champion on to the next subject A miss put the current subject out of play but a pass allowed the champion to redo the subject with the same question after attempting all seven subjects if time permitted The first six correct answers awarded each while the seventh increased the bonus round total to br br br Second and third seasons br Passed or missed questions kept the current subject in play but the host still moved on to the next one After playing through all seven subjects the champion could return to any they had passed or missed receiving a new question in each The first six correct answers were still worth each but the prize for the seventh was a trip to Universal Studios Florida rather than a cash bonus br br br Time filling segments University Round br In the first season where the game finished early and there was additional time to fill in the program it was filled with clips of host Schneider going to malls and asking questions and during the third season studio audience members were asked questions to win T shirts and other small prizes On a few episodes a contestant won the game so early that another game got started with a second set of contestants playing the second game in abbreviated time On one occasion where the game ended early the contestants played what would have been that rounds Fire Drill stunt prior to the Honors Round where the winner earned another towards their winnings br In second season episodes a University Round would occasionally be played in which the day s winning contestant took part in A series of five questions were asked for and respectively The contestant could stop and take the money at any time Any cash and prizes won in the earlier rounds was safe and never risked so any cash won in the University Round was added to the winnings from the earlier rounds br br br br br br External links br Nickelodeon Games Sports br Make the Grade at IMDb br TV com Page
