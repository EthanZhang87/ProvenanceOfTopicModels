handyman often causing massive disasters on and off the set to the consternation of his co workers and family Many Tool Time viewers assume that the accidents on the show are done on purpose to demonstrate the consequences of using tools improperly Many of Tim s accidents are caused by his devices being used in an unorthodox or overpowered manner designed to illustrate his mantra More power
