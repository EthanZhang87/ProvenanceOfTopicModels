DVD boxed set controversy br The Secret World of Alex Mack during a British release of the series on a DVD boxed set received a rating of from the British Board of Film Classification BBFC a rating considered restrictive particularly since the series was initially aimed at preteens It was eventually revealed by the BBFC that the rating was applied to the boxed set because of a season episode called Shock Value where Alex is seen climbing into a clothesdryer from the pilot According to the BBFC The presentation of this behaviour is comic and no negative consequences are shown which would warn young viewers of the potential dangers of hiding in such appliances While fatal incidents of children trapped in washing machines or fridges are rare there remains sufficient cause for serious concern The distributor indicated that they would be happy to accept a higher certificate rather than cutting the episode The TV series is rather dated and would not have much appeal to a young audience when compared to current children s TV programmes In addition as the work was being targeted at an adult nostalgia market children would not be the natural audience br br br Book series br A
