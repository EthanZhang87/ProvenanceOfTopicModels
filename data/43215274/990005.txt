Jeff Sutphen as host with the revival airing from June to July The series was originally recorded at Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios in Orlando Florida The revival episodes were filmed on stage at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles br Children with special skills or unique achievements compete as contestants on the show while a panel of four Nickelodeon celebrities try to guess the predetermined phrase that describes the contestant s talent The series is a loose adaptation of What s My Line and I ve Got a Secret both established panel shows created by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman br Shortly after the series aired its last first run episode Figure It Out began airing repeats on Nick GAS until the network ceased at the end of on Dish Network Several episodes of the Sanders hosted series also aired in as part of The s Are All That a s oriented rerun block that aired on TeenNick br br br Gameplay br Each episode has two sets of three timed rounds originally all seconds in length for the revival series rounds two and three were played for seconds in which the panel takes turns asking yes or no questions to try to guess the contestant s talent For every yes answer the panelist s turn continues Once a panelist asks a question with a no answer their turn ends and the next panelist s turn starts If at any time a panelist cannot think of a question on their turn they may pass their turn to the next panelist Each time a panelist mentions a word that is part of the phrase that describes the secret talent the word is turned over on a game board displaying the puzzle This game board was referred to as Billy the Answer Head during the original series run and is known simply as the It Board in the show s later adaptation br This game board shows which words of the phrase are guessed along with blanks denoting words that the panel did not solve Prepositions and articles such as of and an are provided automatically During the very early episodes of the show synonyms of words that were on the board were accepted by the judges e g A panelist revealing the word song by saying the word carol and another episode featured a panelist revealing the word tossing by saying the word throw This was later changed to a panelist having to say the exact word in a contestant s talent in order for that word to be revealed on the board br The contestant wins a prize after each round that their talent remains unguessed The prize for winning the third round is a trip In Season prizes consisted mainly of leftover props from then defunct Nickelodeon shows such as Double Dare Legends of the Hidden Temple and Global Guts Merchandise prizes such as a Nintendo and gift cards for stores including Kids Foot Locker Toys R Us and Loew s began to appear as prizes during later seasons If Round ends with at least one word left unrevealed each panelist takes one final guess as to what the contestant s talent is any correct words given during the final guess are revealed as during the game The game ends when a panelist either guesses the secret talent or if no panelist guesses the secret talent correctly after the last guess stage br During each Round the panelists receive one clue as a hint to one of the words of the secret phrase The clue usually takes the form of physical objects such as dates to indicate a clue about calendars sounds rarely used the clue cano seasons featured messy clues erupting out of the clue boxes all over the panel making them just as messy as a sliming especially in the Sutphen era which made the panel cautious when opening the clue boxes or pantomime the Charade Brigade Season Clue Force Seasons usually two or three cast members that act out a word from the phrase during Round with Clue Force pictionary was sometimes used instead of pantomime At the start of the second and third rounds a recap of two or three clues are shown on the monitor next to the contestant and host br At the end of the game after the secret talent is revealed the contestant demonstrates or displays their skill and discusses it with the host and panel br br br Secret Slime Action br In each game from the start of round a randomly selected member of the studio audience plays for a prize a merchandise prize such as a Nintendo or a mountain bike in season or a Figure It Out branded article of clothing in seasons If at least one or more panelists perform the Secret Slime Action those panelists will be slimed by the end of round especially when one of the panelists tries to break the rules and get a second chance during season the secret slime action could be triggered anytime after the end of round including between rounds and when the contestant is performing their secret and the audience member wins that prize J the regular announcer for the original show would disclose what the Secret Slime Action was for each episode in which he appeared br The action designated as the Secret Slime Action is typically simple and almost guaranteed touching a clue looking to the left which was reflexive as clues were commonly wheeled out on a small track from a tunnel to the panel s left using the phrase Are you or Is it looking to the audience behind the panel who was sometimes used for clues saying I don t know which panelist Danny Tamberelli was notable for saying out loud whenever he got confused having a certain name and even being a panelist For example Steve Burns from Blue s Clues was slimed because the Secret Slime Action was having a blue dog Alex Heartman from Power Rangers Samurai was slimed because the Secret Slime Action was wearing a red unitard to work Jade Ramsey from House of Anubis was slimed because the Secret Slime Action was having an identical twin sister Ryan Potter from Supah Ninjas was slimed because the Secret Slime Action was being a supah ninja and in the second game of the first episode of the Revival the entire panel was slimed because the Secret Slime Action was wearing underwear br Some Actions are logically not able to be forced such as thinking about coconuts or thinking about mushroom soup Especially in the latter seasons a successful Action has mostly been a foregone conclusion the variables have only been when it will be triggered and by whom not necessarily a panelist br When the Secret Slime Action is triggered all play stops including the clock while the panelist is slimed the action is revealed and a replay of the sliming is shown after which gameplay resumes The host knows of the action and sometimes tricks the panelists into performing it by making them say or touch something in one episode the action was touching your head Sanders touched her head and said Have you done something with your hair which caused the panel to touch their heads in reaction br br br Word of Honor br In the revival prior to each game one word of either the first or second contestant s secrets may be designated as the Word of Honor Should the panel guess this word the contestant is slimed As the contestant is slimed gameplay and the clock are paused Once the Word of Honor was revealed either by a panel guess or the contestant filling in unguessed words it would be out of play for the rest of the show br br br Panelists br Either three or all four panelists are taken from Nickelodeon shows airing at the time Regulars during the original run included All That cast members Amanda Bynes Lori Beth Denberg Kevin Kopelow and Danny Tamberelli who also starred in the Nickelodeon program The Adventures of Pete Pete Bynes occasionally Kopelow and Tamberelli were notorious for frequently asking silly questions and acting goofy while Denberg was the serious panelist who asked well thought out questions and frequently was the one to guess the secret phrase during the final guesses The only four panelists who appeared on every season of the original run of the show were Kopelow Bynes Tamberelli and Irene Ng from The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo br The first seat on the panel was usually reserved for an adult panelist either an adult actor from a Nickelodeon program usually Kopelow or a non Nickelodeon celebrity such as Taran Noah Smith of Home Improvement In several episodes CatDog rendered in CGI and Cousin Skeeter a puppet character were panelists In Seasons and the first seat was not reserved for an adult but Matt Bennett from Victorious and Ciara Bravo from Big Time Rush regularly appeared in the first position Other guest panelists included Coolio Colin Mochrie regular on Whose Line Is It Anyway and professional wrestlers Chris Jericho The Giant and Hacksaw Jim Duggan br In one episode of the second season for the first half Lori Beth Denberg hosted the show and Summer Sanders was

Brigade can have family members of the panelists and the host Figure It Out Family Style also features Little Billy If the panelists figured out the contestants secret then Little Billy a miniature version of Billy the Answer Head with hair and on wheels would come out Summer reads a question about the family s talent and then each panelist will try to guess one impossible answer If they cannot figure it out no panel ever did since they simply treated it as a free for all most times by guessing answers intended for comedic response then the answer in Little Billy would reveal and which gives the family another chance to win a prize usually the Figure It Out apparel used for the Secret Slime Action Rounds For certain episodes J s mother Joanne Dumas filled in as the show s announcer br Season fall The show was re titled Figure It Out Wild Style and focused solely on talents involving animals in addition Billy the Answer Head was reshaped into various animals During these episodes

is the only Figure It Out season that does not include Lori Beth Denberg as she had moved on to work on The Steve Harvey Show During these episodes seven different panelists such as Steve Burns Shane Sweet Erin J Dean Christy Knowings Irene Ng Kevin Kopelow and Kareem Blackwell permanently replaced Denberg in the chair she always sat in This season also featured recurring panelist appearances from legendary animal expert and TV personality Jungle Jack Hanna who would be holding an animal in the first half before having the animal taken backstage so he had a chance to be slimed with the rest of the panelists br Season summer The show reverted to its original title and Jeff Sutphen took over as host Elle Young took over as the announcer The set host panelists theme music and logo were all
