players needed to maneuver around climb over the Skeleton Stalagmites and activate three actuators including one at the end of this first leg Avalanche Peak with a frozen lava storm raining down on contestants This in turns opened the Ice Portal at the base of the Crag where the second player awaited Players then had to cross some stepping stones across The Glacial Gorge and climb two vertical rock climbing walls dubbed The Vertical Freeze to reach the Crystal Peak and hit their final actuator to finalize the results br Semifinal episodes then required all four players to climb the Crag A new section was added The Mad Mesas which was a path of boulders that the contestant needed to run over to reach the second player at the base of the Switchbacks Their final actuator would open up a trapdoor in Avalanche Peak that lead them to a spiraling Swirling Vortex slide that lead them behind the main facade of the Crag and to the third player who had to navigate the Crag Caverns Once they had maneuvered this maze they needed to traverse the entire Glacial Gorge around the entire mountain and reach the base of the mountain which would finally open the Ice Portal and allow the fourth player to climb the Vertical Freeze to victory br In Aggro Bowls a control panel had been placed at the start of the Crag Caverns where the third player from each team could control additional snow and hail that could challenge their respective opponents climbing the Mesas and Switchbacks Once the second player made the exchange with the third he or she could take over control and release Arctic Steam in the Crag Caverns and drop an avalanche on the fourth players climbing the Vertical Freeze br For each victory teams received a white piece of the Aggro Crag The champions of the tournament received all three including a considerably larger third piece which could be put together to form a miniature Aggro Crag as a trophy along with the grand prize of a trip on the Nickelodeon Family
