The Wubbulous World of Dr Seuss is an American children s puppet television series based on characters created by Dr Seuss produced by The Jim Henson Company It aired from October to May on Nickelodeon It combines live puppets with digitally animated backgrounds and in its first season refashioning characters and themes from the original Dr Seuss books into new stories that often retained much of the flavor of Dr Seuss own works br br br Format br In many respects seasons one and two of the program are very different shows The two seasons have completely different intro and outro credit sequences and songs reflecting their differing orientations The virtual settings seen in this show are created by Jim Henson s Creature Shop br br br Season one br Each episode is a self contained story based on Dr Seuss characters such as Yertle the Turtle and Horton the Elephant The unifying element is that the stories are introduced and commented on by The Cat in the Hat performed by Bruce Lanoil who serves as host of the show Occasionally The Cat in the Hat himself appears in the episode reprising his role as a bit of a trickster as in his original eponymous books ex episode The Simplifier br Season one is notable for hewing closely to many of the themes of the original Dr Seuss stories which often had a strong moral overtone As a result some episodes have distinctly dark or sinister elements which like some Dr Seuss books may not be appropriate for younger children br br br Season two br For season two the show was reworked along the lines of a more traditional children s program The Cat in the Hat now performed by Martin P Robinson lives in a playhouse with his Little Cats A through Z and the often flustered Terrence McBird performed by Anthony Asbury Aside from the residents of the house there are usually visitors based on Dr Seuss characters Each episode revolves around a theme such as family health art and features one or two songs about the theme A closing song was also added at the end of each episode The action shifts between The Cat in the Hat and what is going on in his playhouse and shorter related story interludes which he shows to the audience by means of his Wubbuloscope These story vignettes take place in various locations like br br Seussville a contemporary city where Sarah Hall Small and her family live br Jungle of Nool a jungle that is home to Horton the Elephant Morton the Elephant Bird Jane Kangaroo Junior Kangaroo Yertle the Turtle the Wickershams and the Sneels br Kingdom of Didd a Renaissance like kingdom that is ruled by King Derwin br Mount Crumpit home of the Grinch and his dog Max br The tone of season two is much lighter as the result of bringing in a number of comedic writers such as Adam Felber and Mo Rocca The Cat in the Hat is no longer a trickster and instead has assumed the role of a friendly and enthusiastic host who is helpful nurturing and sweet Although this revised format only lasted one season before the show ended the format was recognizably previously featured in Jim Henson Productions next children s program Bear in the Big Blue House which aired on Disney Channel br br br
