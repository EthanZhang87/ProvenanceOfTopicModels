could be the basis for a show They started working on the idea of a family being observed in a mockumentary style show They later decided that it could be a show about three families and their experiences It was originally called My American Family and the camera crew was originally supposed to have been run by a fictitious Dutch filmmaker named Geert Floortje who had lived as a teenaged exchange student with the Pritchetts and had developed a crush on Claire while Mitchell had developed a crush on him The producers later felt that this component was unnecessary and it was scrapped

with each showrunner supervising half the episodes Chris and I are both strong opinionated people and we very very quickly realized it doesn t make sense to sit here and debate each other and waste time Levitan told The Hollywood Reporter in We often come at it from different points of view so we said Let s just switch off who has final say br br br Litigation br br In the first season the adult cast was paid a range of roughly to per episode As a result of the show s success the cast attempted to renegotiate their contracts in the summer of to obtain higher per episode fees but talks broke

per episode to with increases every season plus a percentage of residual profits O Neill had already been earning an episode so his salary was lowered to parity with his co stars but with a larger

Family s sophomore season sings with ingenious sitcom structure and an ensemble in perfect comedic harmony even if the tunes are a little familiar Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the second season four out of four stars saying Not since Frasier has a sitcom offered such an ideal blend of heart and smarts or proven itself so effortlessly adept at so many comic variations from subtle wordplay to

delivering inspired farce and making it look effortless Slant Magazine reviewer Peter Swanson wrote that while the first episode was the type of wacky location stunt that s usually reserved for the fifth or sixth season of a dying sitcom the following episodes have been better but they re still uneven He also criticized the writers for relying too much on stunt episodes and celebrity cameos like David Cross He ultimately gave the season out of stars James Parker of The Atlantic said at the beginning of the third season that Modern Family is very very funny almost ruthlessly so It s a bit of a master class in pace and brevity The writing is Vorsprung durch Technik hectically compressed but dramatically elegant prodigal in its zingers and snorters but austere in its construction He found it an exception to his dislike for sitcoms that do not use a laugh track During the third season New York Times columnist Frank Bruni argued that gay criticism of Cameron and Mitchell actually showed the progress gays have made toward social acceptance A decade ago he writes gays would have balked and balked loudly at how frequently Cameron in particular tips into limp wristed high voiced caricature But now most gay people trust that the television audience knows we re a diverse tribe not easily pigeonholed Modern Family endows us with a sort of comic banality It s an odd kind of progress But it s progress nonetheless br br br Season br The fourth season of Modern Family received positive reviews from critics Rotten Tomatoes currently gives the season an approval rating of based on reviews

episode Game Changer in which Gloria hides her skill at chess so her husband will not be upset at losing This moment is at best a sappy quip about compromise in an often heavy handed series and at
