Antecedents of the archetype include such mythologic characters as Gilgamesh Hanuman Perseus Odysseus David and demigods like Heracles as well as folkloric heroes such as Robin Hood who adventured in

storytelling Mandrake the Magician Olga Mesmer and then Superman and Captain Marvel at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books whose span though disputed is generally agreed to have started

deceased son Being built from an incomplete robot originally intended for military purposes Astro Boy possessed amazing powers such as flight through thrusters in his feet and the incredible mechanical strength of his limbs br The s saw the Silver Age of Comics During this era DC introduced the likes of Batwoman in Supergirl Miss Arrowette and Bat Girl all female derivatives of established male superheroes br In Japan Shintoho produced the first film serial featuring the superhero character Super Giant signaling a shift in Japanese popular culture towards tokusatsu masked superheroes over kaiju giant monsters Along with Astro Boy the Super Giant serials had a profound effect on Japanese television saw the debut of superhero Moonlight Mask on Japanese television It was the first of numerous televised superhero dramas that would make up the tokusatsu superhero genre Created by K han Kawauchi he followed up its success with the tokusatsu superhero shows Seven Color Mask and Messenger of Allah both starring a young Sonny Chiba br br br s br It is arguable that the Marvel Comics teams of the early s brought the biggest assortment of superheroes ever at one time into permanent publication the likes of Spider Man The Hulk Iron Man Daredevil Nick Fury The Mighty Thor The Avengers featuring a rebooted Captain America Thor Hulk Ant Man Quicksilver and many others were given their own monthly titles br Typically the superhero super groups featured at least one and often the only female member much like DC s flagship superhero team the Justice League of America whose initial roster included Wonder Woman as the token female examples include the Fantastic Four s Invisible Girl the X Men s Jean Grey originally known as Marvel Girl the Avengers Wasp and the Brotherhood of Mutants Scarlet Witch who later joined the Avengers with her brother Quicksilver br In Astro Boy was adapted into a highly influential anime television series Phantom Agents in focused

Go Nagai also wrote the manga Cutey Honey in although the Magical Girl genre already existed Nagai s manga introduced Transformation sequences that would become a staple of Magical Girl media br The s would see more anti heroes introduced into Superhero fiction such examples included the debut of Shotaro Ishinomori s Skull Man the basis for his later Kamen Rider in Go Nagai s Devilman in and Gerry Conway and John Romita s Punisher in br The dark Skull Man manga would later get a television adaptation and underwent drastic changes The character was redesigned to resemble a grasshopper becoming the renowned first masked hero of the Kamen Rider series Kamen Rider is a motorcycle riding hero in an insect like costume who shouts Henshin Metamorphosis to don his costume and gain superhuman powers br The ideas of second wave feminism which spread through the s into the s greatly influenced the way comic book companies would depict as well as market their female characters Wonder Woman was for a time revamped as a mod dressing martial artist directly inspired by the Emma Peel character from the British television series The Avengers no relation to the superhero team of the same name but later reverted to Marston s original concept after the editors of Ms magazine publicly disapproved of the character being depowered and without her traditional costume Supergirl was moved from being a secondary feature on Action Comics to headline Adventure Comics in the Lady Liberators appeared in an issue of The Avengers as a group of mind controlled superheroines led by Valkyrie actually a disguised supervillainess and were meant to be a caricatured parody of feminist activists and Jean Grey became the embodiment of a cosmic being known as the Phoenix Force with seemingly unlimited power in the late s a stark contrast from her depiction as the weakest member of her team a decade ago br Both major American publishers began introducing new superheroines with a more distinct feminist theme as part of their origin stories or character development Examples include Big Barda Power Girl and the Huntress by DC comics and from Marvel the second Black Widow Shanna the She Devil and The Cat Female supporting characters who were successful professionals or hold positions of authority in their own right also debuted in the pages of several popular superhero titles from the late s onward Hal Jordan s love interest Carol Ferris was introduced as the Vice President of Ferris Aircraft and later took over the company from her father Medusa who was first introduced in the

supporting vehicles that debuted in Gatchaman into live action and began the Super Sentai franchise later adapted into the American Power Rangers series in the s In Toei adapted Spider Man into a live action Japanese television series In this continuity Spider Man had a vehicle called Marveller that could transform into a giant and powerful robot called Leopardon this idea would be carried over to Toei s Battle Fever J also co produced with Marvel and now multi colored teams not only had support vehicles but giant robots to fight giant monsters with br br br present br In subsequent decades popular characters like Dazzler She Hulk Elektra Catwoman Witchblade Spider Girl Batgirl and the Birds of Prey became stars of long running eponymous titles Female characters began assuming leadership roles in many ensemble superhero teams the Uncanny X Men series and its related spin off titles in particular have included many female characters in pivotal roles since the s Volume of the X Men comic book series featured an all female team as part of the Marvel NOW branding initiative in Superpowered female characters like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Darna have a tremendous influence on popular culture in their respective countries of origin br With more and more anime manga and tokusatsu being translated or adapted Western audiences were beginning to experience the Japanese styles of superhero fiction more than they were able to before Saban s Mighty Morphin Power Rangers an adaptation of Zyuranger created a multimedia franchise that used footage from Super Sentai Internationally the Japanese comic book character Sailor Moon is recognized as one of the most important and popular female superheroes ever created br br br Trademark status br br br Background br The first use of the word super hero dates back to At the time the word was merely used to describe a public figure of great accomplishments However in Ben Cooper Inc an American Halloween costume manufacturer became the first entity to commercialize the phrase super hero when it registered the mark in connection with Halloween costumes In Mego Corporation an American toy company attempted to register the mark World s Greatest Superheroes in connection with its line of action figures Mego Corporation s attempted registration led Ben Cooper Inc to sue Mego Corporation for trademark infringement Due to its financial struggles Mego Corporation was unwilling to defend itself against Ben Cooper Inc s suit As a result in Mego Corporation jointly assigned its interest in the trademark to DC Comics Inc DC and Marvel Comics Marvel Due to the financial prowess of DC and Marvel Ben Cooper Inc decided to withdraw its trademark opposition and jointly assigned its interest in the World s Greatest Super Heroes mark to DC and Marvel Two years later in DC and Marvel applied for the mark in connection with comic books and were granted the mark by the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO in br In the years leading up to the assignment of the mark both DC and Marvel battled to register various trademarks involving the phrase super hero However DC and Marvel quickly discovered that they could only register marks involving the phrase super hero if the phrase referenced their own company or a character associated with their company As a result DC and Marvel decided to become joint owners of the super hero trademark br Although many consumers likely see DC and Marvel as competitors the two comic book publishing giants are allies when it comes to protecting the trademark super hero and variants thereof Although joint ownership in a trademark is uncommon the USPTO will grant joint ownership in a mark For example in the case Arrow Trading Co Inc v Victorinox A G and Wegner S A Opposition No TTAB June the TTAB held that when two entities have a long standing relationship and rely on each other for quality control it may be found in appropriate circumstances that the parties as joint owners do represent a single source br DC and Marvel have continued to expand their commercialization of the super hero mark to categories beyond comic books Now the two publishers jointly own numerous trademarks for figurines see Spiderman Batman movies TV shows magazines merchandise cardboard stand up figures playing cards erasers pencils notebooks cartoons and many more For instance the companies filed a trademark application as joint owners for the mark SUPER HEROES for a series of animated motion pictures in Reg No Both DC and Marvel also individually own trademarks involving the super hero mark Notably DC owns the mark Legion of Super Heroes for comic magazines and Marvel owns the mark Marvel Super Hero Island for story books fiction books and children s activity books br Today DC and Marvel have become known for aggressively protecting their registered marks In the companies pursued a British law student named Graham Jules who was attempting to publish a self help book titled Business Zero to Superhero Currently much academic debate exists about whether the super hero mark has become generic and whether DC and Marvel have created a duopoly over the super hero mark Conversely DC and Marvel hold that they are merely exercising their right and duty to protect their registered marks br br br Current status relevant cases br Currently the following trademarks are registered jointly to MARVEL CHARACTERS INC and DC COMICS br SUPER HEROES for publications br SUPER HERO for costumes br SUPER HEROES for production and distribution of a series of animated motion picture br SUPER HEROES for t shirts br SUPER HEROES for toy figures br As mentioned the two companies also own a variety of other super hero related marks For instance DC owns Legion of Super Heroes and DC Super Hero Girls and Marvel owns Marvel Super Hero Island and Marvel Super Hero Adventures br DC and Marvel have garnered a reputation for zealously protecting their super hero marks As noted above one of these instances included a man by the name of Graham Jules who sought to publish a book entitled Business Zero to Superhero In he received a cease and desist from DC and Marvel who claimed that his use of the term superhero would cause confusion and dilute their brands He was offered a few thousand dollars in settlement to change the name of his book but he did not concede A few days prior to the scheduled hearing at the Intellectual Property Office in London the companies backed down br A similar scenario occurred when comic book creator Ray Felix attempted to register his comic book series A World Without Superheroes with the USPTO Felix is one of many who argue that the term super hero has become generic see discussion below Felix s mark is currently abandoned but he has stated that he intends to fight against DC and Marvel for use of the term br br br Ongoing legal debate br There is an ongoing debate among legal scholars and in the courts about whether the term superhero has become genericized due to its widespread use in popular culture similar to terms like aspirin or escalator which lost their trademark protection and became generic terms for their respective products Some argue the term SUPER HERO trademark is at risk of becoming generic br Courts have noted that determining whether a term has become generic is a highly factual inquiry not suitable for resolution without considering evidence like dictionary definitions media usage and consumer surveys Trademark owners can take steps to prevent genericide such as using the trademark with the generic product name educating the public and policing unauthorized uses However misuse by the public alone does not necessarily cause a trademark to become generic if the primary significance of the term is still to indicate a particular source br Some legal experts argue that like the once trademarked terms aspirin and yo yo the term superhero now primarily refers to a general type of character with extraordinary abilities rather than characters originating from specific publishers However DC and Marvel may be able to preserve their trademark by consistently referring to DC superheroes and Marvel superheroes and challenging unauthorized uses br Ultimately whether superhero has become or will become generic is a complex issue that continues to be debated The potential impact on independent creators and the public domain is also implicated If superhero is deemed generic it could open the door for more creators to use the term to describe characters without fear of trademark infringement However courts may still find particular uses of even generic terms to be confusing or misleading depending on the specific context br br br Minority superheroes br In keeping with their origins as representing the archetypical hero stock character in s American comics superheroes are predominantly depicted as White American middle or upper class young adult males and females who are typically tall athletic educated physically attractive and in perfect health Beginning in the s with the civil rights movement in the United States and increasingly with the rising concern over political correctness in the s superhero fiction centered on cultural ethnic national racial and language minority groups from the perspective of US demographics began to be produced This began with depiction of black superheroes in the s followed in the s with a number of other ethnic minority superheroes In keeping with the political mood of the time cultural diversity and inclusivism would be an important part of superhero groups starting from the s In the s this was further augmented by the first depictions of superheroes as homosexual In Sign Gene emerged the first group of deaf superheroes with superpowers through the use of sign language br br br Female superheroes and villains br br Female super heroes and villains have been around since the early years of comic books dating back to the s The representation of women in comic books has been questioned in the past decade following the rise of comic book characters in the film industry Marvel DC movies Women are presented differently than their male counterparts typically wearing revealing clothing that showcases their curves and cleavage and showing a lot of skin in some cases Heroes like Power Girl and Wonder Woman are portrayed wearing little clothing and showing cleavage Power Girl is portrayed as wearing a suit not unlike the swimsuits in the T V show Baywatch The sexualization of women in comic books can be explained mainly by the fact that the majority of writers are male Not only are the writers mostly male but the audience is mostly male as well Therefore writers are designing characters to appeal to a mostly male audience The super hero characters illustrate a sociological idea called the male gaze which is media created from the viewpoint of a normative heterosexual male The female characters in comic books are used to satisfy male desire for the ideal woman small waist large breasts toned athletic body These characters have god like power but the most easily identifiable feature is their hyper sexualized bodies as they are designed to be sexually pleasing to the hypothetical heteronormative male audience br Villains such as Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy use their sexuality to take advantage of their male victims In the film versions of these characters their sexuality and seductive methods are highlighted Poison Ivy uses seduction through poison to take over the minds of her victims as seen in the film Batman and Robin Harley Quinn in s Suicide Squad uses her sexuality to her advantage acting in a promiscuous manner br Through the overdeveloped bodies of the heroes or the seductive mannerisms of the villains women in comic books are used as subordinates to their male counterparts regardless of their strength or power Wonder Woman has been subject to a long history of suppression as a result of her strength and power including American culture s undoing of the Lynda Carter television series In s Wonder Woman she had the power of a god but was still drawn to a much weaker mortal male character This can be explained by the sociological concept feminine apologetic which reinforces a woman s femininity to account for her masculine attributes strength individualism toughness aggressiveness bravery Women in comic books are considered to be misrepresented due to being created by men for men br The Hawkeye Initiative is a website satirizing the sexualized portrayal of women in comics by recreating the same poses using male superheroes especially Marvel s Hawkeye br br br Ethnic and religious minorities br br In Marvel introduced the Black Panther an African monarch who became the first non caricatured black superhero The first African American superhero the Falcon followed in and three years later Luke Cage a self styled hero for hire became the first black superhero to star in his own series In the Monica Rambeau incarnation of Captain Marvel was the first female black superhero from a major publisher to get her own title in a special one shot issue In Red Wolf became the first Native American in the superheroic tradition to headline a series In Shang Chi became the first prominent Asian superhero to star in an American comic book Kato had been a secondary character of the Green Hornet media franchise series since its inception in the s Kitty Pryde a member of the X Men was an openly Jewish superhero in mainstream American comic books as early as br Comic book companies were in the early stages of cultural expansion and many of these characters played to specific stereotypes Cage and many of his contemporaries often employed lingo similar to that of blaxploitation films Native Americans were often associated with shamanism and wild animals and Asian Americans were often portrayed as kung fu martial artists Subsequent minority heroes such as the X Men s Storm and the Teen Titans Cyborg avoided such conventions they were both part of ensemble teams which became increasingly diverse in subsequent years The X Men in particular were revived in with a line up of characters drawn from several nations including the Kenyan Storm German Nightcrawler Soviet Russian Colossus Irish Banshee and Japanese Sunfire In Milestone Comics an African American owned media publishing company entered into a publishing agreement with DC Comics that allowed them to introduce a line of comics that included characters of many ethnic minorities Milestone s initial run lasted four years during which it introduced Static a character adapted into the WB Network animated series Static Shock br In addition to the creation of new minority heroes publishers have filled the identities and roles of once Caucasian heroes with new characters from minority backgrounds The African American John Stewart appeared in the s as an alternate for Earth s Green Lantern Hal Jordan and would become a regular member of the Green Lantern Corps from the s onward The creators of the s era Justice League animated series selected Stewart as the show s Green Lantern In the Ultimate Marvel universe Miles Morales a youth of Puerto Rican and African American ancestry who was also bitten by a genetically altered spider debuted as the new Spider Man after the apparent death of the original Spider Man Peter Parker Kamala Khan a Pakistani American Muslim teenager who is revealed to have Inhuman lineage after her shapeshifting powers manifested takes on the identity of Ms Marvel in after Carol Danvers had become Captain Marvel Her self titled comic book series became a cultural phenomenon with extensive media coverage by CNN the New York Times and The Colbert Report and embraced by anti Islamophobia campaigners in San Francisco who plastered over anti Muslim bus adverts with Kamala stickers Other such successor heroes of color include James Rhodey Rhodes as Iron Man and to a lesser extent Riri Ironheart Williams Ryan Choi as the Atom Jaime Reyes as Blue Beetle and Amadeus Cho as Hulk br Certain established characters have had their ethnicity changed when adapted to another continuity or media A notable example is Nick Fury who is reinterpreted as African American both in the Ultimate Marvel as well as the Marvel Cinematic Universe continuities br br br Sexual orientation and gender identity br br In Marvel revealed that Northstar a member of the Canadian mutant superhero team Alpha Flight was homosexual after years of implication This ended a long standing editorial mandate that there would be no homosexual characters in Marvel comics Although some minor secondary characters in DC Comics mature audience s miniseries Watchmen were gay and the reformed supervillain Pied Piper came out to Wally West in an issue of The Flash in Northstar is considered to be the first openly gay superhero appearing in mainstream comic books From the mid s onward several established Marvel and DC comics characters or a variant version of the pre existing character were outed or reintroduced as LGBT individuals by both publishers Examples include the Mikaal Tomas incarnation of Starman in Colossus in the Ultimate X Men series Renee Montoya in DC s Gotham Central series in the Kate Kane incarnation of Batwoman in Rictor and Shatterstar in an issue of X Factor in the Golden Age Green Lantern Alan Scott is reimagined as openly gay following The New reboot in and in a younger time displaced version of Iceman in an issue of All New X Men br Many new openly gay lesbian and bisexual characters have since emerged in superhero fiction such as Gen s Rainmaker Apollo and Midnighter of The Authority and Wiccan and Hulkling of the Young Avengers Notable transgender or gender bending characters are fewer in number by comparison the alter ego of superheroine Zsazsa Zaturnnah a seminal character in Philippine popular culture is an effeminate gay man who transforms into a female superhuman after ingesting a magical stone Desire from Neil Gaiman s The Sandman series Cloud from Defenders and Xavin from the Runaways are all characters who could and often change their gender at will Alysia Yeoh a supporting character created by writer Gail Simone for the Batgirl ongoing series published by DC Comics received substantial media attention in for being the first major transgender character written in a contemporary context in a mainstream American comic book br The Sailor Moon series is known for featuring a substantial number of openly LGBT characters since its inception as Japan have traditionally been more open about portraying homosexuality in its children s media compared to many countries in the West Certain characters who are presented as homosexual or transgender in one continuity may not be presented as such in others particularly with dubbed versions made for international release br An animated short The Ambiguously Gay Duo parodies comic book superheroes and features Ace and Gary
