a complex drawing and the second half involved ransacking rooms in a large house built on stage br br br Hidden Pictures round br In the first half of each round the object for the teams was to find hidden pictures drawn into a larger picture The host read a clue and the first team to buzz in was given a chance to find the correct object If they failed to do so the opposing team was given a chance to find it and steal the money br On the Nickelodeon series the picture was displayed on a telestrator and the teams used light pens to circle the objects on monitors set into their podiums On the syndicated series the picture was displayed on a large board and each team was given a set of plastic laminate stickers similar to Colorforms representing the objects When a team buzzed in one member had to run to the board grab the sticker for the correct object in their color and stick it onto the picture in the appropriate place br Each correct item located earned for the team and an opportunity to search one of four rooms in the house for that round During the first half of the Nickelodeon series the players chose the rooms they wanted to search but this was later changed so that each hidden object found awarded the opportunity to search a specific room br Each picture had a maximum of six objects hidden within it In the first half of the Nickelodeon series an incorrect answer meant a room would go unclaimed For the subsequent episodes and syndicated series the round was played until all four rooms were claimed or all six clues were played whichever came first br br br Searching the house br The house consisted of eight rooms that could be whimsical versions of traditional rooms in a typical home e g a living room a bathroom a den or a kitchen or complete fantasy rooms such as Sherlock s Study Ali Baba s bathroom a sewer which contained a pool of water Tarzan s tree house a pastry shop or Frankenstein s laboratory The house was laid out with two floors of four rooms each and a staircase ran up the middle br In each room the host read a clue describing an object hidden within The team had seconds to find the object and were given one chance to show it to the host once found If they found the item the team won If they could not or if the object they presented was not the right one the money went to the other team On the Nickelodeon version while the team was trying to find the item associated with the clue the camera would discreetly zoom in on it On the syndicated version a picture of the room would appear at the bottom of the screen with the target object marked by a flashing X br Rooms were frequently set up with distractions to hinder the teams searches such as ping pong balls falling onto them from cabinets or the ceiling sprays of water or confetti and in later episodes entire shelves collapsing However any breakable or collapsible objects were fabricated in such a way as to prevent any injuries to the host or contestants br br br Round two br br The process repeated with a second hidden pictures round and set of rooms to search The dollar values increased to for finding a correct hidden picture and for successfully finding a hidden object in a room br One of the rooms in round two was secretly designated as the day s Instant Prize Room If a team won control of this room and found its hidden object both members won a bonus prize that was theirs to keep regardless of the final outcome of the game br The team with the most money at the end of this round won the game and advanced to the Room to Room Romp Both teams kept all money earned the losing team receiving consolation prizes br br br Tiebreaker br If the scores were tied at the end of the second round a shortened Hidden Pictures round was played as a tiebreaker The first team to find two pictures won the game br br br Room to Room Romp br In the Room to Room Romp the winning team had seconds to find a hidden object in each of six rooms in a sequence given to them before the round began All six objects had tags attached with each of the first five tags directing them to the next room and giving a clue for the object hidden there The clock began to run after the host finished reading the first clue and continued to count down while the team moved from one room to another br The team won a prize for each object found increasing in value to a grand prize for getting through all six rooms within the time limit br br br Broadcast history br The original version premiered on Nickelodeon on November with Wesley Eure as host and John Harvey as the
