The multiple camera setup multiple camera mode of production multi camera or simply multicam is a method of filmmaking and video production Several cameras either film or professional video cameras are employed on the set and simultaneously record or broadcast a scene It is often contrasted with a single camera setup which uses one camera br br br Description br Generally the two outer cameras shoot close up shots or crosses of the two most active characters on the set at any given time while the central camera or cameras shoot a wider master shot to capture the overall action and establish the geography of the room In this way multiple shots are obtained in a single take without having to start and stop the action This is more efficient for programs that are to be shown a short time after being shot as it reduces the time spent in film or video editing It is also a virtual necessity for regular high output shows like daily soap operas Apart from saving editing time scenes may be shot far more quickly as there is no need for re lighting and the set up of alternative camera angles for the scene to be shot again from the different angle It also reduces the complexity of tracking continuity issues that crop up when the scene is reshot from the different angles br Drawbacks include a less optimized lighting setup that needs to provide a compromise for all camera angles and less flexibility in putting the necessary equipment on scene such as microphone booms and lighting rigs These can be efficiently hidden from just one camera but can be more complicated to set up and their placement may be inferior in a multiple camera setup Another drawback is in the usage of recording capacity as a four camera setup may use depending on the cameras involved up to four times as much film or digital storage space per take compared with a single camera setup br A multiple camera setup will require all cameras to be synchronous to assist with editing and to avoid cameras running at different scan rates with the primary methods being SMPTE timecode and Genlock br br br Film br Most films use a single camera setup but in recent decades larger films have begun to use more than one camera on set usually with two cameras simultaneously filming the same setup However this is not a true multiple camera setup in the television sense br Some films will run multiple cameras perhaps four or five for large expensive and difficult to repeat special effects shots such as large explosions Again this is not a true multiple camera setup in the television sense as the resultant footage will not always be arranged sequentially in editing and multiple shots of the same explosion may be repeated in the final film either for artistic effect or because the different shots can appear to show different explosions since they are taken from different angles br br br Television br br Multiple camera setups are an essential part of live television The multiple camera method gives the director less control over each shot but is faster and less expensive than a single camera setup In television multiple camera is commonly used for light entertainment sports events news soap operas talk shows game shows variety shows and some sitcoms especially ones filmed before a live studio audience br Multiple cameras can take different shots of a live situation as the action unfolds chronologically and is suitable for shows which require a live audience For this reason multiple camera productions can be filmed or taped much faster than single camera Single camera productions are shot in takes and various setups with components of the action repeated several times and out of sequence the action is not enacted chronologically so is unsuitable for viewing by a live audience br In multiple camera television the director creates a line cut by instructing the technical director vision mixer in UK terminology to switch between the feeds from the individual cameras This is either transmitted live or recorded In the case of sitcoms with studio audiences this line cut is typically displayed to them on studio monitors The line cut might be refined later in editing as often the output from all cameras is recorded both separately and as a combined reference display called the q split a technique known as ISO recording The camera currently being recorded to the line cut is indicated by a tally light controlled by a camera control unit CCU on the camera as a reference both for the talent and the camera operators and an additional tally light may be used to indicate to the camera operator that they are being ISO recorded br A sitcom shot with a multiple camera setup will require a different form of script from a single camera setup br br br History and use br The use of multiple film cameras dates back to the development of narrative silent films with the earliest or at least earliest known example being the first Russian feature film Defence of Sevastopol written and directed by Vasily Goncharov and Aleksandr Khanzhonkov When sound came into the picture multiple cameras were used to film multiple sets at a single time Early sound was recorded onto wax discs that could not be edited br The use of multiple video cameras to cover a scene goes back to the earliest days of television three cameras were used to broadcast The Queen s Messenger in the first drama performed for television The first drama performed for British television was Pirandello s play The Man With the Flower in His Mouth in using a single camera The BBC routinely used multiple cameras for their live television shows from onward br br br United States br Before the pre recorded continuing series became the dominant dramatic form on American television the earliest anthology programs see the Golden Age of Television utilized multiple camera methods br Although some claim the multiple camera setup was pioneered for television when producer and co star Desi Arnaz associate producer Al Simon and cinematographer Karl Freund of Desilu Productions used it to film I Love Lucy in other producers had been using the technique for several years br According to Thomas Schatz Jerry Fairbanks is the first to develop a mm multi camera system to film a made for TV show when he used it to shoot the pilot episode of Public Prosecutor in Fairbanks went on to film episodes for a planned network premiere in September but it was pulled from the schedule and the show did not air until br Assisted by producer director Frank Telford Fairbanks also used a multi camera system to film Edgar Bergen s Silver Theater which aired in the season He continued working with this system for the pilot of Truth or Consequences in April When Al Simon joined Ralph Edwards Productions in producing Truth or Consequences several months later he improved the system by substituting mm film for mm film and adding a more sophisticated intercom system br The technique was used for the CBS comedy The Amos n Andy Show which was filmed at the Hal Roach Studios and was on the air four months before I Love Lucy br br In Ray Culley of Cin craft Productions a sponsored film studio filmed the first TV infomercial Home Miracles for the s for Vitamix using the technique Culley also used the technique for three made for television TV series featuring Louise Winslow a pioneer in sewing cooking

other innovative technologies of the era br In the late s Garry Marshall was credited with adding the fourth camera known then as the X Camera and occasionally today known as the D Camera to the multi camera set up for his series Mork Mindy Actor Robin Williams could not stay on his marks due to his physically active improvisations during shooting so Marshall had them add the fourth camera just to stay on Williams so they would have more than just the master shot of the actor Soon after many productions followed suit and now having four cameras A B C and X D is the norm for multi camera situation comedies br Sitcoms shot with the multiple camera setup include nearly all of Lucille Ball s TV series as well as Mary Kay and Johnny Our Miss Brooks The Dick Van Dyke Show The Mary Tyler Moore Show All in the Family Three s Company Cheers The Cosby Show Full House Seinfeld Family Matters The Fresh Prince of Bel Air Mad About You Friends The Drew Carey Show Frasier Will Grace Everybody Loves Raymond The King of Queens Two and a Half Men The Big Bang Theory Mike Molly Last Man Standing Mom Broke Girls The Odd Couple One Day at a Time Man with a Plan Carol s Second Act and Bob Hearts Abishola Many American sitcoms from the s to the s were shot using the single camera method including The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet Leave It to Beaver The Andy Griffith Show The Addams Family The Munsters Get Smart Bewitched I Dream of Jeannie Gilligan s Island Hogan s Heroes and The Brady Bunch The earliest seasons of Happy Days were filmed using a single camera setup before the series transitioned to a multi camera setup which also occurred alongside its increase in popularity These did not have a live studio audience and by being shot single camera tightly edited sequences could be created along with multiple locations and visual effects such as magical appearances and disappearances Multiple camera sitcoms were more simplified but have been compared to theatre work due to their similar setup and use of theatre experienced actors and crew members br While the multiple camera format dominated US sitcom production in the s and s there has been a recent revival of the single camera format with programs such as Malcolm in the Middle Curb Your Enthusiasm Scrubs Arrested Development Entourage The Office My Name Is Earl Everybody Hates Chris It s Always Sunny in Philadelphia present Rock Modern Family The Middle Community Parks and Recreation Raising Hope Louie The Goldbergs Black ish Superstore Silicon Valley American Housewife and Young Sheldon br br br United Kingdom br The majority of British sitcoms and dramas from the s to the early s were made using a multi camera format Unlike the United States the development of completed filmed programming using the single camera method was limited for several decades Instead a hybrid form emerged using single camera filmed inserts generally location work which were mixed with interior scenes shot in the multi camera electronic studio It was the most common type of domestic production screened by the BBC and ITV However as technology developed some drama productions were mounted on location using multiple electronic cameras Many all action s programs such as The Sweeney and The Professionals were shot using the single camera method on mm film Meanwhile by the early s the most highly budgeted and prestigious television productions like Brideshead Revisited had begun to use film exclusively br By the late s soap operas were left as the only TV drama made in the UK using multiple cameras Television prime time dramas are usually shot using a single camera setup br br br See also br D reconstruction from multiple images br Camera rig br Circle Vision br Light stage is a device used for
