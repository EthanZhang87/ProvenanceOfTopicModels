episode My Dinner with Bobo The following month Nickelodeon greenlit an additional seven episodes for the fourth season and Bell and Peck signed on to direct several episodes With the extended season filming continued through July According to Schneider the show ended due to a collective decision from the creative forces behind the show br The profession of the family s mother is never revealed on the show although Schneider had written dialogue into the series finale that would have revealed her profession at a catering business The scene was filmed but Schneider ultimately chose to remove it during editing Schneider said On the one hand I thought it was funny to finally reveal it so casually in the very last episode there was something ironic about that But then I decided that because fans always seemed to have fun trying to figure it out what Mom s name and job were it would be better to keep the bit going for eternity by never revealing it in any episode br br br Release br br br
