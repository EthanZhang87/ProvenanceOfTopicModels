Gossling br br br Relationship with Shaw Communications br br Corus Entertainment was formed from the media assets that had been owned by Shaw Communications in the years before From to early Shaw and Corus operated as independent publicly traded companies nonetheless they had a common majority shareholder in the Shaw family and some reports indicated that the two companies continued to have a close relationship For several years Corus managed advertising operations such as TV listings channels for Shaw s cable systems although this operation has since been discontinued Executives have also occasionally moved between the two companies with former Corus Television president Paul Robertson joining Shaw to head Shaw Media the former Canwest broadcasting operations in br Following Shaw s acquisition of Canwest s TV assets the two companies incidentally became partners in certain channels including Dusk later replaced by ABC Spark and the Canadian version of Food Network these two partnerships were unwound in April Otherwise there was no connection or common programming between Corus s conventional and specialty television operations and those of Shaw Media For example Corus owns three over the air TV stations which were long time CBC affiliates and which agreed in to switch to Bell Media s CTV network despite Shaw owning the rival Global network at the time Following the merger of the Shaw Media properties into Corus the Corus operated CTV affiliates began transitioning to Global programming in September beginning with CTV News programming being phased out in favour of Global News and eventually switching to Global full time after their affiliation expired on August Shaw also continued to direct a portion of its CRTC mandated local expression funding to Corus owned Global stations following the transfer of Shaw Media amounting to approximately million per year br As Corus Entertainment and Shaw Communications were both effectively controlled by JR Shaw the CRTC considered them to be one entity regarding the Diversity of Voices policy and a vertical integration rule which requires television providers to carry three channels owned by unaffiliated parties for each co owned channel they offer due to the effective control Corus networks that are carried by Shaw television services were subject to this rule br With the closing of the acquisition of Shaw Communications by Rogers Communications in early there are no meaningful ties between Corus and the combined telecom company except that the Shaw family is now a significant minority shareholder in Rogers while remaining the majority voting shareholder in Corus The CRTC decision approving the Rogers Shaw deal confirms that the regulator considers Corus to remain unrelated to Rogers following the transaction resulting in Corus becoming an independent programmer under the commission s regulations Rogers withdrew the community television expenditures that had been previously allocated to Corus Global stations and moved them to its own Citytv stations br br br Sponsorships and industry partnerships br Corus is an industry sponsor of the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus Gary Maavara
