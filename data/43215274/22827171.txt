achievements br br br Reviews br Aaron H Bynum of Animation Insider called Fanboy Chum Chum a fun show that deserves a good look The quality animation helps counterbalance the immense amount of dialogue from the series chatty characters and the sheer comedy of marginally competent comic loving kids helps outweigh what might otherwise be a binge of geeky annoyance But overall Fanboy Chum Chum is a lot of fun Variety praised the series bright energetic look and even an appealing premise in theory David Hinckley of NY Daily News gave the series three stars out of five and said that it s good but might not be the next SpongeBob br KJ Dell Antonia of Slate found the main characters irritating and thought the whole concept was unoriginal with many tired jokes and not enough of that kind of mild satire to make this play in our house Joly Herman of Common Sense Media gave the series out of stars saying that br br If you re looking for deep content and lasting lessons then this show isn t for you or for your kids Precious little of it can be applied to reality especially when it comes to Fanboy and Chum Chum s experiences at school where they enjoy nearly free rein to goof off and hardly put effort into their work Even the nature of their friendship may be troubling to some parents since Fanboy s control over his pal s actions sometimes verges on bullying But there s no doubt that it s entertaining So if your young tweens can check their sense of reality at the door this silly show offers a fun depiction of the wild imagination that they probably share with the main characters For younger kids though the blurry line between fiction and realistic lifestyles may be a little confusing br br br Ratings br The series premiered on November after the SpongeBob SquarePants film Truth or Square The broadcast ranked number three of cable programs that week and number two of the night The premiere was watched by a total of million viewers The second episode was
