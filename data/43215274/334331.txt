Larchmont New York where series creator Emily Kapnek moved to when she was in junior high She said the town became sort of the basis for this show Other towns noted in the series are Protected Pines a gated community in which Courtney lives Brittle Branches where Ginger s father resides and Heathered Hills the town of Ginger s summer camp crush Sasha br br br Continuity and themes br As Told by Ginger has been recognized by fans and Nickelodeon alike for its character development most of which was unusual for a cartoon in its time br In the first season Ginger s age group is considered as being in seventh grade By the second season they move up to eighth grade rather than remaining the same age In this season Darren has the unwieldy orthodontic headgear that he has worn for the entire first season removed which results in rising popularity They graduate junior high in the middle of the third season and move on to become freshmen in high school Carl s age group works in the same way as they become junior high students by the third season Many episodes make references to past episodes giving the episodes a definite order br One of the most notable developments is that most of the characters change clothes every episode and often within the same episode a highly unusual characteristic of cartoons Most animated cartoons have their characters remain in the same outfits throughout the series to save time and money This was most conspicuous amongst the girls in Ginger s age group Dodie Courtney Macie Miranda and Ginger herself and some of the adults such as Ginger s mother After Darren got his orthodontic headgear removed he changed clothes as well Carl s age group changes clothes only infrequently and with few changes Hoodsey s coat rack has similar purple hoodies satirizing cartoons whose characters always remain in the same outfits Unlike most live action shows whose characters only wear an outfit once As Told by Ginger characters wear their outfits in rotation and new outfits are added every few episodes br The series also deals with several deeper themes In Wicked Game Ginger s two best friends betray her after feeling jealousy toward her new boyfriend Darren In And She Was Gone the staff and students at school think Ginger is suicidally depressed after she writes a disturbing poem that worries them In the episode No Hope for Courtney Carl s pranks cause his teacher to retire After she agrees to come back Mrs Gordon passes on In actuality Mrs Gordon s voice actress Kathleen Freeman died before the episode s completion and the script was rewritten in dedication to her A Lesson in Tightropes has Ginger going through an emotional breakup with Darren while she must undergo surgery for appendicitis Furthermore the episode Stuff ll Kill Ya shows Ginger dealing with a coffee and caffeine drug addiction br br In the TV film The Wedding Frame when the Foutleys are driving to their soon to be home they pass a cemetery park One tombstone reads ATBG while another reads RIP ATBG is short for As Told by Ginger and RIP is short for Rest in Peace This is a nod to the fact that the film is the series finale br A girl named Leandra who had a bone marrow illness and was a Make A Wish patient was a fan of the series and watched it during her treatments Her wish was to be a character on the show so she appeared and voiced a character named after herself in a scene of the episode Butterflies are Free in which Ginger Macie and Dodie greet her by name br Unlike most other Nicktoons the series was aired on the TEENick block br br br Episodes br br br

third season and the series as a whole and features Lois marrying one of the doctors at her hospital br Nickelodeon had originally asked for the ending of The Wedding Frame to be changed to something
