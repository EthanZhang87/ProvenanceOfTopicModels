for Fox It is placed on several lists of the greatest TV and sitcom series of all time It has won a Peabody Award seven Emmy Awards one Grammy Award and seven Golden Globe nominations br br br Premise br The series revolves around a boy named Malcolm Frankie Muniz who is revealed in the first episode to be a genius with an IQ of which places him in a class for gifted students also known as Krelboynes originally taught by Caroline Miller Catherine Lloyd Burns He is the third born child in a comically dysfunctional family of four later five boys br of Lois Jane Kaczmarek and Hal Bryan Cranston As of the first season their delinquent oldest child Francis Christopher Kennedy Masterson has been sent away to military school while his brothers Reese Justin Berfield Malcolm and Dewey Erik Per Sullivan remain at home with their parents With Francis away Malcolm becomes the middle child of the family In season four the character Jamie James and Lukas Rodriguez was added to the show as the fifth son of Hal and Lois The show s early seasons centered on Malcolm dealing with the rigors of being an intellectual and enduring the eccentricities of family life br Later seasons expanded the show s scope by exploring the family s interactions with their extended family friends and colleagues in more depth including Lois tyrannical mother Cloris Leachman Craig Feldspar David Anthony Higgins Lois hapless coworker at the Lucky Aide drugstore Malcolm s best friend Stevie Kenarban Craig Lamar Traylor who is both a wheelchair user and highly asthmatic and Stevie s dad Abe Gary Anthony Williams as well as a series of continuing subplots detailing Francis misadventures at the military academy from which he subsequently disenrolls to work in an Alaskan logging camp before finally landing a job on a dude ranch run by an eccentric German couple br The series differed significantly from the standard TV sitcom presentation commonplace at the time Malcolm routinely broke the fourth wall by both narrating in voice over and talking directly to the viewer on camera The distinctive look and sound of the series relied heavily on elaborate post production including fast cut editing sound effects musical inserts the extensive use of locations and the unusual camera styles compositions and effects e g overhead tracking hand held and crane shots and the frequent use of a wide angle lens for both close ups and ensemble scenes that would be generally impractical or impossible to achieve in a standard studio based video multi camera sitcom production The show employed neither a laugh track which was standard in other TV sitcoms nor a live studio audience Emulating the style of hour long dramas this half hour show was shot on film instead of on video br Another distinctive aspect of the show is that the cold open of every episode is unrelated to the main story Exceptions were episodes which were the conclusions of two parters each part two episode opened with a recap of its part one episode br The family s surname is never mentioned directly in the series Linwood Boomer s script for the pilot episode originally included the surname Wilkerson but it was later removed because he did not want to put any specific ethnic label on the characters The surname appeared in early drafts of promotional material and also on Francis Marlin Academy uniform in the pilot In the last episode of the series Graduation Francis drops his ID badge from his new office job which lists his name as Francis Nolastname Also in that same episode the principal announces Malcolm as the speaker mouthing Nolastname as his voice is drowned out by microphone feedback A publicist for Fox said that officially the family s last name should be considered a mystery br br br Characters br br
