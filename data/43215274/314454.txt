Clarissa Explains It All is an American teen sitcom created by Mitchell Kriegman for Nickelodeon In the series Clarissa Darling Melissa Joan Hart is a teenager who addresses the audience directly to explain the things that are happening in her life dealing with typical adolescent concerns such as school boys pimples wearing her first training bra and an annoying younger brother br A total of episodes were produced and aired from March to October with repeats airing until August From August onwards the series headlined the popular SNICK Saturday Night Nickelodeon lineup Reruns of the show have appeared intermittently on TeenNick s channel block The s Are All That eventually NickRewind from to br A pilot for a spin off series was filmed titled Clarissa Now It featured Clarissa as an intern at a newspaper in New York City The pilot was not picked up and aired once as a special on Nickelodeon br In Kriegman released a novel Things I Can t Explain which serves as a sequel to the series In the novel Clarissa is now in her late s and trying to navigate life as an adult In March it was reported that a sequel to the series was in development at Nickelodeon with Clarissa now as a mother In March Melissa Joan Hart revealed the reboot was not moving forward at the network br br br Premise br The main characters in the show are Clarissa Darling her family consisting of her father Marshall her mother Janet and her younger brother Ferguson and her best friend Sam all living in a small unnamed suburban town somewhere in Ohio Clarissa had a pet baby alligator Elvis which she kept in a kiddie sandbox and appeared sporadically in early episodes br Clarissa was credited with becoming the first Nickelodeon series to feature a female lead which led the network to create other shows such as The Secret World of Alex Mack The Amanda Show and The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo Its popularity among both boys and girls also helped to debunk a myth that a children s series with a female lead would not appeal to boys br Clarissa dealt with normal adolescent issues such as first crushes getting a driver s license and preparing for college and working These topics were dealt with far less dramatically than they were on other similar shows at the time such as Full House and Blossom For instance in one episode Clarissa accidentally shoplifts a piece of lingerie but is neither caught by store security nor punished by her parents she spends most of the episode trying to figure out how to remedy the situation on her own Although terms like hell and sex drive were occasionally uttered during the show s run most dialogue was kept family friendly One running gag involved her friend Sam often entering the scene by a ladder accompanied by a characteristic chord of guitar music through her bedroom window A repeating theme during the series was the sibling rivalry between Clarissa and Ferguson showing their repeated attempts to harm or even as in the series premiere to kill each other br Unique to the show was Clarissa s tendency to tackle the episode s central theme through the creation of a fictional video game The show also integrated some of Hart s real life likes such as the band They Might Be Giants br br br Episodes br br The decision to structure the episodes into five seasons of thirteen episodes each was made after the show ended its original broadcast run During the original run of the series the seasons were not well defined br br br Characters br br br Main br Clarissa Marie Darling Melissa Joan Hart A smart witty sarcastic and realistic teenage girl Despite her rationalism she often tends to exaggerate any problem she is facing She was approximately years old when the series began and was a freshman at Thomas Tupper Junior High School Her interests include computer game programming photography journalism and rock music Though she is usually mild mannered she can be just as selfish and calculating as her younger brother Ferguson Clarissa is best known for her unique fashion sense typically involving very colorful mismatched clothing During Season Clarissa had an alligator named Elvis but in the first episode of Season Clarissa explained that her parents sent Elvis back to Florida when he grew too big In Mitchell Kriegman s novel Things I Can t Explain Clarissa further elaborated that he disappeared under mysterious circumstances and it took years to get mom to confess that she gave away the reptilian Elvis without telling me after Ferguson tried to shove a pocket watch down its throat thinking it would win him the role of Captain Hook in the school play In reality David Ellis who worked as art director in house on the series suggested that the show may have been under pressure from the ASPCA to remove the alligator from later episodes and that it would also represent the idea that Clarissa was also growing older br Marshall Darling Joe O Connor Clarissa and Ferguson s father He is an architect who designs unusually shaped buildings mostly retail and tourist attractions such as the Fryfel Tower Clarissa sometimes comes to him for advice but he is less reliable in this role than Janet He often calls Clarissa sport seldom addressing her by name He and Janet are former flower children from the s In comparison to adult co star Elizabeth Hess O Connor initially had difficulty becoming part of the ensemble and accepting the show was primarily centered around Clarissa and that the rest of the family were more supporting characters As Kriegman later explained after a while you kinda have to take a backseat and understand that it s CLARISSA Explains It All not The Darling Family In the unaired Pilot he was played by Terry Layman br Janet Darling Elizabeth Hess Clarissa and Ferguson s mother She is the only family member Clarissa sees as a voice of reason and thus she seeks advice from her occasionally She is a teacher who works at a children s museum She is also an

name Despite achieving fame relatively early in his career unlike co star Hart Zimbler decided to not pursue an acting career and attended college instead As Zimbler later recalled somewhere on the show I think I grew up br Samuel Sam Anders Sean O Neal Clarissa s best friend and confidant Generally more optimistic and upbeat than she is he often asks What s the worst that can happen He is perhaps best known for entering her second story bedroom with a ladder after a distinctive guitar chord plays followed by Clarissa s Hi Sam greeting Creator Mitchell Kriegman explained that Sam entering the house through Clarissa s bedroom window was a way to get him into her room and start interacting faster as well as keeping their relationship non sexual He is smart and polite and enjoys
