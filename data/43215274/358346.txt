He has an alter ego Quailman who was inspired by Jinkins s and Roberts s childhood home movies in which they posed as superheroes Billy West the original voice behind Doug was assigned by executive

Despite a certain air of superiority over her peers Beebe maintains friendships with Patti Mayonnaise and most of her other contemporaries Doug had his first kiss with her in the episode Doug s Secret

are switched giving her lime green hair and violet skin instead of indigo hair and pale green skin br Al and Moo Sleech voiced by Eddie Korbich Nerdy twin brothers and two of Doug s best friends Doug

Dink s spending on various things he claims as very expensive In later Nickelodeon episodes Mrs Dink becomes mayor of Bluffington a role she continues in the Disney version br br br Production br br br Development br br Doug was created by animator Jim Jinkins He was born in Richmond Virginia in and grew up fascinated by drawing He went on to animation and filmmaking at Ohio State University and upon graduation got a job working at PBS in their children s programming unit Jinkins first sketched the character of Doug while doodling without thought not aiming to create a character based on himself In the s he began working on an autobiographical character named Brian which he later changed to Doug as it was a very general common name He began to view the character as his alter ego drawing him in variously cynical and silly scenarios in his sketchbook br In Jinkins s career took a turn for the worse as well as his personal life he had a rough breakup and suffered injuries in a biking accident During this time he gained a new outlook on life Desiring to create a place where there was no overdue rent and no delinquent phone bills he began doodling and formed the basis for Bluffington the central location in Doug The character s early designs were solidified alongside friend David Campbell at a small Mexican restaurant in New York He later credited the character s odd coloring choices from being in a margarita stupor Campbell suggested he make Doug into a children s book titled Doug Got a New Pair of Shoes which was rejected by all of the city s publishing houses Simon Schuster was interested but management changed before it purchased the pitch The character made its first animated appearance in a Florida Grapefruit Growers commercial and it was also used for a promotional bumper for the USA Network br Meanwhile cable network Nickelodeon aiming to expand its content and find creative auteurs began a search for animators to develop their first original animated series This was very unusual for the time period which often consisted of pre licensed characters such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Where s Waldo Jinkins had actually worked at the network before it was renamed Nickelodeon he was employed in the late s on their first show Pinwheel Jinkins set up a meeting with executive Vanessa Coffey to show her the book prototype Coffey ran out of the room which is you know disturbing Jinkins would recall but only to inform her boss that This Jinkins guy is the real deal and we re taking him to pilot Employing voice artists and writers from New York Jinkins created a pilot for Doug titled Doug Can t Dance It was one of three six minute pilots chosen out of eight to premiere as Nickelodeon s debut animated series or Nicktoons It also tested the highest out of eight that were shown to test audiences scoring the highest of eight points The long contract development took nearly a year to complete Jinkins made sure that his contract allowed him to take the series to another network if Nickelodeon did not complete the show s order br In another unusual move Nickelodeon allowed their purchased pilots to be animated at independent studios Jinkins and Campbell founded Jumbo Pictures in July to produce Doug He would later recall the oddity of the deal remarking that was a moment in time where we were able to be an independent production company and deliver those shows Coffey was the main executive in charge of the series production and Jinkins would later give her credit in bringing the show to air Following the success of its first season Nickelodeon renewed the series for its second and third season in November br br br Writing and design br Jinkins characterized the series as not entirely autobiographical but emotionally accurate to his childhood experiences The show was designed and based on his experiences growing up in Virginia designing it as such to give the viewers a roller coaster of emotions Each character in the series was based on people from Jinkins life with some exaggerations Prior to the show s premiere Jinkins sent messages to each subject of inspiration notifying them of their inclusion Jinkins religious upbringing also made its way into the series albeit without direct reference For example if an episode is set on Sunday Doug s family is dressed in their church clothes Jinkins felt it was important to not insert overly religious themes into the series but he viewed it essential that each episode contain a moral The series was also inspired by Peanuts br The show s design was labor intensive intended to convey a certain logic to the show s universe In the show s pitch bible which Jinkins described as huge contain floor plans for each main character s homes as well as maps of each street In addition Jinkins and the series developers paid particular attention to more hidden elements within the series such as the founding fathers of the show s central town In writing the series the production schedule was built around spending several weeks writing the series scripts Jinkins asked each writer to place a central theme at the top of each script what issue Doug is dealing with and what he learns Jinkins often told staff that he wanted the show to remain relevant in years aiming for a timeless effect While developing the series Jinkins wanted to change its name from Doug to The Funnies but the network encouraged him to stick with the original name There was a cross pollination among the network s writing staff This involved story editors being assigned to the show among them Mitchell Kriegman of Clarissa Explains It All and Will McRobb of The Adventures of Pete Pete There was definitely camaraderie and a quirkiness about who they were hiring Jinkins later said Sometimes it didn t work quite so well but working with McRobb was awesome br In translating the show into animation the characters designs were solidified Jim Jinkins is an illustrator and not an animator so his initial drawings were a little bit more of a wiggly line said Yvette Kaplan The designs were inspired by Jinkins period working for R O Blechman at the Ink Tank incorporating Blechman s nervous line quality br br br Music br Jinkins was also very involved in the show s music One of the show s most notable elements is its unique soundtrack which consists of various mouth sounds by voice actor Fred Newman Fred showed me how you could take out a guitar and use a tuna can filled with water that you d thump with your finger said Jinkins The concept of making music out of anything or making something good out of nothing is explored in Doug s Garage Band episode part which ends in Doug performing the song Bangin on a Trashcan br In the series Doug s favorite rock group is The Beets a play on the Beatles the band s members also visually resemble caricatures of Ringo Starr of the Beatles and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin and their penchant for endless reunion tours owes to the Who Jinkins viewed the series music as an accent to the storytelling br Creating the music for the series was a deliberate attempt to deviate from the standard for animated cartoons which traditionally followed the works of Carl Stalling The most complicated piece of music created for the series was for the opening sequence which was recorded preceding animation rather than the typical method of composing it afterward The series theme song is largely composed of simple sounds mostly doo doo and na na performed in a scat singing style with increasing intensity and culminating in a crescendo of several harmonies Newman s scat singing also plays over transitions in the series The show also incorporated many homemade sound effects br In the closing credits for the first season of Nickelodeon s Doug two different pieces of music would play the first piece would be taken from the second story in the episode and during the last third Porkchop would don headphones and listen to music from the first story immediately drowning out the original background music angering Doug sweats from his reaction and runs off to the left with Doug following him Subsequent seasons however use a single piece of music for their closing credits despite using the same animation Starting with the Disney series the credits have used Doug chasing Porkchop to the left and right only for Porkchop to chase Doug to the left while the credits play br br br Disney acquisition br br The original deal required Jumbo to produce episodes of Doug which Nickelodeon would air in blocks of per season After four seasons and episodes of Doug Nickelodeon declined to order the additional citing the show s expensive budget during a budget freeze The network had a two year window in which it could reverse the decision The duo received strong interest from several networks among them ABC Each time they received interest they would notify Nickelodeon in order to speed up ordering the series fifth season In February The Walt Disney Company having closed on its purchase of ABC earlier in the year purchased Doug in a multimillion dollar deal with Jinkins and Campbell The deal involved buying Jumbo Pictures and signing them to five year contracts with stock options to be Disney executives The company also purchased the Doug trademark and its rights to all future merchandising Nickelodeon was allowed to retain the rights to the episodes produced from to br Due to the length of time between the series run on Nickelodeon and its beginning on ABC there were several creative changes Production of the series relocated from New York City to Los Angeles This meant the voice actors recorded their lines remotely instead of together in the studio Billy West was replaced by Tom McHugh as the voice of Doug while the role of Roger was taken over by Chris Phillips Disney could not afford West as his fame had grown from voicing characters in Ren Stimpy and other animated properties Jinkins argues that he worked hard to keep West on the series claiming that the deal the company offered him was breaking their budget In despite not returning to the Disney version West mentioned that he would be open to returning as the role character br Several original staff members of Doug have openly regarded the Disney run as inferior to the Nickelodeon run Jinkins was less hands on regarding the production of the show s Disney episodes due to other responsibilities I mostly agree with Doug fans who think the original eleven minute Doug stories made for Nick were the best Jinkins later said David Campbell felt the Nickelodeon episodes were quirkier and better while Constance Shulman Patti Mayonnaise s voice actress felt voice recording sessions were not the same in the show s newer incarnation I missed all the gang crammed in the studio waiting for their turn for the big group scene Someone just dimmed the magic a bit br Another factor in Doug going to Disney might have been Nickelodeon s high expectations for the series not being met something that has been acknowledged by Jinkins as well as Ren Stimpy creator John Kricfalusi Among Nickelodeon s three original Nicktoons executives were banking on Doug to be the network s breakout hit While Doug proved to be popular it was by far Nickelodeon s least popular original Nicktoon as Ren Stimpy would alongside The Simpsons and Beavis and Butt Head help revive the adult animation genre that had been largely dormant since The Flintstones ended in Meanwhile Nickelodeon s other original Nicktoon Rugrats would instead be the network s breakout hit and would remain in production until long after the other two series ended production br Since the acquisition Disney has owned the rights to produce any future material in the Doug franchise In Jinkins stated that Disney had no interest in revamping the show br Doug and Porkchop appear on a billboard in the Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers movie released on Disney in May br In Jinkins revealed concept art he had drawn for a potential revival titled Doug Kids that would focus on the children of Doug and his friends While no movement has been made he has stated that he hopes to pitch it to Disney in the future br br br Themes br The series covers aspects of desiring to be different while coming of age According to Jinkins honesty is the series main theme br br We put ourselves through enormous pain to avoid pain and I had this notion of What if we didn t do that What if we just told the truth he said But that s complicated In the adult world the notion of truth and not truth is complicated but I didn t want to debate it I didn t want to show all of the ambiguity of the adult world to kids I wanted to show kids a world where everyone took honesty seriously br For example the episode Doug s in the Money finds the titular character coming across an envelope of cash and returning it to its elderly owner It created a heated debate among the series writers regarding honesty In the episode Doug is rewarded with a stick of gum It comes down to how we think about who is involved in a story In that case I wanted Doug to do something that hurt where there was no tangible reward said Jinkins br The series also made frequent use of cutaways frequently showing Doug daydreaming certain scenarios The use of cutaways declined during the Disney run but was never eliminated The technique would become much more frequently used on Family Guy which debuted five months before the series concluded br After the series completion much of the online debate ensued over the race of Doug s best friend Skeeter who some viewers felt exhibited traits stereotypical of African Americans and who subsequently drew conclusions that the character was intended to be African American Jinkins did not envision this discourse on the series colors When creating the show he came across his design markers and employed an array of bright wild colors for the characters Jinkins later told The Huffington Post in that the series colors came to symbolize the irrelevance of race br br br Home media br Sony Wonder released a series of Doug videos

immediately popular as its counterparts and Jinkins lamented to Coffey this fact Ren and Stimpy is getting so much attention because of the show s creator John Kricfalusi I feel like the squeaky wheel gets the grease Nickelodeon was largely attempting to push the limits of children s programming while Doug was a much gentler quiet show While the original Nickelodeon series received mostly positive reviews the Disney series received a more mixed reception and became notable for negative reception from fans br br br Ratings br The new Nicktoons block on Nickelodeon raised the network s ratings instantly Doug constantly achieved over in the network s most desirable demographics br When the show moved to ABC in Doug became the most popular program on ABC s Saturday morning lineup attracting
