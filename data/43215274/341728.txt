br Critical reception br Sean Aitchison from CBR wrote positively of the show stating Aside from the look of the show My Life as a Teenage Robot had a fun premise that made for some great action comedy storytelling and it definitely holds up in modern day Though the show s depiction of teendom is somewhat outdated the cliches actually end up working in favor of the humor Though there s not a lot of story progression throughout the series My Life as a Teenage Robot is still a whole lot of fun Joly Herman of Common Sense Media wrote more negatively of the show saying that Though it looks cool and has an upbeat energy the show can be a bit of a drag Some kids may enjoy it for the mindless entertainment it intends to be but know that there are much better uses of a free half hour br br
