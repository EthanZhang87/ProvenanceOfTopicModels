continued to revise their branding and promotional material In a number of different on air logos were taken effect which features the logo s text placed atop of random objects One logo variant used on production credits and presumably the official logo features an arrangement of the logo s text placed on a red screen of a stylized purple television set In December the YTV text was changed

a new slogan Keep It Weird The logo was changed again in September with the TV background dropped and the YTV text modified The channel continued utilizing various on air logos featuring the same arrangement of the logo s text this time on various bizarre and imaginative creatures Many of the channel s promos from this period often focused on promoting the brand through crude humour often at the expense of the programs being advertised As this advertising style permeated the station at all hours of the day it was heavily criticized especially by older fans of the station br As a response a new post p m advertising style was developed for older audiences which used a much simpler logo similar to the current logo used today and sleeker packaging with reduced gross out tactics Introduced

in replacing the creatures that had been used in rotation during the channel s daytime hours br On August the logo was changed slightly to have featured new colours and the background was simplified
