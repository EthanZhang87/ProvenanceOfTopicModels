GUTS br br br Gameplay br On each half hour episode three participants blue red and purple compete against each other in four events that are based on extreme versions of skills in popular sports such as basketball baseball football and soccer While most of these events include the use of an elastic harness others make use of a wave pool and sometimes a racing track is used During the show s run more creative and ambitious events were developed even including a fabricated ski slope br The competitors are awarded points based on their comparative performance in each event First place in each event is worth points Second place receives points and third place earns points In general in case of a tie the players involved each receive the higher placing and points however if two or more players are disqualified fail to finish or fail to score they each receive third place points The player with the most points after all five events won the game and received a gold GUTS medal and a faux glowing piece of the Aggro Crag Second place received a silver medal and third received a bronze medal br The contestants are introduced in the breaks between events in a segment dubbed Spill Your GUTS The segment was done as an interview with one of the hosts in the first two seasons O Malley in season and Quirk in season and was subsequently a prerecorded segment In seasons and the contestants introduced themselves During Global Guts a flag of the player s country was shown followed by the contestant introducing themselves Then the location where the contestant is from was shown on a map followed by them giving more information about what they do Non English speaking contestants introduced themselves in their native language with an English language voiceover dubbed over their voices br br br The Crag br The fifth and final event of each episode pits the three contestants in a race to climb a fabricated mountain called the Aggro Crag seasons the Mega Crag season or the Super Aggro Crag Global GUTS br The object of the Crag was for all three players to race to the peak of the mountain while hitting a series of actuators buttons that illuminated a light beacon when pressed along the way to the peak If a player misses any of the actuators along the way a spotter at the top referred to as the Crag Troll prevented that player from completing the climb until they returned and activated whatever targets they missed Each player had a separate but identical side of the mountain to climb and was not permitted to cross into their opponents paths or disrupt their progress The climb is made more difficult by strobe lights simulating lightning foam rock avalanches flying snow in the form of glitter and confetti and nuclear flying crystals in the form of balls that are each triggered either at random or when the players stepped on specific switchbacks on the crag The first player to successfully activate all of their actuators including the final one at the peak earns points The second and third place earn and points respectively br A number of violations errors on the Crag resulted in a player automatically receiving third place points including br br Crossing into another player s section of the mountain br Hitting someone else s actuators excluding the final actuator br Reaching the top of the mountain by grabbing a hand rail br Making a false start at the beginning of the climb br Finishing the climb without lighting all of one s own actuators br Not stepping on all of the boulders in the Crag s Boulder Canyon section Boulder Canyon was introduced in season of GUTS br The increased point structure in the final event allows players overcome a deficit of as much as points to win despite earlier mistakes The point structure for the Crag eliminates the possibility of a tie except in the unlikely event that two players who are already tied are each disqualified during the Crag and therefore both receive third place points While dual disqualifications did occur during the show s run it never resulted in a tie br The sound design for the action on the Aggro Crag was created by Nickelodeon Senior Sound Designer Mark Schultz who converted the voltages supplied by the infrared actuator eyes to triggers read by a MIDI based sampler br The total height of the Aggro Crag was feet m For the Mega Crag as well as the Super Aggro Crag on Global GUTS the total height was feet m tall br br br Series variations br br br Nickelodeon GUTS All Stars br The highest possible score for a contestant was points and was attained several
