physical challenge in which both teams compete with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round and money for their score After the toss up the host begins asking trivia questions of the team in control Each correct answer earns a monetary award and allows the team to maintain control while an incorrect answer or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turns control over to the opponents However the team can dare their opponents to answer the question doubling its value in response the opponents can double dare for quadruple the original value When the team in control is challenged to a double dare they have to either answer or compete in a physical challenge An incorrect answer or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare awards both control and the appropriate amount of money to the team that issues it The second round plays the same as the first with question values doubled On the original Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare a question was initially worth On Family Double Dare and Double Dare a question was initially worth On the Double Dare a question was initially worth later points br After the toss up at the start of the first round the host explains the rules as follows br br I m going to ask you a question and if you don t know the answer or think the other team hasn t got a clue you can dare them to answer it for double the dollars But be careful because they can always double dare you back for four times the amount and then you either have to answer that question or take the physical challenge br br br Physical challenges br br Physical challenges are often messy stunts that a team has to perform in a specified time usually or seconds although occasionally or seconds All physical challenges on Double Dare were seconds in length unless a time reduction was in play due to the Triple Dare Challenge The team wins money and retained control for completing the stunt Otherwise the money and control pass to their opponents br Many challenges have involved filling a container past a line with one of a variety of substances including water uncooked rice green slime whipped cream and milk Others involve catching a specific number of items before time runs out For example during Pies in the Pants a contestant has to catch a set number of pies in a pair of oversized clown pants within the specified time limit while their teammate launches the pies from a foot operated catapult at the opposite end of the stage br On the original Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare both contestants on a team competed in all physical challenges For the version of Family Double Dare all four members of a team competed in the challenges On the version of Family Double Dare and on Double Dare two members of a team competed in round one and all four members competed in round two All members of a team competed in physical challenges in the first season of the Double Dare while most challenges in the second season are for two players br Double Dare introduced the Triple Dare Challenge Available only in round two this allowed a team to make their physical challenge more difficult increasing its value by and putting a bonus prize at stake Difficulties included reducing the time limit adding an extra item to the stunt or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge If the team did not complete the challenge successfully the money prize and control went to their opponents br br br Obstacle course br br The team with the highest score at the end of round two goes on to the bonus round the obstacle course renamed the Slopstacle Course for Double Dare From the original Double Dare through Double Dare both teams keep all money earned regardless of the outcome Only the winning team on the version gets to keep their money br The course consists of eight obstacles that have to be completed within seconds Each obstacle has an orange flag either at its end or hidden within it One team member runs the first obstacle then passes its flag to a partner who then moves on to the next obstacle The team continues to alternate in this manner until they have completed the course or until time expires For safety reasons team members are given helmets elbow pads and knee pads to wear while running the course br Many obstacles have appeared in the course rotation often based on body parts food and enlarged items found in daily life Popular elements of the obstacle course have included The One Ton Human Hamster Wheel an oversized hamster wheel Pick It a giant human nose with a flag hidden inside The Sundae Slide a chocolate covered ramp leading to a playground slide with ice cream at the bottom and Gum Drop which required contestants to leap into a giant gumball machine filled with plastic balls and slide out through the dispensing hatch at the bottom br br Through January the team would win a prize for each obstacle completed escalating in value up to a grand prize for completing the entire course Two person teams split cash earnings from the front game and both contestants receive the same physical prize for each obstacle Prizes have included televisions concert tickets encyclopedias electronics gift certificates non motorized modes of transportation and on

the Double Dare crew agreed br br br Broadcast and production history br br br br br In the mid s Nickelodeon was approached by production and consulting groups with the idea of doing a game show for children a first for the network Nickelodeon conducted focus groups and concluded that children enjoyed watching game shows with adults but they did not have a game show targeted at their demographic

presentation was recorded in May hosted by Darby Double Dare was green lighted and Nickelodeon announced its premiere on June br Initial candidates to host the program included Soupy Sales host of children s variety shows in the s and s and comedian Dana Carvey After Nickelodeon determined Sales to be too old for the role and Carvey was offered a chance to audition for Saturday Night Live the

Marc Summers was one of two finalists advancing to a final audition Each hosted a mock game for Nickelodeon to make an ultimate decision on who would host Double Dare The producers felt the way Summers ended the game by leading into a commercial break was more professional and he was hired for the position in the first week of September Because focus groups showed that the audience thought he was more than years younger than he actually was Summers then years old was obligated by Nickelodeon for years to not mention his age publicly br In need of an announcer Double Dare producers were
