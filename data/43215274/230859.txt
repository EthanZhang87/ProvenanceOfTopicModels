protagonist role According to Eryk Casemiro SVP of Creative Affairs at Klasky Csupo Productions at the time of the series production she was originally designed to look quite frankly very ugly in order to contradict the stereotype that all young heroines are beautiful However her design was later retooled to look cuter at the request of Nickelodeon It premiered on September and was the first Nicktoon to exclusively use minute stories episodes of other Nicktoons usually featured two minute stories using minute stories only on occasion br The series was designed to have a focus on parents after focus groups run by Klasky and Csupo uncovered that children were talking about the real struggles of the parent child relationship this was opposed to Nickelodeon s view of only featuring kids in children s programming It was also designed with the potential of being used in science curriculums To accomplish this the production crew hired a specialist who did research on different regions of the world different cultures and different species of animals all of which were provided to the writers to help them develop ideas for episodes br br br Broadcast br The show aired in reruns on
