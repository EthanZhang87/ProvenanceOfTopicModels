and digital outlets including ABC News Radio and ABC News Live plus various podcasts hosted by ABC News personalities br br br History br br br th century origins br ABC began in as the NBC Blue Network a radio network that was spun off from NBC as ordered by the Federal Communications Commission FCC in The reason for the order was to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the United States specifically news and political broadcasting and broaden the projected points of view Only a few companies such as NBC and CBS dominated the radio market NBC conducted the split voluntarily in case its appeal of the ruling was denied and it was forced to split its two networks into separate companies br Regular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial owned and operated television station WJZ TV now WABC TV and production center in New York City in August Broadcasts continued as the ABC network expanded nationwide Until the early s ABC News programs and ABC in general consistently ranked third in viewership behind CBS and NBC news programs ABC had fewer affiliate stations and a weaker prime time programming slate to support the network s news operations compared to the two larger networks each of which had established their radio news operations during the s br br br Roone Arledge br By the s the network had effectively turned around with its prime time entertainment programs achieving more substantial ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits for ABC overall With the appointment of the president of ABC Sports Roone Arledge as president of ABC News in ABC invested the resources to make it a significant source of news content Arledge known for experimenting with the broadcast model created many of ABC News most popular and enduring programs including World News Tonight This Week Nightline and Primetime Live ABC News longtime slogan More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source introduced in the late s was a claim referring to the number of people who watch listen to and read ABC News content on television radio and eventually the Internet and not necessarily to the telecasts alone br In June ABC News which owned an stake in the service Nine Network and ITN sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the Associated Press Additionally ABC News signed a multi year content deal with AP for its affiliate video service Associated Press Television News APTV while providing material from ABC s news video service ABC News One to APTV br br br Marilyn Monroe scandal br Scandal erupted in over a decision by Arledge president of ABC News and Sports to kill a minute report about Marilyn Monroe possibly due to his close ties to Ethel Kennedy drew criticism from the program s co anchors Hugh Downs and Barbara Walters and the executive producer Av Westin Arledge said that he had killed the piece because it was gossip column stuff and does not live up to its billing Downs however took issue with Arledge s judgment I am upset about the way it was handled he said in an interview I honestly believe that this is more carefully documented than anything any network did during Watergate I lament the fact that the decision reflects badly on people I respect and it reflects badly on me and the broadcast Additionally Westin said I don t anticipate not putting it on the air The journalism is solid Everything in there has two sources We are documenting that there was a relationship between Bobby and Marilyn and Jack and Marilyn A variety of eyewitnesses attest to that on camera Two other aspects of the unaired report according to an ABC staff member who has seen it are eyewitness accounts of wiretapping of Monroe s home by Jimmy Hoffa the teamster leader that reveal meetings between her and the Kennedy brothers and accounts of a visit to Monroe by Robert F Kennedy on the day of her death Fred Otash a detective who said he was the chief wiretapper is interviewed on camera and ABC staff members said three other wiretappers corroborated his account In addition several people not in the book say on camera that Monroe kept diaries with references to meetings with the Kennedy brothers according to a staff member who has seen the report It set out to be a piece which would demonstrate that because of alleged relations between Robert Kennedy and John F Kennedy and Monroe the presidency was compromised because organized crime was involved he said Based on what has been uncovered so far there was no evidence Arledge s decision to kill the broadcast resulted in the subsequent decision of Geraldo Rivera to leave ABC entirely Rivera was a correspondent but did not work on that story He had been publicly critical of Arledge s decision Arledge a champion and defender of Rivera said he thought the story needed more work The story probed purported affairs between actress Marilyn Monroe President John F Kennedy and his brother Robert F Kennedy br br br st century br On August ABC announced that it would relaunch its radio network division ABC Radio on January The change occurred following the
