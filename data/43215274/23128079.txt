hitherto uncolonised upper districts of the Hunter River There he explored the present sites of Muswellbrook Aberdeen and Scone After crossing the Hunter River just to the north west of the present site of Aberdeen he named the Dart Brook and Kingdon Ponds two tributaries that flow from the north br Dangar followed Dart Brook to its source and crossed the Liverpool Range to the plains beyond He turned back when attacked by the Geawegal clan of the Wanaruah people west of where the town of Murrurundi later developed br His report on the quality of land on the plains caused an immediate rush of applicants for land grants On this journey he sighted a domed feature that he named Mt Cupola It was renamed Mount Dangar by explorer Allan Cunningham who became the first European to climb it the following year br Cornish place names scattered through the Hunter Region mark Henry Dangar s surveys and record his deep affection for his birthplace br br br Dismissal after investigation into land appropriation br In Dangar was commissioned by the government to allocate land grants to colonists along the Hunter River and its tributaries which he had previously surveyed During this process he assigned to himself and his brother William prime land at Dart Brook The prominent colonial land agent Peter MacIntyre believed he had prior claim to this territory br A board of enquiry found Dangar guilty of using his public position for private gain and he was dismissed from office on March Governor Sir Ralph Darling recommended that he be dispossessed of the land under dispute and required to take his grant in some other district He returned to England to appeal against this recommendation John Oxley supported him in his appeal but it was unsuccessful br Despite these adverse findings against him Dangar received two other grants of land for his services as a surveyor acres ha named Neotsfield and acres ha near Morpeth known as Baroona When he sailed to England in he left his estates in the hands of his brother William br On returning to Australia with his new wife Grace Sibly he was granted further parcels of land at Kingdon Ponds and in the Port Stephens area He had completed survey work for the Australian Agricultural Company there up to br br br Surveyor for the Australian Agricultural Company br During the voyage to England Dangar wrote his Index and Directory to Map of the Country Bordering Upon the River Hunter which was published in London in It demonstrated his skill as a cartographer and ability as a surveyor attracting the attention of the directors of the Australian Agricultural Company They offered him an appointment as a surveyor to the company which he accepted br Accompanied by his wife Grace whom he married at St Neot on May and their infant son he returned in April to take up his new position at Port Stephens br Dangar produced topographical and soil reports on the company s grants and surveyed its acres ha reserve north of the Manning River His reports of this area were so unfavourable that he was sent to explore as an alternative location the Liverpool Plains districts originally recommended to the company by John Oxley From the headwaters of the Manning River he crossed the Great Dividing Range to the Liverpool Plains and selected an extensive area of attractive land for the company s consideration After some negotiation the company s claim to the land was accepted by the government In June Dangar retired to his property Neotsfield near Singleton br br br Pastoralist and businessman br His brother William Dangar had been managing Neotsfield and it was a flourishing and highly developed farm Dangar quickly extended his interests purchasing additional grazing properties and leasing extensive runs which

Dangar said at the trial of twelve defendants that he had given Anderson lashes When Hobbs ignored Dangar s advice and alerted the local magistrate Dangar terminated his service But Dangar testified at the trial that the termination was not connected with Hobbs s actions related to the massacre br br br Efforts to pervert the course of justice br During the trial of the accused men Dangar exercised his power and influence in order to sway the outcome Dangar and his fellow squatters had established a secret society the Black Association in their fight against the Aboriginal people over land The group included Robert Scott a wealthy landowner businessman and part owner of The Sydney Herald As the court case began the group served as a defence fund br In additiont he Black Association orchestrated and funded a smear campaign particularly via The Sydney Herald It was aimed at influencing public opinion against the prosecution on the case At the first hearing the group arranged for the erroneous arrest for debt of Hobbs a key witness They also paid jurors not to attend and at the second trial the court had difficulty collecting a jury This resulted in an empty jury box on one morning of the hearing br At the second trial of seven suspects on additional charges all were convicted they were later executed by hanging The four remaining suspects were remanded to allow time for the main witness an Aboriginal boy named Yintayintin or Davey to be prepared in order to take a Bible oath By some accounts missionary Lancelot Edward Threlkeld said that Dangar had arranged for Davey to be put out of the way and he was never seen again When the prosecution was unable to locate Davey they could not proceed and discharged the four suspects in February br But Threlkeld wrote the following about Davey br br for Mr Arndell who was here last week states that on his recent return from the Gwyder he was informed by a Gentleman that Davey was put out of the way but whether with his throat cut or only hid could not be ascertained Further when the remaining four accused came before the Court on February Attorney General Plunkett informed the Court br Davey had been under the tuition of a competent person for two months but it was now reported to the Attorney General that he was not so far instructed as to be a competent witness and it was quite uncertain when he would be and he the Attorney General did not think he should be doing his duty in risking public justice by prosecuting the case without his evidence br br br I cannot proceed with the trial with any hope of success without Davey s evidence br br br Magistrate and politician br Dangar was a magistrate and member of the district council for a number of years He devoted much time and energy to the
