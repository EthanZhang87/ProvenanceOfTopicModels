there are four puzzles worth and points Each solution is a number that the players need to enter using their keypads The contestants teams have seconds to lock in their answers The four highest scoring contestants teams advance to the next round while the remaining two contestants one team is eliminated but receives a consolation prize and a bucket of slime the bucket of slime was dropped for Family Brainsurge Ties are broken by how quickly the contestants teams entered their answers In Family Brainsurge if the teams tied for last place had a score of points a tiebreaker puzzle is played instead and the team who correctly answers it the fastest will advance The two eliminated contestants one team are sent down the Brain Drain a slide formed as a human ear containing foam br br br Level Two Brain Fart br During the second round the four remaining contestants teams are told a story from a book read by the host and are asked questions in turn about the story Contestants teams lock in their answers by sitting down on a chair If the contestant team gets a question right a ding sound is heard If the contestant team gets a question wrong or if they fail to answer the chair makes a farting noise and the contestant team is pulled backwards through the paper tooth curtains in Season or later of a large face made to resemble host Sutphen and eliminated from further play This continues until two contestants teams remain In Family BrainSurge each team is allowed one Brain Fart which allows two other members of the family the Brain Trust to offer an answer for the team the team stays in the game or is eliminated based on that answer There were two types of questions used in Level One type involved who what where when why and how type questions about events in the story in this type if a question is missed the next player team will be asked the same question but sometimes a new question in season and the other type involved players teams naming things that Jeff listed in the story e g name the musical instruments mentioned in the story and in this type repeating an already said answer including another form of that answer counted as a wrong answer In Family BrainSurge if all the answers in the naming type questions are used up before two teams are eliminated then Jeff will ask tiebreaker questions using who what and where type questions and teams cannot use their Brain Farts during a tiebreaker any unused Brain Farts are out of play when the tiebreaker starts br br br Knockout round br In the knockout round the two remaining contestants teams have ten seconds to memorize a grid of numbers containing pairs of images from the story The two contestants teams then take turns matching pairs of images from the story If any of the contestants teams makes a mistake the game will go to sudden death whoever makes a match moves on If the contestant makes a mistake the contestant who made the last correct match wins the game At this point the losing contestant team s chair does the same thing as if a question is wrong The contestant team that lost in this round and the two eliminated contestants teams who got a question wrong from Level all receive a consolation prize The three eliminated contestants teams then are sent down the Brain Drain br Although there s no footage of the knockout round getting completed the closest being down to pairs left it was revealed in an interview with Jeff that a lot of contestants cleared the knockout round but the footage was edited out and never shown The board was reset until someone made a mistake and was knocked out br br br Level Three Brain Trip The Final Stage br For the bonus round the contestant team must successfully trace out three paths on grids within seconds The first path is squares squares on a season episode on a x grid the second is squares squares on two season episodes and squares on a season episode on a x grid and the third is squares on a x grid squares are always connected horizontally vertically or diagonally Each square has an actuator in the middle that must be stepped on to activate the square Contestants see each path twice the clock begins to start running when the contestant first activates a square After completing a path successfully the contestant must step on an actuator outside the board to stop the clock The contestants are told immediately when they make a mistake the grid turns red makes a buzzer sound and they must return to the start and view the pattern again before being allowed to continue when viewing the pattern after a mistake the clock continues to run On Family BrainSurge the child did the x and x while the adult did the x and the rest of the team including the Brain Trust was allowed to help guide the contestant The contestants teams can win three prizes one for completing each of the three paths with the grand prize usually being a trip though on a celebrity episode of Family BrainSurge it was a billiards table any prizes they win on one stage are theirs to keep regardless of the outcome If time runs out the contestant team must go down the Brain Drain but still keep the prizes they won while
