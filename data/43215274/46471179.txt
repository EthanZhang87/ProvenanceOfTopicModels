mawkish grating broadly played chip off the Full House block He also added that It s doubtful that there will be a more painful TV episode than the Fuller House pilot which takes an inexcusable minutes to establish a plot that is just an inversion of the original Full House premise David Weigand of the San Francisco Chronicle reacted similarly writing The episodes are predictable because they re unoriginal and the writing is painful The canned laughter is perhaps the greatest reminder of the good old days If only all those recorded voices had something legitimate to laugh at Maureen
