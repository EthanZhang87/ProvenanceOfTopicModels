Common Sense Media gave the series out of stars saying that Nonsensical imaginative fun rules the day in this unpredictable animated series But added that Welcome to the Wayne is best treated as a sugary treat kind of addition to kids media diets since the content is more about garnering laughs than it is about anything outright educational Damon Cap of BSC Kids compared the series to Gravity Falls adding that after viewing the first episode is a lot of potential and excitement on who this is going to turn out Cap added that once Ansi came across the library they knew the show would be good and great to watch Television Business International said that the series kept the hand drawn art style used in the web series while using innovative animation techniques to create a unique visual aesthetic Peter Jurado of ComicsVerse said that the show takes you back to the city like Hey Arnold highlights the value of knowledge and is unique in its own way even though it has some similarities with Gravity Falls as a new mystery with a lot of heart Jurado also praised the return to the minute format and the fact that the characters are young enough that they don t automatically judge somebody Librarian Burkely Hermann argued that in this series a special and magnificent library is central going beyond positive depictions in recent years with the chief librarian as a Black woman named Clara Rhone voiced by Harriett D Foy This included episodes he wrote where the issues of underfunded libraries and the value of knowledge were central as was the focus on librarians as gatekeepers and others which made clear the value of librarians and libraries as places of knowledge and diversity br br br Accolades br br br br br br External links br Official website br Welcome to
