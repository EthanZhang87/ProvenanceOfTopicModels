the highest rated Nickelodeon program and cable s show for the week ending July with a rating equivalent to million viewers Approximately of all kids aged tuned in to watch the special Nickelodeon president Herb Scannell noted that a Surprising numbers of kids held Rugrats parties on Saturday night and watched the show in groups The following day Nickelodeon said We ve got to make this a show because of the size of the audience that came to it Noting the immediate popularity of the show s concept All Growed Up was deemed the network s equivalent of the Super Bowl Nickelodeon made a two season order of episodes br Nick s press releases for the Rugrats th anniversary noted that the All Growed Up special was a one time only special Nickelodeon was so impressed by the high ratings they wanted to use the show as a pilot for either a regular spinoff series or a series of occasional one hour specials Nickelodeon decided to commission an entire series around the teenage main characters Arlene Klasky explained It got enormous ratings so Nickelodeon blessed us with another series Margie Cohn felt that Rugrats had endured prolonged success due to the series writing and the appeal of the show s well developed characters to its deeply devoted audience and argued the sequel resulted from fan support and speculation on how the characters would age br While Nickelodeon executives were concerned that the new series would maintain the Rugrats appeal they acknowledged a revision to the successful franchise was necessary as the original series was beaten in the ratings by shows such as The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius and SpongeBob SquarePants On October a PC game based on the All Growed Up special was released After release in the US Canada All Growed Up debuted on Canadian television by YTV Rugrats English broadcaster in Canada on September The French Canadian version Les Razmoket Dix Ans Apr s was broadcast in two parts on VRAK TV on December and December In Britain and Australia the video was released as Older and Bolder because a Rugrats video existed in those countries named All Growed Up An All Growed Up book was also released br br br Production br br Nickelodeon ordered episodes to be created by Rugrats animation studio Klasky Csupo for production in September All Grown Up was intended as the first Rugrats spinoff as others were under consideration The series premiered with its first episode Coup DeVille on April following the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards By November Rugrats was no longer in production In Rugrats and All Grown Up were aired concurrently to highlight the characters in two stages of their lives All Grown Up aired twice per week br The new episodes shifted from the minute Rugrats format of two stories per episode to a single minute story This was to allow more time to develop and tell a story and see where the characters go with it Each of the episodes focused on the life of a main character and usually showed the characters facing a lot of firsts for tweens and teenagers The show included gradual stylistic changes with the first episodes similar to the All Growed Up special and the original Rugrats world The second set of episodes and onward had a more contemporary look with characters being given hipper clothing Over the seasons of episodes the developers hoped for a gradual evolution in style to where the audience will be comfortable with the changes The main cast recorded their parts for each episode in about one hour By November episodes began airing while more episodes were in the scripting stage br br br Episodes br br br Casting and the evolution of characterization br The existing cast modified their voices for their characters new ages Tommy s voice actress E G Daily noted It was a little harder when we were doing the first batch of episodes when they were just coming in and trying to define everybody and how they ve grown Susie s character changes included having a little more sass a little less innocence and a little more bottom end All Grown Up attracted million viewers a month including a large number of to year olds The producers did not delve into the characters loss of innocence with topics such as sex and drugs in favor of issues relevant to to year olds the show s target demographic While the producers did not take the teen approach with All Grown Up they did with another Klasky Csupo show As Told by Ginger br Executive producer Arlene Klasky stated It was always in the back of our minds that we would love to see what these characters were like as they grew Susie s voice actor Cree Summer noted that while part of the appeal to this kind of TV show is not growing up she noted a natural evolution of the show after years on the air Daily said that while her character was still the star of the show he was older wiser and using more contemporary language Cyma Zarghami Nickelodeon s executive vice president and general manager at the time said The tween special proved kids are ready to embrace these beloved characters in a whole new realm The Rugrats property is years old so it feels just right to have the babies turn into tweens in their th year on the air On the evolution of Angelica Marjorie Cohn executive vice president for development and original programming at Nickelodeon explained She s the center of the universe and she keeps bumping up against forces that tell her she s not The writers mellowed Angelica and her voice actress addressed I welcome the new development in her character the way she can be vulnerable She s getting some real acting challenges from the material the writers are coming up with She compared her role to Bart Simpson s voice actress who will likely play the year old until retirement noting that now she could play the same character with a bit more sophistication She s become more vulnerable and has to learn to navigate the social strata of junior high The potential for more sophisticated storytelling was one of the factors in the creation of the series The show s creators thought that pushing the show to the next age bracket would be an effective way of holding on to viewers who have grown up with Rugrats Daily stated I m definitely going to miss doing baby Tommy but it s awesome watching people grow br br br Other proposed spin offs br br At the Television Critics Association tour in July Nickelodeon executives mentioned that All Growed Up was one of three spinoff concepts proposed by Nickelodeon to continue the successful Rugrats franchise In Nickelodeon aired the episode Pre School Daze the pilot for a series in which Angelica and Susie attend preschool According to Variety in September the show was to be repurposed as a series of four standalone specials The program aired in the UK in The North American debut took place in late after the cancellation of the series Another proposed spinoff was a series featuring Susie and the Carmichael family who would move from California to Atlanta Georgia it was first proposed for the television season but Nickelodeon and Klasky Csupo decided instead to concentrate on all the original aged Rugrats The Kwanzaa special which aired in served as a pilot for this new series but the series would have contradicted the established continuity br In the thirteenth episode of All Grown Up Lucky Angelica becomes a teenager When asked if the popularity of that episode would produce a spinoff as the characters enter teendom Nickelodeon executives explained It has been talked about but said the network had no immediate plans to push the entire cast into puberty though noted that those connected with the franchise were eager to continue developing the characters The show was preceded by a six hour marathon of Angelica centered episodes of Rugrats and All Grown Up Angelica s voice actor Cheryl Chase expressed a desire to take part in any spin off of Rugrats from Angelica Goes to College to Rugrats in the Nursing Home In Cohn proposed that Rugrats characters play the leads in classic fairy tales for Nickelodeon br br br Premieres with other networks br A preview show premiered

Reception br The debut show was in the top ratings spots Common Sense Media felt that the show s scenarios were not as good as in the original series commenting that they were thoughtfully crafted but lacked the satiric take of babies misunderstanding the adult world Rather the show was choosing to tackle more standard pre teen themes The Los Angeles Times stated it was a revolutionary idea for a series with characters perpetually stuck in their status quo Image felt All Grown Up was the natural progression of the show GamesRadar felt it was an ill advised venture CBR commented The sense of adventure and exploration of the original had been lost those special personalities they had as babies vanished in a haze of pre pubescent insecurities though felt it was a fun what if NYU argued the

about babies who do not understand the world Germain felt that if the characters are older then the story is finished He additionally stated What I would have said to people at the time if I had been
