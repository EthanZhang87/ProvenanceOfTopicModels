Aarhus US also Danish hu s officially spelled rhus from until January is the second largest city in Denmark and the seat of Aarhus Municipality It is located on the eastern shore of Jutland in the Kattegat sea and approximately kilometres mi northwest of Copenhagen br Dating back to the late th century Aarhus was founded as a harbour settlement at the mouth of the Aarhus River and quickly became a trade hub The first Christian church was built here around the year and later in the Viking Age the town was fortified with defensive ramparts The bishopric of Aarhus grew steadily stronger and more prosperous building several religious institutions in the town during the early Middle Ages Trade continued to improve although it was not until that Aarhus was granted market town privileges and the population of Aarhus remained relatively stable until the th century The city began to grow significantly as trade prospered in the mid th century but not until the mid th century did the Industrial Revolution bring real growth in population The first railway line in Jutland was built here in In the first university in Jutland was founded in Aarhus and today it is a university city and the largest centre for trade services industry and tourism in Jutland br Aarhus Cathedral is the longest cathedral in Denmark with a total length of m ft The Church of our Lady Vor Frue Kirke was originally built in making it the oldest stone church in Scandinavia The City Hall designed by Arne Jacobsen and Erik M ller was completed in in a modern Functionalist style Aarhus Theatre the largest provincial theatre in Denmark opposite the cathedral on Bispetorvet was built by Hack Kampmann in the Art Nouveau style and completed in Musikhuset Aarhus concert hall and Det Jyske Musikkonservatorium Royal Academy of Music Aarhus Aalborg are also of note as are its museums including the open air museum Den Gamle By the art museum ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum the Moesg rd Museum and the women s museum Kvindemuseet The city s major cultural institutions include Den Gamle By ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum the Moesg rd Museum Gender Museum Denmark Musikhuset Aarhus and Aarhus Theatre Known as Smilets By lit City of Smiles it is the Danish city with the youngest demographics and home to Scandinavia s largest university Aarhus University Commercially the city is the principal container port in the country and major Danish companies such as Vestas Arla Foods Salling Group and Jysk have their headquarters there br br br Etymology br Aarhus is a compound of the two words r genitive of river Modern Danish and oss mouth referencing the city s location at the mouth of Aarhus Aarhus River br br br Spelling br In Valdemar s Census Book the city was called Arus and in Icelandic it was known as Aros later written as Aars The spelling Aarhus is first found in and gradually became the norm in the th century With the Danish spelling reform of Aa was changed to Some Danish cities resisted the change but Aarhus city council opted to change the name In the city council voted to change the name back from rhus to Aarhus again with effect from January br It is still grammatically correct to write geographical names with the letter and local councils are allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative and most newspapers and public institutions will accept either Some official authorities such as the Danish Language Committee publisher of the Danish Orthographic Dictionary still retain rhus as the main name providing Aarhus as a second option in brackets and some institutions are still using rhus explicitly in their official name such as the local newspaper rhus Stiftstidende and the schools rhus Kunstakademi and rhus Statsgymnasium Aa was used by some major institutions between and as well such as Aarhus University or the largest local sports club Aarhus Gymnastikforening AGF which has never used the spelling Certain geographically affiliated names have been updated to reflect the name of the city such as the Aarhus River changed from rhus to Aarhus br br br History br br br Early history br Founded in the early Viking Age Aarhus is one of the oldest cities in Denmark along with Ribe and Hedeby The original Aros settlement was situated on the northern shores of a fjord by the mouth of the Aarhus River right where the city center is today It quickly became a hub for sea going trade due to its position on intersecting trade routes in the Danish straits and the fertile countryside The trade however was not nearly as prominent as that in Ribe and Hedeby during the Viking Age and it was primarily linked to Norway as evidenced by archaeological finds A shipbuilding yard from the Viking Age was uncovered upriver in by archaeologists It was located at a place formerly known as Snekkeeng or Snekke Meadow in English Snekke is a type of longship east of the Brabrand Lake close to Viby and it was in use for more than years from the late s till around the mid s br br Archaeological evidence indicates that Aarhus was a town as early as the last quarter of the th century Discoveries after a archaeological dig included half buried longhouses firepits glass pearls and a road dated to the late s Several excavations in the inner city since the s have revealed wells streets homes and workshops and inside the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers everyday utensils like combs jewellery and basic multi purpose tools from approximately the year have been unearthed The early town was fortified with defensive earthen ramparts in the first part of the s possibly in the year on order from king Gorm the Old The fortifications were later improved and expanded by his son Harald Bluetooth encircling the settlement much like the defence structures found at Viking ring fortresses elsewhere Together with the town s geographical placement this suggests that Aros became an important military centre in the Viking Age There are also strong indications of a former royal residence from the same period in Viby a few kilometres south of the Aarhus city centre br The centre of Aarhus was originally a pagan burial site until Aarhus s first Christian church Holy Trinity Church a timber structure was built upon it during the reign of Frode King of Jutland around The bishopric of Aarhus dates back to at least when Adam of Bremen reported that the missionary bishop Reginbrand of Aros attended the synod of Ingelheim in Germany but the late Viking Age during the Christianization of Scandinavia was a turbulent and violent time with several naval attacks on the town such as Harald Hardrada s assault around when the Holy Trinity Church was burned to the ground Despite the conflicts Aarhus continued to prosper from the trade and the finding of six runestones in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around the year as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them The bishopric diocese was obliterated for almost a hundred years after Reginbrand in but in a new bishop Christian was ordained and he founded a new church in Aarhus Sankt Nicolai Domkirke St Nicholas Cathedral this time in stone It was erected outside the town fortifications and stood finished in at the site where Church of Our Lady stands today but only an underground crypt remains br br br Middle Ages br br The growing influence of the Church during the Middle Ages gradually turned Aarhus with its bishopric into a prosperous religious centre Many public and religious buildings were built in and around the town notably Aarhus Cathedral was initiated in the late th century by the influential bishop Peder Vognsen and around Aros had a total of four churches The th century also marks a thorough reorganisation erasing most of the town s original layout with new streets relocations dismantling and new constructions The Church clearly had the upper hand in the Aarhus region during medieval times and the large bishopric of Aarhus prospered and expanded territory reaching as far as Viborg in extent In Christopher III issued the oldest known charter granting market town status although similar privileges may have existed as far back as the th century The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a regional power and is by some considered Aarhus s birth certificate br The commercial and religious status spurred town growth and in the defensive earthen ramparts which had ringed the town since the Viking Age were abandoned to accommodate expansion Parts of the ramparts still exist today and can be experienced as steep slopes at the riverside and they have also survived in some place names of the inner city including the streets of Volden The Rampart and Graven The Moat Aarhus grew to become one of the largest cities in the country by the early th century In octroi was imposed in larger Danish cities which changed the layout and face of Aarhus over the following decades Wooden city walls were erected to prevent smuggling with gates and toll booths on the major thoroughfares Mejlgade and Studsgade The city gates funnelled most traffic through a few streets where merchant quarters were built br In the th century Aarhus entered a period of recession as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish wars and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state Not until the middle of the th century did growth return in large part due to trade with the large agricultural catchment areas around the city grain particularly proved to be a remunerative export The first factories were established at this time as the Industrial Revolution reached the country and in the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade br br br Industrialisation br br Aarhus began to prosper in the s as the industrial revolution reached the city and factories with steam driven machinery became more productive In the electoral laws were reformed leading to elections for the seats on the city council The rules were initially very strict allowing only the wealthiest citizens to run In the elections only citizens qualified out of a total population of more than The first city council mainly composed of wealthy merchants and industrialists quickly looked to improve the harbour situated along the Aarhus River Larger ships and growing freight volumes made a river harbour increasingly impractical In the harbour was moved to the coast north of the river where it became the largest industrial harbour outside Copenhagen over the following years From the outset the new harbour was controlled by the city council as it is to this day br br During the First Schleswig War Aarhus was occupied by German troops from June to July The city was spared any fighting but in Vejlby north of the city a cavalry skirmish known as Rytterf gtningen took place which stopped the German advance through Jutland The war and occupation left a notable impact on the city as many streets particularly on Frederiksbjerg are named after Danish officers of the time Fifteen years later in the city was occupied again this time for seven months during the Second Schleswig War br In spite of wars and occupation the city continued to expand and develop In the octroi was abolished and the city walls were removed to provide easier access for trade Regular steamship links with Copenhagen had begun with the Jylland in and the Dania and in Jutland s first railway was established between Aarhus and Randers br br In the second half of the th century industrialisation came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products especially oil and butter Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus The Ceres Brewery was established in and served as Aarhus s local brewery for more than years gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres grunden lit the Ceres ground In local farmers and businessmen created Korn og Foderstof Kompagniet KFK focused on grain and feedstuffs KFK established departments all over the country while its headquarters remained in Aarhus where its large grain silos still stand today Otto M nsted created the Danish Preserved Butter Company in focusing on butter export to England China and Africa and later founded the Aarhus Butterine Company in the first Danish margarine factory His company became an important local employer with factory employees increasing from in to in partaking in the effective transformation of the city from a regional trade hub to an industrial centre Other new factories of note included the dockyard Aarhus Flydedok and the oil mill rhus Oliefabrik br Aarhus became the largest provincial city in the country by the turn of the century and the city marketed itself as the Capital of Jutland The population increased from in to in and in response the city annexed large land areas to develop new residential quarters such as Tr jborg Frederiksbjerg and Marselisborg Many of its cultural institutions were also established at this time such as Aarhus Theatre the original State Library Aarhus University and several hospitals br br br Second World War br br On April Nazi Germany invaded Denmark occupying Aarhus the following day the occuption lasted for five years This was a destructive period with major disasters loss of life and economic depression The Port of Aarhus became a hub for supplies to the Baltics and Norway while the surrounding rail network supplied the Atlantic Wall in west Jutland and cargo headed for Germany Combined these factors resulted in a strong German presence especially in br br Small resistance groups first appeared in but the first to co ordinate with the Freedom Council was the Samsing Group responsible for most operations from early The Samsing group along with others in and around Aarhus was dismantled in June when Grethe Thora Bartram turned her family and acquaintances over to German authorities In response requests for assistance were sent to contacts in England and in October the Royal Air Force bombed the Gestapo headquarters successfully destroying archives and obstructing the ongoing investigation br In the summer of the Copenhagen based resistance group Holger Danske helped establish the Kolonne group and an SOE agent arrived from England to liaison with the L groups Subsequently resistance operations escalated which was countered with Schalburgtage terror operations by the Peter group The increasingly destructive occupation was compounded when an ammunition barge exploded in July destroying much of the harbour area On May German forces in Denmark surrendered but during the transitional period fighting broke out resulting in dead On May the British Royal Dragoons entered the city br br br Post World War II years br In the s and s the city entered a period of rapid economic growth and the service sector overtook trade industry and crafts as the leading sector of employment for the first time Workers gradually began commuting to the city from most of east and central Jutland as the region became more interconnected The student population tripled between and turning the city into a Danish centre of research and education The growing and comparably young population initiated a period of creativity and optimism Gaffa and the KaosPilot school were founded in and respectively and Aarhus was at the centre of a renaissance in Danish rock and pop music launching bands and musicians such as TV Gnags Thomas Helmig Bamses Venner Anne Dorte Michelsen Mek Pek and Shit Chanel br br br The s br br Since the turn of the millennium Aarhus has seen an unprecedented building boom with many new institutions infrastructure projects city districts and recreational areas Several of the construction projects are among the largest in Europe such as the New University Hospital DNU and the harbourfront redevelopment br Both the skyline and land use of the inner city is changing as former industrial sites are being redeveloped into new city districts and neighbourhoods Starting in the former docklands known as De Byn re Havnearealer The Peri urban Harbour areas and closest to the city seaside are being converted to new mixed use districts It is among the largest harbourfront projects in Europe The northern part dubbed Aarhus Aarhus Docklands is almost finished as of while the southern district dubbed Sydhavnskvarteret The South harbour neighbourhood is only starting to be developed The adjacent site of Frederiks Plads at the former DSB repair facilities have been under construction since as a new business and residential quarter The main bus terminal close by is planned to be moved to the central railway station and the site will be redeveloped to a new residential neighbourhood Elsewhere in the inner city the site of the former Ceres breweries was redeveloped in as a new mixed use neighbourhood known as CeresByen br Construction of Aarhus Letbane the first light rail system in the country commenced in and the first increment was finished in December Since then the lightrail service has been expanded with two intercity sections to the towns of Odder and Gren respectively and also includes a northward leg to the suburb of Lisbjerg The light rail system is planned to tie many other suburbs closer to central Aarhus in the future with the next phase including local lines to Brabrand in the east and Hinnerup to the north br Accelerating growth since the early s brought the inner urban area to roughly inhabitants by The rapid growth is expected to continue until at least when Aarhus municipality has set an ambitious target for inhabitants br br br Geography br br Aarhus is located at the Bay of Aarhus facing the Kattegat sea in the east with the peninsulas of Mols and Helgen s across the bay to the northeast Mols and Helgen s are both part of the larger regional peninsula of Djursland A number of larger cities and towns is within easy reach from Aarhus by road and rail including Randers kilometres mi by road north Gren northeast Horsens kilometres mi south and Silkeborg kilometres mi east br br br Topography br At Aarhus s location the Bay of Aarhus provides a natural harbour with a depth of m ft quite close to the shore Aarhus was founded at the mouth of a brackish water fjord but the original fjord no longer exists as it has gradually narrowed into what is now the Aarhus River and the Brabrand Lake due to natural sedimentation The land around Aarhus was once covered by forests remains of which exist in parts of Marselisborg Forest to the south and Riis Skov to the north Several lakes extend west from the inner city as the landscape merges with the larger region of S h jlandet with heights exceeding metres ft at Himmelbjerget between Skanderborg and Silkeborg The highest natural point in Aarhus Municipality is Jelsh j at metres above sea level in the southern district of H jbjerg The hilltop is home to a Bronze Age barrow shrouded in local myths and legends br The hilly area around Aarhus consists of a morainal plateau from the last ice age broken by a complex system of tunnel valleys The most prominent valleys of this network are the Aarhus Valley in the south stretching inland east west with the Aarhus River Brabrand Lake rslev Lake and T strup Lake and the Eg Valley to the north with the stream of Eg en Eg Engs the bog of Geding Kasted Mose and Geding Lake Most parts of the two valleys have been drained and subsequently farmed but in the early s some of the drainage was removed and parts of the wetlands were restored for environmental reasons The valley system also includes the stream of Lyngbyg rd in the west and valleys to the south of the city following erosion channels from the pre quaternary By contrast the Aarhus River Valley and the Giber River Valley are late glacial meltwater valleys The coastal cliffs along the Bay of Aarhus consist of shallow tertiary clay from the Eocene and Oligocene to million years ago br br br Climate br br Aarhus has a temperate oceanic climate K ppen Cfb and the weather is constantly influenced by major weather systems from all four ordinal directions resulting in unstable conditions throughout the year Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May warmer summer months from June to August frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months often with frost and occasional snow from December to March The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds more fog less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding open land br Western winds from the Atlantic and North Sea are dominant resulting in more precipitation in western Denmark In addition Jutland rises sufficiently in the centre to lift air to higher colder altitudes contributing to increased precipitation in eastern Jutland Combined these factors make east and south Jutland comparatively wetter than other parts of the country Average temperature over the year is C F with February being the coldest month C or F and August the warmest C or F Temperatures in the sea can reach C F in June to August but it is not uncommon for beaches to register C F locally br The geography in the area affects the local climate of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low lying valley floor where central Aarhus is located Brabrand Lake to the west further contributes to this effect and as a result the valley has a comparably mild temperate climate The sandy ground on the valley floor dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist retaining boulder clay These conditions affect crops and plants that often bloom weeks earlier in the valley than on the northern and southern hillsides br Because of the northern latitude the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter On the summer solstice the sun rises at and sets at providing hours minutes of daylight On the winter solstice it rises at and sets at with hours and minutes of daylight The difference in length of days and nights between summer and winter solstices is hours and minutes br br br Politics and administration br br Aarhus is the seat of Aarhus Municipality and Aarhus City Council Aarhus Byr d is also the municipal government with headquarters in Aarhus City Hall The Mayor of Aarhus since is Jacob Bundsgaard of the Social Democrats Municipal elections are held every fourth year on the third Tuesday of November with the next election in The city council consists of members elected for four year terms When an election has determined the composition of the council it elects a mayor two deputy mayors and five aldermen from their ranks Anyone who is eligible to vote and who resides within the municipality can run for a seat on the city council provided they can secure endorsements and signatures from inhabitants of the municipality br The first publicly elected mayor of Aarhus was appointed in In the Danish Municipal Reform the current Aarhus municipality was created by merging municipalities Aarhus was the seat of Aarhus County until the Danish municipal reform which substituted the Danish counties with five regions and replaced Aarhus County with Central Denmark Region Region Midtjylland seated in Viborg br br br Subdivisions br Aarhus Municipality has electoral wards and polling stations in four electoral districts for the Folketing national Parliament The diocese of Aarhus has four deaneries composed of parishes within Aarhus municipality Aarhus municipality contains postal districts and some parts of another The urban area of Aarhus and the immediate suburbs are divided into the districts Aarhus C Aarhus N Aarhus V Viby J H jbjerg and Brabrand br br br Environmental planning br br Aarhus has increasingly been investing in environmental planning and in accordance with national policy aims to be CO neutral and independent of fossil fuels for heating by The municipal power plants were adapted for this purpose in the s In the municipality took over three private straw fired heating plants and the year after a new MW combined heat and power biomass plant at Lisbjerg Power Station was completed while Studstrup Power Station finished a refit to move from coal to wood chips In conjunction with the development of the Docklands district there are plans for a utility scale seawater heat pump which will take advantage of fluctuating electricity prices to supply the district heating system Since the city has been implementing energy saving LED technology in street lighting by January about half of the municipal street lighting had been changed Apart from reducing the city s CO emissions it saves on the electricity bill thereby making it a self financed project over a year period br The municipality aims for a coherent and holistic administration of the water cycle to protect against and clean up previous pollution as well as encourage green growth and self sufficiency The main issues are excessive nutrients adapting to increased and increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change and securing the water supply These goals have manifested in a number of large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners In the s underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes rslev Engs and Eg Engs were created in and respectively The number of sewage treatment plants is planned to be reduced from to by as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Eg are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment They have already been refitted for biogas production to become net producers of electricity and heat To aid the new treatment plants and avoid floodings sewage and stormwater throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems Construction began in in several areas but it is a long process that is scheduled to be finished by br Afforestation projects have been undertaken to prevent groundwater pollution secure drinking water sequester CO increase biodiversity create an attractive countryside provide easy access to nature and offer outdoor activities to the public In the first project the New Forests of Aarhus was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners under a larger national agenda Other projects to expand natural habitats include a rewilding effort in Geding Kasted Bog and continuous monitoring of the four Natura areas in the municipality br br br Demographics br br Aarhus has a population of on square kilometres sq mi for a density of km sq mi Aarhus municipality has a population of on km with a density of km sq mi Less than a fifth of the municipal population resides beyond city limits and almost all live in an urban area The population of Aarhus is both younger and better educated than the national average which can be attributed to the high concentration of educational institutions More than of the population have an academic degree while only some have no secondary education or trade The largest age group is to year olds and the average age is making it the youngest city in the country and one of its youngest municipalities Women have slightly outnumbered men for many years br br The city is home to different religious groups and denominations most of which are Christian or Muslim with a smaller number of Buddhist Hindu and Jewish communities Since the s there has been a marked growth in diverse new spiritual groups although the total number of followers remains small The majority of the population are members of the Protestant state church Church of Denmark which is by far the largest religious institution both in the city and the country as a whole Some of the population are not officially affiliated with any religion a percentage that has been slowly rising for many years br During the s there was significant immigration from Turkey and in the s there was a fast growth in the overall immigrant community from people in to in The majority of immigrants have roots outside Europe and the developed world comprising some people from different nationalities with the largest groups coming from the Middle East and North Africa Some have come from within Europe with Poland Germany Romania and Norway being the largest contributors br Many immigrants have established themselves in the suburbs of Brabrand Hasle and Viby where the percentage of inhabitants with foreign origins has risen by since This has resulted in a few so called ghettos defined as residential areas with more than half of inhabitants from non Western countries and with relatively high levels of poverty and or crime Gellerup is the most notable neighbourhood in that respect The ghetto labelling has been criticized as unnecessarily stigmatising and counterproductive for social and economical development of the related areas br br br Economy br br The economy of Aarhus is predominantly knowledge and service based strongly influenced by the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city transitions away from manufacturing Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the s while agriculture has long been a marginal sector within the municipality The municipality is home to jobs with some in the private sector and the rest split between state region and municipality The region is a major agricultural producer with many large farms in the outlying districts People commute to Aarhus from as far away as Randers Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost a third of those employed within the Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities Aarhus is a centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many speciality shops br The job market is knowledge and service based and the largest employment sectors are healthcare and social services trade education consulting research industry and telecommunications The municipality has more high and middle income jobs and fewer low income jobs than the national average Today te majority of the largest companies in the municipality are in the sectors of trade transport and media The wind power industry has strong roots in Aarhus and the larger region of Central Jutland and nationally most of the revenue in the industry is generated by companies in the greater Aarhus area The wind industry employs about a thousand people within the municipality making it a central component in the local economy The biotech industry is well established in the city with many small and medium sized companies mainly focused on research and development There are multiple Big Tech companies with offices in the city including Uber and Google br Several major companies are headquartered in Aarhus including four of the ten largest in the country These include Arla Foods one of the largest dairy groups in Europe Salling Group Denmark s largest retailer Jysk a worldwide retailer of household goods Vestas a global wind turbine manufacturer Terma A S a major defence and aerospace manufacturer Per Aarsleff a civil engineering company and several large retail companies Other large employers of note include Krifa Systematic A S and Bestseller A S Since the early s the city has experienced an influx of larger companies moving from other parts of the Jutland peninsula br br br Port of Aarhus br br The Port of Aarhus is one of the largest industrial ports in northern Europe with the largest container terminal in Denmark processing more than of Denmark s container traffic and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world It is a municipal self governing port with independent finances The facilities handle some million tonnes of cargo a year Grain is the principal export while feedstuffs stone cement and coal are among the chief imports Since the port has faced increasing competition from the Port of Hamburg and freight volumes have decreased somewhat from the peak in br The ferry terminal presents the only alternative to the Great Belt Link for passenger transport between Jutland and Zealand It has served different ferry companies since the first steamship route to Copenhagen opened in Currently Mols Linien operates the route and annually transports some two million passengers and a million vehicles Additional roll on roll off cargo ferries serve Finland and Kalundborg on a weekly basis and smaller outlying Danish ports at irregular intervals Since the early s the port has increasingly become a destination for cruise lines operating in the Baltic Sea br br br Tourism br br The ARoS Art Museum the Old Town Museum and Tivoli Friheden are among Denmark s top tourist attractions With a combined total of almost million visitors they represent the driving force behind tourism but other venues such as Moesg rd Museum and Kvindemuseet are also popular The city s extensive shopping facilities are also said to be a major attraction for tourists as are festivals especially NorthSide and SPOT Many visitors arrive on cruise ships in vessels visited the port with over passengers br In the s there was a significant expansion of tourist facilities culminating in the opening of the room Comwell Hotel in July which increased the number of hotel rooms in the city by Some estimates put the number of visitors spending at least one night as high as a year most of them Danes from other regions with the remainder coming mainly from Norway Sweden northern Germany and the United Kingdom Overall they spend roughly DKK billion million in the city each year The primary motivation for tourists choosing Aarhus as a destination is experiencing the city and culture family and couples vacation or as a part of a round trip in Denmark The average stay is little more than three days on average br There are more than tourist information spots across the city Some of them are staffed while others are online publicly accessible touchscreens The official tourist information service in Aarhus is organised under VisitAarhus a corporate foundation initiated in by Aarhus Municipality and local commercial interest organisations br br br Research parks br br The largest research park in Aarhus is INCUBA Science Park focused on IT and biomedical research It is based on Denmark s first research park Forskerpark Aarhus Research Park Aarhus founded in which in merged with another research park to form INCUBA Science Park The organisation is owned partly by Aarhus University and private investors and aims to foster close relationships between public institutions and startup companies It is physically divided across locations after a new department was inaugurated in Navitas Park in which it will share with the Aarhus School of Marine and Technical Engineering and AU Engineering Another major centre for knowledge is Agro Food Park in Skejby established to facilitate co operation between companies and public institutions working within food science and agriculture In January Arla Foods will open the global innovation centre Arla Nativa in Agro Food Park and in Aarhus University is moving the Danish Centre for Food and Agriculture there as well In some people worked at Agro Food Park spread across companies and institutions and in August Agro Food Park management published plans to expand facilities from m to square metres sq ft br In addition Aarhus is home to the Aarhus School of Architecture one of two Danish Ministry of Education institutions that provide degree programs in architecture and some of the largest architecture firms in the Nordic countries such as Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects Arkitema Architects and C F M ller Architects Taken together these organisations form a unique concentration of expertise and knowledge in architecture outside Copenhagen which the Danish Ministry of Business and Growth refers to as arkitekturklyngen the architecture cluster To promote the cluster the School of Architecture will be given new school buildings centrally in the new Freight Station Neighborhood planned for development in the s In the interim the city council supports a culture business and education centre in the area which may continue in the future neighbourhood in some form The future occupants of the neighbourhood will be businesses and organisations selected for their ability to be involved in the local community and it is hoped that the area will evolve into a hotspot for creativity and design br br br Cityscape br br Aarhus has developed in stages from the Viking Age to modern times all visible in the city today Many architectural styles are represented in different parts of the city such as Romanesque Gothic Renaissance Baroque Rococo National Romantic Nordic Classicism Neoclassical Empire and Functionalism The city has developed around the main transport hubs the river the harbour and later the railway station and as a result the oldest parts are also the most central and busiest today br The streets of Volden The Rampart and Graven The Moat testify to the defences of the initial Viking town and All gaderingen in Midtbyen roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement The street network in the inner city formed during the Middle Ages with narrow curved streets and low dense housing by the river and the coast Vesterport Westward Gate still bears the name of the medieval city gate and the narrow alleyways Posthussm gen and Telefonsm gen are remnants of toll stations from that time The inner city has the oldest preserved buildings especially the Latin Quarter with houses dating back to the early th century in Mejlgade and Skolegade Medieval merchants mansions with courtyards can be seen in Klostergade Studsgade and Skolegade By far the largest part of the present day city was built during and after the industrialization of the late s and the most represented architectural styles today are historicism and modernism especially the subgenre of Danish functionalism of which there are many fine examples The building boom of the s has imprinted itself on Aarhus with a redeveloped harbourfront many new neighbourhoods also in the inner city and a revitalized public space It is also beginning to change the skyline with several dominating high rises br br br Developments br In recent years Aarhus has experienced a large demand in housing and offices spurring a construction boom in some parts of the city The newly built city district of Aarhus formerly docklands includes major housing developments mostly consisting of privately owned apartments designed by architects such as CEBRA and JDS Architects br br In the second quarter of the population of the area stood at only however that number had risen to by October br The main public transportation service is bus line as well as stbanetorvet train station Plans to service the area by the light rail line Aarhus Letbane have now been shelved br br br Landmarks br br Aarhus Cathedral rhus Domkirke in the centre of Aarhus is the longest and tallest church in Denmark at m ft and m ft in length and height respectively Originally built as a Romanesque basilica in the th century it was rebuilt and enlarged as a Gothic cathedral in the late th and early th centuries Even though the cathedral stood finished around it took more than a century to build the associated cathedral school of Aarhus Katedralskole was already founded in and ranks as the th oldest school in the world Another important and historic landmark in the inner city is the Church of Our Lady Vor Frue Kirke also from the th century in Romanesque and Gothic style It is smaller and less impressive but it was the first cathedral of Aarhus and founded on an even older church constructed in the oldest stone church in Scandinavia Langelandsgade Kaserne in National Romantic Style from is the oldest former military barracks left in the country home to the university Department of Aesthetics and Communication since br br Marselisborg Palace Marselisborg Slot designed by Hack Kampmann in Neoclassical and Art Nouveau styles was donated by the city to Prince Christian and Princess Alexandrine as a wedding present in The Aarhus Custom House Toldkammeret from is said to be Hack Kampmann s finest work br Tivoli Friheden Tivoli Freedom opened in and has since been the largest amusement park in the city and a tourist attraction Aarhus Theatre from in the Art Nouveau style is the largest provincial theatre in Denmark The early buildings of Aarhus University especially the main building completed in designed by Kay Fisker Povl Stegmann and by C F M ller have gained an international reputation for their contribution to functionalist architecture The City Hall Aarhus R dhus from with an iconic m ft tower clad in marble was designed by Arne Jacobsen and Erik M ller in a modern Functionalist style br br br Culture br Aarhus is home to many annual cultural events and festivals museums theatres and sports events of both national and international importance and presents some of the largest cultural attractions in Denmark There is a long tradition of music from all genres and many Danish bands have emerged from Aarhus Libraries cultural centres and educational institutions present free or easy opportunities for the citizens to participate in engage in or be creative with cultural events and productions of all kinds br Since Aarhus has marketed itself as Smilets by City of smiles which has become both an informal moniker and official slogan In the city council opted to change the slogan to Aarhus Danish for Progress but it was unpopular and abandoned after just a few years Other slogans that have occasionally been used are Byen ved havet City by the sea Mellem bugt og b geskov Between bay and beechwood and Verdens mindste storby World s smallest big city Aarhus is featured in popular songs such as Hjem til Aarhus by P Slaget Lav sol over Aarhus by Gnags Aarhus C by Flemming J rgensen Pigen ud af Aarhus by Tina Dickow and Slingrer ned ad Vestergade by Gnags In the number Sangen til
