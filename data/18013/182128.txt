his contract with Wednesday to hold his vigil by re enacting Odin s time hanging from a World Tree while pierced by a spear for nine days During these nine days he is visited by Horus who has become mad from living too long as a hawk Shadow dies and visits the land of the dead where he is judged by Anubis Shadow learns that he is Wednesday s Odin s son conceived as part of the deity s plans During this time Mr Town arrives at the World Tree ordered by Mr World to cut a branch from it br Horus finds Easter and convinces her to bring Shadow back to life Shadow realizes Mr World is actually Low Key Loki Lyesmith and that Odin and Loki have been working a two man con They orchestrated Shadow s birth his meeting of Loki in disguise in prison and even Laura s death Loki had arranged for

to Rock City and meets Mr Town who does not realize who she is and they agree to travel together During their travels Laura learns who Mr Town is and once they arrive at their destination kills him and takes the branch he took from the World Tree She then meets with Loki and manages to stab him with the World Tree branch which turns into a spear as she stabs br Shadow arrives at Rock City and confronts Loki now gravely wounded and the ghost of Odin who reveal their plans Shadow travels to the site of the battle and explains that both sides have nothing to gain and everything to lose with

fades Laura asks Shadow to take the coin from her which he does and she finally dies br After resting with Mr Nancy Shadow remembers a dream where the Hindu god Ganesha told him to look in the trunk

while trapped beneath sees cars from past winters resting on the lake floor Each one presumably has a child s body locked inside Shadow is saved by Hinzelmann who takes him to his house and treats him for hypothermia Shadow realizes that Hinzelmann is a god and is also responsible for the children s kidnappings and deaths Hinzelmann explains that he regretfully must take one child as a sacrifice each year in exchange for the town s prosperity The townspeople are unaware of this and Hinzelmann s control of the town as he tries to sacrifice children that no one will greatly miss Shadow thinks of killing Hinzelmann but finds he cannot as Hinzelmann saved his life However Chad Mulligan overhears the conversation and shoots Hinzelmann killing him Shadow and Chad drive away with Chad guilty to the point of suicide Shadow concludes this is a fail safe created by Hinzelmann so that whoever killed him would die soon after Using magic Shadow takes Chad s memory of overhearing Hinzelmann and the killing He leaves Chad and Lakeside behind understanding that the town s prosperity will likely wither away without Hinzelmann s protection br In Iceland Shadow meets another incarnation of Odin created by the belief of the original settlers of Iceland who is much closer than Wednesday to the Odin of mythology Shadow accuses Odin of Wednesday s actions but Odin retorts He was me yes But I am not him He indicates that Wednesday was the part of him that went with his followers when they traveled to the new world and became corrupted as he was gradually forgotten Shadow gives Wednesday s glass eye to Odin which Odin places in a leather bag as a keepsake Shadow performs a simple sleight of hand coin trick which delights Odin who asks for a repeat performance Shadow then performs a
