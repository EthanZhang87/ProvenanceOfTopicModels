positive coverage as well as plans for rebranding the group s racism and antisemitism with the identitarian label and innocuous sounding slogans such as Make America Beautiful Again The Southern Poverty Law Center commented that the group s rebrands offers further cover to smuggle white nationalist views into mainstream politics and that its attempts to influence media for spreading propaganda and recruiting were often successful Shortly after the leak Patrick Casey said that the group has been retired and announced the formation a new group American Identity Movement The SPLC commented that the new group will continue Identity Evropa s efforts at quietly working to normalize their ideas within the Republican Party After the leak Discord removed Identity Evropa chat

the group s weekly meetings These audio recordings reveal that despite Casey s claim that American Identity Movement is not a rebrand of Identity Evropa the two are in fact the same group Matthew Warner the group s second in command admitted in the recordings that Identity Evropa s membership list and dues payments directly carry over to the AIM and reiterated that the group would only accept non Jewish White Americans After the Discord leak the groups has used stricter vetting processes in an attempt to prevent future leaks where members are required to make two Skype calls and one in person meeting before being given sensitive information such as the location of the group s new headquarter in Washington D C After the rebrand Identity Evropa continued its attempts to coordinate its members to edit the group s Wikipedia page into more favorable terms Leaders of the group expressed fear that the existing page for IE would simply be renamed into AIM which would foil the groups s rebranding attempts In the recordings Casey urged members to rebrand their social media accounts as well saying that the groups s new Americana aesthetic would help its members avoid being held accountable for their membership Discussing the group s strategy Casey said in the recordings that the group would appeal to the boomer patriot crowd and would ideally exploit political crises to seize control of the United States government and replacing it with a white only identitarian regime br br br Fake Antifa Twitter account br In June during the George Floyd protests Identity Evropa set up a false flag account on Twitter purporting to represent the antifascist movement antifa The account urged violence with comments such as Tonight s the night Comrades Tonight we say Fuck The City and we move into the residential areas the white hoods and we take what s ours According to a spokesperson for Twitter it was not the first time that Identity Evropa had created such fake accounts Before the account was closed down by Twitter it had been cited by United States law enforcement officials as an example of left wing radicals attempting to foment violence A comment on the account was re posted on Instagram by Donald Trump Jr who commented about antifa They re not even pretending anymore John Cohen a former senior Department of Homeland Security official said Time and time again we have seen public figures media personalities and even government officials amplifying disinformation and extremist rhetoric intended to inspire violence A great step in deescalating the violence currently facing the Nation would be for this to end Facebook also took action against supposed antifa accounts and had prevented the Twitter postings from being distributed on its platform br In Data Society a non profit research organization documented how fake antifa accounts are used to damage the movement writing Various white supremacist groups have consistently tried to damage Antifa s reputation in the media by doxing protesters releasing their personal information or impersonating them online Throughout right wing manipulators utilized parody to discredit Antifa taking

SPLC which tracks extremist groups in the United States has designated it as a hate group Their campus centric advertising posters depict photos of classical Greek sculptures of men overlaid with various short slogans which urge whites to embrace cultural elitism Mark Potok a senior fellow at the SPLC states Identity Evropa is merely the latest iteration of the white supremacist movement

describes as a false anti white narrative by professors whom Damigo calls charlatans br In late Damigo and Identity Evropa members traveled to Washington D C for a post election conference hosted by the white supremacist National Policy Institute at which keynote speaker Richard B Spencer and several other attendees rendered a Nazi salute br During the Berkeley protests Damigo punched a young woman captured on video that subsequently went viral Footage showed Damigo punching the woman in the face then running away into the crowd The attack prompted calls for Damigo s arrest or expulsion
