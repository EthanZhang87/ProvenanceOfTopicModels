id: 898503
Steam is a video game digital distribution service and storefront managed by Valve It was launched as a software client in September to provide game updates automatically for Valve s games and expanded to distributing third party titles in late Steam offers various features like game server matchmaking with Valve Anti Cheat measures social networking and game streaming services Steam client s functions include game update automation cloud storage for game progress and community features such as direct messaging in game overlay functions and a virtual collectable marketplace br Steamworks an application programming interface API released in is used by developers to integrate Steam s functions including digital rights management DRM into their game products Many game publishers began distributing their products on Steam that year Initially developed for Windows Steam was ported to macOS Linux Android and iOS in the early s The storefront also offers productivity software game soundtracks videos and Valve hardware such as the Index and Steam Deck br The service is the largest digital distribution platform for PC games with an estimated of the market share in according to IHS Screen Digest By game purchases through Steam totaled about US billion or at least of global PC game sales according to Steam Spy By the service had over games with over million monthly active users Steam s success has led to the development of the Steam Machine gaming PCs in including the SteamOS Linux distribution and Steam Controller Steam Link devices for local game streaming and in the handheld Steam Deck tailored for running Steam games br br br History br br In the early s Valve was looking for a better way to update its published games as providing downloadable patches for multiplayer games resulted in most of the online user base disconnecting for several days until players had installed the patch They decided to create a platform that would update games automatically and implement stronger anti piracy and anti cheat measures They approached several companies including Microsoft Yahoo and RealNetworks to build a client with these features but were declined br Valve began its own platform development in using the working names Grid and Gazelle The Steam platform was publicly announced at the Game Developers Conference event on March and released for beta testing that day Prior to the implementation of Steam Valve had a publishing contract with Sierra Studios the version of the contract gave Valve rights to digital distribution of its games Valve took Sierra and their owners Vivendi Games to court in over a claimed breach of this contract Sierra counter sued asserting that Valve had been working to undermine the contract by offering a digital storefront for their games directly competing with Sierra br In November Half Life was the first game to be offered digitally on Steam requiring installation of the Steam client for retail copies During this time users faced problems attempting to play the game The Steam requirement was met with concerns about software ownership software requirements and problems with overloaded servers demonstrated previously by the Counter Strike rollout br In third party developers were contracted to release games on Steam such as Rag Doll Kung Fu and Darwinia In May ATI included Steam in the ATI Catalyst GPU driver as well as offering a free Steam copy of Half Life Lost Coast and Half Life Deathmatch to ATI Radeon owners In January Nvidia promoted Steam in the GeForce GPU driver as well as offering a free Steam copy of Portal The First Slice to Nvidia hardware owners br In Electronic Arts removed some of its games from Steam because of its restrictive terms of service and launched its games beginning with Mass Effect in on its Origin service In Ubisoft announced that they would stop selling their future games on Steam starting with Tom Clancy s The Division because Valve would not modify its revenue sharing model In May Microsoft distributed its games on Steam in addition to the Microsoft Store br In Electronic Arts started to publish select games on Steam and offered its rebranded subscription service EA Play on the platform In Ubisoft announced that they would return to selling its recent games on Steam starting with Assassin s Creed Valhalla stating that they were constantly evaluating how to bring our games to different audiences wherever they are br By total annual game sales on Steam were estimated at billion By the service had over million monthly active users In its network delivered billion gigabytes of data compared to less than billion in br br br Features and functionality br br br Software delivery and maintenance br Steam s primary service is to allow its users to purchase games and other software adding them to a virtual library from which they may be downloaded and installed an unlimited number of times Initially Valve was required to be the publisher for these games since they had sole access to Steam s database and engine but with the introduction of the Steamworks software development kit SDK in May anyone could integrate Steam into their game without Valve s direct involvement br Valve intended to make DRM obsolete as games released on Steam had traditional anti piracy measures including the assignment and distribution of product keys and support for digital rights management software tools such as SecuROM or non malicious rootkits With an update to the Steamworks SDK in March Valve added Custom Executable Generation CEG which creates a unique encrypted copy of the game s executable files for the given user which allows them to install it multiple times and on multiple devices and make backup copies of their software Once the software is downloaded and installed the user must then authenticate through Steam to de encrypt the executable files to play the game Normally this is done while connected to the Internet following the user s credential validation but once they have logged into Steam once a user can instruct Steam to launch in a special offline mode to be able to play their games without a network connection Developers are not limited to Steam s CEG and may include other forms of DRM or none at all and other authentication services than Steam for example some games from publisher Ubisoft require the use of their Uplay gaming service br In November Steam achievements were added similar to Xbox Achievements In September Valve added support for Steam Cloud a service that can automatically store saved game and related custom files on Valve s servers users can access this data from any machine running the Steam client Users can disable this feature on a per game and per account basis Cloud saving was expanded in January for Dynamic Cloud Sync allowing games developed with this feature to store saved states to Steam Cloud while a game is running rather than waiting until the user quit this was added ahead of the portable Steam Deck unit so that users can save from the Deck and then put the unit into a suspended state In May the service added the ability for users to manage their game libraries from remote clients including computers and mobile devices Product keys sold through third party retailers can also be redeemed on Steam For games that incorporate Steamworks users can buy redemption codes from other vendors and redeem these in the Steam client to add the title to their libraries Steam also offers a framework for selling and distributing downloadable content DLC for games br In September Steam introduced the ability to share most games with family members and close friends by authorizing machines to access one s library Authorized players can install the game locally and play it separately from the owning account Users can access their saved games and achievements provided the main owner is not playing When the main player initiates a game while a shared account is using it the shared account user is allowed a few minutes to either save their progress and close the game or purchase the game for their own account Within Family View introduced in January parents can adjust settings for their children s tied accounts limiting the functionality and accessibility to the Steam client and purchased games A more robust implementation of Family Sharing titled Steam Families was put into beta in allowing up to five members of a household to share games from a single account including the ability to play different games on those accounts along with different game saves and profiles and enhanced parental control tools for those accounts br By its acceptable use policy Valve retains the right to block customers access to their games and Steam services when Valve s Anti Cheat VAC software determines that the user is cheating in multiplayer games selling accounts to others or trading games to exploit regional price differences Blocking such users initially removed access to their other games leading to some users with high value accounts losing access because of minor infractions Valve later changed its policy to be similar to that of Electronic Arts Origin platform in which blocked users can still access their games but are heavily restricted limited to playing in offline mode and unable to participate in Steam Community features Customers also lose access to their games and Steam account if they refuse to accept changes to Steam s end user license agreements this last occurred in August In April Valve began allowing developers to set bans on players for their games but enacted and enforced at the Steam level which allowed them to police their own gaming communities in a customizable manner br br br Storefront features br The Steam client includes a digital storefront called the Steam Store through which users can purchase games Once the game is bought a software license is permanently attached to the user s Steam account allowing them to download the software on any compatible device Game licenses can be given to other accounts under certain conditions Content is delivered from an international network of servers using a proprietary file transfer protocol As of Steam sells its products in US and Canadian dollars euros pounds sterling Brazilian reais Russian rubles Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupees depending on the user s location In December the client began supporting the WebMoney payment system From April until December Steam accepted payments in Bitcoin before dropping support for it due to high fluctuation in value and costly service fees The Steam storefront validates the user s region the purchase of games may be restricted to specific regions because of release dates game classification or agreements with publishers Since the Steam Translation Server project allows Steam users to assist with the translation of the Steam client storefront and a selected library of Steam games for twenty eight languages In October official support for Vietnamese and Latin American Spanish was added in addition to Steam s then languages Steam also allows users to purchase downloadable content for games and for some specific games such as Team Fortress the ability to purchase in game inventory items In February Steam began to open similar options for in game item purchases for third party games br In conjunction with developers and publishers Valve frequently provides discounted sales on games on a daily and weekly basis sometimes oriented around a publisher genre or holiday theme and sometimes allows games to be tried for free during the days of these sales The site normally offers a large selection of games at a discount during its annual Summer and Holiday sales including gamification of these sales br Users of Steam s storefront can also purchase games and other software as gifts for another Steam user Before May users could purchase these gifts to be held in their profile s inventory until they opted to gift them However this feature enabled a gray market around some games where a user in a country where the price of a game was substantially lower than elsewhere could stockpile giftable copies to sell to others in regions with much higher prices In August Valve changed its gifting policy to require that games with VAC and Game Ban enabled games be gifted immediately to another Steam user which also served to combat players that worked around VAC and Game Bans in May Valve expanded this policy to all games The changes also placed limitations on gifts between users of different countries if there is a large difference in pricing Due to runaway inflation in Argentina and Turkey Valve eliminated the use of local currency pricing for users in those storefronts in November instead moving them to a special regional pricing model based on U S dollars as a means to provide fair payments to publisher and developers though these local users saw effective price hikes as high as br The Steam store also enables users to redeem store product keys to add software from their library The keys are sold by third party providers such as Humble Bundle distributed as part of a physical release or given to a user as part of promotions often used to deliver Kickstarter and other crowdfunding rewards A grey market exists around Steam keys where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost and then resell these keys to users or other third party sites at a higher price This caused some of these third party sites such as G A to be embroiled in this grey market It is possible for publishers to have Valve track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them removing the product from the user s libraries Other legitimate storefronts like Humble Bundle have set a minimum price that must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases In June Valve began limiting how frequently Steam users could change their default region to prevent them from purchasing games from outside their home region for cheaper br In Steam began to accept player reviews of games Other users can subsequently rate these reviews as helpful humorous or otherwise unhelpful which are then used to highlight the most useful reviews on the game s Steam store page Steam also aggregates these reviews and enables users to sort products based on this feedback while browsing the store In May Steam further broke out these aggregations between all reviews overall and those made more recently in the last days a change Valve acknowledges to how game updates particularly those in Early Access can alter the impression of a game to users To prevent observed abuse of the review system by developers or other third party agents Valve modified the review system in September to discount review scores for a game from users that activated the product through a product key rather than directly purchased by the Steam Store though their reviews remain visible Alongside this Valve announced that it would end business relations with any developer or publisher that they found to be abusing the review system Separately Valve has taken actions to minimize the effects of review bombs on Steam In particular Valve announced in March that they mark reviews they believe are off topic as a result of a review bomb and eliminate their contribution to summary review scores the first such games they took action on with this were the Borderlands games after it was announced Borderlands would be a timed exclusive to the Epic Games Store br During mid Valve began to offer free to play games such as Global Agenda Spiral Knights and Champions Online this offer was linked to the company s move to make Team Fortress a free to play title Valve included support via Steamworks for microtransactions for in game items through Steam s purchasing channels in a similar manner to the in game store for Team Fortress Later that year Valve added the ability to trade in game items and unopened game gifts between users Steam Coupons which was introduced in December provides single use coupons that provide a discount to the cost of items Steam Coupons can be provided to users by developers and publishers users can trade these coupons between friends in a similar fashion to gifts and in game items In May GameStop began selling Steam Wallet cards Steam Market a feature introduced in beta in December that would allow users to sell virtual items to others via Steam Wallet funds further extended the idea Valve levies a transaction fee of on such sales and game publishers that use Steam Market pay a transaction fee For example Team Fortress the first game supported at the beta phase incurred both fees Full support for other games was expected to be available in early In April Valve added subscription based game support to Steam the first game to use this service was Darkfall Unholy Wars br In October Steam introduced non gaming applications which are sold through the service in the same manner as games Creativity and productivity applications can access the core functions of the Steamworks API allowing them to use Steam s simplified installation and updating process and incorporate features including cloud saving and Steam Workshop Steam also allows game soundtracks to be purchased to be played via Steam Music or integrated with the user s other media players Valve adjusted its approach to soundtracks in no longer requiring them to be offered as DLC meaning that users can buy soundtracks to games they do not own and publishers can offer soundtracks to games not on Steam br Valve has also added the ability for publishers to rent and sell digital movies via the service with initially most being video game documentaries Following Warner Bros Entertainment offering the Mad Max films alongside the September release of the game based on the series Lionsgate entered into agreement with Valve to rent over one hundred feature films from its catalog through Steam starting in April with more films following later In March Crunchyroll started offering various anime for purchase or rent through Steam However by February Valve shuttered video from its storefront save for videos directly related to gaming content While available users could also purchase Steam Machine related hardware br Valve received revenue share of a flat from all direct Steam sales and transactions In October Valve updated their policies that cut theirs to once revenue for a game surpasses US million and further to at US million The policy change was seen by journalists as trying to entice larger developers to stay with Steam while the decision was also met with backlash from indie and other small game developers as their revenue split remained unchanged br While Steam allows developers to offer demo versions of their games at any time Valve worked with Geoff Keighley in in conjunction with The Game Awards to hold a week long Steam Game Festival to feature a large selection of game demos of current and upcoming games alongside sales for games already released This event has since been repeated two or three times a year typically in conjunction with game expositions or award events and since has been renamed as the Steam Next Fest Valve expaned support for demo versions of games in July allowing demos to have their own store page with user reviews and made it easier for user to manage demos within their game library br A Steam Points system and storefront was added in June which mirrored similar temporary points systems that had been used in prior sales on the storefront Users earn points through purchases on Steam or by receiving community recognition for helpful reviews or discussion comments These points can be redeemed in the separate storefront for cosmetics that apply to the user s profile and chat interface br br br Privacy security and abuse br The popularity of Steam has led to the services being attacked by hackers An attempt occurred in November when Valve temporarily closed the community forums citing potential hacking threats to the service Days later Valve reported that the hack had compromised one of its customer databases potentially allowing the perpetrators to access customer information including encrypted passwords and credit card details At that time Valve was not aware whether the intruders actually accessed this information or discovered the encryption method but nevertheless warned users to be alert for fraudulent activity br Valve added Steam Guard functionality to the Steam client in March to protect against the hijacking of accounts via phishing schemes one of the largest support problems Valve had at the time Steam Guard was advertised to take advantage of the identity protection provided by Intel s second generation Core processors and compatible motherboard hardware which allows users to lock their account to a specific computer Once locked activity by that account on other computers must first be approved by the user on the locked computer Support APIs for Steam Guard are available to third party developers through Steamworks Steam Guard also offers two factor risk based authentication that uses a one time verification code sent to a verified email address associated with the Steam account this was later expanded to include two factor authentication through the Steam mobile application known as Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator br In Valve stated that the potential monetary value of virtual goods attached to user accounts had drawn hackers to try to access accounts for financial benefit Valve reported that in December around accounts per month were hijacked enabling the hijackers to empty the user s inventory of items through the trading features To improve security the company announced that new restrictions would be added in March under which day holds are placed on traded items unless they activate and authenticate with Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator After a Counter Strike Global Offensive gambling controversy Valve stated it is cracking down on third party websites using Steam inventory trading for Skin gambling in July br ReVuln a commercial vulnerability research firm published a paper in October that said the Steam browser protocol was posing a security risk by enabling malicious exploits through a simple user click on a maliciously crafted steam URL in a browser This was the second serious vulnerability of gaming related software following a problem with Ubisoft s Uplay German IT platform Heise online recommended strict separation of gaming and sensitive data for example using a PC dedicated to gaming gaming from a second Windows installation or using a computer account with limited rights dedicated to gaming br In July a bug in the software allowed anyone to reset the password to any account by using the forgot password function of the client High profile professional gamers and streamers lost access to their accounts In December Steam s content delivery network was misconfigured in response to a DDoS attack causing cached store pages containing personal information to be temporarily exposed for users br In April Valve added new privacy settings for Steam users who can hide their activity status game lists inventory and other profile elements While these changes brought Steam s privacy settings in line with approaches used by game console services they also impacted third party services such as Steam Spy which relied on the public data to estimate Steam sales count br Valve established a HackerOne bug bounty program in May a crowdsourced method to test and improve the security features of the Steam client In August a security researcher exposed a zero day vulnerability in the Windows client of Steam which allowed for any user to run arbitrary code with LocalSystem privileges using just a few simple commands The vulnerability was then reported to Valve via the program but it was initially rejected for being out of scope Following a second vulnerability found by the same user Valve apologized and patched them both and expanded the program s rules to accept any other similar problems br The Anti Defamation League published a report that stated the Steam Community platform harbors hateful content in April In January a trading card glitch let players generate Steam Wallet funds from free Steam trading cards with bots using Capcom Arcade Stadium and other games resulting in the game becoming one of the statistically most played titles br br br User interface and functions br Since November Steam has allowed for users to review their purchased games and organize them into categories set by the user and add to favorite lists for quick access br Players can add non Steam games to their libraries allowing the game to be easily accessed from the Steam client and providing support where possible for Steam Overlay features The Steam interface allows for user defined shortcuts to be added In this way third party modifications and games not purchased through the Steam Store can use Steam features Valve sponsors and distributes some modifications free of charge and modifications that use Steamworks can also any Steam features supported by their parent game For most games launched from Steam the client provides an in game overlay from which the user can access Steam Community lists and participate in chat manage selected Steam settings and access a built in web browser without having to exit the game Since the beginning of February as a beta version the overlay also allows players to take screenshots of the games in process As a full version on February this feature was reimplemented so that users could share screenshots on websites of Facebook Twitter and Reddit directly from a user s screenshot manager br br Steam s Big Picture mode was announced in public betas started in September and were integrated into the software in December Big Picture mode is a foot user interface which optimizes the Steam display to work on high definition televisions allowing the user to control Steam with a gamepad or with a keyboard and mouse Newell stated that Big Picture mode was a step towards a dedicated Steam entertainment hardware unit With the introduction of the Steam Deck Valve began pushing the new Big Picture mode based on the Steam Deck UI in beta testing in October and full release in February br In Valve announced Steam for Schools a free function limited version of the Steam client for schools It was part of Valve s initiative to support gamification of learning It was released alongside free versions of Portal and a standalone program called Puzzle Maker that allowed teachers and students to create and manipulate levels It featured additional authentication security that allowed teachers to share and distribute content via a Steam Workshop type interface but blocks access from students br In Home Streaming was introduced in May it allows users to stream games installed on one computer to another on the same home network with low latency By June Valve renamed this feature to Remote Play allowing users to stream games across devices that may be outside of their home network Steam s Remote Play Together added in November after a month of beta testing gives the ability for local multiplayer games to be played by people in disparate locations though will not necessary resolve latency problems typical of these types of games Remote Play Together was expanded in February to give the ability to invite non Steam players to play through a Steam Link app approach br br The Steam client as part of a social network service allows users to identify friends and join groups using the Steam Community feature Through the Steam Chat feature users can use text chat and peer to peer VoIP with other users identify which games their friends and other group members are playing and join and invite friends to Steamworks based multiplayer games that support this feature Users can participate in forums hosted by Valve to discuss Steam games Each user has a unique page that shows his or her groups and friends game library including earned achievements game wishlists and other social features users can choose to keep this information private In January Valve reported that million of the million active Steam accounts had signed up to Steam Community In conjunction with the Steam Summer Sale user profiles were updated with Badges reflecting the user s participation in the Steam community and past events Steam Trading Cards a system where players earn virtual trading cards based on games they own were introduced in May Using them players can trade with other Steam users on the Steam Community Marketplace and use them to craft Badges which grant rewards such as discount coupons and user profile page customization options In the Steam client became an OpenID provider allowing third party websites to use a Steam user s identity without requiring the user to expose his or her Steam credentials In order to prevent abuse access to most community features is restricted until a one time payment of at least US is made to Valve This requirement can be fulfilled by making any purchase of five dollars or more on Steam or by adding at the same amount to their wallet br Through Steamworks Steam provides a means of server browsing for multiplayer games that use the Steam Community features allowing users to create lobbies with friends or members of common groups Steamworks also provides Valve Anti Cheat VAC Valve s anti cheat system game servers automatically detect and report users who are using cheats in online multiplayer games In August Valve added new features including dedicated hub pages for games that highlight the best user created content top forum posts and screenshots to the Community area In December a feature where users can upload walkthroughs and guides detailing game strategy was added Starting in January the Steam client allowed players to livestream to Steam friends or the public while playing games on the platform For the main event of The International Dota tournament Valve launched Steam tv as a major update to Steam Broadcasting adding Steam chat and Steamworks integration for spectating matches played at the event It has also been used for other events such as a pre release tournament for the digital card game Artifact and for The Game Awards and Steam Awards award shows Game Recording was added in beta in June allowing for recording of gameplay sessions both on demand or as a background recording Users can then edit and clip footage to share via Steam with other users br In September Steam Music was added to the Steam client allowing users to play through music stored on their computer or to stream from a locally networked computer directly in Steam An update to the friends and chat system was released in July allowing for non peer to peer chats integrated with voice chat and other features that were compared to Discord A standalone mobile app based on this for Android and iOS was released in May br A major visual overhaul of the Library and game profile pages was released in October These redesigns are aimed to aid users to organize their games help showcase what shared games a user s friends are playing games that are being live streamed and new content that may be available along with more customization options for sorting games Associated with that Valve gave developers a means of communicating when special in game events are approaching through Steam Events which appear to players on the revamped Library and game profile pages br Another major overhaul of the UI was released in June Besides unifying backend functions for the main Steam client Steam Deck client and Big Picture mode the new UI featured an improved screen overlay that users could pin various dialogs such as friend chat and game guides that would remain visible while playing a game A new notes feature allowed users to create personal notes that are stored in the cloud that they could use for various tracking of progress or reminders while in game br br br Developer features br Valve provides developers the ability to create storefront pages to help generate interest in their game ahead of release This is also necessary to fix a release date that functions into Valve s build review a free service performed by Valve about a week before this release date to make sure the game s launch is trouble free Updates in to Discovery queues have given developers more options for customizing their storefront page and how these pages integrate with users experiences with the Steam client br Valve offers Steamworks an application programming interface API that provides development and publishing tools free of charge to game and software developers Steamworks provides networking and player authentication tools for both server and peer to peer multiplayer games matchmaking services support for Steam community friends and groups Steam statistics and achievements integrated voice communications and Steam Cloud support allowing games to integrate with the Steam client The API also provides anti cheating devices and digital copy management In after introducing the Steam Controller and improvements to the Steam interface to support numerous customization options the Steamworks API was also updated to provide a generic controller library for developers and these customization features for other third party controllers starting with the DualShock Steam s Input API has since been updated to include official support for other console controllers such as the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller in the Xbox Wireless Controller for the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles and the PlayStation s DualSense as well as compatible controllers from third party manufacturers in In November Valve said the controller usage had more than doubled over the past years In March Steam s game server network was opened to third party developers br Developers of software available on Steam can track sales of their games through the Steam store In February Valve announced that it would begin to allow developers to set up their own sales for their games independent of any sales that Valve may set Valve may also work with developers to suggest their participation in sales on themed days br Steam has conducted and partially published a monthly opt in hardware and software survey between and br Valve added the ability for developers to sell games under an early access model with a special section of the Steam store starting in March This program allows developers to release functional but not finished products such as beta versions to the service to allow users to buy the games and help provide testing and feedback towards the final production Early access also helps to provide funding to the developers to help complete their games The early access approach allowed more developers to publish games onto the Steam service without the need for Valve s direct curation of games significantly increasing the number of available games on the service br Developers can request Steam keys of their products to use as they see fit such as to give away in promotions to provide to selected users for review or to give to key resellers for different prioritization Valve generally honors all such requests but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys to games or other offerings that are designed to manipulate the Steam storefront and other features br Valve enabled the ability for multiple developers to create bundles of games from their offerings in June br br br Steam Workshop br The Steam Workshop is a service that allows users to share user made content and modifications for video games available on Steam New levels art assets gameplay modifications or other content may be published to or installed from the Workshop depending on the title The Workshop was originally used for distribution of new items for Team Fortress it was redesigned to extend support for any game in early including modifications for The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim A May patch for Portal enabled by a new map making tool through the Workshop introduced the ability to share user created levels Independently developed games including Dungeons of Dredmor are able to provide Workshop support for user made content Dota became Valve s third published title available for the Workshop in June its features include customizable accessories character skins and announcer packs Workshop content may be monetized Newell said that the Workshop was inspired by gold farming from World of Warcraft to find a way to incentive both players and content creators in video games and which had informed them of their approach to Team Fortress and their later multiplayer games br By January Valve themselves had provided some user developed Workshop content as paid for features in Valve developed games including Team Fortress and Dota with over million being paid to content creators using the Workshop Valve began allowing developers to use these advanced features in January both the developer and content generator share the profits of the sale of these items the feature went live in April starting with various mods for Skyrim This feature was pulled a few days afterward following negative user feedback and reports of pricing and copyright misuse Six months later Valve stated they were still interested in offering this type of functionality in the future In November the Steam client was updated with the ability for game developers to offer in game items for direct sale via the store interface with Rust being the first game to use the feature br br br SteamVR br SteamVR is a virtual reality hardware and software platform developed by Valve with a focus on allowing room scale experiences using positional tracking base stations as opposed to those requiring the player to stay in a singular location SteamVR was first introduced for the Oculus Rift headset in and later expanded to support other virtual reality headsets Initially released for support on Windows macOS and Linux Valve dropped macOS support for SteamVR in May SteamVR was released in October adding in UI features common to the main Steam app and the Steam Deck app as well as further improvements for virtual reality users br br br Storefront curation br Until Valve handpicked games to be included onto the Steam service limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them or smaller studios with proven track records Since then Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam while pulling away from manually approving games short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated In Steam development team member Alden Kroll said that Valve knows Steam is in a near monopoly for game sales on personal computers and the company does not want to be in a position to determine what gets sold and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control At the same time Valve recognized that unfettered control of games in the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low quality games br br br Steam Greenlight br Valve announced Steam Greenlight to streamline game addition to the service in July and released the following month Through Greenlight Steam users would choose which games were added to the service Developers were able to submit information about their games as well as early builds or beta versions for consideration by users Users would pledge support for these games and Valve would make top pledged games available on Steam In response to complaints during its first week that finding games to support was made difficult by a flood of inappropriate or false submissions Valve required developers to pay US to list a game on the service Those fees were donated to the charity Child s Play This fee was met with some concern from smaller developers who often are already working in a deficit and may not have the money to cover such fees A later modification allowed developers to put conceptual ideas on the Greenlight service to garner interest in potential projects free of charge votes from such projects are visible only to the developer Valve also allowed non gaming software to be voted onto the service through Greenlight br The initial process offered by Greenlight was panned by developers because while they favored the concept the rate of games that were eventually approved were small In January Newell stated that Valve recognized that its role in Greenlight was perceived as a bottleneck something the company was planning to eliminate in the future through an open marketplace infrastructure On the eve of Greenlight s first anniversary Valve simultaneously approved games to demonstrate this change of direction br br br Steam Direct br Steam Greenlight was phased out and replaced with Steam Direct on June following Greenlight s suspension the previous week With Steam Direct a developer or publisher wishing to distribute their game on Steam needs only to complete appropriate identification and tax forms for Valve and then pay a recoupable application fee for each game they intend to publish Once they apply a developer must wait thirty days before publishing the game as to give Valve the ability to review the game to make sure it is configured correctly matches the description provided on the store page and doesn t contain malicious content br On announcing its plans for Steam Direct Valve suggested the fee would be in the range of meant to encourage earnest software submissions to the service and weed out poor quality games that are treated as shovelware improving the discovery pipeline to Steam s customers Smaller developers raised concerns about the Direct fee harming them and excluding potentially good indie games from reaching the Steam store Valve opted to set the Direct fee at after reviewing concerns from the community and outlined plans to improve their discovery algorithms and inject more human involvement to help these Valve refunds the fee should the game exceed in sales In the process of transitioning from Greenlight to Direct Valve mass approved most of the remaining games that were still in Greenlight though the company noted that not all of these were at a state to be published Valve anticipated that the volume of new games added to the service would further increase with Direct in place Some groups such as publisher Raw Fury and crowd funding investment site Fig have offered to pay the Direct fee for indie developers who cannot afford it br br br Games discovery changes br Without more direct interaction in the curation process Valve had looked to find methods to allow players to find games they would be more likely to buy based on previous purchase patterns Valve has rejected the use of paid advertising or placement on the storefront which would have created a pay to win scenario Instead the company had relied on algorithms and other automatic features for game discovery which has allowed for unexpected hits to gain more visibility br The September Discovery Update added tools that would allow existing Steam users to be curators for game recommendations and sorting functions that presented more popular games and recommended games specific to the user This Discovery update was considered successful by Valve as they reported in March in seeing increased use of the Steam Storefront and an increase in of sales by revenue from just prior to the update A second Discovery update was released November giving users more control over what games they want to see or ignore within the Steam Store alongside tools for developers and publishers to better customize and present their game br By February Valve reported that with the second Discovery update the number of games shown to users via the store s front page increased by with more conversions into sales from that viewership In more games are meeting a rough metric of success defined by Valve as selling more than in revenues in its first days of release Valve added a Curator Connect program in December Curators can set up descriptors for the type of games they are interested in preferred languages and other tags along with social media profiles while developers can find and reach out to specific curators from this information and after review provide them directly with access to their game This step which eliminates the use of a Steam redemption key is aimed at reducing the reselling of keys as well as dissuading users who may be trying to game the curator system to obtain free game keys br Valve has attempted to deal with fake games those that are built around reused assets and little other innovation by adding Steam Explorers atop its existing Steam Curator program Any Steam user can sign up to be an Explorer and be asked to look at under performing games on the service to either vouch that the game is truly original or if it is an example of a fake game at which point Valve can take action to remove the game br In July the Steam Labs feature was introduced as a means to showcase experimental discovery features Valve considered for including into Steam to seek public feedback For example an initial experiment released at launch was the Interactive Recommender which uses artificial intelligence algorithms pulling data from the user s past gameplay history to suggest new games that may be of interest to them As these experiments mature through end user testing they have then been brought into the storefront as direct features br The September Discovery update which Valve claimed would improve the visibility of niche and lesser known games was met with criticism from some indie game developers who recorded a significant drop in the exposure of their games including new wishlist additions and appearances in the More Like This and Discovery queue sections of the store br Steam Charts were introduced in September and publicly track the storefront s best selling and most played games including historically by week and month Charts replaced a previous statistics page to be more comprehensive and features content that had previously been part of third party websites including SteamSpy SteamDB and SteamCharts br br br Games and account policies br In June Valve created a formal process to allow purchasers to request refunds with refunds guaranteed within the first two weeks as long as the player had not spent more than two hours in a game Prior to June Valve had a no refunds policy but allowed them in certain circumstances such as digital rights management issues or false advertising br Valve has full authority to remove games from the service for various reasons however games that are removed can still be downloaded and played by those who have already purchased these games Grand Theft Auto Vice City was removed from Steam in because of a claim from the Recording Industry Association of America over an expired license for a song on the soundtrack Around the launch of Electronic Arts EA own digital storefront Origin during the same year Valve removed Crysis Dragon Age II and Alice Madness Returns from Steam because the terms of service prevented games from having their own in game storefront for downloadable content Valve also removes games that are formally stated to be violating copyright or other intellectual property when given such complaints In Valve removed Orion by Trek Industries when Activision filed a Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA complaint about the game after it was discovered that one of the game s artists had taken among other assets gun models directly from Call of Duty Black Ops and Call of Duty Advanced Warfare br br br Quality control br With the launch of Steam Direct effectively removing any curation of games by Valve prior to being published on Steam there have been several incidents of published games that have attempted to mislead Steam users Starting in June Valve has taken actions against games and developers that are trolling the system in September Valve explicitly defined that trolls on Steam aren t actually interested in good faith efforts to make and sell games to you or anyone As an example Valve s Lombardi stated that the game Active Shooter which would have allowed the player to play as either a SWAT team member tasked to take down the shooter at a school shooting incident or as the shooter themselves was an example of trolling as he described it was designed to do nothing but generate outrage and cause conflict through its existence Within a month of clarifying its definition of trolling Valve removed approximately games from Steam br In addition to removing bad actors Valve has also taken steps to reduce the impact of fake games In May Valve identified several games on the service with trading card support where the developer distributed game codes to thousands of bot operated accounts that would run the game to earn trading cards that they could then sell for profit these games would also create false positives that make these games appear more popular than they really were affecting Steam s Discovery algorithms Subsequent to this patch games must reach some type of confidence factor based on actual playtime before they can generate trading cards with players credited for their time played towards receiving trading cards before this metric is met Valve identified a similar situation in June with fake games that offered large numbers of game achievements with little gameplay aspects which some users would use to artificially raise their global achievement statistics Valve plans to use the same approach and algorithms to identify these types of games limiting these games to only one thousand total achievements and discounting these achievements towards a user s statistics These algorithms have resulted in select false positives for legitimate games with unusual end user usage patterns such as Wandersong which was flagged in January for what the developer believed was related to near unanimous positive user reviews from the game br Other actions taken by developers against the terms of service or other policies have prompted Valve to remove games Some noted examples include br br In September Valve removed Digital Homicide Studios games from the storefront for being hostile to Steam customers following a lawsuit that the developer had issued against unnamed Steam users for leaving negative reviews of their games br In September Valve removed games developed by Silicon Echo citing that these were cheap fake games that relied on asset flipping with pre existing Unity game engine assets so that they could be published quickly and were designed to take advantage of the trading card market to allow players and the developers to profit from the trading card sales br In February after discovering that the CEO of Insel Games had requested the company s employees write positive Steam reviews for its games Valve removed all of Insel s games from the service and banned the company from it br In July the games Abstractism and Climber offered Steam inventory items that used assets from other Valve games which were used to mislead users looking for these for trading Valve removed the games and built in additional trade protections warning users of trades involving recently released games or games they do not own to prevent such scamming br In November nearly games were removed from Steam most tied to a Russian publisher that had operated under several different names A Valve representative stated that they recently discovered a handful of partners that were abusing some Steamworks tools as rationale for the removals br Developers stated that Valve began warning them about the removal of games that used cryptocurrencies and non fungible tokens in October as such items could have real world value outside of the game or Steam which would be against Valve s acceptable use policy br With the rise of generative artificial intelligence in Valve originally established that games with content generated in this manner could be distributed through Steam though cautioned developers about assuring that they had the rights for this type of content As greater concerns about the copyright and ethical nature of generational AI in the latter half of Valve clarified its stance in January requiring games that did use content from generational AI to disclose this on the game s store page including methods that the developers used to assure the AI engines did not generate illegal content br br br Mature content br Valve has also removed or threatened to remove games due to inappropriate or mature content though there was often confusion as to what material qualified for this For example Eek Games House Party included scenes of nudity and sexual encounters in its original release which drew criticism from conservative religious organization National Center on Sexual Exploitation leading Valve to remove the title Eek Games later included censor bars within the game allowing the game to be readded to Steam though they offered a patch on their website to remove the bars In May several developers of anime stylized games that contained some light nudity such as HuniePop were told by Valve they had to address sexual content within their games or face removal from Steam leading to questions of inconsistent application of Valve s policies The National Center on Sexual Exploitation took credit for convincing Valve to target these games However Valve later rescinded its orders allowing these games to remain br In June Valve clarified its policy on content taking a more hands off approach outside of illegal material Rather than trying to make decisions themselves on what content is appropriate Valve enhanced its filtering system to allow developers and publishers to indicate and justify the types of mature content violence nudity and sexual content in their games Users can block games that are marked with this type of content from appearing in the store and if they have not blocked it they are presented with the description before they can continue to the store page Developers and publishers with existing games on Steam have been strongly encouraged to complete these forms for these games while Valve will use moderators to make sure new games are appropriately marked Valve also committed to developing anti harassment tools to support developers who may find their game amid controversy br br Until these tools were in place some adult themed games were delayed for release Negligee Love Stories developed by Dharker Studios was one of the first sexually explicit games to be offered after the introduction of the tools in September Dharker noted in discussions with Valve that they would be liable for any content related fines or penalties that countries may place on Valve a clause of their publishing contract for Steam and took steps to restrict sale of the game in over regions Games that feature mature themes with primary characters that visually appear to be underaged even if the game s narrative establishes them as adults have been banned by Valve br In March Valve faced pressure over Rape Day a planned game described as being a dark comedy and power fantasy where the player would control a serial rapist amid a zombie apocalypse Valve ultimately decided against offering the game on Steam arguing that while it respects developers desire to express themselves there were costs and risks associated with the game and the developers had chosen content matter and a way of representing it that makes it very difficult for us to help them find an audience br br br Platforms and devices br br br Windows br Steam was originally released exclusively for Microsoft Windows in but has since been ported to other platforms More recent Steam client versions use the Chromium Embedded Framework To take advantage of some of its features for newer interface elements Steam uses bit versions of Chromium which makes it unsupported on older operating systems such as Windows XP and Windows Vista Steam on Windows also relies on some security features built into later versions of Windows Support for XP and Vista was dropped in While users still on those operating systems can use the client they do not have access to newer features Around of Steam users were affected by this when it began In March Valve announced that Steam would drop support for Windows and on January br br br MacOS br Valve announced a client for Mac OS X in March The announcement was preceded by a change in the Steam beta client to support the cross platform WebKit web browser rendering engine instead of the Trident engine of Internet Explorer Valve teased the release by e mailing several images to Mac community and gaming websites the images featured characters from Valve games with Apple logos and parodies of vintage Macintosh advertisements Valve developed a full video homage to Apple s Macintosh commercial to announce the availability of Half Life on the service some concept images for the video had previously been used to tease the Mac Steam client br Steam for Mac OS X was originally planned for release in April before being pushed back to May In addition to the Steam client several features were made available to developers allowing them to take advantage of the cross platform Source engine and platform and network capabilities using Steamworks Through the Steam Play functionality the MacOS client allows players who have purchased compatible products in the Windows version to download the Mac versions at no cost The Steam Cloud along with many multiplayer PC games also supports cross platform play br br br Linux br In July Valve announced that it was developing a client for Linux based on the Ubuntu distribution This announcement followed months of speculation primarily from the website Phoronix that had discovered evidence of Linux developing in recent builds of Steam and other Valve games Newell stated that getting Steam and games to work on Linux is a key strategy for Valve Newell called the closed nature of Microsoft Windows a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space and that Linux would maintain the openness of the platform Valve is extending support to any developers that want to bring their games to Linux by making it as easy as possible for anybody who s engaged with us putting their games on Steam and getting those running on Linux according to Newell br The team developing the Linux client had been working for a year before the announcement to validate that such a port would be possible As of the official announcement a near feature complete Steam client for Linux had been developed and successfully run on Ubuntu Internal beta testing of the Linux client started in October external beta testing occurred in early November the same year Open beta clients for Linux were made available in late December and the client was officially released in mid February At the time of announcement Valve s Linux division assured that its first game on the OS Left Dead would run at an acceptable frame rate and with a degree of connectivity with the Windows and Mac OS X versions From there it began working on porting other games to Ubuntu and expanding to other Linux distributions Versions of Steam working under Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux were released by October There were over Linux compatible games on Steam in June and in February Steam for Linux had native games and was described as having the power to keep Linux gaming alive by Engadget br In August Valve released a beta version of Proton named Steam Play an open source Windows compatibility layer for Linux so that Linux users could run Windows games directly through Steam for Linux Proton comprises a set of open source tools including Wine and DXVK The software allows the use of Steam supported controllers even those not compatible with Windows Released in February Valve s handheld computer the Steam Deck runs SteamOS which is based on the Arch Linux distribution and uses Proton to support Windows based games without native Linux ports Valve worked with various middleware developers to make sure their tools were compatible with Proton on Linux and maximize the number of games that the Steam Deck would support This included working with various anti cheat developers such as Easy Anti Cheat and BattlEye to make sure their solutions worked with Proton To help with compatibility Valve developed a classification system that they will populate to rank any game as to how well it works as a Linux native solution or through Proton br Support for Nvidia s proprietary deep learning super sampling DLSS on supported video cards and games was added to Proton in June though this is not available on the Steam Deck which is based on AMD hardware br In March Google offered a prerelease version of Steam on Chromebooks and entered public beta in November br br br Steamworks on consoles br At E Newell announced that Steamworks would arrive on the PlayStation with Portal Steamworks made its debut on consoles with Portal s PlayStation release Several features including cross platform play and instant messaging Steam Cloud for saved games and the ability for PS owners to download Portal from Steam Windows and Mac were offered Valve s Counter Strike Global Offensive also supports Steamworks and cross platform features on the PlayStation including using keyboard and mouse controls as an alternative to the gamepad Valve said it hope s to expand upon this foundation with more Steam features and functionality in DLC and future content releases br The Xbox does not have support for Steamworks Newell said that they would have liked to bring the service to the console through the game Counter Strike Global Offensive but later said that cross platform play would not be present in the final version of the game Valve attributes the inability to use Steamworks on the Xbox to limitations in the Xbox Live regulations of the ability to deliver patches and new content Valve s Erik Johnson stated that Microsoft required new content on the console to be certified and validated before distribution which would limit the usefulness of Steamworks delivery approach br br br Mobile apps br Valve released an official Steam client for iOS and Android devices in late January following a short beta period The application allows players to log into their accounts to browse the storefront manage their games and communicate with friends in the Steam community The application also incorporates a two factor authentication system that works with Steam Guard Newell stated that the application was a strong request from Steam users and sees it as a means to make Steam richer and more accessible for everyone A mobile Steam client for Windows Phone devices was released in June In May a mobile chat only client for Steam was released under the name Steam Chat br On May a Steam Link app with remote play features was released in beta to allow users to stream games to Android phones named after discontinued set top box Steam Link It was also submitted to the iOS App Store but was denied by Apple Inc who cited business conflicts with app guidelines Apple later clarified its rule at the following Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in early June in that iOS apps may not offer an app like purchasing store but does not restrict apps that provide remote desktop support In response Valve removed the ability to purchase games or other content through the app and resubmitted it for approval in June where it was accepted by Apple and allowed on their store in May br br br Steam branded devices br Before industry analysts believed that Valve was developing hardware and tuning features of Steam with apparent use on its own hardware These computers were pre emptively dubbed as Steam Boxes by the gaming community and expected to be a dedicated machine focused on Steam functionality and maintaining the core functionality of a traditional video game console In September Valve unveiled SteamOS a custom Linux based operating system they had developed specifically aimed for running Steam and games and the final concept of the Steam Machine hardware Unlike other consoles the Steam Machine does not have set hardware its technology is implemented at the discretion of the manufacturer and is fully customizable much like a personal computer In the Steam Machines were removed from the storefront due to low sales and small user traffic br In November Valve released the set top box Steam Link and Steam Controller which was discontinued in The Steam Link removed the need for HDMI cables for displaying a PC s screen and allowed for wireless connection when connecting to a TV That was discontinued in but now Steam Link refers to the Remote Play mobile app that allows users to stream content such as games from a PC to a mobile device over a network br br Valve released the Steam Deck a handheld gaming computer running an updated version of SteamOS with initial shipments starting on February The Deck is designed for the play of Steam games but can be placed into a separate dock that allows the Deck to output to an external display The Deck was released on February Among updates to Steam and SteamOS included better Proton layer support for Windows based games improved user interface features in the Steam client for the Steam Deck display and adding Dynamic Cloud Saves to Steam to allow synchronizing saved games while a game is being played Valve began marking all games on the service through a Steam Deck Validated program to indicate how compatible they were with the Steam Deck software br br br Steam Cloud Play br Valve included beta support for Steam Cloud Play in May for developers to allow users to play games in their library which developers and publishers have opted to allow in a cloud gaming service At launch Steam Cloud Play only worked through Nvidia s GeForce Now service and would link up to other cloud services in the future though whether Valve would run its own cloud gaming service was unclear br br br Steam China br br China has strict regulations on video games and Internet use however access to Steam is allowed through China s governmental firewalls Currently a large portion of Steam users are from China By November more than half of the Steam userbase was fluent in Chinese an effect created by the large popularity of Dota and PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds in the country and several developers have reported that Chinese players make up close to of the total players for their games br Following a Chinese government ordered temporary block of many of Steam s functions in December Valve and Perfect World announced they would help to provide an officially sanctioned version of Steam that meets Chinese Internet requirements Perfect World has worked with Valve before to help bring Dota and Counter Strike Global Offensive to the country through approved government processes All games to be released on Steam China are expected to pass through the government approval process and meet other governmental requirements such as requiring a Chinese company to run any game with an online presence br The platform is known locally as Steam Platform Chinese pinyin Zh ngq p ngt i and runs independently from the rest of Steam It was made to comply with China s strict regulations on video games Valve does not plan to prevent Chinese users from accessing the global Steam platform and will try to assure that a player s cloud data remains usable between the two The client launched as an open beta on February with about games available at launch As of December only around games that have been reviewed and licensed by the government are available through Steam China br On December reports emerged that Steam s global service was the target of a domain name system attack that prevented users in China from accessing its site The Chinese government Ministry of Industry and Information Technology MIIT later confirmed that Chinese gamers would no longer be able to use Steam s global service as its international domain name has been designated as illegal The block has effectively locked all Chinese users out of games they had purchased through Steam s international service In reports emerged that the Steam Store could be used as normal in China while the Steam Community was still in blocked br br br Reception and impact br Steam s success has led to some criticism because it supported DRM and for being an effective monopoly In Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman called DRM using Steam on Linux unethical but still better than Windows br Steam s customer service has been highly criticized with users citing poor response times or lack of response In March Valve was given a failing F grade from the Better Business Bureau due to a large number of complaints about Valve s handling of Steam leading Valve s Erik Johnson to state that we don t feel like our customer service support is where it needs to be right now Johnson stated the company plans to better integrate customer support features into the Steam client and be more responsive In May in addition to hiring more staff for customer service Valve publicized pages that show the number and type of customer service requests it was handling over the last days with an average of entered each day Of those requests for refunds were the largest segment and which Valve could resolve within hours followed by account security and recovery requests Valve stated at this time that of all service requests were processed within hours of filing br br br Users br Valve reported that there were million active accounts on Steam by the end of By August the company reported that there were million new active accounts since January bringing the total number of active users to at least million Most accounts were from North America and Western Europe with there being a significant growth in accounts from Asia around spurred by their work to help localize the client and make additional currency options available to purchasers In September million accounts belonged to Australian users this grew to million by October br Valve also considers concurrent users how many accounts were logged in at the same time a key indicator of the success of the platform By August Valve reported that they saw a peak of million concurrent players up from million in with million concurrent players each day and million each month By January the peak online count had reached million with over million daily active users During the COVID pandemic in in which a large proportion of the world s population were at home Steam saw a concurrent player count of over million in March along with several games seeing similar record breaking concurrent counts The figure was broken again in January with over million users shortly after the release of the highly anticipated game Cyberpunk itself the first single player game on the service to have over a million concurrent players br br br Sales and distribution br br Steam has grown from seven games in to over by with additional non gaming products such as creation software DLC and videos numbering over More than games were on the service as of February The growth of games on Steam is attributed to changes in Valve s curation approach which allows publishers to add games without Valve s direct involvement and games supporting virtual reality technology The addition of Greenlight and Direct has accelerated the number of games present on the service with almost of the games on Steam by the end of having been released in Before Greenlight Valve saw about five new games published each week Greenlight expanded this to about per week and which doubled to per week following the introduction of Direct br Although Steam provides direct sales data to a game s developer and publisher it does not provide any public sales data In Valve s Jason Holtman stated that the company felt that such sales data was outdated for a digital market Data that Valve does provide cannot be released without permission because of a non disclosure agreement br Developers and publishers have expressed the need to have some metrics of sales for games on Steam as this allows them to judge the potential success of a title by reviewing how similar games have performed Algorithms that worked on publicly available data through user profiles to estimate sales data with some accuracy led to the creation of the website Steam Spy in Steam Spy was credited with being reasonably accurate but in April Valve added new privacy settings that defaulted to hiding user game profiles stating this was part of compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR in the European Union The change broke the method by which Steam Spy had collected data rendering it unusable A few months later another method had been developed using game achievements to estimate sales with similar accuracy but Valve shortly changed the Steam API that reduced the functionality of this service Some have asserted that Valve used the GDPR change as a means to block methods of estimating sales data though Valve has since promised to provide tools to developers to help gain such insights that they say will be more accurate In Simon Carless revised an approach originally proposed by Mike Boxleiter as early as with Carless s method used to estimate sales of a game based on the number of reviews it has on Steam based on a modified Boxlieter number used as a multiplication factor br br br Curation impact br The accessibility of publishing games on digital storefronts like Steam since its launch has been described as key to the popularity of indie games As these processes allow developers to publish games on Steam with minimal oversight from Valve journalists have criticized Valve for lacking curation policies that make it difficult to find quality games among poorly produced games aka shovelware br Following the launch of Steam Direct members of the video game industry were split on Valve s hands off approach Some praised Valve for favoring avoiding trying to be a moral adjudicator of content and letting consumers decide what content they want to see while others felt that this would encourage some developers to publish games on Steam that are purposely hateful and that Valve s reliance on user filters and algorithms may not succeed in blocking undesirable content Some further criticized the decision based on the financial gain from avoiding blocking any game content as Valve collects a cut from sales through Steam The National Center on Sexual Exploitation denounced the policy for avoiding corporate and social responsibility in light of the rise of sexual violence and exploitation games being hosted on Steam br br br Sector competition and retailers boycott br Steam was estimated to have the largest share in the PC digital distribution market in the s In sales via the Steam catalog are estimated to be between and percent of the total PC gaming market In and with an increase in retail copies of major game publishers integrating or requiring Steam retailers and journalists referred to the service as a monopoly which they claimed can be detrimental to the industry and that sector competition would yield positive results for consumers Several developers also noted that Steam s influence on the PC gaming market is powerful and one that smaller developers cannot afford to ignore or work with but believe that Valve s corporate practices for the service make it a type of benevolent dictator br Because of Valve s oversight of sales data estimates of how much of a market share Steam has in the video game market are difficult to compile Stardock developer of competing platform Impulse estimated that Steam had a share of the digital distribution market for video games in In February Forbes reported that Steam sales constituted of the US billion market for downloaded PC games and that Steam offered game producers gross margins of of the purchase price compared with at retail br Steam has been criticized for its reported cut on revenue with publishers from game sales a value that is similar to other digital storefronts according to IGN However some critics have asserted that the share no longer scales with cheaper costs of serving data a decade since Steam s launch A Game Developers Conference survey showed only of the respondents deeming the share justified Epic Games Tim Sweeney postulated that Valve could reduce its cut to given that content delivery network costs has dropped significantly Other services have promoted their sites having a lower cut including the Epic Games Store and Discord br In November online retailers Impulse Direct Drive and GamersGate refused to offer Call of Duty Modern Warfare because it includes mandatory installation of Steamworks Direct Drive accused Steamworks of being a trojan horse Valve s business development director Jason Holtman replied Steamworks features were chosen by developers and based on consumer wants and that Modern Warfare was one of Steam s greatest sellers In December MCV Develop reported that key traditional retailers would stop offering games that integrate Steam br br br Legal disputes br Steam s predominance in the gaming market has led to Valve becoming involved in various legal cases The lack of a formal refund policy led the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ACCC to sue Valve in September for violating Australian consumer laws that required stores to offer refunds for faulty or broken products The ACCC won the lawsuit in March though recognizing Valve changed its policy in the interim In December the court fined Valve A million as well as requiring Valve to include proper language for Australian consumers outlining their rights when purchasing games off Steam In January Valve filed for special leave to appeal the decision to the High Court of Australia but the High Court dismissed this request Later in September Valve s Steam refund policy was found to violate France s consumer laws and were fined along with requiring Valve to modify their refund policy appropriately br In December the French consumer group UFC Que Choisir initiated a lawsuit against Valve for several of their Steam policies that conflict or run afoul of French law including the restriction against reselling of purchased games which is legal in the European Union In September the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris found that Valve s practice of preventing resales violated the European Union s Information Society Directive of and the Computer Programs Directive of and required them to allow it in the future The Interactive Software Federation of Europe ISFE issued a statement that the French court ruling goes against established EU case law related to digital copies and threatened to upend much of the digital distribution systems in Europe should it be upheld br In August BT Group filed a lawsuit against Valve stating that Steam s client infringed on four of their patents which they stated were used within Steam s Library Chat Messaging and Broadcasting services br In the European Commission began investigating Valve and five other publishers Bandai Namco Entertainment Capcom Focus Home Interactive Koch Media and ZeniMax Media for anti competitive practices specifically the use of geo blocking to prevent access to software to citizens of certain countries within the European Economic Area Such practices would be against the Digital Single Market initiative set by the European Union The French gaming trade group Syndicat National du Jeu Vid o noted that geo blocking was a necessary feature to hinder inappropriate product key reselling The Commission found in January that Valve and co defendants had violated antitrust rules of the European Union issued combined fines of million and determined that these companies may be further liable to lawsuits from affected consumers Valve had chosen not to cooperate and was fined million the most of any of the defendants br A January class action lawsuit filed against Valve asserted that the company forced developers into entering a most favored nation type of pricing contract to offer games on their storefront which required the developers to price their games the same on other platforms as they did on Steam thus stifling competition Gamasutra s Simon Carless analyzed the lawsuit and observed that Valve s terms only apply the resale of Steam keys and not games themselves and thus the lawsuit may be without merit br A separate class action lawsuit filed against Valve by Wolfire Games in April asserted that Steam is essentially a monopoly since developers must sell to PC users through it and that its cut and most favored nation pricing practices violate antitrust laws as a result of their position Valve s response to the suit filed in July sought to dismiss the complaint stating that it has no duty under antitrust law to allow developers to use free Steam Keys to undersell prices for the games they sell on Steam or to provide Steam Keys at all referring to the most favored nation allegations Valve further defended its revenue as meeting the current Industry standard and claimed Wolfire s figure Steam s market share to lack evidence Wolfire s suit was dismissed by the presiding judge in November after determining that Wolfire had failed to show that Valve had a monopoly on game sales and that the cut has remained unchanged throughout Valve s history Wolfire refiled their case narrowing the antitrust complaint toward Valve s use of its dominant power to intimidate developers that sell their game for less on marketplaces other than Steam which the judge accepted and allowed to proceed in May according to discovery Valve was ordered to have Gabe Newell submit to a deposition for discussion of Valve s business strategy related to Steam br br br See also br List of video game digital distribution systems br br br Notes
