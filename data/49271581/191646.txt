An organic light emitting diode OLED also known as organic electroluminescent organic EL diode is a type of light emitting diode LED in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is an organic compound film that emits light in response to an electric current This organic layer is situated between two electrodes typically at least one of these electrodes is transparent OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens computer monitors and portable systems such as smartphones and handheld game consoles A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid state lighting applications br There are two main families of OLED those based on small molecules and those employing polymers Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light emitting electrochemical cell LEC which has a slightly different mode of operation An OLED display can be driven with a passive matrix PMOLED or active matrix AMOLED control scheme In the PMOLED scheme each row and line in the display is controlled sequentially one by one whereas AMOLED control uses a thin film transistor TFT backplane to directly access and switch each individual pixel on or off allowing for higher resolution and larger display sizes br OLEDs are fundamentally different from LEDs which are based on a p n diode structure In LEDs doping is used to create p and n regions by changing the conductivity of the host semiconductor OLEDs do not employ a p n structure Doping of OLEDs is used to increase radiative efficiency by direct modification of the quantum mechanical optical recombination rate Doping is additionally used to determine the wavelength of photon emission br An OLED display works without a backlight because it emits its own visible light Thus it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display LCD In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD regardless of whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or an LED backlight br OLED displays are made in a similar way to LCDs including manufacturing of several displays on a mother substrate that is later thinned and cut into several displays Substrates for OLED displays come in the same sizes as those used for manufacturing LCDs For OLED manufacture after the formation of TFTs for active matrix displays addressable grids for passive matrix displays or indium tin oxide ITO segments for segment displays the display is coated with hole injection transport and blocking layers as well with electroluminescent material after the first two layers after which ITO or metal may be applied again as a cathode Later the entire stack of materials is encapsulated The TFT layer addressable grid or ITO segments serve as or are connected to the anode which may be made of ITO or metal OLEDs can be made flexible and transparent with transparent displays being used in smartphones with optical fingerprint scanners and flexible displays being used in foldable smartphones br br br History br Andr Bernanose and co workers at the Nancy Universit in France made the first observations of electroluminescence in organic materials in the early s They applied high alternating voltages in air to materials such as acridine orange dye either deposited on or dissolved in cellulose or cellophane thin films The proposed mechanism was either direct excitation of the dye molecules or excitation of electrons br In Martin Pope and some of his co workers at New York University in the United States developed ohmic dark injecting electrode contacts to organic crystals They further described the necessary energetic requirements work functions for hole and electron injecting electrode contacts These contacts are the basis of charge injection in all modern OLED devices Pope s group also first observed direct current DC electroluminescence under vacuum on a single pure crystal of anthracene and on anthracene crystals doped with tetracene in using a small area silver electrode at volts The proposed mechanism was field accelerated electron excitation of molecular fluorescence br Pope s group reported in that in the absence of an external electric field the electroluminescence in anthracene crystals is caused by the recombination of a thermalized electron and hole and that the conducting level of anthracene is higher in energy than the exciton energy level Also in Wolfgang Helfrich and W G Schneider of the National Research Council in Canada produced double injection recombination electroluminescence for the first time in an anthracene single crystal using hole and electron injecting electrodes the forerunner of modern double injection devices In the same year Dow Chemical researchers patented a method of preparing electroluminescent cells using high voltage V AC driven Hz electrically insulated one millimetre thin layers of a melted phosphor consisting of ground anthracene powder tetracene and graphite powder Their proposed mechanism involved electronic excitation at the contacts between the graphite particles and the anthracene molecules br The first Polymer LED PLED to be created was by Roger Partridge at the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom It used a film of poly N vinylcarbazole up to micrometers thick located between two charge injecting electrodes The light generated was readily visible in normal lighting conditions though the polymer used had limitations low conductivity and the difficulty of injecting electrons Later development of conjugated polymers would allow others to largely eliminate these problems His contribution has often been overlooked due to the secrecy NPL imposed on the project When it was patented in it was given a deliberately obscure catch all name while the government s Department for Industry tried and failed to find industrial collaborators to fund further development As a result publication was delayed until br br br Practical OLEDs br Chemists Ching Wan Tang and Steven Van Slyke at Eastman Kodak built the first practical OLED device in This device used a two layer structure with separate hole transporting and electron transporting layers such that recombination and light emission occurred in the middle of the organic layer this resulted in a reduction in operating voltage and improvements in efficiency br Research into polymer electroluminescence culminated in with J H Burroughesat the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University UK reporting a high efficiency green light emitting polymer based device using nm thick films of poly p phenylene vinylene Moving from molecular to macromolecular materials solved the problems previously encountered with the long term stability of the organic films and enabled high quality films to be easily made Subsequent research developed multilayer polymers and the new field of plastic electronics and OLED research and device production grew rapidly White OLEDs pioneered by J Kido et al at Yamagata University Japan in achieved the commercialization of OLED backlit displays and lighting br In Kodak and Sanyo had entered into a partnership to jointly research develop and produce OLED displays They announced the world s first inch active matrix full color OLED display in September the same year In September they presented a prototype of inch HDTV format display based on white OLEDs with color filters at the CEATEC Japan br Manufacturing of small molecule OLEDs was started in by Pioneer Corporation followed by TDK in and Samsung NEC Mobile Display SNMD which later became one of the world s largest OLED display manufacturers Samsung Display in br The Sony XEL released in was the first OLED television Universal Display Corporation one of the OLED materials companies holds a number of patents concerning the commercialization of OLEDs that are used by major OLED manufacturers around the world br On December JOLED the successor of Sony and Panasonic s printable OLED business units began the world s first commercial shipment of inkjet printed OLED panels br br br Working principle br br A typical OLED is composed of a layer of organic materials situated between two electrodes the anode and cathode all deposited on a substrate The organic molecules are electrically conductive as a result of delocalization of pi electrons caused by conjugation over part or all of the molecule These materials have conductivity levels ranging from insulators to conductors and are therefore considered organic semiconductors The highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals HOMO and LUMO of organic semiconductors are analogous to the valence and conduction bands of inorganic semiconductors br Originally the most basic polymer OLEDs consisted of a single organic layer One example was the first light emitting device synthesised by J H Burroughes et al which involved a single layer of poly p phenylene vinylene However multilayer OLEDs can be fabricated with two or more layers in order to improve device efficiency As well as conductive properties different materials may be chosen to aid charge injection at electrodes by providing a more gradual electronic profile or block a charge from reaching the opposite electrode and being wasted Many modern OLEDs incorporate a simple bilayer structure consisting of a conductive layer and an emissive layer Developments in OLED architecture in improved quantum efficiency up to by using a graded heterojunction In the graded heterojunction architecture the composition of hole and electron transport materials varies continuously within the emissive layer with a dopant emitter The graded heterojunction architecture combines the benefits of both conventional architectures by improving charge injection while simultaneously balancing charge transport within the emissive region br During operation a voltage is applied across the OLED such that the anode is positive with respect to the cathode Anodes are picked based upon the quality of their optical transparency electrical conductivity and chemical stability A current of electrons flows through the device from cathode to anode as electrons are injected into the LUMO of the organic layer at the cathode and withdrawn from the HOMO at the anode This latter process may also be described as the injection of electron holes into the HOMO Electrostatic forces bring the electrons and the holes towards each other and they recombine forming an exciton a bound state of the electron and hole This happens closer to the electron transport layer part of the emissive layer because in organic semiconductors holes are generally more mobile than electrons The decay of this excited state results in a relaxation of the energy levels of the electron accompanied by emission of radiation whose frequency is in the visible region The frequency of this radiation depends on the band gap of the material in this case the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO br As electrons and holes are fermions with half integer spin an exciton may either be in a singlet state or a triplet state depending on how the spins of the electron and hole have been combined Statistically three triplet excitons will be formed for each singlet exciton Decay from triplet states phosphorescence is spin forbidden increasing the timescale of the transition and limiting the internal efficiency of fluorescent devices Phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes make use of spin orbit interactions to facilitate intersystem crossing between singlet and triplet states thus obtaining emission from both singlet and triplet states and improving the internal efficiency br Indium tin oxide ITO is commonly used as the anode material It is transparent to visible light and has a high work function which promotes injection of holes into the HOMO level of the organic layer A second conductive injection layer is typically added which may consist of PEDOT PSS as the HOMO level of this material generally lies between the work function of ITO and the HOMO of other commonly used polymers reducing the energy barriers for hole injection Metals such as barium and calcium are often used for the cathode as they have low work functions which promote injection of electrons into the LUMO of the organic layer Such metals are reactive so they require a capping layer of aluminium to avoid degradation Two secondary benefits of the aluminum capping layer include robustness to electrical contacts and the back reflection of emitted light out to the transparent ITO layer br Experimental research has proven that the properties of the anode specifically the anode hole transport layer HTL interface topography plays a major role in the efficiency performance and lifetime of organic light emitting diodes Imperfections in the surface of the anode decrease anode organic film interface adhesion increase electrical resistance and allow for more frequent formation of non emissive dark spots in the OLED material adversely affecting lifetime Mechanisms to decrease anode roughness for ITO glass substrates include the use of thin films and self assembled monolayers Also alternative substrates and anode materials are being considered to increase OLED performance and lifetime Possible examples include single crystal sapphire substrates treated with gold Au film anodes yielding lower work functions operating voltages electrical resistance values and increasing lifetime of OLEDs br Single carrier devices are typically used to study the kinetics and charge transport mechanisms of an organic material and can be useful when trying to study energy transfer processes As current through the device is composed of only one type of charge carrier either electrons or holes recombination does not occur and no light is emitted For example electron only devices can be obtained by replacing ITO with a lower work function metal which increases the energy barrier of hole injection Similarly hole only devices can be made by using a cathode made solely of aluminium resulting in an energy barrier too large for efficient electron injection br br br Carrier balance br Balanced charge injection and transfer are required to get high internal efficiency pure emission of luminance layer without contaminated emission from charge transporting layers and high stability A common way to balance charge is optimizing the thickness of the charge transporting layers but is hard to control Another way is using the exciplex Exciplex formed between hole transporting p type and electron transporting n type side chains to localize electron hole pairs Energy is then transferred to luminophore and provide high efficiency An example of using exciplex is grafting Oxadiazole and carbazole side units in red diketopyrrolopyrrole doped Copolymer main chain shows improved external quantum efficiency and color purity in no optimized OLED br br br Material technologies br br br Small molecules br br Organic small molecule electroluminescent materials have the advantages of a wide variety easy to purify and strong chemical modifications In order to make the luminescent materials to emit light as required some chromophores or unsaturated groups such as alkene bonds and benzene rings will usually be introduced in the molecular structure design to change the size of the conjugation range of the material so that the photophysical properties of the material changes In general the larger the range of electron conjugation system the longer the wavelength of light emitted by the material For instance with the increase of the number of benzene rings the fluorescence emission peak of benzene naphthalene anthracene and butyl gradually red shifted from nm to nm Common organic small molecule electroluminescent materials include aluminum complexes anthracenes biphenyl acetylene aryl derivatives coumarin derivatives and various fluorochromes Efficient OLEDs using small molecules were first developed by Ching W Tang et al at Eastman Kodak The term OLED traditionally refers specifically to this type of device though the term SM OLED is also in use br Molecules commonly used in OLEDs include organometallic chelates for example Alq used in the organic light emitting device reported by Tang et al fluorescent and phosphorescent dyes and conjugated dendrimers A number of materials are used for their charge transport properties for example triphenylamine and derivatives are commonly used as materials for hole transport layers Fluorescent dyes can be chosen to obtain light emission at different wavelengths and compounds such as perylene rubrene and quinacridone derivatives are often used Alq has been used as a green emitter electron transport material and as a host for yellow and red emitting dyes br Because of the structural flexibility of small molecule electroluminescent materials thin films can be prepared by vacuum vapor deposition which is more expensive and of limited use for large area devices The vacuum coating system however can make the entire process from film growth to OLED device preparation in a controlled and complete operating environment helping to obtain uniform and stable films thus ensuring the final fabrication of high performance OLED devices However small molecule organic dyes are prone to fluorescence quenching in the solid state resulting in lower luminescence efficiency The doped OLED devices are also prone to crystallization which reduces the luminescence and efficiency of the devices Therefore the development of devices based on small molecule electroluminescent materials is limited by high manufacturing costs poor stability short life and other shortcomings Coherent emission from a laser dye doped tandem SM OLED device excited in the pulsed regime has been demonstrated The emission is nearly diffraction limited with a spectral width similar to that of broadband dye lasers br Researchers report luminescence from a single polymer molecule representing the smallest possible organic light emitting diode OLED device Scientists will be able to optimize substances to produce more powerful light emissions Finally this work is a first step towards making molecule sized components that combine electronic and optical properties Similar components could form the basis of a molecular computer br br br Polymer light emitting diodes br br Polymer light emitting diodes PLED P OLED also light emitting polymers LEP involve an electroluminescent conductive polymer that emits light when connected to an external voltage They are used as a thin film for full spectrum colour displays Polymer OLEDs are quite efficient and require a relatively small amount of power for the amount of light produced br Vacuum deposition is not a suitable method for forming thin films of polymers If the polymeric OLED films are made by vacuum vapor deposition the chain elements will be cut off and the original photophysical properties will be compromised However polymers can be processed in solution and spin coating is a common method of depositing thin polymer films This method is more suited to forming large area films than thermal evaporation No vacuum is required and the emissive materials can also be applied on the substrate by a technique derived from commercial inkjet printing However as the application of subsequent layers tends to dissolve those already present formation of multilayer structures is difficult with these methods The metal cathode may still need to be deposited by thermal evaporation in vacuum An alternative method to vacuum deposition is to deposit a Langmuir Blodgett film br Typical polymers used in PLED displays include derivatives of poly p phenylene vinylene and polyfluorene Substitution of side chains onto the polymer backbone may determine the colour of emitted light or the stability and solubility of the polymer for performance and ease of processing br While unsubstituted poly p phenylene vinylene PPV is typically insoluble a number of PPVs and related poly naphthalene vinylene s PNVs that are soluble in organic solvents or water have been prepared via ring opening metathesis polymerization These water soluble polymers or conjugated poly electrolytes CPEs also can be used as hole injection layers alone or in combination with nanoparticles like graphene br br br Phosphorescent materials br br Phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes use the principle of electrophosphorescence to convert electrical energy in an OLED into light in a highly efficient manner with the internal quantum efficiencies of such devices approaching br Typically a polymer such as poly N vinylcarbazole is used as a host material to which an organometallic complex is added as a dopant Iridium complexes such as Ir mppy as of were a focus of research although complexes based on other heavy metals such as platinum have also been used br The heavy metal atom at the centre of these complexes exhibits strong spin orbit coupling facilitating intersystem crossing between singlet and triplet states By using these phosphorescent materials both singlet and triplet excitons will be able to decay radiatively hence improving the internal quantum efficiency of the device compared to a standard OLED where only the singlet states will contribute to emission of light br Applications of OLEDs in solid state lighting require the achievement of high brightness with good CIE coordinates for white emission The use of macromolecular species like polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes POSS in conjunction with the use of phosphorescent species such as Ir for printed OLEDs have exhibited brightnesses as high as cd m br br br Device architectures br br br Structure br br br Bottom emission br br The bottom emission organic light emitting diode BE OLED is the architecture that was used in the early stage AMOLED displays It had a transparent anode fabricated on a glass substrate and a shiny reflective cathode Light is emitted from the transparent anode direction To reflect all the light towards the anode direction a relatively thick metal cathode such as aluminum is used For the anode high transparency indium tin oxide ITO was a typical choice to emit as much light as possible Organic thin films including the emissive layer that actually generates the light are then sandwiched between the ITO anode and the reflective metal cathode The downside of bottom emission structure is that the light has to travel through the pixel drive circuits such as the thin film transistor TFT substrate and the area from which light can be extracted is limited and the light emission efficiency is reduced br br br Top emission br An alternative configuration is to switch the mode of emission A reflective anode and a transparent or more often semi transparent cathode are used so that the light emits from the cathode side and this configuration is called top emission OLED TE OLED Unlike BEOLEDs where the anode is made of transparent conductive ITO this time the cathode needs to be transparent and the ITO material is not an ideal choice for the cathode because of a damage issue due to the sputtering process Thus a thin metal film such as pure Ag and the Mg Ag alloy are used for the semi transparent cathode due to their high transmittance and high conductivity In contrast to the bottom emission light is extracted from the opposite side in top emission without the need of passing through multiple drive circuit layers Thus the light generated can be extracted more efficiently br br br Improvements br br br Micro cavity theory br br When light waves meet while traveling along the same medium wave interference occurs This interference can be constructive or destructive It is sometimes desirable for several waves of the same frequency to sum up into a wave with higher amplitudes br Since both electrodes are reflective in TEOLED light reflections can happen within the diode and they cause more complex interferences than those in BEOLEDs In addition to the two beam interference there exists a multi resonance interference between two electrodes Because the structure of TEOLEDs is similar to that of the Fabry Perot resonator or laser resonator which contains two parallel mirrors comparable to the two reflective electrodes this effect is especially strong in TEOLED This two beam interference and the Fabry Perot interferences are the main factors in determining the output spectral intensity of OLED This optical effect is called the micro cavity effect br In the case of OLED that means the cavity in a TEOLED could be especially designed to enhance the light output intensity and color purity with a narrow band of wavelengths without consuming more power In TEOLEDs the microcavity effect commonly occurs and when and how to restrain or make use of this effect is indispensable for device design To match the conditions of constructive interference different layer thicknesses are applied according to the resonance wavelength of that specific color The thickness conditions are carefully designed and engineered according to the peak resonance emitting wavelengths of the blue nm green nm and red nm color LEDs This technology greatly improves the light emission efficiency of OLEDs and are able to achieve a wider color gamut due to high color purity br br br Color filters br In white color filter method red green and blue emissions are obtained from the same white light LEDs using different color filters With this method the OLED materials produce white light which is then filtered to obtain the desired RGB colors This method eliminated the need to deposit three different organic emissive materials so only one kind of OLED material is used to produce white light It also eliminated the uneven degradation rate of blue pixels vs red and green pixels Disadvantages of this method are low color purity and contrast Also the filters absorb most of the emitted light requiring the background white light to be relatively strong to compensate for the drop in brightness and thus the power consumption for such displays can be higher br Color filters can also be implemented into bottom and top emission OLEDs By adding the corresponding RGB color filters after the semi transparent cathode even purer wavelengths of light can be obtained The use of a microcavity in top emission OLEDs with color filters also contributes to an increase in the contrast ratio by reducing the reflection of incident ambient light In a conventional panel a circular polarizer was installed on the panel surface While this was provided to prevent the reflection of ambient light it also reduced the light output By replacing this polarizing layer with color filters the light intensity is not affected and essentially all ambient reflected light can be cut allowing a better contrast on the display panel This potentially reduced the need for brighter pixels and can lower the power consumption br br br Other architectures br br br Transparent OLEDs br Transparent OLEDs use transparent or semi transparent contacts on both sides of the device to create displays that can be made to be both top and bottom emitting transparent TOLEDs can greatly improve contrast making it much easier to view displays in bright sunlight This technology can be used in Head up displays smart windows or augmented reality applications br br br Graded heterojunction br Graded heterojunction OLEDs gradually decrease the ratio of electron holes to electron transporting chemicals This results in almost double the quantum efficiency of existing OLEDs br br br Stacked OLEDs br Stacked OLEDs use a pixel architecture that stacks the red green and blue subpixels on top of one another instead of next to one another leading to substantial increase in gamut and color depth and greatly reducing pixel gap Other display technologies with RGB and RGBW pixels mapped next to each other tend to decrease potential resolution br br br Inverted OLED br In contrast to a conventional OLED in which the anode is placed on the substrate an inverted OLED uses a bottom cathode that can be connected to the drain end of an n channel TFT especially for the low cost amorphous silicon TFT backplane useful in the manufacturing of AMOLED displays br All OLED displays passive and active matrix use a driver IC often mounted using the chip on glass COG technology with an anisotropic conductive film br br br Color patterning technologies br br br Shadow mask patterning method br The most commonly used patterning method for organic light emitting displays is shadow masking during film deposition also called the RGB side by side method or RGB pixelation method Metal sheets with multiple apertures made of low thermal expansion material such as nickel alloy are placed between the heated evaporation source and substrate so that the organic or inorganic material from the evaporation source is masked off or blocked by the sheet from reaching the substrate in most locations so the materials are deposited only on the desired locations on the substrate and the rest is deposited and remains on the sheet Almost all small OLED displays for smartphones have been manufactured using this method br Fine metal masks FMMs made by photochemical machining reminiscent of old CRT shadow masks are used in this process The dot density of the mask will determine the pixel density of the finished display Fine Hybrid Masks FHMs are lighter than FFMs reducing bending caused by the mask s own weight and are made using an electroforming process br This method requires heating the electroluminescent materials at C using a thermal method in a high vacuum of Pa An oxygen meter ensures that no oxygen enters the chamber as it could damage through oxidation the electroluminescent material which is in powder form The mask is aligned with the mother substrate before every use and it is placed just below the substrate The substrate and mask assembly are placed at the top of the deposition chamber Afterwards the electrode layer is deposited by subjecting silver and aluminum powder to C using an electron beam Shadow masks allow for high pixel densities of up to DPI dot cm High pixel densities are br necessary for virtual reality headsets br br br White color filter method br Although the shadow mask patterning method is a mature technology used from the first OLED manufacturing it causes many issues like dark spot formation due to mask substrate contact or misalignment of the pattern due to the deformation of shadow mask Such defect formation can be regarded as trivial when the display size is small however it causes serious issues when a large display is manufactured which brings significant production yield loss To circumvent such issues white emission devices with sub pixel color filters white red green and blue have been used for large televisions In spite of the light absorption by the color filter state of the art OLED televisions can reproduce color very well such as NTSC and consume little power at the same time This is done by using an emission spectrum with high human eye sensitivity special color filters with a low spectrum overlap and performance tuning with color statistics into consideration br This approach is also called the Color by white method br br br Other color patterning approaches br There are other types of emerging patterning technologies to increase the manufacturability of OLEDs br Patternable organic light emitting devices use a light or heat activated electroactive layer A latent material PEDOT TMA is included in this layer that upon activation becomes highly efficient as a hole injection layer Using this process light emitting devices with arbitrary patterns can be prepared br Colour patterning can be accomplished by means of a laser such as a radiation induced sublimation transfer RIST br Organic vapour jet printing OVJP uses an inert carrier gas such as argon or nitrogen to transport evaporated organic molecules as in organic vapour phase deposition The gas is expelled through a micrometre sized nozzle or nozzle array close to the substrate as it is being translated This allows printing arbitrary multilayer patterns without the use of solvents br Like ink jet material deposition inkjet etching IJE deposits precise amounts of solvent onto a substrate designed to selectively dissolve the substrate material and induce a structure or pattern Inkjet etching of polymer layers in OLED s can be used to increase the overall out coupling efficiency In OLEDs light produced from the emissive layers of the OLED is partially transmitted out of the device and partially trapped inside the device by total internal reflection TIR This trapped light is wave guided along the interior of the device until it reaches an edge where it is dissipated by either absorption or emission Inkjet etching can be used to selectively alter the polymeric layers of OLED structures to decrease overall TIR and increase out coupling efficiency of the OLED Compared to a non etched polymer layer the structured polymer layer in the OLED structure from the IJE process helps to decrease the TIR of the OLED device IJE solvents are commonly organic instead of water based due to their non acidic nature and ability to effectively dissolve materials at temperatures under the boiling point of water br Transfer printing is an emerging technology to assemble large numbers of parallel OLED and AMOLED devices efficiently It takes advantage of standard metal deposition photolithography and etching to create alignment marks commonly on glass or other device substrates Thin polymer adhesive layers are applied to enhance resistance to particles and surface defects Microscale ICs are transfer printed onto the adhesive surface and then baked to fully cure adhesive layers An additional photosensitive polymer layer is applied to the substrate to account for the topography caused by the printed ICs reintroducing a flat surface Photolithography and etching removes some polymer layers to uncover conductive pads on the ICs Afterwards the anode layer is applied to the device backplane to form the bottom electrode OLED layers are applied to the anode layer with conventional vapor deposition and covered with a conductive metal electrode layer As of transfer printing was capable to print onto target substrates up to mm mm This size limit needs to expand for transfer printing to become a common process for the fabrication of large OLED AMOLED displays br Experimental OLED displays using conventional photolithography techniques instead of FMMs have been demonstrated allowing for large substrate sizes as it eliminates the need for a mask that needs to be as large as the substrate and good yield control Visionox has announced the use of photolithography for depositing OLED emissive materials br br br Thin film transistor backplanes br For a high resolution display like a TV a thin film transistor TFT backplane is necessary to drive the pixels correctly As of low temperature polycrystalline silicon LTPS TFT is widely used for commercial AMOLED displays LTPS TFT has variation of the performance in a display so various compensation circuits have been reported Due to the size limitation of the excimer laser used for LTPS the AMOLED size was limited To cope with the hurdle related to the panel size amorphous silicon microcrystalline silicon backplanes have been reported with large display prototype demonstrations An indium gallium zinc oxide IGZO backplane can also be used Large OLED displays usually use AOS amporphous oxide semiconductor TFT transistors instead also called oxide TFTs and these are usually based on IGZO br Many AMOLED displays use LTPO TFT transistors These transistors offer stability at low refresh rates and variable refresh rates which allows for power saving displays that do not show visual artifacts br br br Advantages br br The different manufacturing process of OLEDs has several advantages over flat panel displays made with LCD technology br br Lower cost in the future br OLEDs can be printed onto any suitable substrate by an inkjet printer or even by screen printing theoretically making them cheaper to produce than LCD or plasma displays However fabrication of the OLED substrate as of is costlier than that for TFT LCDs Roll to roll vapor deposition methods for organic devices do allow mass production of thousands of devices per minute for minimal cost however this technique also induces problems devices with multiple layers can be challenging to make because of registration lining up the different printed layers to the required degree of accuracy br Lightweight and flexible plastic substrates br OLED displays can be fabricated on flexible plastic substrates leading to the possible fabrication of flexible organic light emitting diodes for other new applications such as roll up displays embedded in fabrics or clothing If a substrate like polyethylene terephthalate PET can be used the displays may be produced inexpensively Furthermore plastic substrates are shatter resistant unlike the glass displays used in LCD devices br Better picture quality br OLEDs enable a greater contrast ratio and wider viewing angle compared to LCDs because OLED pixels emit light directly This also provides a deeper black level since a black OLED display emits no light Furthermore OLED pixel colors appear correct and unshifted even as the viewing angle approaches from the normal br Better power efficiency br LCDs filter the light emitted from a backlight allowing a small fraction of light through Thus they cannot show true black However an inactive OLED element does not produce light or consume power allowing true blacks Removing the backlight also makes OLEDs lighter because some substrates are not needed br Response time br OLEDs also have a much faster response time than an LCD Using response time compensation technologies the fastest modern LCDs can reach response times as low as ms for their fastest color transition and are capable of refresh frequencies as high as Hz According to LG OLED response times are up to times faster than LCD putting conservative estimates at under s ms which could theoretically accommodate refresh frequencies approaching kHz Hz Due to their extremely fast response time OLED displays can also be easily designed to be strobed creating an effect similar to CRT flicker in order to avoid the sample and hold behavior seen on both LCDs and some OLED displays which creates the perception of motion blur br br br Disadvantages br br br Lifespan br The biggest technical problem for OLEDs is the limited lifetime of the organic materials One technical report on an OLED TV panel found that after hours the blue luminance degraded by the red by and the green by In particular blue OLEDs at that time had a lifetime of around hours to half original brightness five years at eight hours per day when used for flat panel displays This is lower than the typical lifetime of LCD LED or PDP technology each rated for about hours to half brightness depending on manufacturer and model One major challenge for OLED displays is the formation of dark spots due to the ingress of oxygen and moisture which degrades the organic material over time whether or not the display is powered In LG Electronics reported an expected lifetime of hours up from hours in A US Department of Energy paper shows that the expected lifespans of OLED lighting products goes down with increasing brightness with an expected lifespan of hours at brightness or hours at brightness br br br Cause of degradation br br Degradation occurs because of the accumulation of nonradiative recombination centers and luminescence quenchers in the emissive zone It is said that the chemical breakdown in the semiconductors occurs in four steps br br recombination of charge carriers through the absorption of UV light br homolytic dissociation br subsequent radical addition reactions that form radicals br disproportionation between two radicals resulting in hydrogen atom transfer reactions br However some manufacturers displays aim to increase the lifespan of OLED displays pushing their expected life past that of LCD displays by improving light outcoupling thus achieving the same brightness at a lower drive current In experimental OLEDs were created which can sustain cd m of luminance for over hours for green OLEDs and hours for blue OLEDs In OLED lifetime to half of the initial brightness was improved to hours for red hours for yellow and hours for green at an initial luminance of cd m Proper encapsulation is critical for prolonging an OLED display s lifetime as the OLED light emitting electroluminescent materials are sensitive to oxygen and moisture When exposed to moisture or oxygen the electroluminescent materials in OLEDs degrade as they oxidize generating black spots and reducing or shrinking the area that emits light reducing light output This reduction can occur in a pixel by pixel basis This can also lead to delamination of the electrode layer eventually leading to complete panel failure br Degradation occurs three orders of magnitude faster when exposed to moisture than when exposed to oxygen Encapsulation can be performed by applying an epoxy adhesive with dessicant by laminating a glass sheet with epoxy glue and dessicant followed by vacuum degassing or by using Thin Film Encapsulation TFE which is a multi layer coating of alternating organic and inorganic layers The organic layers are applied using inkjet printing and the inorganic layers are applied using Atomic Layer Deposition ALD The encapsulation process is carried out under a nitrogen environment using UV curable LOCA glue and the electroluminescent and electrode material deposition processes are carried out under a high vacuum The encapsulation and material deposition processes are carried out by a single machine after the Thin film transistors have been applied The transistors are applied in a process that is the same for LCDs The electroluminescent materials can also be applied using inkjet printing br br br Color balance br The OLED material used to produce blue light degrades much more rapidly than the materials used to produce other colors in other words blue light output will decrease relative to the other colors of light This variation in the differential color output will change the color balance of the display and is much more noticeable than a uniform decrease in overall luminance This can be avoided partially by adjusting the color balance but this may require advanced control circuits and input from a knowledgeable user More commonly though manufacturers optimize the size of the R G and B subpixels to reduce the current density through the subpixel in order to equalize lifetime at full luminance For example a blue subpixel may be larger than the green subpixel The red subpixel may be larger than the green br br br Efficiency of blue OLEDs br br Improvements to the efficiency and lifetime of blue OLEDs is vital to the success of OLEDs as replacements for LCD technology Considerable research has been invested in developing blue OLEDs with high external quantum efficiency as well as a deeper blue color br Since research focuses on organic materials exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence TADF discovered at Kyushu University OPERA and UC Santa Barbara CPOS TADF would allow stable and high efficiency solution processable meaning that the organic materials are layered in solutions producing thinner layers blue emitters with internal quantum efficiencies reaching Early in TADF materials based on oxygen based fully bridged boron type electron accepttors had achieved huge breakthrough in their proprities The external quantum efficiency of TADF OLED for blue and green light had achieved with thin full width half maximum and high color purity In Han et al synthesized a new D A type luminescent material TDBA Cz and used the m AC DBNA synthesized by Meng et al as a control to investigate the effect of the substitution site of the carbazole unit as an electron donor on the oxygen bridged triphenylboron electron acceptor unit on the photophysical properties of the overall molecule It was found that the introduction of two carbazole units into the same benzene ring of the oxygen bridged triphenylboron electron acceptor unit could effectively suppress the conformational relaxation of the molecule during the radiative transition resulting in narrow bandwidth blue light emission In addition TDBA Cz is the first reported blue material to achieve both a FWHM down to nm and a maximum EQE of in a non doped TADF OLED br Blue TADF emitters are expected to market by and would be used for WOLED displays with phosphorescent color filters as well as blue OLED displays with ink printed QD color filters br br br Water damage br Water can instantly damage the organic materials of the displays Therefore improved sealing processes are important for practical manufacturing Water damage especially may limit the longevity of more flexible displays br br br Outdoor performance br As an emissive display technology OLEDs rely completely upon converting electricity to light unlike most LCDs which are to some extent reflective E paper leads the way in efficiency with ambient light reflectivity enabling the display to be used without any internal light source The metallic cathode in an OLED acts as a mirror with reflectance approaching leading to poor readability in bright ambient light such as outdoors However with the proper application of a circular polarizer and antireflective coatings the diffuse reflectance can be reduced to less than With fc incident illumination typical test condition for simulating outdoor illumination that yields an approximate photopic contrast of Advances in OLED technologies however enable OLEDs to become actually better than LCDs in bright sunlight The AMOLED display in the Galaxy S for example was found to outperform all LCD displays on the market in terms of power usage brightness and reflectance br br br Power consumption br While an OLED will consume around of the power of an LCD displaying an image that is primarily black for the majority of images it will consume of the power of an LCD However an OLED can use more than power to display an image with a white background such as a document or web site This can lead to reduced battery life in mobile devices when white backgrounds are used br br br Screen flicker br Many OLEDs use pulse width modulation to display colour brightness gradations For example a pixel instructed to display gray will flicker on and off rapidly creating a subtle strobe effect The alternative way to decrease brightness would be to decrease power to the display which would eliminate screen flicker to the detriment of colour balance which deteriorates as brightness decreases However use of PWM gradations may be more harmful for eye health br br br Manufacturers and commercial uses br br Almost all OLED manufacturers rely on material deposition equipment that is only made by a handful of companies the most notable one being Canon Tokki a unit of Canon Inc Canon Tokki is reported to have a near monopoly of the giant OLED manufacturing vacuum machines notable for their metre ft size Apple has relied solely on Canon Tokki in its bid to introduce its own OLED displays for the iPhones released in The electroluminescent materials needed for OLEDs are also made by a handful of companies some of them being Merck Universal Display Corporation and LG Chem The machines that apply these materials can operate continuously for days and can process a mother substrate in minutes br OLED technology is used in commercial applications such as displays for mobile phones and portable digital media players car radios and digital cameras among others as well as lighting Such portable display applications favor the high light output of OLEDs for readability in sunlight and their low power drain Portable displays are also used intermittently so the lower lifespan of organic displays is less of an issue Prototypes have been made of flexible and rollable displays which use OLEDs unique characteristics Applications in flexible signs and lighting are also being developed OLED lighting offers several advantages over LED lighting such as higher quality illumination more diffuse light source and panel shapes Philips Lighting has made OLED lighting samples under the brand name Lumiblade available online and Novaled AG based in Dresden Germany introduced a line of OLED desk lamps called Victory in September br Nokia introduced OLED mobile phones including the N and the N MP both of which feature an AMOLED display OLEDs have also been used in most Motorola and Samsung color
