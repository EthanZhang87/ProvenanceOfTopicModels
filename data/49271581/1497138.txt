id: 1497138
The Palace is a computer program to access graphical chat room servers called palaces in which users may interact with one another using graphical avatars overlaid on a graphical backdrop The software concept was originally created by Jim Bumgardner and produced by Time Warner in and was first opened to the public in November br While there is no longer any official support for the original program a new client has been developed and is actively maintained by Jameson Heesen Many chat servers are still operating and can be found on the Palace Portal Live Directory Palace clients and servers are available for Mac OS Mac OS X Linux and Microsoft Windows br br br Concept and design br br br Palaces br Each room in a palace is represented by a large image that serves as a backdrop for users By clicking on certain areas in a room called doors users can travel either to different rooms in the same palace another palace server or an address leading to a different service such as websites and email In some rooms users are allowed to paint on the backdrop using a simple suite of drawing tools User messages appear as chat bubbles above their avatar similar to those in comic books and stored in a chat log br br br Avatars br br The Palace has an avatar system that allows users to combine small partially transparent images Once a member has created an avatar the member can pick up various pieces of clothing or other accessories By default users are represented by spherical smiley face emoticons but can also wear up to nine separate bitmap images known as props br In Q several users began using doll inspired images as avatars with a customizable appearance The avatars were known as Little People before later collectively named Dollz A fanzine credited the creation of Dollz to Rainman who based his Sk er doll on his comic strip Other sources claimed that Melicia Greenwood created the first Dollz basing her avatar on Barbie while catering to counter culture audiences of preps goths and skaters Other popular Dollz used on The Palace were Wonderkins Silents and Divas based on Diva Starz br Dollz became popular with the users on The Palace particularly teenagers with several rooms dedicated to unofficial Dollz editing contests Teenagers also used Dollz as avatars as a sign of rebellion against The Palace s older users The popularity of Dollz has inspired several personal websites dedicated to creating and customizing Dollz outside of The Palace community The majority of Dollz creators were female br br br History br The Palace was originally created by Jim Bumgardner and produced by Time Warner Interactive in with its official website launching to the public in November Bumgardner incorporated many features of Idaho an in house authoring tool he had previously developed for making multimedia CD ROMs One of the features of Idaho was IPTSCRAE a Forth like programming language The name is a play on the word script in Pig Latin One of the unique features of the Palace for its time was that the server software was given away for free and ran on consumer PCs rather than being housed in a central location Two of the original beta testers Ben LaCascia Now Bethany O Brien and Justice LeClaire are still active as of br From around artists began to use the Palace as a site for experimental live performance Notably the group Desktop Theatre staged interventions and performances in their own and public Palaces from until In they presented waitingforgodot com at the Third Annual Digital Storytelling Festival which took an interesting turn when another Palatian changed their name to Godot and arrived in the performance Other artists working in The Palace include Avatar Body Collision br The Palace s popularity peaked around when nu metal band Korn had their own palace chat room that fans could download from their official website Palace s popularity at this time could also be attributed to a palace which focused on the cartoon South Park as well as the Sci Fi channel s Mothership palace There was even a link to the South Park palace on the Comedy Central website at the time br The Palace was the subject of a number of sales between companies until when Open Text Corporation purchased the rights to the Palace software and technology as part of a bankruptcy settlement The software is currently unsupported by Open Text or any of its previous owners and many members of the community now provide unofficial support for existing versions The original thepalace com domain was bought by a long time Palace user and is now used as a directory for other sites br Official Palace software development ceased when Communities com declared bankruptcy but a few developers have created viable Palace protocol compatible clients since then The earliest contributions came from David Lee Lead Developer of Phalanx David worked for many years reverse engineering the majority of the protocol for proper communications between the client and server Without David s mentoring of Jameson Heesen Palace Chat would likely not exist as David shared much of his findings with Jameson including the XOR xtlk encryption used to encrypt chats and generation of client registration codes prop encoding and decoding and so much more Much later circa and after numerous source code leaks Open Palace was developed by Brian McKelvey Jameson utilized Brian s open source Open Palace to implement scripting support into Palace Chat Brian also spearheaded the development of Type avatars which Palace Chat adopted and continues to utilize br All of these new clients support improved high color avatars larger room backgrounds also in high color and modern sound formats such as MP and are designed for modern operating systems However only Palace Chat is presently maintained and is the present day client of choice br One of the first comprehensive psychological studies of avatar communities conducted by John Suler took place at the Palace This collection of essays entitled Life at the Palace consists of an analysis of Palace history social relationships addiction and deviance Suler s work focused on the unique aspects of interacting via avatars and in a graphical space br br br Privacy br Signing into The Palace does not require any registration or personal information To begin chatting users download the client set
