Midjourney is a generative artificial intelligence program and service created and hosted by the San Francisco based independent research lab Midjourney Inc Midjourney generates images from natural language descriptions called prompts similar to OpenAI s DALL E and Stability AI s Stable Diffusion It is one of the technologies of the AI boom br The tool is currently in open beta which it entered on July The Midjourney team is led by David Holz who co founded Leap Motion Holz told The Register in August that the company was already profitable Users create artwork with Midjourney using Discord bot commands br br br History br Midjourney Inc was founded in San Francisco California by David Holz previously a co founder of Leap Motion The Midjourney image generation platform entered open beta on July On March the Midjourney Discord server launched with a request to post high quality photographs to Twitter and Reddit for systems training br br br Model versions br The company has been working on improving its algorithms releasing new model versions every few months Version of their algorithm was launched in April and version on July On November the alpha iteration of version was released to users On March the alpha iteration of version was released The model is more opinionated than version applying more of its own stylization to images while the RAW model adds improvements while working better with more literal prompts The version included a new aesthetics system and the ability to zoom out by generating surroundings to an existing image On December the alpha iteration of version was released The model was trained from scratch over a nine month period Support was added for better text rendition and a more literal interpretation of prompts br br br Functionality br Midjourney is accessible through a Discord bot either through their official Discord server by directly messaging the bot or by inviting the bot to a third party server To generate images users use the imagine command and type in a prompt the bot then returns a set of four images which users are given the option to upscale br br br Uses br Midjourney s founder David Holz told The Register that artists use Midjourney for rapid prototyping of artistic concepts to show to clients before starting work themselves br The advertising industry has been quick to embrace AI tools such as Midjourney DALL E and Stable Diffusion among others The tools that enable advertisers to create original content and brainstorm ideas quickly are providing new opportunities such as custom ads created for individuals a new way to create special effects or even making e commerce advertising more efficient according to Ad Age br Architects have described using the software to generate mood boards for the early stages of projects as an alternative to searching Google Images br br br Notable usage and controversy br br The program was used by the British magazine The Economist to create the front cover for an issue in June In Italy the leading newspaper Corriere della Sera published a comic created with Midjourney by writer Vanni Santoni in August Charlie Warzel used Midjourney to generate two images of Alex Jones for Warzel s newsletter in The Atlantic The use of an AI generated cover was criticised by people who felt it was taking jobs from artists Warzel called his action a mistake in an article about his decision to use generated images Last Week Tonight with John Oliver included a minute segment on Midjourney in an episode broadcast in August br A Midjourney image called Th tre D op ra Spatial won first place in the digital art competition at the Colorado State Fair Jason Allen who wrote the prompt that led Midjourney to generate the image printed the image onto a canvas and entered it into the competition using the name Jason M Allen via Midjourney Other digital artists were upset by the news Allen was unapologetic insisting that he followed the competition s rules The two category judges were unaware that Midjourney used AI to generate images although they later said that had they known this they would have awarded Allen the top prize anyway br In December Midjourney was used to generate the images for an AI generated children s book that was created over a weekend Titled Alice and Sparkle the book features a young girl who builds a robot that becomes self aware The creator Ammaar Reeshi used Midjourney to generate a large number of images from which he chose for the book Both the product and process drew criticism One artist wrote that the main problem is that it was trained off of artists work It s our creations our distinct styles that we created that we did not consent to being used br br In the realism of AI based text to image generators such as Midjourney DALL E or Stable Diffusion reached such a high level that it led to a significant wave of viral AI generated photos Widespread attention was gained by a Midjourney generated photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat the fictional arrest of Donald Trump and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon as well as the usage in professional creative arts br Research has suggested that the images Midjourney generates can be biased For example even neutral prompts in one study returned unequal results on the aspects of gender skin color and location A study by researchers at the nonprofit group Center for Countering Digital Hate found the tool to be easy to generate racist and conspiratorial images br br In a Frontiers journal published a paper which contained gibberish figures generated with Midjourney one of which was a diagram of a rat with large testicles and a large penis towering over himself The paper was retracted a day after the images went viral on Twitter br br br Content moderation and censorship in Midjourney br Prior to May Midjourney implemented a moderation mechanism predicated on a banned word system This method prohibited the use of language associated with explicit content such as sexual or pornographic themes as well as extreme violence Moreover the system also banned certain individual words including those of religious and political figures such as Allah or Xi Jinping This practice occasionally stirred controversy due to perceived instances of censorship within the Midjourney platform br Commencing in May with subsequent updates post version Midjourney transitioned to an AI powered content moderation system This advanced mechanism allowed for a more nuanced interpretation of user prompts by analyzing them in their entirety It consequently facilitated the context dependent use of words that had previously been prohibited For instance users can now prompt the AI to generate a portrait of Xi Jinping At the same time the system will prevent the generation of contentious images such as depictions of global leaders including Xi Jinping in situations of arrest br br br Litigation br On January three artists Sarah Andersen Kelly McKernan and Karla Ortiz filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Stability AI Midjourney and DeviantArt claiming that these companies have infringed on the rights of millions of artists by training AI tools on five billion images scraped from the web without the consent of the original artists br The legal action was initiated in San Francisco by attorney Matthew Butterick in partnership with the Joseph Saveri Law Firm the same team challenging Microsoft GitHub and OpenAI developers of ChatGPT and DALL E in court In July U S District Judge William Orrick inclined to dismiss most of the lawsuit filed by Andersen McKernan and Ortiz but allowed them to file a new complaint Another lawsuit was filed in November against Midjourney Stability AI DeviantArt and Runway AI for using the copyrighted work of over artists br br br See also br Artificial intelligence art br Computer art br Generative art br br br br br br External links br br
