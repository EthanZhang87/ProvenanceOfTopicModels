id: 1651190
Sexual grooming is the action or behavior used to establish an emotional connection with a minor and sometimes the child s family to lower the child s inhibitions with the objective of sexual abuse It can occur in various settings including online in person and through other means of communication Children who are groomed may experience mental health issues including anxiety depression post traumatic stress and suicidal thoughts br br br History and recognition br br br Origins br Before the term grooming was associated with grooming a child for sexual abuse it had come to have a meaning of mentorship coaching or preparing someone for leadership br From to law enforcement in the United States became increasingly aware of child sexual abuse that happened to children from outside their family committed by those who were not strangers Previously the focus of law enforcement had been on stranger danger and those who used threats of violence to ensure compliance from their victims In these newly recognized sexual abuse cases children were manipulated with a combination of attention affection kindness gifts alcohol drugs money and privileges While there are examples before this time where the pattern was recognized it was during this decade that the FBI became aware of the pattern and criminal investigations began to be taken seriously in the United States There was also growing awareness that offenders joined youth serving organizations to gain access to potential victims br As an example a study used the terminology pressured sexual contacts and forced sex contacts to distinguish two types of offenders Sex pressure offenses had a lack of physical force and behavior that was counter aggressive using persuasion of reward attention affection money gifts or entrapment Sex force offenses used the threat of harm or physical force such as intimidation verbal threat restraint manipulation and physical strength br Ken Lanning is credited with being one of the first professionals using the term grooming He recalls it being used in conversations between law enforcement professionals and pinpoints the first known written description of the process of child grooming to a book written by Nicholas Groth and the first printed use of the word grooming to a article by Jon Conte At the beginning of its use both grooming and seduction were being used to describe this type of non violent offender and Lanning recalls using both terms interchangeably br A January FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin used seduction and being seduced to describe the activity of non violent offenders By the Chicago Tribune had used the term reporting These friendly molesters become acquainted with their targeted victim gaining their trust while secretly grooming the child as a sexual partner br In the s the public in the United States became increasingly aware of child sexual abuse through the nursery school cases and abuse in religious settings br br br Changing meaning br During the s the term grooming began to replace seduction as the most commonly used term However there was not one official legal mental health or even lay definition of grooming Growing awareness of chat rooms being used by pedophiles to target victims came to public notice and the use of grooming to mean To win the confidence of a victim in order to a commit sexual assault on him or her became mainstream In academia the description of grooming strategies in online cases became distinct from the descriptions of pre Internet grooming strategies br In a BBC report stated that grooming had taken on a pejorative meaning no longer associated with animal care or mentoring it had become associated with pedophiles and pedophilia This caused outrage when the term groomed was used to describe the behavior of someone who had obtained leaked documents from a civil servant The news report mentioned other uses of the term groom that also had negative connotation such as groomed for terrorism or groomed to become suicide bombers br A report by the Christian Monitor reported that the word grooming was now seen as sinister Instead of meaning to prepare as a political candidate to prepare or coach for a career the term had shifted in public discourse to mean to befriend or influence a child now esp via the internet in preparation for future sexual abuse br br br Patterns br br br Non violent offenders br To establish a good relationship with a child and the child s family child groomers might do several things They might try to gain the child s or parents trust by befriending them with the goal of easy access to the child A trusting relationship with the family means the child s parents are less likely to believe potential accusations Child groomers might look for opportunities to have time alone with the child which can be done by offering to babysit the groomers may also invite the child for sleepovers for opportunistic bed sharing They might give gifts or money to the child in exchange for sexual contact or for no apparent reason Commonly they show pornography to the child or talk about sexual topics with the child hoping to make it easy for the child to accept such acts thus normalizing the behavior They may also engage in hugging kissing or other physical contact even when the child does not want it br When grooming techniques are successful the resulting compliance of the child can be mis interpreted as consent and the child treated as if they were not a victim of crime When the behavior is considered criminal it can still be perceived as a lesser offense br Some offenders prefer sexual gratification from less obvious types of behaviors and grooming behaviors in and of themselves are the goal as they provide a chance to engage in a paraphilia br Signs that characterize child groomers include a person who takes an unusual interest in a child particularly if the interest is primarily focused on their physical appearance behavior or activities a person who tries to communicate with a child online or in person in secret outside the knowledge of the child s parents or guardians a person who attempts to isolate a child from their friends or family or who discourages the child from spending time with others or a person who asks a child to keep secrets or who makes the child feel like they are special or important in a way that is inappropriate br br br Online offenders br Sexual grooming of children also occurs on the Internet Some abusers sometimes posing as children themselves chat with children online and make arrangements to meet with them in person Online grooming of minors is most prevalent in relation to the age group of cases and particularly The majority of targeted children are girls and most victimization occurs with mobile phone support Children and teenagers who are highly curious and high sensation seeking are at higher risk than others br Facebook has been involved in controversy as to whether it takes enough precautions against the sexual grooming of children Jim Gamble leader of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre CEOP in the UK said in that his office had received complaints about Facebook users in but that none of the complaints had come directly from Facebook A spokesman for Facebook responded to complaints by meeting CEOP directly in person and said that they take safety issues very seriously In MSN implemented chat room restrictions to help protect children from adults seeking sexual conversations with them In Yahoo chat rooms were investigated by the New York State attorney general s office for allowing users to create rooms whose names suggested they were being used for this purpose that October Yahoo agreed to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure that such rooms would not be allowed Computer programs have been developed to analyse chat rooms and other instant messaging logs for suspicious activity As this can be prevented not only on platform level but also on the point of entry it is recommended that parents establish safe environments for their children to use the Internet with reduced risk of encountering cyber grooming individuals br Pedophiles and predators use online grooming to carry out cybersex trafficking crimes After the pedophile gains the trust from a local cybersex trafficker often a parent or neighbor of the victim the online sexual exploitation will take place br Suspected offenders have used the so called fantasy defense the argument that they were only expressing fantasies and not plans of future behavior to defend actions such as online communication In the U S case law draws a distinction between those two and some people accused of grooming have successfully used this defense br In the US an online privacy law Children s Online Privacy Protection Act has been misattributed as a measure to prevent online child grooming and protect children from child predators br br br Impact on victims br Children who are groomed may feel they are to blame for their abuse and have difficulty placing blame on the perpetrator br br br Criminal offences br br br General br br In its report Protection of Children Against Abuse Through New Technologies the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention Committee addressed the emerging issues of violence against children through the use of new technologies the issue of child pornography on the Internet is already covered by Article Convention with particular reference to grooming both through the internet and by mobile telephones br Some nations have already criminalized grooming in their national legislation Analysis of these laws suggests some may be redundant with existing legislation and or practices br br br Australia br Australian Criminal Code Act section and prohibits the use of a carrier service to communicate with the intent to procure a person under the age of or expose such a person to any indecent matter for grooming The various states and territories have similar laws some of which use a different ages for example the victim only has to be under in Queensland Such laws across Australia were recently strengthened in the wake of the murder of Carly Ryan br br br Canada br In Canada Criminal Code section makes it an offence to communicate with a child through a computer system to commit a sexual offence termed luring a child br br br Costa Rica br In Costa Rica since April the Criminal Code section bis makes it an offence to seduce a child by electronic

Offences Act make it an offence to arrange a meeting with a child under for oneself or someone else with the intent of sexually abusing the child The meeting itself is also an offence in its own right The offence carries a maximum sentence of years imprisonment and automatic barring of the offender from working with children or vulnerable adults br The Protection of Children and Prevention of Sexual Offences Scotland Act introduced a similar provision for Scotland br Thus a crime may be committed even without the actual meeting taking place and without the child being involved in the meeting for example if a police officer has taken over the contact and pretends to be that child In R v T EWCA Crim the appellant aged had pretended to befriend a nine year old girl but had done very little with her before she became suspicious and reported his approaches He had many previous convictions including one for rape and was described as a relentless predatory pedophile The Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of eight years imprisonment with an extended license period of two years br br br United States br br In the United States U S C b makes it a federal offence to use the mail
