Trump Prevails During Trump s first impeachment the Times drafted the hammer headline Trump Impeached The New York Times altered the ligatures between the E and the A as not doing so would leave a noticeable gap due to the stem of the A sloping away from the E The Times reused the tight kerning for Biden Beats Trump and Trump s second impeachment which simply read Impeached br In cases where two major events occur on the same day or immediately after each other The New York Times has used a paddle wheel headline where both headlines are used but split by a line The term dates back to
