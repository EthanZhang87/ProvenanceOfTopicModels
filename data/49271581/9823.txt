Eris Greek ris Strife is the Greek goddess of strife and discord Her Roman equivalent is Discordia which means the same Eris s Greek opposite is Harmonia whose Roman counterpart is Concordia though she is also described as opposing Nike counterpart of the Roman Victoria Homer equated her with the war goddess Enyo whose Roman counterpart is Bellona The dwarf planet Eris is named after the goddess br It is unknown whether she had any temples or sects in Greece She is often invoked as a personification of strife as which she appears in Homer and many later works br br br Etymology br Eris is of uncertain etymology connections with the verb or nein to raise stir excite and the proper name Erinyes have been suggested R S P Beekes rejects these derivations and suggested a pre Greek origin br br br In Greek mythology br The most famous tale of Eris recounts her initiating the Trojan War by causing the Judgement of Paris The goddesses Hera Athena and Aphrodite had been invited along with the rest of Olympus to the forced wedding of Peleus and Thetis who would become the parents of Achilles but Eris had been snubbed because of her troublemaking inclinations br She therefore as mentioned at the Kypria according to Proclus as part of a plan hatched by Zeus and Themis tossed into the party the Apple of Discord a golden apple inscribed Ancient Greek romanized t i kallist i For the most beautiful one or To the Fairest One provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient The hapless Paris Prince of Troy was appointed to select the fairest by Zeus The goddesses stripped naked to try to win Paris s decision and also attempted to bribe him Hera offered political power while Athena promised infinite wisdom But Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world Helen wife of Menelaus of Sparta and Paris chose to award the apple to Aphrodite thereby dooming his city which was destroyed in the war that ensued br In Works and Days Hesiod distinguishes between two kinds of strife It is unclear whether the distinction in this passage is to be taken literally or purely as a means to distinguish between two concepts Different interpretations exist br br In Hesiod s Theogony Eris has her lineage laid out as she bears many personifications as her children with some being singular deities and others being plural daemons br br In Homer s Iliad Book IV Eris is named as a sister and comrade to Ares though this is likely meant symbolically as they are both regarded as deities of war br br and Discord that rageth incessantly sister and comrade of man slaying Ares she at the first rears her crest but little yet thereafter planteth her head in heaven while her feet tread on earth She it was that now cast evil strife into their midst as she fared through the throng making the groanings of men to wax br Eris is also mentioned in Nonnus s Dionysiaca when Typhon prepares to battle with Zeus br br Eris Strife was Typhon s escort in the mellay Nike Victory led Zeus into battle br Another story of Eris includes Hera and the love of Polytechnus and Aedon They claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus were in love This angered Hera so she sent Eris to wreak discord upon them Polytekhnos was finishing off a chariot board and Aedon a web she had been weaving Eris said to them Whosoever finishes thine task last shall have to present the other with a female servant Aedon won But Polytekhnos was not happy by his defeat so he came to Khelidon Aedon s sister and raped her He then disguised her as a slave presenting her to Aedon When Aedon discovered this was indeed her sister she chopped up Polytekhnos s son and fed him to Polytekhnos The gods were not pleased so they were transformed into birds br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br In Roman mythology br br Discordia the Roman counterpart of Eris embodies similar attributes of strife and discord While sharing the fundamental essence of her Greek counterpart Discordia possesses distinct Roman characteristics and narratives In Roman mythology Discordia is often portrayed as the personification of chaos and strife representing the disruptive forces that can unsettle order and harmony within society She is typically associated with the concept of dissension and conflict symbolizing the breakdown of social cohesion br Virgil presents Discordia as similar to the Greek Eris Following Homer she appears in the Aeneid together with Mars Bellona and the Furies She is most frequently depicted as the daughter of Nox and the sister of Mars following Greek precedent though other sources present her as the sister of Nemesis and the constant attendent of Mars Ennius describes her in his Annales as a maiden in a military cloak born with hellish body of equal proportion with water and fire air and heavy earth br In Roman mythology Discordia is often intertwined with various tales of love and rivalry While not traditionally depicted as having consorts or lovers in the same manner as some other Roman deities her influence is evident in stories where conflicts arise due to jealousy ambition or betrayal Discordia s presence exacerbates tensions and fuels the flames of discord leading to dramatic consequences for mortal and divine alike The most notable example of this simply follows the Greek story of the Judgement of Paris br One notable aspect of Discordia s mythology is her role in the political and social sphere of ancient Rome As a personification of discord she was invoked during times of political unrest or upheaval serving as a symbolic representation of the turmoil and division within society Her influence extended beyond individual conflicts shaping the course of history and influencing the destiny of nations br Despite her association with chaos and strife Discordia was not always viewed in a negative light In some interpretations she served as a catalyst for change and transformation challenging established norms and fostering innovation While her disruptive influence could be destructive it also paved the way for renewal and growth highlighting the complex nature of her character within Roman mythology br br br In Discordianism br br The modern Discordian religion according to its book Principia Discordia began with a revelation from the Greek goddess Eris in the form of a chimpanzee Eris was adopted as the founding and patron deity of Discordianism in the early s by Gregory Hill and Kerry Wendell Thornley under the pen names of Malaclypse the Younger and Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst br The Discordian view of Eris is considerably lighter in comparison to the rather malevolent Graeco Roman view In Discordianism she is depicted as a positive albeit mischievous force of chaotic creation Principia Discordia states br br One day Mal consulted his Pineal Gland and asked Eris if She really created all of those terrible things She told him that She had always liked the Old Greeks but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters They were She added victims of indigestion you know br Suffice it to say that Eris is not hateful or malicious But she is mischievous and does get a little bitchy at times br br The story of Eris being snubbed and indirectly starting the Trojan War is recorded in the Principia and is referred to as the Original Snub The Principia Discordia states that her parents may be as described in Greek legend or that she may be the daughter of Void She is the Goddess of Disorder and Being whereas her sister Aneris called the equivalent of Harmonia by the Mythics of Harmonia is the goddess of Order and Non Being Their brother is Spirituality br In Discordianism Eris is looked upon as a foil to the preoccupation of Western philosophy in attempting find order in the chaos of reality in prescribing order to be synonymous with truth In Principia Discordia this is called the Aneristic Illusion David G Robertson discusses Discordian theology in the book Handbook of New Religions and Cultural Production writing that despite Discordian claims that its catmas are soft optional beliefs br br Nevertheless the Principia Discordia contains a complex and subtle religious system although this is often obscured by its chaotic structure The theology of the Principia is perhaps best summarized in the symbol The Sacred Chao Taken as a whole however the Sacred Chao symbolizes the Discordian idea that both order and chaos are man made concepts and that to believe that either is more true than the other is illusion The Sacred Chao represents pure chaos the metaphysical grounding of all that is and a level beyond any distinction making br br In this telling Eris becomes something of a patron of chaotic creation br br I am chaos I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms I am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy I am chaos I am alive and I tell you that you are free br Robertson writes in the book Fiction Invention and Hyper reality that br br Discordians have also constructed a complex and unique cosmology and theology and Discordianism has over time come to be considered as having genuine religious significance for many of its adherents Thus Discordianism can no longer be considered a purely parodic religion br br br Cultural influences br The classic fairy tale Sleeping Beauty references what appears to be Eris s role in the wedding of Peleus and Thetis Like Eris a malevolent fairy curses a princess after not being invited to the princess s christening br The concept of Eris as developed by the Principia Discordia is used and expanded upon in the science fiction work The Illuminatus Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson in which characters from Principia Discordia appear In this work Eris is a major character br The dwarf planet Eris was named after this Greek goddess in br In the New Zealand
