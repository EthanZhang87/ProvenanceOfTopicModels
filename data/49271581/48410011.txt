The United States presidential election was the th quadrennial presidential election held on Tuesday November The Democratic ticket of former vice president Joe Biden and the junior U S senator from California Kamala Harris defeated the incumbent Republican president Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence The election took place against the backdrop of the global COVID pandemic and related recession The election saw the highest voter turnout by percentage since with each of the two main tickets receiving more than million votes surpassing Barack Obama s record of million votes from Biden received more than million votes the most votes ever cast for a candidate in a U S presidential election br In a competitive primary that featured the most candidates for any political party in the modern era of American politics Biden secured the Democratic presidential nomination over his closest rival Senator Bernie Sanders Biden s running mate Harris became the first African American first Asian American and third female vice presidential nominee on a major party ticket Trump secured re nomination getting a total of delegates one of the most in presidential primary history to runner up Bill Weld s one delegate in the Republican primaries Jo Jorgensen secured the Libertarian presidential nomination with Spike Cohen as her running mate and Howie Hawkins secured the Green presidential nomination with Angela Nicole Walker as his running mate br The central issues of the election included the public health and economic impacts of the ongoing COVID pandemic civil unrest in reaction to the police murder of George Floyd and others the Supreme Court following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett and the future of the Affordable Care Act Due to the ongoing pandemic a record number of ballots were cast early and by mail Many more registered Democrats voted by mail than registered Republicans As a result of a large number of mail in ballots some swing states saw delays in vote counting and reporting this led to major news outlets delaying their projection of Biden and Harris as the president elect and vice president elect until the morning of November three and a half days after the election Major media networks project a state for a candidate once there is high statistical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning that state br Biden ultimately received the majority in the Electoral College with electoral votes while Trump received Trump was the first president to lose re election since George H W Bush in Key to Biden s victory were his wins in the Democratic leaning Rust Belt states of Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin which Trump narrowly carried in and whose combined electoral votes were enough to swing the election to either candidate Biden also became the first Democrat to win a presidential election in Georgia since and in Arizona since as well as Nebraska s nd congressional district since br Before during and after Election Day Trump and numerous other Republicans engaged in an aggressive and unprecedented attempt to subvert the election and overturn the results falsely alleging widespread voter fraud and trying to influence the vote counting process in swing states in what was described by many as an attempted coup d tat or more specifically an attempted self coup Attorney General William Barr and officials in each of the states found no evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities in the election Federal agencies overseeing election security said it was the most secure in American history The Trump campaign and its allies including Republican members of Congress continued to engage in numerous attempts to overturn the results of the election by filing numerous lawsuits in several states most of which were withdrawn or dismissed spreading conspiracy theories alleging fraud pressuring Republican state election officials including notably Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in a phone call that later became widely publicized and legislators to change results pressuring the Department of Justice to declare the election corrupt and intervene objecting to the Electoral College certification in Congress and refusing to cooperate with the presidential transition of Joe Biden With Trump vowing that he would never concede the election and after exhorting his followers to fight like hell a mob of Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol on January during the joint session of Congress held to certify the Electoral College count On January Trump acknowledged the incoming administration without mentioning Biden s name Biden and Harris were inaugurated on January in a break from tradition Trump did not attend his successor s inauguration Trump was indicted on August on four counts relating to conspiring to overturn the results br br br Background br br br Procedure br br Article Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a natural born citizen of the United States be at least years old and have been a United States resident for at least years Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the various political parties in the United States Each party develops a method such as a primary election to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position Primary elections are usually indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate The party s delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party s behalf The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that party s ticket which is then ratified by the delegates at the party s convention except for the Libertarian Party which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee s preference The general election in November is also an indirect election in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College these electors then directly elect the president and vice president If no candidate receives the minimum electoral votes needed to win the election the United States House of Representatives will select the president from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes and the United States Senate will select the vice president from among the candidates who received the two highest totals The presidential election occurred simultaneously alongside elections for the House of Representatives the Senate and various state and local level elections br The Maine Legislature passed a bill in August adopting ranked choice voting RCV both for presidential primaries and for the general election Governor Janet Mills allowed the bill to become law without her signature which delayed its taking effect until after the Democratic primary in March and made Maine the first state to use RCV for a presidential general election The Maine Republican Party filed signatures for a veto referendum to preclude the use of RCV for the election but Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap found there were insufficient valid signatures to qualify for the ballot A challenge in Maine Superior Court was successful for the Maine Republican Party but the Maine Supreme Judicial Court stayed the ruling pending appeal on September Nevertheless ballots began being printed later that day without the veto referendum and including RCV for the presidential election and the Court ruled in favor of the secretary of state on September allowing RCV to be used An emergency appeal to the Supreme Court was denied on October The law continues the use of the congressional district method for the allocation of Maine s electors Nebraska is the only other state that apportions its electoral votes this way While multiple rounds of vote counting were not needed due to a single candidate receiving a majority of first choice votes statewide and in each district use of RCV complicates interpretation of the national popular vote because voters are more likely to vote for third party or independent candidates br On December pledged electors for each candidate known collectively as the United States Electoral College gathered in their states capitols to cast their official votes Pursuant to the processes laid out by the Electoral Count Act of certificates of ascertainment listing the names of the electors and separate certificates recording their votes are distributed to various officials across the branches of government The newly elected Congress with the Vice President in his role as Senate President presiding met in a joint session to formally open the certificates and count the votes which began on January was interrupted by the January United States Capitol attack and finished the following day br br br Simultaneous elections br br The presidential election occurred simultaneously with elections to the Senate and the House of Representatives Gubernatorial and legislative elections were also held in several states For the subsequent election the apportionment of House seats among the states based on the results of the United States census occurred and the states conducted redistricting of congressional and state legislative districts In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting although some states have redistricting commissions Often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a coattail effect that also helps other candidates of that party win elections The party that won the presidential election could have also won a significant advantage in drawing new congressional and state legislative districts which would stay in effect until br br br Nominations br br br Democratic Party br br The Democratic Party chose its nominee in the Democratic Party presidential primaries Joe Biden became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party on June when he secured enough delegates to ensure his nomination at the national convention Biden picked Kamala Harris as his vice presidential nominee and the ticket was formally nominated at the convention on August br br br Republican Party br br Incumbent president Donald Trump and incumbent vice president Mike Pence were able to easily secure the nomination after Trump received enough delegates in the Republican presidential primaries They were formally nominated at the Republican National Convention on August br br br Libertarian Party br br Jo Jorgensen who was the running mate of author Harry Browne in received the Libertarian nomination at the national convention on May She achieved ballot access in all states and the District of Columbia br br br Green Party br br Howie Hawkins became the presumptive nominee of the Green Party on June and was officially nominated by the party on July Hawkins secured ballot access in states and the District of Columbia representing electoral votes and write in access in more states representing electoral votes br br br General election campaigns br br br Ballot access br br br Party conventions br br The Democratic National Convention was originally scheduled for July in Milwaukee Wisconsin but was delayed to August due to the effects of the COVID pandemic On June it was announced that the convention would be held in a mixed online in person format with most delegates attending remotely but a few still attending the physical convention site On August the in person portion of the convention was scaled down even further major speeches including Biden s were switched to a virtual format br The Republican National Convention took place from August in Charlotte North Carolina and various remote locations Originally a three day convention was planned to be held in North Carolina but due to North Carolina s insistence that the convention follow COVID social distancing rules the speeches and celebrations were moved to Jacksonville Florida official convention business was still contractually obligated to be conducted in Charlotte Due to the worsening situation with regards to COVID in Florida the plans there were cancelled and the convention was moved back to Charlotte in a scaled down capacity br The Libertarian National Convention was originally scheduled to be held in Austin Texas over Memorial Day weekend from May to but all reservations at the JW Marriott Downtown Austin for the convention were cancelled on April due to the COVID pandemic The Libertarian National Committee eventually decided the party would hold two conventions one online from May to select the presidential and vice presidential nominees and one at a physical convention in Orlando Florida from July for other business br The Green National Convention was originally to be held in Detroit Michigan from July to Due to the COVID pandemic the convention was instead held online without a change in date br br br Issues unique to the election br br br Impeachment br br The House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump on two counts on December The trial in the Senate began on January and ended on February resulting in acquittal by the United States Senate br This is the second time a president has been impeached during his first term while running for a second term Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses br br br Effects of the COVID pandemic br br Several events related to the presidential election were altered or postponed due to the ongoing COVID pandemic in the United States and its effects such as stay at home orders and social distancing guidelines by local governments On March following primary elections in six states Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in person campaigning and campaign rallies On March Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies The th Democratic debate was held on March without an audience at the CNN studios in Washington D C Several states also postponed their primaries to a later date including Georgia Kentucky Louisiana Ohio and Maryland As of March all major party presidential candidates had halted in person campaigning and campaign rallies over COVID concerns Political analysts speculated at the time that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled with the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly how the election will be conducted br br Some presidential primary elections were severely disrupted by COVID related issues including long lines at polling places greatly increased requests for absentee ballots and technology issues Due to a shortage of election workers able or willing to work during the pandemic the number of polling places was often greatly reduced Most states expanded or encouraged voting by mail as an alternative but many voters complained that they never received the absentee ballots they had requested br The March Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act included money for states to increase mail in voting By May Trump and his campaign strongly opposed mail in voting claiming that it would cause widespread voter fraud a belief that has been discredited by a number of media organizations Government response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration coupled with the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding economic stimulus became a major campaign issue for both parties br On April the Supreme Court and Republicans in the State Legislature of Wisconsin rebuffed Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers s request to move the state s spring elections to June As a result the elections which included a presidential primary went ahead on April as planned At least seven new cases of COVID were traced to this election Voting rights advocates expressed fear of similar chaos on a nationwide scale in November recommending states move to expand vote by mail options br On June Trump s campaign held an in person rally in Tulsa Oklahoma after the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that the event could go ahead despite continuing concerns over COVID Attendance at the rally was far lower than expected being described as a flop and it led to a significant worsening of relations between Trump and his campaign manager Brad Parscale million people watched the event on Fox News a Saturday audience record for that channel Three weeks after the rally the Oklahoma State Department of Health recorded record numbers of cases of COVID and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain died of the virus although it was not confirmed that he caught the disease due to his attendance at the rally br On October Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for SARS CoV following a positive test from his senior advisor Hope Hicks as part of the larger COVID outbreak among White House personnel Both the president and first lady immediately entered quarantine which prevented Trump from further campaigning notably at campaign rallies Later that day the President was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center with a low grade fever where he was reported to have received an experimental antibody treatment Trump s diagnosis came only two days after he had shared the stage with Biden at the first presidential debate and raised the possibility that Biden had caught the virus from Trump Biden tested negative Trump was discharged from the hospital on October br Trump being diagnosed with COVID was widely seen as having a negative effect on his campaign and shifted the attention of the public back onto COVID an issue which is generally seen as a liability for Trump due to his response to the COVID pandemic suffering from low approval ratings Being in quarantine also meant Trump was unable to attend rallies which were a major part of his campaign As a result of Trump contracting COVID Biden continued campaigning but temporarily ceased running attack ads against him On October one week after his discharge from the hospital Trump resumed in person rallies Trump continued to travel to battleground states and hold mass rallies sometimes two or three in a day His rallies were criticized for their lack of social distancing or mask wearing and some polls suggested that voters saw him less favorably for potentially endangering attendees br br br Foreign interference br br U S officials accused Russia China and Iran of trying to influence the United States elections On October Microsoft announced that Phosphorus a group of hackers linked to the Iranian government had attempted to compromise e mail accounts belonging to journalists U S government officials and the campaign of a U S presidential candidate The American Government owned Voice of America reported in April that Internet security researchers say there have already been signs that China allied hackers have engaged in so called spear phishing attacks on American political targets ahead of the vote Chinese spokesman Geng Shuang denied the allegations and said he would hope the people of the U S not drag China into its electoral politics br On February American intelligence officials advised members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the election in an effort to get Trump re elected The briefing was delivered by Shelby Pierson the intelligence community s top election security official and an aide to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire On February The Washington Post reported that according to unnamed U S officials Russia was interfering in the Democratic primary in an effort to support the nomination of Senator Bernie Sanders Sanders issued a statement after the news report saying in part I don t care frankly who Putin wants to be president My message to Putin is clear stay out of American elections and as president I will make sure that you do Sanders acknowledged that his campaign was briefed about Russia s alleged efforts about a month prior In a February briefing to the House Intelligence Committee U S intelligence officials warned Congress that Russia was interfering in the campaign to support Trump s reelection campaign Trump was angered that Congress had been informed of the threat and the day after the briefing castigated the acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire for allowing the briefing to go forward China and some government linked Chinese individuals have been accused of interfering in the election to support the candidacy of both Biden and Trump though whether it is actually doing so is disputed among the intelligence community br On October threatening emails were sent to Democrats in at least four states The emails warned You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe announced that evening that the emails using a spoofed return address had been sent by Iran He added that both Iran and Russia are known to have obtained American voter registration data possibly from publicly available information and This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy A spokesman for Iran denied the allegation In his announcement Ratcliffe said Iran s intent had been to intimidate voters incite social unrest and damage President Trump raising questions as to how ordering Democrats to vote for Trump would be damaging to Trump It was later reported that the reference to Trump had not been in Ratcliffe s prepared remarks as signed off by the other officials on the stage he had added it on his own On November the Justice Department charged two Iranian hackers with attempting to intimidate American voters ahead of the U S election by sending threatening emails and spreading false information br Throughout the election period several Colombian lawmakers and the Colombian ambassador to the United States issued statements supporting the Donald Trump campaign which has been viewed as potentially harmful to Colombia United States relations On October the U S Ambassador to Colombia Philip Goldberg requested that Colombian politicians abstain from getting involved in the elections br The Department of Justice is investigating whether the Trump Victory Committee accepted a donation from Malaysian businessman and international fugitive Jho Low who is accused of being the mastermind behind the multibillion dollar Malaysia Development Berhad scandal involving a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund MDB br Government officials and American corporate security officers braced for a repeat of s election infrastructure hacking and similar twenty first century attacks and in fact conducted what were characterized as preemptive counter strikes on botnet infrastructure which might be used in large scale coordination of hacking and some incidents earlier in the year appeared to foreshadow such possibilities Nonetheless after his dismissal in a December interview Chris Krebs the Trump administration s director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA described monitoring Election Day from CISA s joint command center along with representatives from the military s United States Cyber Command the National Security Agency NSA the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI the United States Secret Service USSS the Election Assistance Commission EAC representatives of vendors of voting machine equipment and representatives of state and local governments as well as his agency s analysis preceding and after that day saying It was quiet There was no indication or evidence that there was any sort of hacking or compromise of election systems on before or after November third Responding to spurious claims of foreign outsourcing of vote counting as a rationale behind litigation attempting to stop official vote counting in some areas Krebs also affirmed that All votes in the United States of America are counted in the United States of America br Acts of foreign interference included Russian state directed application of computational propaganda approaches more conventional state sponsored Internet propaganda smaller scale disinformation efforts information laundering and trading up the chain propaganda tactics employing some government officials Trump affiliates and US media outlets br br br Trump s potential rejection of election results br br During the campaign Trump indicated in Twitter posts interviews and speeches that he might refuse to recognize the outcome of the election if he were defeated Trump falsely suggested that the election would be rigged against him In July Trump declined to answer whether he would accept the results just as he did in the presidential election telling Fox News anchor Chris Wallace that I have to see No I m not going to just say yes I m not going to say no Trump repeatedly claimed that the only way he could lose would be if the election was rigged and repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power after the election Trump also attacked mail in voting throughout the campaign falsely claiming that the practice contains high rates of fraud at one point Trump said We ll see what happens Get rid of the ballots and you ll have a very peaceful there won t be a transfer frankly There will be a continuation Trump s statements have been described as a threat to upend the constitutional order In September FBI Director Christopher A Wray who was appointed by Trump testified under oath that the FBI has not seen historically any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election whether it s by mail or otherwise br A number of congressional Republicans insisted they were committed to an orderly and peaceful transition of power but declined to criticize Trump for his comments On September the Senate unanimously passed a resolution affirming the Senate s commitment to a peaceful transfer of power Trump also stated he expected the Supreme Court to decide the election and that he wanted a conservative majority in case of an election dispute reiterating his commitment to quickly install a ninth justice following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg br br br Election delay suggestion br In April Biden suggested that Trump might try to delay the election saying he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow come up with some rationale why it can t be held On July Trump tweeted that With Universal Mail In Voting not Absentee Voting which is good will be the most INACCURATE FRAUDULENT Election in history and asked if it should be delayed until people can safely cast ballots in person Experts indicated that for the election to be legally delayed such a decision must be made by Congress And the Constitution sets the end of the presidential and vice presidential terms at January a hard deadline which cannot be altered by Congress except by constitutional amendment br br br Postal voting br br Postal voting in the United States has become increasingly common with of voters mailing their ballots in and By June the COVID pandemic was predicted to cause a large increase in mail voting because of the possible danger of congregating at polling places An August state by state analysis concluded that of Americans were eligible to vote by mail in a record number The analysis predicted that million ballots could be cast by mail in more than double the number in The Postal Service sent a letter to multiple states in July warning that the service would not be able to meet the state s deadlines for requesting and casting last minute absentee ballots In addition to the anticipated high volume of mailed ballots the prediction was due in part to numerous measures taken by Louis DeJoy the newly installed United States Postmaster General including banning overtime and extra trips to deliver mail which caused delays in delivering mail and dismantling and removing hundreds of high speed mail sorting machines from postal centers On August after the House of Representatives had been recalled from its August break to vote on a bill reversing the changes DeJoy announced that he would roll back all the changes until after the November election He said he would reinstate overtime hours roll back service reductions and halt the removal of mail sorting machines and collection boxes br The House of Representatives voted an emergency grant of billion to the post office to facilitate the predicted flood of mail ballots Although Trump has repeatedly denounced mail voting he has mailed in ballots due to being in a different state than the one where he votes at the time of the election In August Trump conceded that the post office would need additional funds to handle the additional mail in voting but said he would block any additional funding for the post office to prevent any increase in balloting by mail br The Trump campaign filed lawsuits seeking to block the use of official ballot dropboxes in Pennsylvania in locations other than an election office and also sought to block election officials from counting mail in ballots if a voter forgets to put their mail in ballot in a secrecy sleeve within the ballot return envelope The Trump campaign and the Republican Party both failed to produce any evidence of vote by mail fraud after being ordered by a federal judge to do so br On Election Day a judge ordered mail inspectors to search mail facilities in key battleground states for ballots The agency refused to comply with the order and nearly of ballots in USPS facilities on Election Day were not processed in time br br br Federal Election Commission issues br The Federal Election Commission which was created in to enforce campaign finance laws in federal elections has not functioned since July due to vacancies in membership In the absence of a quorum the commission cannot vote on complaints or give guidance through advisory opinions As of May there were outstanding matters on the agency s enforcement docket and items waiting for action As of September Trump had not nominated anyone to fill the FEC vacancies br br br Supreme Court vacancy br br On September Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately said the precedent he had set regarding the Merrick Garland nomination was inoperative and that a replacement would be voted on as soon as possible setting the stage for a confirmation battle and an unexpected intrusion into the campaign The death of Justice Ginsburg resulted in large increases in momentum for both the Democrats and Republicans The president vice president and several Republican members of Congress said a full Supreme Court bench was needed to decide the upcoming election br On September the day after Justice Ginsburg s body lay in state at the Capitol Trump held a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House to announce and introduce his candidate Amy Coney Barrett After four days of confirmation hearings the Senate Judiciary Committee voted the nomination out of committee on October and on October Barrett was confirmed on a party line vote of with no Democrats voting for her confirmation This was the closest Supreme Court confirmation ever to a presidential election and the first Supreme Court nomination since with no supporting votes from the minority party It was also one of the fastest timelines from nomination to confirmations in U S history br br br Pre election litigation br br By September several hundred legal cases relating to the election had been filed About of these had to do with the mechanics of voting in relation to the COVID pandemic The Supreme Court ruled on a number of these cases primarily issuing emergency stays instead of going through the normal process due to the urgency In October there was speculation that the election might be decided through a Supreme Court case as happened following the election br br br Debates br br On October the Commission on Presidential Debates CPD announced that three general election debates would be held in the fall of br The first moderated by Chris Wallace took place on September and was co hosted by Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland Ohio The debate was originally to be hosted at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame Indiana but the university decided against holding the debate as a result of the COVID pandemic Biden was generally held to have won the first debate with a significant minority of commentators deeming it a draw br One exchange that was particularly noted was when Trump did not directly denounce the white supremacist and neo fascist group Proud Boys instead responding that they should stand back and stand by On the next day Trump told reporters the group should stand down while also claiming that he was not aware of what the group was The debate was described as chaotic and nearly incoherent because of Trump s repeated interruptions causing the CPD to consider adjustments to the format of the remaining debates br The vice presidential debate was held on October at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City The debate was widely held to be subdued with no clear victor One incident that was particularly commented on was when a fly landed on vice president Pence s head and remained there unbeknownst to him for two minutes br The second debate was initially set to be held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor Michigan but the university withdrew in June over concerns regarding the COVID pandemic The planned debate was rescheduled for October at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami due to Trump contracting COVID the CPD announced on October that the debate would be held virtually in which the candidates would appear from separate locations Trump refused to participate in a virtual debate and the commission subsequently announced that the debate had been cancelled br The third scheduled debate took place on October at Belmont University in Nashville Tennessee and was moderated by Kristen Welker The changes to the debate rules which included the candidates microphones being muted while the other was speaking resulted in it being generally considered more civil than the first debate Welker s performance as moderator was praised with her being regarded as having done a good job preventing the candidates from interrupting each other Biden was generally held to have won the debate though it was considered unlikely to alter the race to any considerable degree br br The Free Equal Elections Foundation held two debates with various third party and independent candidates one on October in Denver Colorado and another on October in Cheyenne Wyoming br br br Polling br br br Two way br The following graph depicts the standing of each candidate in the poll aggregators from September to November Former Vice President Joe Biden the Democratic nominee had an average polling lead of percentage points over incumbent President Donald Trump the Republican nominee Biden would win the national popular vote by percentage points br br br Four way br Calculated averages are not comparable to those for the Biden vs Trump polls As polling with third parties has been very limited the polls included in the average are often different br br br Swing states br The following graph depicts the difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in each swing state in the poll aggregators from March to the election with the election results for comparison br br br Endorsements br br br Total cost estimate br OpenSecrets estimated the total cost of the election nearly billion making it the most expensive election in history and twice as expensive as the previous presidential election cycle br br br Campaign issues br br br COVID pandemic br br The COVID pandemic was a major issue of the campaign with Trump s responses being heavily criticized The president spread mixed messages on the value of wearing face masks as protection including criticizing Biden and reporters for wearing them but has also encouraged their use at times During the campaign Trump held many events across the country including in COVID hotspots where attendees did not wear masks and were not socially distancing at the same time he mocked those who wore face masks br Biden advocated for the expansion of federal funding including funding under the Defense Production Act for testing personal protective equipment and research Trump also invoked the Defense Production Act to control the distribution of masks and ventilators but his response plan relied significantly on a vaccine being released by the end of At the second presidential debate Trump claimed Biden had called him xenophobic for restricting entry from foreign nationals who had visited China but Biden responded that he had not been referring to this decision br br br Economy br br Trump claimed credit for the consistent economic expansion of his presidency s first three years with the stock market at its longest growth period in history and unemployment at a fifty year low Additionally he has touted the third quarter rebound in which GDP grew at an annualized rate of as evidence of the success of his economic policies Biden responded to Trump s claims by repeating that the strong economy under Trump s presidency was inherited from the Obama administration and that Trump has aggravated the economic impact of the pandemic including the need for million Americans to file for unemployment br The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of which lowered income taxes for many Americans and lowered the corporate tax rate from to were a major component of Trump s economic policy Biden and the Democrats generally describe these cuts as unfairly benefiting the upper class Biden plans to raise taxes on corporations and those making over per year while keeping the reduced taxes on lower income brackets and raise capital gains taxes to a maximum bracket of In response Trump said Biden s plans would destroy retirement accounts and the stock market br br br Environment br br Trump and Biden s views on environmental policy differ significantly Trump stated that climate change is a hoax although he also called it a serious subject Trump condemned the Paris Agreement on greenhouse gas reduction and began the withdrawal process Biden planned to rejoin it and announced a trillion plan to combat climate change Biden had not fully accepted the Green New Deal Biden did not plan to ban fracking but rather to outlaw new fracking on federal land In a debate Trump claimed Biden wanted to ban it altogether Trump s other environmental policies included the removal of methane emission standards and an expansion of mining br br br Health care br br Health care was a divisive issue in both the Democratic primary campaign and the general campaign While Biden as well as other candidates promised protection of the Affordable Care Act progressives within the Democratic Party advocated to replace the private insurance industry with Medicare for All Biden s plan involves adding a public option to the American healthcare system and the restoration of the individual mandate to buy health care which was removed from the Affordable Care Act by the tax cut bill as well as restoring funding for Planned Parenthood Trump announced plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act calling it too expensive but he did not say what would replace it At the time of the election the Trump administration and Republican officials from states had a lawsuit before the Supreme Court asking the court to repeal the Affordable Care Act br br br Racial unrest br br As a result of the murder of George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality against African Americans combined with the effects of the COVID pandemic a series of protests and a wider period of racial unrest erupted in mid This was followed by the Black Lives Matter movement which protested police brutality against black people and became a central point of the presidential campaign Protests were mostly peaceful fewer than involved property damage or violence with most of the latter directed at BLM protesters themselves According to a September estimate arson vandalism and looting caused about billion in insured damage between May and June making this initial phase of the George Floyd protests the civil disorder event with the highest recorded damage in United States history br In response Trump and the Republicans suggested sending in the military to counter the protests which was criticized especially by Democrats as heavy handed and potentially illegal Trump referred to Black Lives Matter protesters confronting diners in a restaurant as thugs and called a street painting of the slogan a symbol of hate Particularly controversial was a photo op Trump took in front of St John s Church in Washington D C before which military police had forcefully cleared peaceful protestors from the area Biden condemned Trump for his actions against protestors he described George Floyd s words I can t breathe as a wake up call for our nation He also promised he would create a police oversight commission in his first days as president and establish a uniform use of force standard as well as other police reform measures br br br Predictions br br br Results br br br Statistics br More than million votes were cast in the election More than million of them were cast before Election Day by early voting or mail ballot due to the ongoing COVID pandemic The election saw the highest voter turnout as a percentage of eligible voters since with each of the two main tickets receiving more than million votes surpassing Barack Obama s record of million votes from The Biden Harris ticket received more than million votes the most votes ever in a U S presidential election It was also the ninth consecutive presidential election where the victorious major party nominee did not receive a popular vote majority by a double digit margin over the losing major party nominee s continuing the longest sequence of such presidential elections in U S history which began in and in eclipsed the previous longest sequence that from through In percent of U S voters lived in landslide counties a decline from percent in br Trump became the eleventh incumbent in the country s history and the first since to lose a bid for a second term Biden s of the popular vote was the highest for a challenger to an incumbent president since Biden is the sixth vice president to become president without succeeding to the office on the death or resignation of a previous president Additionally Trump s loss marked the third time an elected president lost the popular vote twice the first being John Quincy Adams in the s and Benjamin Harrison in the s and s This was the first time since and the first for Republicans since that a party was voted out after a single four year term This was the second election in American history in which the incumbent president lost re election despite winning a greater share of the popular vote than he did in the previous election after It is also the third election in which the two candidates that received electoral votes carried the same number of states This also happened in and br Biden won states the District of Columbia and one congressional district in Nebraska totaling electoral votes Trump won states and one congressional district in Maine totaling electoral votes This result was exactly the reverse of Trump s victory to in excluding faithless electors Biden became the first Democrat to win the presidential election in Georgia since and in Arizona since and the first candidate to win nationally without Florida since and Ohio since casting doubt on Ohio s continued status as a bellwether state Biden carried five states won by Trump in Arizona Georgia Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin He also became the first Democrat since to carry Nebraska s nd congressional district winning one electoral vote from the state Trump did not win any states won by Clinton in Biden s three gains in the Rust Belt Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were widely characterized as a rebuilding of the blue wall a term widely used in the press for the states consistently won by Democrats from to broken by Trump in when he narrowly flipped those three Rust Belt states Nevertheless amidst Trump s national and electoral defeat his scoring decisive victories in Ohio Iowa and Florida for the second time after their having backed Obama twice has led many commentators to conclude they have shifted from perennial swing states to reliable red states br In light of the attempts to contest the election results an important question is how many votes would have had to change in particular states in order to produce a different Electoral College outcome If Biden s three narrowest state victories Wisconsin Georgia and Arizona all of which he won by less than a percentage point had gone to Trump there would have been a tie of electors for each candidate causing a contingent election to be decided by the House of Representatives where Trump had the advantage Even though Democrats controlled the House contingent elections are determined by state delegations in which each state receives just one vote and since a slight majority of states in contained more Republican than Democratic representatives Republicans would have had more votes in such an election This scenario would have required a popular vote shift of or less in each of these three states a total of about votes of votes cast nationally This situation paralleled when a shift of or less in each of the three most closely contested states Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania or about votes would have resulted in the popular vote winner Hillary Clinton also winning in the Electoral College This was the first time since that Democrats won the popular vote in four elections in a row Biden was the second former Vice President after Richard Nixon in to win the presidency as well as the first Vice President since George H W Bush in to be elected president br Almost all counties previously considered reliable indicators of eventual success in presidential elections voted for Trump instead of Biden meaning that they did not continue their streaks as bellwether counties This was attributed to increasing political polarization throughout the country and to the urban rural divide br While Trump still dominated rural America as a whole there were rural areas that he lost Biden won of the rural counties that each had mostly non white voters particularly in the South and the West Rural counties in the South won by Biden had greater economic distress than those won by Trump in the Northeast the opposite was true In the West Biden did especially well in rural counties that had high shares of workers employed in leisure and hospitality Such counties likewise had large constituencies of immigration from other states Every state won by Biden was won by more votes than those by which Hillary Clinton won the state The combined vote margin of these states was equal to Biden s gain over Hillary Clinton Biden became the oldest president ever elected besting

reporting from Maryland Virginia California Nevada Michigan Missouri Wisconsin and D C Due to the COVID pandemic it was scaled down to a limited election observation mission from the originally planned long term observers and short term observers br An interim report published by the OSCE shortly before the election noted that many ODIHR interlocutors expressed grave concerns about the risk of legitimacy of the elections being questioned due to the incumbent President s repeated allegations of a fraudulent election process and postal vote in particular On the day after the election the task force published preliminary findings with part of the summary stating br br The November general elections were competitive and well managed despite legal uncertainties and logistical challenges In a highly polarized political environment harsh campaign rhetoric fuelled tensions Measures intended to secure the elections during the pandemic triggered protracted litigation driven by partisan interests The uncertainty caused by late legal challenges and evidence deficient claims about election fraud created confusion and concern among election officials and voters Voter registration and identification rules in some states are unduly restrictive for certain groups of citizens The media although sharply polarized provided comprehensive coverage of the campaign and made efforts to provide accurate information on the organization of elections br Link said that on the election day itself we couldn t see any violations at the polling places visited by the observers The task force

Rosebud Sioux and Crow Creek tribes going for Biden For example in Oglala Lakota County which overlaps with the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation Biden won of the vote br Trump s strongest performance among Native tribes was with the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina where he won a strong majority in Robeson County and flipped Scotland County from Democratic to Republican Trump had campaigned in Lumberton in Robeson County and had promised the Lumbees federal recognition br br br Polling accuracy br Although polls generally predicted the Biden victory the national polls overestimated him by three to four points and some state polling was even further from the actual result and greater than s error one or two points The numbers represented the highest level of error since the presidential election This polling overestimation also applied in several Senate races where the Democrats underperformed by about five points relative to the polls as well as the House elections where Republicans gained seats instead of losing as polls predicted Most pollsters underestimated support for Trump in several key battleground states including Florida Iowa Ohio Pennsylvania Michigan Texas and Wisconsin The discrepancy between poll predictions and the actual result persisted from the election despite pollsters attempts to fix problems with polling in in which they underestimated the Republican vote in several states The imprecise polls led to changes in campaigning and fundraising decisions for both Democrats and Republicans br According to The New York Times polling misses have been attributed to among other issues reduced average response to polling the relative difficulty to poll certain types of voters and pandemic related problems such as a theory which suggests Democrats were less willing to vote in person on Election Day than Republicans for fear of contracting COVID According to CNN research presented to the American Association for Public Opinion Research indicated one of the primary problems was an inability by pollsters to include a certain segment of Trump supporters either due to inaccessibility or lack of participation New Statesman data journalist Ben Walker pointed to Hispanics as a historically difficult group to poll accurately leading to pollsters underestimating the level of Trump support within the demographic group Election analyst Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight wrote that the polling error was completely normal by historical standards and disputes the narrative that polls were wrong br br br Aftermath br br br Election night br br Election night November ended without a clear winner as many state results were too close to call and millions of votes remained uncounted including in the battleground states of Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania North Carolina Georgia Arizona and Nevada Results were delayed in these states due to local rules on counting mail in ballots Mail in ballots became particularly prevalent in the election due to the widespread outbreak of the COVID pandemic Over roughly million mail in ballots were submitted over doubling the previous election s million In a victory declared after midnight Trump won the swing state of Florida by over three percentage points an increase from his percentage point margin in having seen significant gains in support among the Latino community in Miami Dade County br Shortly after a m EST Biden made a short speech in which he urged his supporters to be patient while the votes are counted and said he believed he was on track to win this election Shortly before a m EST Trump made a speech to a roomful of supporters falsely asserting that he had won the election and calling for a stop to all vote counting saying that continued counting was a fraud on the American people and we will be going to the U S Supreme Court The Biden campaign denounced these attempts claiming the Trump campaign was engaging in a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens br br br Late counting br In Pennsylvania where the counting of mail in ballots began on election night Trump declared victory on November with a lead of votes despite more than a million ballots remaining uncounted Trump also declared victory in North Carolina and Georgia despite many ballots being uncounted At p m EST on election night Fox News projected Biden would win Arizona with the Associated Press making the same call at a m EST on November several other media outlets concluded the state was too close to call By the evening of November the Associated Press reported that Biden had secured electoral votes by winning Michigan and Wisconsin with Pennsylvania North Carolina Georgia and Nevada remaining uncalled Biden had a lead in Nevada and maintained a lead in Arizona by November needing only to win Nevada and Arizona or to win Pennsylvania to obtain the necessary electoral votes br Some Trump supporters expressed concerns of possible fraud after seeing the president leading in some states on Election Night only to see Biden take the lead in subsequent days Election experts attributed this to several factors including a red mirage of early results being counted in relatively thinly populated rural areas that favored Trump which are quicker to count followed later by results from more heavily populated urban areas that favored Biden which take longer to count In some states like Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin Republican controlled legislatures prohibited mail in ballots from being counted before Election Day and once those ballots were counted they generally favored Biden at least in part because Trump had for months raised concerns about mail in ballots encouraging his supporters instead to vote in person By contrast in states such as Florida which allowed counting of mail in ballots for weeks prior to Election Day an early blue shift giving the appearance of a Biden lead was later overcome by in person voting that favored Trump resulting in the state being called for the president on Election Night br On November a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by the Trump campaign to stop vote counting in Pennsylvania The Trump campaign had alleged that its observers were not given access to observe the vote but its lawyers admitted during the hearing that its observers were already present in the vote counting room Also that day a state judge dismissed another lawsuit by the Trump campaign which alleged that in Georgia late arriving ballots were counted The judge ruled no evidence had been produced that the ballots were late Meanwhile a state judge in Michigan dismissed the Trump campaign s lawsuit requesting a pause in vote counting to allow access to observers as the judge noted that vote counting had already finished in Michigan That judge also noted the official complaint did not state why when where or by whom an election observer was allegedly blocked from observing ballot counting in Michigan br On November Biden assumed leads in Pennsylvania and Georgia as the states continued to count ballots and absentee votes in those states heavily favored Biden Due to the slim margin between Biden and Trump in the state Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced on November that a recount would be held in Georgia At that point Georgia had not seen any widespread irregularities in this election according to the voting system manager of the state Gabriel Sterling br Also on November U S Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito issued an order requiring officials in Pennsylvania to segregate late arriving ballots amid a dispute as to whether the state s Supreme Court validly ordered a day extension of the deadline for mail in ballots to arrive Several Republican attorneys general filed amicus briefs before the U S Supreme Court in subsequent days agreeing with the Pennsylvania Republican Party s view that only the state legislature could change the voting deadline br By November several prominent Republicans had publicly denounced Trump s claims of electoral fraud saying they were unsubstantiated baseless or without evidence damaging to the election process undermining democracy and dangerous to political stability while others supported his demand of transparency According to CNN people close to Donald Trump such as his son in law and senior adviser Jared Kushner and his wife Melania Trump urged him to accept his defeat While Donald Trump privately acknowledged the outcome of the presidential election he nonetheless encouraged his legal team to continue pursuing legal challenges Trump expected to win the election in Arizona but when Fox News declared Biden the victor of the state Trump became furious and claimed the result was due to fraud br Trump and his allies suffered approximately legal losses in four weeks after starting their litigation In view of these legal defeats Trump began to employ a public pressure campaign on state and local Republican officials to manipulate the electoral system on his behalf br br br Election protests br br Protests against Trump s challenges to the election results occurred in Minneapolis Portland New York and other cities Police in Minneapolis arrested more than demonstrators for blocking traffic on an interstate highway In Portland the National Guard was called out after some protesters smashed windows and threw objects at police At the same time groups of Trump supporters gathered outside of election centers in Phoenix Detroit and Philadelphia shouting objections to counts that showed Biden leading or gaining ground In Arizona where Biden s lead was shrinking as more results were reported the pro Trump protesters mostly demanded that all remaining votes be counted while in Michigan and Pennsylvania where Trump s lead shrank and disappeared altogether as more results were reported they called for the count to be stopped br br br False claims of fraud br br Trump and a variety of his surrogates and supporters made a series of observably false claims that the election was fraudulent Claims that substantial fraud was committed have been repeatedly debunked On November and The New York Times called the offices of top election officials in every state all of those who responded said there was no evidence of fraud Some described the election as remarkably successful considering the coronavirus pandemic the record turnout and the unprecedented number of mailed ballots On November the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA issued a statement calling the election the most secure in American history and noting t here is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes changed votes or was in any way compromised Five days later Trump fired the director of CISA whom he had appointed in br As ballots were still being counted two days after Election Day Trump falsely asserted that there was tremendous corruption and fraud going on adding If you count the legal votes I easily win If you count the illegal votes they can try to steal the election from us Trump has repeatedly claimed as suspicious that mail in ballots showed significantly more support for Biden This blue shift phenomenon is believed to occur because more Democrats than Republicans tend to vote by mail and mail ballots are counted after Election Day in many states Leading up to the election the effect was predicted to be even greater than usual as Trump s attacks on mail in voting may have deterred Republicans from casting mail ballots br In early January Trump falsely proclaimed that he had by rights won all states in the presidential election and a to electoral college victory On January during his phone call to Brad Raffensperger the Georgia Secretary of State Trump said As you know every single state We won every state we won every statehouse in the country But we won every single statehouse Two days later on January Trump appeared at a campaign rally in Dalton Georgia supporting Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler During his speech at the rally Trump again asserted that he won every single state and We win every state and they re going to have this guy Biden be President br Many claims of purported voter fraud were discovered to be false or misleading In Fulton County Georgia the number of votes affected was with no breakdown of which candidates they were for A viral video of a Pennsylvania poll worker filling out a ballot was found to be a case of a damaged ballot being replicated to ensure proper counting while a video claiming to show a man taking ballots illegally to a Detroit counting center was found to show a photographer transporting his equipment Another video of a poll watcher being turned away in Philadelphia was found to be real but the poll watcher had subsequently been allowed inside after a misunderstanding had been resolved A viral tweet claimed votes in Wayne County Michigan were cast by dead people but the list of names included was found to be incorrect The Trump campaign and Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson also claimed a man named James Blalock had voted in Georgia despite having died in but in fact his year old widow had registered and voted as Mrs James Blalock In Erie Pennsylvania a postal worker who claimed the postmaster had instructed postal workers to backdate ballots mailed after Election Day later admitted he had fabricated the claim Prior to this recantation Republican senator Lindsey Graham cited the claim in a letter to the Justice Department calling for an investigation and a GoFundMe page created for the postal worker patriot raised br Days after Biden had been declared the winner White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany asserted without evidence that the Democratic Party was welcoming fraud and illegal voting Republican former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich stated on Fox News I think that it is a corrupt stolen election Appearing at a press conference outside a Philadelphia landscaping business as Biden was being declared the winner Trump s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani asserted without evidence that hundreds of thousands of ballots were questionable Responding to Giuliani a spokesperson for Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said Many of the claims against the commonwealth have already been dismissed and repeating these false attacks is reckless No active lawsuit even alleges and no evidence presented so far has shown widespread problems br One week after the election Republican Philadelphia city commissioner Al Schmidt said he had not seen any evidence of widespread fraud stating I have seen the most fantastical things on social media making completely ridiculous allegations that have no basis in fact at all and see them spread He added that his office had examined a list of dead people who purportedly voted in Philadelphia but not a single one of them voted in Philadelphia after they died Trump derided Schmidt tweeting He refuses to look at a mountain of corruption dishonesty We win br Attorneys who brought accusations of voting fraud or irregularities before judges could not produce valid evidence to support the allegations In one instance a Trump attorney sought to have ballot counting halted in Detroit on the basis of a Republican poll watcher s claim that an unidentified person had said ballots were being backdated Michigan Court of Appeals judge Cynthia Stephens dismissed the argument as inadmissible hearsay within hearsay Some senior attorneys at law firms working for Trump notably Jones Day expressed concerns that they were undermining the integrity of American elections by advancing arguments without evidence br Trump and his lawyers Giuliani and Sidney Powell repeatedly made the false claim that the Toronto Ontario based firm Dominion Voting Systems which had supplied voting machines for states was a communist organization controlled by billionaire George Soros former Venezuelan president Hugo Ch vez who died in or the Chinese Communist Party and that the machines had stolen hundreds of thousands of votes from Trump Defamatory rumors about the company circulated on social media amplified by more than a dozen tweets or retweets by Trump The disinformation campaign prompted threats and harassment against Dominion employees br A December poll showed of Republicans believed widespread fraud occurred during the election along with of independent voters Overall of Americans believed Biden s win was legitimate did not and were unsure Another poll taken in late December showed a similar result with of Americans polled believing Biden was the legitimate winner of the election while did not This split in popular opinion remained largely stable with a January poll commissioned by ABC News showing of Americans believed Biden s win was legitimate and did not These numbers remained largely stagnant with a June poll from Monmouth showing believed Biden won fair and square believed he won due to fraud and were unsure More than a year later public opinion on the matter still remained stagnant with a poll commissioned by ABC News finding that of Americans believed Biden s win was legitimate believed it was not legitimate and were unsure The same poll also found that of Americans thought the people involved in the attack on the U S Capitol on January were attacking democracy while thought they were protecting democracy and were unsure A March poll commissioned by the conservative Rasmussen Reports found that of voters think that it is likely that cheating affected the outcome of the presidential election while of voters believe that it is unlikely say that cheating was very likely say it was somewhat likely say it was somewhat unlikely and say it was very unlikely br Motivated by the myth of widespread fraud Republican state lawmakers initiated a push to make voting laws more restrictive br br br Lawsuits br br After the election the Trump campaign filed lawsuits in multiple states including Georgia Michigan Nevada and Pennsylvania Lawyers and other observers noted the suits were unlikely to affect the outcome Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt said There s literally nothing that I ve seen yet with the meaningful potential to affect the final result br Some law firms moved to drop their representation in lawsuits challenging results of the election br Trump unsuccessfully sought to overturn Biden s win in Georgia through litigation suits by the Trump campaign and allies were rejected by both the Georgia Supreme Court and by federal courts Trump also sought to overturn Biden s win by pressuring Kemp to call a special session of the Georgia General Assembly so state legislators could override the Georgia election results and appoint a pro Trump slate of electors an entreaty rebuffed by Kemp br On December Giuliani filed a petition with the U S Supreme Court asking them to overturn the results of the Pennsylvania election and direct the state legislature to appoint electors The Supreme Court was regarded as very unlikely to grant this petition and in any case Biden would still have a majority of Electoral College votes without Pennsylvania The Court set the deadline for reply briefs from the respondents for January two days after President Elect Biden s inauguration br br br Texas v Pennsylvania br br On December Ken Paxton the Attorney General of Texas filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court asking the court to overturn the results in Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin and Georgia Attorneys general of seventeen other states also signed onto the lawsuit In the House of Representatives Republicans more than two thirds of the Republican caucus signed an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit The suit was rejected by the Supreme Court on December br br br Trump s refusal to concede br br Early in the morning on November with vote counts still going on in many states Trump claimed he had won This is an embarrassment to our country We were getting ready to win this election frankly we did win this election For weeks after the networks had called the election for Biden Trump refused to acknowledge that Biden had won Unlike every losing major party presidential candidate before him Trump refused to formally concede breaking with the tradition of formal concession started in when William Jennings Bryan sent a congratulatory telegram to President elect William McKinley Biden described Trump s refusal as an embarrassment br In the wake of the election Trump s White House ordered government agencies not to cooperate with the Biden transition team in any way and the General Services Administration GSA refused to formally acknowledge Biden s victory br Trump finally acknowledged Biden s victory in a tweet on November although he refused to concede and blamed his loss on fraud stating He won because the Election was Rigged Trump then tweeted I concede NOTHING We have a long way to go br In a June interview with Sean Hannity Trump stated that we didn t win and said that he wished President Biden success in international diplomacy which Forbes declared as Trump coming as close as he s ever been to conceding his election loss br br br GSA delays certifying Biden as president elect br br Although all major media outlets called the election for Biden on November the head of the General Services Administration GSA Trump appointee Emily W Murphy refused for over two weeks to certify Biden as the president elect Without formal GSA ascertainment of the winner the official transition process was delayed On November Murphy acknowledged Biden as the winner and said the Trump administration would begin the transition Trump said he had instructed his administration to do what needs to be done but did not concede and indicated he would continue his fight to overturn the election results br br br Attempts to delay or deny election results br br In November Trump focused his efforts on trying to delay vote certifications at the county and state level On December Trump posted a minute video to his social media in which he repeated his baseless claims that the election was rigged and fraudulent and he called for either state legislatures or courts to overturn the election and allow him to stay in office He continued to pressure elected Republicans in Michigan Georgia and Pennsylvania in an unprecedented attempt to overturn his loss Some commentators have characterized Trump s actions as an attempted coup d tat or self coup br On December the day after the electoral college vote Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell who was previously said he would not recognize the election results publicly accepted Biden s win saying Today I want to congratulate President elect Joe Biden br A December meeting in the White House discussed Michael Flynn s suggestion to overturn the election by invoking martial law and rerunning the election in several swing states under military supervision Army Secretary Ryan D McCarthy and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville later issued a joint statement saying There is no role for the U S military in determining the outcome of an American election In a December tweet Trump dismissed accusations that he wanted to declare martial law as fake news br In a December news conference outgoing attorney general William Barr disavowed several actions reportedly being considered by Trump including seizing voting machines appointing a special counsel to investigate voter fraud and appointing one to investigate Hunter Biden br br br Plot for state legislatures to choose electors br br Both before and after the election Trump and other Republican leaders publicly considered asking certain Republican controlled state legislatures to select presidential electors favoring Trump even if Biden won the popular vote in those states In Pennsylvania a state which Biden won the president s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked a federal judge to consider allowing the Republican controlled state legislature to select electors Legal experts including New York University law professor Richard Pildes have raised numerous legal and political objections to this policy noting that in various battleground states Democratic Party members holding statewide office would thwart such efforts and ultimately Congress would probably reject the votes of legislatively appointed electors over those elected by the voters Law professor Lawrence Lessig noted that while the Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine how electors are selected including the power to directly appoint them Article II Section Clause gives Congress the power to determine when electors must be appointed which they have designated to be Election Day meaning that legislatures cannot change how electors are appointed for an election after this date In modern times most states have used a popular vote within their state as the determining factor in who gets all the state s electors and changing election rules after an election could also violate the Constitution s Due Process Clause br br br Pressure on state and local officials br br As the Trump campaign s lawsuits were repeatedly rejected in court Trump personally communicated with Republican local and state officials in at least three states including state legislators attorneys general and governors who had supported him during and after the elections He pressured them to overturn the election results in their states by recounting votes throwing out certain votes or getting the state legislature to replace the elected Democratic slate of Electoral College members with a Republican slate of electors chosen by the legislature In late November he personally phoned Republican members of two county electoral boards in Michigan urging them to reverse their vote certifications He invited members of the Michigan state legislature to the White House where they declined his suggestion that they choose a new slate of electors He repeatedly spoke to the Republican governor of Georgia and the secretary of state demanding that they reverse their state s election results and retaliating when they did not strongly criticizing them in speeches and tweets and demanding that the governor resign br During the first week of December Trump twice phoned the speaker of the Pennsylvania state House of Representatives urging him to appoint a replacement slate of electors the speaker said he did not have that power but later joined in a letter encouraging the state s representatives in Congress to dispute the results On January The Washington Post reported that in a phone call on January Trump pressured Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state s result telling him I just want to find votes and threatening him with legal action if he did not cooperate On January Democratic congressional leaders believing Trump engaged in solicitation of or conspiracy to commit a number of election crimes requested the FBI to investigate the incident In addition while some House Republicans tried to defend Trump s Georgia call Democrats began drafting a censure resolution Two months later The Washington Post acknowledged that they had misquoted Trump and added a correction to the article Also on January Trump took part in a mass phone call with nearly state legislators from Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in which he urged them to decertify the election results in their states br br br Recounts br br On November Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ordered a statewide hand recount of the vote in addition to the normal audit process At the time Biden held a lead of votes The audit was concluded on November and affirmed Biden s lead by votes Therefore the results of the hand recount netted Trump votes The change in the count was due to a number of human errors including memory cards that did not upload properly to the state servers and was not attributable to any fraud in the original tally After certifying the results Republican governor Brian Kemp called for another hand audit demanding to compare signatures on absentee ballot requests to actual ballots despite the fact that this request was impossible as signatures on mail in ballot applications and envelopes are checked when they are originally received by election offices and that ballots are thereafter separated from envelopes to ensure the secrecy of the ballot The Trump campaign requested a machine recount which was estimated to cost taxpayers in one Georgia county alone On December Biden was confirmed as the winner of the recount requested by Trump s campaign br On November the Trump campaign wired million to pay for partial recounts in Milwaukee County and Dane County Wisconsin where Milwaukee and Madison the two largest cities in the state and Democratic strongholds are located During the recount Milwaukee County election commissioner Tim Posnanski said several Republican observers were breaking rules by posing as independents The recount started November and concluded on November increasing Biden s lead by votes br br br Electoral College votes br The presidential electors met in the state capitol of each state and in the District of Columbia on December and formalized Biden s victory casting votes for Biden Harris and votes for Trump Pence Unlike the election there were no faithless electors In six swing states won by Biden groups of self appointed Republican alternate electors met on the same day to vote for Trump These alternate slates were not signed by the governors of the states they claim to represent did not have the backing of any state legislature and have no legal status br Even after the casting of the electoral votes and rejection of his lawsuits seeking to overturn the election by at least judges Trump refused to concede defeat In a speech following the Electoral College vote Biden praised the resiliency of U S democratic institutions and the high election turnout calling it one of the most amazing demonstrations of civic duty we ve ever seen in our country and called for national unity Biden also condemned Trump and those who backed his efforts to subvert the election outcome for adopting a stance so extreme that we ve never seen it before a position that refused to respect the will of the people refused to respect the rule of law and refused to honor our Constitution and for exposing state election workers and officials to political pressure verbal abuse and even threats of physical violence that was simply unconscionable br br br Certification and January th br br The th United States Congress first convened on January and was scheduled to count and certify the Electoral College votes on January There were Democrats and Republicans in the House there were Republicans Democrats and two independents in the Senate Several Republican members of the House and Senate said they would raise objections to the reported count in several states meeting the requirement that if a member from each body objects the two houses must meet separately to discuss whether to accept the certified state vote A statement from the vice president s office said Pence welcomes the plan by Republicans to raise objections and bring forward evidence challenging the election results br On December Representative Louie Gohmert filed a lawsuit in Texas challenging the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act of claiming Vice President Pence has the power and ability to unilaterally decide which slates of electoral votes get counted The case was dismissed on January for lack of both standing and jurisdiction The plaintiffs filed an appeal and the appeal was dismissed by a three
