genre contributes to child sexual abuse Culture and media scholars generally identify lolicon with a broader separation between fiction and reality within otaku sexuality br br br Definition br br Lolicon is a Japanese abbreviation of Lolita complex ror ta konpurekkusu an English language phrase derived from Vladimir Nabokov s novel Lolita and introduced to Japan in Russell Trainer s The Lolita Complex translated a work of pop psychology in which it is used to denote attraction to pubescent and pre pubescent girls In Japanese the phrase was adopted to describe feelings of love and lust for young girls over adult women which remains the term s common meaning Due to its association with otaku culture the term is more often used to describe desires for young or young looking girl

public Lolicon also refers to works particularly sexually suggestive or erotic which feature such characters and their fans Lolicon is distinct from words for pedophilia y ji zuki and pedofiria clinically sh niseiai and jid seiai and for child pornography jid poruno br The meaning of lolicon within the otaku context developed in the early s during the lolicon boom in erotic manga see History According to Akira Akagi the meaning of lolicon moved away from the sexual pairing of an older man and a young girl and instead came to describe desire for cuteness and girl ness in manga and anime Others defined lolicon as a desire for cute things manga like or anime like characters roundness and the two dimensional as opposed to the real At the time all eroticism in the manga style featuring bish jo cute girl characters was associated with the term and synonyms of Lolita complex included two dimensional complex nijigen konpurekkusu two dimensional fetishism nijikon fechi two dimensional syndrome nijikon sh k gun cute girl syndrome bish jo sh k gun and simply sickness by ki As character body types within erotic manga became more varied by the end of the lolicon boom in the scope of the term narrowed to younger looking depictions br Lolicon became a keyword after the arrest of Tsutomu Miyazaki a serial killer of young girls who was portrayed by the Japanese media as an otaku see History As lolicon was conflated with pedophilia in the public debates on harmful manga its meaning was replaced among otaku by moe which refers to feelings of affection for characters more generally Like moe lolicon is still used by many otaku to refer to attraction which is consciously distinct from reality some otaku identify as two dimensional lolicon nijigen rorikon to specify their attraction to characters The term has become a keyword in criticism of manga and sexuality within Japan as well as globally with the spread of Japanese popular culture br br br History br br br Background br In the s sh jo manga marketed to girls underwent a renaissance in which artists such as those of the Year Group experimented with new narratives and styles and introduced themes such as psychology gender and sexuality These developments attracted adult male fans of sh jo manga who crossed gendered boundaries to produce and consume it The first appearance of the term Lolita complex in manga was in Stumbling Upon a Cabbage Patch an Alice in Wonderland inspired work by Shinji Wada published in a issue of the sh jo manga magazine Bessatsu Margaret where a male character calls Lewis Carroll a man with a strange character of liking only small children in an inside joke to adult readers Early lolicon artwork was influenced by male artists mimicking sh jo manga as well as erotic manga created by female artists for male readers br The image of the sh jo young girl rose to prominence in Japanese mass media in the s as a symbol of cuteness innocence and an idealized Eros attributes which became attached to imagery of younger girls over time Nude photographs of sh jo conceived as fine art gained popularity a photo collection titled Nymphet The Myth of the Year Old was published in and in and there was an Alice boom in nude photos themed around Alice in Wonderland Specialty adult magazines carrying nude photos fiction and essays on the appeal of young girls emerged in the s this trend faded in the late s due to backlash and because many men preferred images of sh jo in manga and anime The spread of such imagery both in photographs and in manga may have been helped by prohibitions on displaying pubic hair under Japan s obscenity laws br br br s s br br The rise of lolicon as a genre began at Comiket Comic Market a convention for the sale of d jinshi self published works founded in by adult male fans of sh jo manga In a group of male artists published the first issue of the fanzine Cybele its standout creator was Hideo Azuma who is known as the Father of Lolicon Prior to Cybele the dominant style in seinen marketed to men and pornographic manga hentai was gekiga characterized by realism sharp angles dark hatching and gritty linework Azuma s manga in contrast displayed light shading and clean circular lines which he viewed as thoroughly erotic and sharing with sh jo manga a lack of reality Azuma s combination of the stout bodies of Osamu Tezuka s works and the emotive faces of sh jo manga marked the advent of the bish jo and the aesthetic of cute eroticism kawaii ero While erotic lolicon manga was initially mainly viewed as humorous and parodic but a large fan base soon grew in response to the alternative to pornographic gekiga that it represented Erotic manga began to move away from combining realistic bodies and cartoony faces towards a wholly unrealistic style Lolicon manga played a role in attracting male fans to Comiket whose participants were percent female in by the proportion of male and female participants was equal Lolicon manga mostly created by and for men served as a response to yaoi manga featuring male homoeroticism mostly created by and for women br The early s saw a lolicon boom in professional and amateur art The popularity of lolicon within the otaku community attracted the attention of publishers who founded specialty publications dedicated to the genre such as Lemon People and Manga Burikko both in Other magazines of the boom included Manga Hot Milk Melon Comic and Halfliter The genre s rise was closely linked to the concurrent development of otaku culture and growing fan consciousness the word otaku itself was coined in Burikko in Originally founded as an unprofitable gekiga magazine the publication was transformed into a lolicon magazine in by editor Eiji tsuka whose intention was to publish sh jo manga for boys Reflecting the influence of sh jo manga there was an increasingly small place in lolicon artwork for realistic characters and explicit depictions of sex in Burikko s editors yielded to reader demands by removing photographs of gravure idol models from its opening pages publishing an issue with the subtitle Totally Bish jo Comic Magazine Lolicon magazines regularly published female artists such as Kyoko Okazaki and Erika Sakurazawa and male artists such as Aki Uchiyama dubbed the King of Lolicon who produced pages of manga per month to meet demand Uchiyama s works were published both in niche magazines such as Lemon People and in the mainstream Sh nen Champion The first ever pornographic anime series was Lolita Anime an OVA released episodically in and br br Iconic characters of the lolicon boom include Clarisse from the film Lupin III Castle of Cagliostro and Lana from the TV series Future Boy Conan both directed by Hayao Miyazaki Clarisse was especially popular and inspired a series of articles discussing her appeal in the anime specialty magazines Gekkan Out Animec and Animage as well as a trend of fan works dubbed Clarisse magazines which were not explicitly sexual but instead fairytale esque and girly in nature Many early lolicon works combined mecha and bish jo elements the premiere of the Daicon III Opening Animation at the Japan SF Convention is one notable example of the prominence of science fiction and lolicon in the nascent otaku culture of the time Anime shows targeted at young girls with young girl heroines such as Magical Princess Minky Momo gained new viewership from adult male fans who started fan clubs and were courted by creators br The lolicon boom in commercial erotic manga only lasted until Near the end of the boom because readers had no attachment to lolicon per se and did not take young girls as objects of sexual desire a majority of readers and creators of erotic manga moved towards the diversifying bish jo works featuring baby faced and big breasted characters which were no longer considered lolicon At Comiket lolicon manga declined in popularity by following developments in erotic d jinshi including new genres of fetishism and the growing popularity of softcore erotica popular with men and women particularly in yuri manga featuring lesbian themes br br br s present br In lolicon and otaku became the subject of a media frenzy and moral panic after the arrest of Tsutomu Miyazaki a young man who had kidnapped and murdered four girls between the ages of four and seven and committed sexual acts with their corpses Widely disseminated photos of Miyazaki s room revealed an extensive collection of video tapes which included horror slasher films on which he had modelled some of his crimes and manga including sh jo and lolicon works In the extended public debates that followed Miyazaki s crimes were blamed on supposed media effects namely a reduction in his inhibitions to crime and a blurring of the lines between fiction and reality Miyazaki was labelled as an otaku and an image of otaku as socially and sexually immature men and for some as pedophiles and potential predators was established for much of the public The decade saw local crackdowns on retailers and publishers of harmful manga and the arrests of some manga artists Despite this lolicon imagery expanded and became more acceptable within manga in the s and the early s saw a small boom in the genre sparked by the magazine Comic LO br br br Media br Lolicon media is loosely defined Some define its characters by age while others define its characters by appearance those which are small and flat chested independent of age Lolicon works often depict girl characters as innocent precocious and sometimes flirtatious characters may appear in borderline or outright sexual situations though the term can be applied to works with neither According to Kaoru Nagayama manga readers define lolicon works as those with a heroine younger than a middle school student a definition which can vary from characters under age for society at large to characters younger than gradeschool aged for fanatics and to kindergarteners for more pedophiliac readers Girl characters in lolicon can display a contradictory performance of age in which their body behavior and role in a story conflict for example lolibaba Lolita granny characters speak and behave with the mannerisms of older women Curvy hips and other secondary sex characteristics similarly appear as features in many of the genre s characters Plot devices often explain the young appearance of characters who are non human or actually much older br Akira Akagi identifies themes in lolicon manga including sadomasochism groping objects alien tentacles or robots in the role of the penis mecha fetishes combinations of a machine and a girl erotic parodies of mainstream manga and anime and simply indecent or perverted stuff also noting common themes of lesbianism and masturbation Media scholar Setsu Shigematsu argues that forms of substitution and mimicry enable lolicon to transform straight sex into a parodic form More extreme works depict themes including coercion rape incest bondage and hermaphroditism Nagayama argues that most pornographic lolicon manga deal with a consciousness of sin or a sense of taboo and guilt in its consumption Some manga manage this by portraying the girl as enjoying the experience in the end while others represent the girl as the active partner in sex who seduces men to her Other lolicon manga where men are absolute evil and girls are pitiable victims indulge in the pleasure of sin through the breaking of taboos which he argues affirms the fragility of the characters He posits that manga depicting sex between children avoid the consciousness of sin via mutual innocence while also thematizing nostalgia and an idealized past while other lolicon manga accomplish this through characters with especially unrealistic and moe designs where it is precisely because fiction is distinguished from reality as fiction that one can experience moe br Lolicon manga often published as d jinshi or compiled in anthology magazines is mostly consumed by male audiences though Nagayama notes that the works of Hiraku Machida have resonated with female readers and earned the support of women Other notable artists include Aguda Wanyan Takarada Gorgeous and female creators Erika Wada and Fumio Kagami Lolicon imagery is a prominent theme in Superflat a manga influenced art movement founded by Takashi Murakami Superflat artists whose works incorporate lolicon include Mr and Henmaru Machino br br br Relation to moe br In the s lolicon imagery evolved and contributed to the mainstream development of moe the generalized affective response to fictional characters typically bish jo characters in manga anime and computer games and its associated design elements The bish jo character form moved from niche otaku publications to mainstream manga magazines and saw explosive popularity in the decade with the rise of bish jo games and anime series such as Sailor Moon and Neon Genesis Evangelion which pioneered media and merchandising based on fan affection for their female protagonists Moe characters which tend to be physically immature girl characters exemplified by cuteness are ubiquitous in contemporary manga and anime In contrast to lolicon sexuality in moe is treated indirectly or not at all the moe response is often defined with emphasis on platonic love John Oppliger of AnimeNation identifies Ro Kyu Bu Kodomo no Jikan and Moetan as examples of series which challenge the distinction between moe and lolicon through use of sexual innuendo commenting that they satire the chaste sanctity of the mo phenomenon and poke fun at viewers and the arbitrary delineations that viewers assert Moe style lolicon works depict mild eroticism such as glimpses of underwear and forgo explicit sex br br br Legality br br Child pornography laws in some countries including the United States the United Kingdom Canada Australia and New Zealand have expanded since the s to include sexually explicit depictions of fictional child characters while those in other countries including Japan exclude fiction from relevant definitions In Japan passed a national law criminalizing the production and distribution of child pornography The law s original draft included depictions of fictional children in its definition of child pornography after criticism from many in Japan this text was removed in the final version In Japan s parliament amended the law to criminalize possession of child pornography the draft introduced by the Liberal Democratic Party LDP which maintained the existing legal definition included a provision for a government investigation on whether manga anime and computer generated images similar to child pornography were connected to child sexual abuse which would be followed by a later decision on regulation This provision was opposed by manga related organizations including the Japan Cartoonists Association which argued that regulation would infringe upon freedom of expression and negatively impact the industry The provision was removed from the final version of the law which took effect in br Lolicon media is a common target of local ordinances in Japan which restrict distribution of materials designated harmful to the healthy development of youth which were strengthened throughout the s and s An amendment proposed in to the Tokyo law on material banned from sale to minors described by Vice Governor Naoki Inose as targeting non pornographic lolicon manga writing that We had regulation for eromanga but not for lolicon restricted depictions of non existent youths who appeared under age and were portrayed in anti social sexual situations After heavy opposition from manga creators academics and fans the bill was rejected in June by the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly however a new revision passed in December which restricts manga anime and computer games where any characters engage in sexual or pseudo sexual acts that would be illegal in real life depicted in a way that glorifies or exaggerates such acts In several manga were listed for restriction including Oku sama wa Sh gakusei My Wife Is an Elementary Student it was published online by J Comi avoiding restriction br Sexualized depictions of young girl characters have also been subject to censorship and restriction outside of Japan In North American publisher Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the manga series Kodomo no Jikan for release under the title Nymphet but cancelled its plans in after vendor cancellations In a statement the company stated that the manga cannot be considered appropriate for the US market by any reasonable standard In Australian senator Stirling Griff criticized the Australian Classification Board for giving ratings to manga and anime depicting child exploitation and called for a review of classification regulations later that year the board banned the import and sale of three volumes of the light novel series No Game No Life for sexual depiction of young characters Some online platforms including Discord Reddit and Twitter ban lolicon content br br br Debate br Explaining the exclusion of lolicon material from the child pornography law amendment an LDP lawmaker stated that manga anime and CG child pornography don t directly violate the rights of girls or boys and that it has not been scientifically validated that it even indirectly causes damage Manga creators and activists argue that the Japanese constitution guarantees artistic freedom of expression and that laws restricting lolicon material would be unconstitutional Statistically sexual abuse of minors in Japan has declined since the s and s as the prevalence of lolicon media has increased cultural anthropologist Patrick W Galbraith interprets this as evidence that lolicon imagery does not necessarily influence crimes while Steven Smet suggests that lolicon is an exorcism of fantasies that contributes to Japan s low crime rates Drawing on his fieldwork Galbraith argues that otaku culture collectively promotes media literacy and an ethical position of separating fiction and reality especially when the conflation of the two would be dangerous A report by the Sexologisk Klinik for the Danish government found no evidence that individuals that view cartoons and drawings depicting fictitious child sexual abuse are more likely to engage in child sexual abuse in the real world Sharalyn Orbaugh argues that manga depicting underage sexuality can help victims of child sexual abuse to work through their own trauma and that there is greater harm in regulating sexual expression than potential harm caused by such manga br Legal scholar Hiroshi Nakasatomi argues that lolicon material can distort consumers sexual desires and induce crime a view shared by the non profit organization CASPAR whose founder Kondo Mitsue argues that freedom of expression does not allow for the depiction of little girls being violently raped depriving them of their basic human rights Some critics such as the non profit organization Lighthouse argue that lolicon works can be used for sexual grooming and that they encourage a culture which accepts sexual abuse of children In the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Sale and Sexual Exploitation of Children Maud de Boer Buquicchio called for further discussion and research on manga depicting extreme child pornography and a resultant banalization of child sexual abuse in Japan and called for a ban on such material Guidelines released in by the United Nations Human Rights Committee encouraged state parties to include explicit drawings of fictional children in laws against child pornography in particular when such representations are used as part of a process to sexually exploit children Feminist critic Kuniko Funabashi argues that the themes of lolicon material contribute to sexual violence by portraying girls passively and by presenting the female body as the man s possession Legal scholar Shin ichir Harata argues that child pornography laws should not collapse reality and fiction together but also that fans should not dismiss an ambivalence represented by lolicon He describes the practice of keeping the two separated as the ethics of moe or responsibility of otaku br br br Analysis br Culture and media scholars responding to lolicon generally identify it as distinct from attraction to real young girls Cultural anthropologist Patrick W Galbraith finds that from early writings to the present researchers suggest that lolicon artists are playing with symbols and working with tropes which does not reflect or contribute to sexual pathology or crime Psychologist Tamaki Sait who has conducted clinical work with otaku highlights an estrangement of lolicon desires from reality as part of a distinction for otaku between textual and actual sexuality and observes that the vast majority of otaku are not pedophiles in actual life Manga researcher Yukari Fujimoto argues that lolicon desire is not for a child but for the image itself and that this is understood by those brought up in Japan s culture of drawing and fantasy Sociologist Mark McLelland identifies lolicon and yaoi as self consciously anti realist genres given a rejection by fans and creators of three dimensionality in favor of two dimensionality and compares lolicon to the yaoi fandom in which fans consume depictions of homosexuality which lack any correspondent in the real world Setsu Shigematsu argues that lolicon reflects a shift in erotic investment from reality to two dimensional figures of desire Queer theorist Yuu Matsuura criticizes the classification of lolicon works as child pornography as an expression of human oriented sexualism which marginalizes fictosexuality or nijikon br Many scholars also identify lolicon as a form of self expression on the part of its male creators and consumers Sociologist Sharon Kinsella suggests that for lolicon fans the infantilized female object of desire has crossed over to become an aspect of their own self image and sexuality Akira Akagi argues that lolicon manga represented a notable shift in reader identification from the hero penetrator common to pornographic gekiga Lolicon readers do not need a penis for pleasure but rather they need the ecstasy of the girl They identify with the girl and get caught up in a masochistic pleasure Manga critic G It views this as an abstract desire quoting a lolicon artist who told him that he was the girl who is raped in his manga reflecting a feeling of being raped by society or by the world Kaoru Nagayama posits that lolicon readers adopt a fluid perspective that alternates between that of an omniscient voyeur and the multiple characters in a work reflecting an active reader role and a projection onto girl characters Writing in The Book of Otaku feminist Chizuko Ueno argued that lolicon as an orientation towards fictional bish jo is completely different from pedophilia and characterized it as a desire to be part of the cute world of sh jo for male fans of sh jo manga who find it too much to be a man br Several scholars identify the emergence of lolicon with changes in Japanese gender relations Sociologist Kimio It attributes the rise of lolicon manga to a shift in the s and s when boys driven by a feeling that girls were surpassing them in terms of willpower and action turned to the world of imagination in which young girl characters are easy to control Kinsella interprets lolicon as part of a gaze of both fear and desire stimulated by the growing power of women in society and as a reactive desire to see the sh jo infantilized undressed and subordinate Media scholar Chizuko Nait views lolicon as reflecting a broader societal desire for young girls as sex symbols in Japan which she calls a loliconized society Cultural anthropologist Christine Yano argues that eroticized imagery of the sh jo real or fictive reflects heteronormative pedophilia in which emphasis is placed on the ephemerality of childhood it is as child that the sh jo becomes precious as a transitory figure threatened by impending adulthood
