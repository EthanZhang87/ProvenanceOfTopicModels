origin of the first Diablo came from David Brevik while at Condor Games around Brevik was heavily inspired by the roguelike genre with turn based combat but with simplified role playing game elements and a more expansive loot system The name Diablo was based on Mount Diablo which was where Brevik lived when he conceived the game idea Condor was working alongside Blizzard Entertainment at the time on a separate title Blizzard offered to help develop Brevik s idea as it shared concepts with their recent Warcraft Orcs Humans but strongly urged that they convert the game from turn based to real time combat as well as later urging the including of multiplayer over their new Battle net service Over the course of development Blizzard acquired Condor Games with Condor located in San Mateo California becoming Blizzard North while Blizzard s main offices in Irvine California became Blizzard South Diablo was released in January br Diablo was a top selling game in with over a million

have improved the game from this initial take br br br Gameplay br Maps for the in game world are randomly generated in each Diablo game which increases the replayability Due to its procedurally generated maps and hack and slash nature Diablo shares some similar mechanics as early roguelike games though with real time gameplay graphics and sound It was in fact originally conceived and pitched to Blizzard as what amounted to a graphical roguelike The adventurer being based in a town above the dungeon and being able to use scrolls of town portal is a specific influence from Moria The
