title: Holocaust denial
id: 65651
Holocaust denial is an antisemitic conspiracy theory that asserts that the Nazi genocide of Jews known as the Holocaust is a fabrication or exaggeration Holocaust denial includes making one or more of the following false claims br br Nazi Germany s Final Solution was aimed only at deporting Jews from the territory of the Third Reich and did not include their extermination br Nazi authorities did not use extermination camps and gas chambers for the mass murder of Jews br The actual number of Jews murdered is significantly lower than the accepted figure of approximately six million br The Holocaust is a hoax perpetrated by the Allies Jews or the Soviet Union br The methodologies of Holocaust deniers are based on a predetermined conclusion that ignores overwhelming historical evidence to the contrary Scholars use the term denial to describe the views and methodology of Holocaust deniers in order to distinguish them from legitimate historical revisionists who challenge orthodox interpretations of history using established historical methodologies Holocaust deniers generally do not accept denial as an appropriate description of their activities and use the euphemism revisionism instead In some former Eastern Bloc countries Holocaust deniers do not deny the mass murder of Jews but deny the participation of their own nationals in the Holocaust br Holocaust denial is considered a serious societal problem in many places where it occurs and it is illegal in Canada Israel and many European countries br br br Terminology and etymology br Holocaust deniers prefer to refer to their work as historical revisionism and object to being referred to as deniers Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt has written that The deniers selection of the name revisionist to describe themselves is indicative of their basic strategy of deceit and distortion and of their attempt to portray themselves as legitimate historians engaged in the traditional practice of illuminating the past Scholars consider this misleading since the methods of Holocaust denial differ from those of legitimate historical revision Legitimate historical revisionism is explained in a resolution adopted by the Duke University History Department November and reprinted in Duke Chronicle November in response to an advertisement produced by Bradley R Smith s Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust br br That historians are constantly engaged in historical revision is certainly correct however what historians do is very different from this advertisement Historical revision of major events is not concerned with the actuality of these events rather it concerns their historical interpretation their causes and consequences generally br Lipstadt writes that modern Holocaust denial draws its inspiration from various sources including a school of thought which used an established method to question government policies br In Donald L Niewyk gave some examples of how legitimate historical revisionism the re examination of accepted history and its updating with newly discovered more accurate or less biased information may be applied to the study of the Holocaust as new facts emerge to change the historical understanding of it br br With the main features of the Holocaust clearly visible to all but the willfully blind historians have turned their attention to aspects of the story for which the evidence is incomplete or ambiguous These are not minor matters by any means but turn on such issues as Hitler s role in the event Jewish responses to persecution and reactions by onlookers both inside and outside Nazi controlled Europe br In contrast the Holocaust denial movement bases its approach on the predetermined idea that the Holocaust as understood by mainstream historiography did not occur Sometimes referred to as negationism from the French term n gationnisme introduced by Henry Rousso Holocaust deniers attempt to rewrite history by minimizing denying or simply ignoring essential facts Koenraad Elst writes br br Negationism means the denial of historical crimes against humanity It is not a reinterpretation of known facts but the denial of known facts The term negationism has gained currency as the name of a movement to deny a specific crime against humanity the Nazi genocide on the Jews in also known as the Holocaust Greek complete burning or the Shoah Hebrew disaster Negationism is mostly identified with the effort at re writing history in such a way that the fact of the Holocaust is omitted br In Secondary Anti Semitism From Hard Core to Soft Core Denial of the Shoah Clemens Heni writes br br Contrary to the hard core version soft core denial is often not easily identifiable Often it is tolerated or even encouraged and reproduced in the mainstream not only in Germany Scholars have only recently begun to unravel this disturbing phenomenon Manfred Gerstenfeld discusses Holocaust trivialization in an article published in In Germany in two scholars Thorsten Eitz and Georg St tzel published a voluminous dictionary of German language and discourse regarding National Socialism and the Holocaust It includes chapters on Holocaust trivialization and contrived comparisons such as the infamous atomic Holocaust Babycaust Holocaust of abortion red Holocaust or biological Holocaust br br br Background br br br Denial as a means of genocide br Lawrence Douglas argues that denial was invented by the perpetrators and employed as a means of genocide For example trucks of Zyklon B were labeled with Red Cross symbols and victims were told that they would be resettled Douglas also cites the Posen speeches as an example of denial while genocide was ongoing with Himmler referring to the Holocaust as an unnamed and never to be named page of glory According to Douglas the denial of mass murder using gas chambers recalls the Nazi efforts to persuade the victims that they were actually harmless showers br br br Efforts to conceal the historical record br br br German efforts br br While the Second World War was still underway the Nazis had already formed a contingency plan that if defeat was imminent they would carry out the total destruction of German records Historians have documented evidence that as Germany s defeat became imminent and Nazi leaders realized they would most likely be captured and brought to trial great effort was made to destroy all evidence of mass extermination Heinrich Himmler instructed his camp commandants to destroy records crematoria and other signs of mass extermination As one of many examples the bodies of the mostly Latvian Jews whom Friedrich Jeckeln and the soldiers under his command had shot at Rumbula near Riga in late were dug up and burned in Similar operations were undertaken at Belzec Treblinka and other death camps br br br French collaboration in archive destruction br In occupied France the situation with respect to preserving war records was not much better partly as a result of French state secrecy rules dating back to well before the war aimed at protecting the French government and the state from embarrassing revelations and partly to avoid culpability For example at Liberation the Prefecture of Police destroyed nearly all of the massive archive of Jewish arrest and deportation br br br Efforts to preserve the historical record br br br During the war br One of the earliest efforts to save historical record of the Holocaust occurred during the war in France where Drancy internment camp records were carefully preserved and turned over to the new National Office for Veterans and Victims of War however the bureau then held them in secret refusing to release copies later even to the Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation CDJC br In Isaac Schneersohn anticipating the need for a center to document and preserve the memory of the persecution for historical reasons and also support claims post war gathered together representatives from Jewish organizations in Grenoble which was under Italian occupation at the time in order to form a center de documentation Exposure meant the death penalty and as a result little actually happened before liberation Serious work began after the center moved to Paris in late and was renamed the CDJC br br br Immediate post war period br br In General Dwight D Eisenhower Supreme Allied Commander anticipated that someday an attempt would be made to recharacterize the documentation of Nazi crimes as propaganda and took steps against it Eisenhower upon finding the victims of Nazi concentration camps ordered all possible photographs to be taken and for the German people from surrounding villages to be ushered through the camps and made to bury the dead br br br Nuremberg trials br br The Nuremberg trials took place in Germany after the war in The stated aim was to dispense justice in retribution for atrocities of the German government This Allied intention to administer justice post war was first announced in in the Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe and reiterated at the Yalta Conference and at Berlin in While the intention was not specifically to preserve the historical record of the Holocaust some of the core documents required to prosecute the cases were provided to them by the CDJC and much of the huge trove of archives were then transferred to the CDJC after the trials and became the core of future Holocaust historiography br The Nuremberg trials were important historically but the events were still very recent television was in its infancy and not present and there was little public impact There were isolated moments of limited public awareness from Hollywood films such as The Diary of Anne Frank or the Judgment at Nuremberg which had some newsreel footage of actual scenes from liberated Nazi concentration camps including scenes of piles of naked corpses laid out in rows and bulldozed into large pits which was considered exceptionally graphic for the time br Public awareness changed when the Eichmann trial riveted the world s attention fifteen years after Nuremberg br br br Trial of Adolf Eichmann br br In the Israeli government captured Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and brought him to Israel to stand trial for war crimes Chief prosecutor Gideon Hausner s intentions were not only to demonstrate Eichmann s guilt personally but to present material about the entire Holocaust thus producing a comprehensive record br The Israeli government arranged for the trial to have prominent media coverage Many major newspapers from all over the globe sent reporters and published front page coverage of the story Israelis had the opportunity to watch live television broadcasts of the proceedings and videotape was flown daily to the United States for broadcast the following day br br br Significant individuals and organizations br br In the immediate aftermath of the war prior to the extensive documentation efforts by the Allied forces a sense of disbelief caused many to deny the initial reports of the Holocaust Compounding this disbelief was the memory of forged newspaper accounts of the German Corpse Factory an anti German atrocity propaganda campaign during WWI which was widely known to be false by br During the s the Nazi government used this propaganda against the British claiming allegations of concentration camps were malicious lies put forward by the British government and historians Joachim Neander and Randal Marlin note that this story encouraged later disbelief when early reports circulated about the Holocaust under Hitler Victor Cavendish Bentinck chairman of the British Joint Intelligence Committee noted that these reports were similar to stories of employment of human corpses during the last war for the manufacture of fat which was a grotesque lie likewise The Christian Century commented that The parallel between this story and the corpse factory atrocity tale of the First World War is too striking to be overlooked Neander notes that There can be no doubt that the reported commercial use of the corpses of the murdered Jews undermined the credibility of the news coming from Poland and delayed action that might have rescued many Jewish lives br The Neo Nazi movement has been revitalized by Holocaust denial Small but vocal numbers of Neo Nazis realized that recreation of a Hitlerite style regime may be impossible but a replica might be produced in the future the rehabilitation of Nazism they concluded required the discrediting of the Holocaust Neo fascism has likewise relied upon Holocaust denial as a means of rehabilitation br As a movement modern Holocaust denial is associated with historical revisionism based on pseudoscientific evidence and fringe academic networks including intradiegetic pseudoscientific journals conferences and professional organizations e g Journal of Historical Review International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust br br br Maurice Bard che br The first person to openly write after the end of World War II that he doubted the reality of the Holocaust was French journalist Maurice Bard che in his book Nuremberg ou la Terre promise Nuremberg or the Promised Land Viewed as the father figure of Holocaust denial Bard che introduced in his works many aspects of neo fascist and Holocaust denial propaganda techniques and ideological structures his work is deemed influential in regenerating post war European far right ideas at a time of identity crisis in the s His arguments formed the basis of numerous works of Holocaust denial that followed testimonies are not reliable essentially coming from the mouth of Jews and communists atrocities committed in camps were the work of deportees essentially the kapos disorganization occurred in Nazi camps following the first German defeats the high mortality is due to the weakening of prisoners and epidemics only lice were gassed in Auschwitz etc br br br Harry Elmer Barnes br Harry Elmer Barnes at one time a mainstream American historian assumed a Holocaust denial stance in his later years Between World War I and World War II Barnes was an anti war writer and a leader of the historical revisionism movement Starting in Barnes worked closely with the Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War a German government funded think tank whose sole purpose was to disseminate the official government position that Germany was the victim of Allied aggression in and that the Versailles Treaty was morally invalid Headed by Major Alfred von Wegerer a v lkisch activist the organization portrayed itself as a scholarly society but historians later described it as a clearinghouse for officially desirable views on the outbreak of the war br Following World War II Barnes became convinced that allegations made against Germany and Japan including the Holocaust were wartime propaganda that had been used to justify the United States involvement in World War II Barnes claimed that there were two false claims made about World War II namely that Germany started the war in and the Holocaust which Barnes claimed did not happen br In his pamphlet Revisionism and Brainwashing Barnes claimed that there was a lack of any serious opposition or concerted challenge to the atrocity stories and other modes of defamation of German national character and conduct Barnes argued that there was a failure to point out the atrocities of the Allies were more brutal painful mortal and numerous than the most extreme allegations made against the Germans He claimed that in order to justify the horrors and evils of the Second World War the Allies made the Nazis the scapegoat for their own misdeeds br Barnes cited the French Holocaust denier Paul Rassinier whom Barnes called a distinguished French historian who had exposed the exaggerations of the atrocity stories In a article Zionist Fraud published in the American Mercury Barnes wrote The courageous author Rassinier lays the chief blame for misrepresentation on those whom we must call the swindlers of the crematoria the Israeli politicians who derive billions of marks from nonexistent mythical and imaginary cadavers whose numbers have been reckoned in an unusually distorted and dishonest manner Using Rassinier as his source Barnes claimed that Germany was the victim of aggression in both and and that reports of the Holocaust were propaganda to justify a war of aggression against Germany br br br Beginnings of modern denialism br In a prot g of Barnes David Hoggan published Der erzwungene Krieg The Forced War in West Germany which claimed that Germany had been the victim of an Anglo Polish conspiracy in Though Der erzwungene Krieg was primarily concerned with the origins of World War II it also down played or justified the effects of Nazi antisemitic measures in the pre period For example Hoggan justified the huge one billion Reichsmark fine imposed on the entire Jewish community in Germany after the Kristallnacht as a reasonable measure to prevent what he called Jewish profiteering at the expense of German insurance companies and alleged that no Jews were killed in the Kristallnacht in fact German Jews were murdered in the Kristallnacht Subsequently Hoggan explicitly denied the Holocaust in in a book entitled The Myth of the Six Million which was published by the Noontide Press a small Los Angeles publisher specializing in antisemitic literature br In Paul Rassinier published The Drama of the European Jews Rassinier was himself a concentration camp survivor he was held in Buchenwald for having helped French Jews escape the Nazis and modern day deniers continue to cite his works as scholarly research that questions the accepted facts of the Holocaust Critics argued that Rassinier did not cite evidence for his claims and ignored information that contradicted his assertions he nevertheless remains influential in Holocaust denial circles for being one of the first deniers to propose that a vast Zionist Allied Soviet conspiracy faked the Holocaust a theme that would be picked up in later years by other authors br Austin App a La Salle University medieval English literature professor is considered the first major mainstream American holocaust denier App defended the Germans and Nazi Germany during World War II He published numerous articles letters and books on Holocaust denial quickly building a loyal following App s work inspired the Institute for Historical Review a California center founded in whose sole task is the denial of the Holocaust br The publication of Arthur Butz s The Hoax of the Twentieth Century The case against the presumed extermination of European Jewry in and David Irving s Hitler s War in brought other similarly inclined individuals into the fold Butz was a tenured associate professor of electrical engineering at Northwestern University In December and January Robert Faurisson a French professor of literature at the University of Lyon wrote two letters to Le Monde claiming that the gas chambers used by the Nazis to exterminate the Jews did not exist A colleague of Faurisson Jean Claude Pressac who initially shared Faurisson s views later became convinced of the Holocaust s evidence while investigating documents at Auschwitz in He published his conclusions along with much of the underlying evidence in his book Auschwitz Technique and operation of the gas chambers br Henry Bienen the former president of Northwestern University has described Arthur Butz s view of the Holocaust as an embarrassment to Northwestern In sixty of Butz s colleagues from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science faculty signed a censure describing Butz s Holocaust denial as an affront to our humanity and our standards as scholars The letter also called for Butz to leave our Department and our University and stop trading on our reputation for academic excellence br br br Institute for Historical Review br In the American far right activist Willis Carto founded the Institute for Historical Review IHR an organization dedicated to publicly challenging the commonly accepted history of the Holocaust The IHR s founding was inspired by Austin App a La Salle professor of medieval English literature and considered the first major American holocaust denier The IHR sought from the beginning to establish itself within the broad tradition of historical revisionism by soliciting token supporters who were not from a neo Nazi background such as James J Martin and Samuel Edward Konkin III and by promoting the writings of French socialist Paul Rassinier and American anti war historian Harry Elmer Barnes in an attempt to show that Holocaust denial had a base of support beyond neo Nazis The IHR republished most of Barnes s writings which had been out of print since his death While it included articles on other topics and sold books by mainstream historians the majority of material published and distributed by IHR was devoted to questioning the facts surrounding the Holocaust br In the IHR promised a reward to anyone who could prove that Jews were gassed at Auschwitz Mel Mermelstein wrote a letter to the editors of the Los Angeles Times and others including The Jerusalem Post The IHR wrote back offering him for proof that Jews were in fact gassed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz Mermelstein in turn submitted a notarized account of his internment at Auschwitz and how he witnessed Nazi guards ushering his mother and two sisters and others towards as he learned later gas chamber number five Despite this the IHR refused to pay the reward Represented by public interest attorney William John Cox Mermelstein subsequently sued the IHR in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County for breach of contract anticipatory repudiation libel injurious denial of established fact intentional infliction of emotional distress and declaratory relief On October both parties in the Mermelstein case filed motions for summary judgment in consideration of which Judge Thomas T Johnson of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County took judicial notice of the fact that Jews were gassed to death at the Auschwitz Concentration Camp in Poland during the summer of judicial notice meaning that the court treated the gas chambers as common knowledge and therefore did not require evidence that the gas chambers existed On August Judge Robert A Wenke entered a judgment based upon the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment agreed upon by the parties on July The judgment required IHR and other defendants to pay to Mermelstein and to issue a letter of apology to Mr Mel Mermelstein a survivor of Auschwitz Birkenau and Buchenwald and all other survivors of Auschwitz for pain anguish and suffering caused to them br In the About the IHR statement on their website the IHR states The IHR does not deny the Holocaust Indeed the IHR as such has no position on any specific event British historian Richard J Evans wrote that the Institute s acknowledgment that a relatively small number of Jews were killed was a means to draw attention away from its primary beliefs i e that the number of victims was not in the millions and that Jews were not systematically murdered in gas chambers br br br James Keegstra br br In James Keegstra a Canadian high school teacher was charged under the Canadian Criminal Code for promoting hatred against an identifiable group by communicating anti Semitic statements to his students During class he would describe Jews as a people of profound evil who had created the Holocaust to gain sympathy He also tested his students in exams on his theories and opinion of Jews br Keegstra was charged under s of the Criminal Code now s which provides that Every one who by communicating statements other than in private conversation wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group commits a criminal offense He was convicted at trial before the Alberta Court of Queen s Bench The court rejected the argument advanced by Keegstra and his lawyer Doug Christie that promoting hatred is a constitutionally protected freedom of expression as per s b of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Keegstra appealed to the Alberta Court of Appeal That court agreed with Keegstra and he was acquitted The Crown then appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada which ruled by a majority that promoting hatred could be justifiably restricted under s of the Charter The Supreme Court restored Keegstra s conviction He was fired from his teaching position shortly afterward br br br Z ndel trials br br The Toronto based photo retoucher Ernst Z ndel operated a small press called Samisdat Publishers which published and distributed Holocaust denial material such as Did Six Million Really Die by Richard Harwood a pseudonym of Richard Verrall a British neo Nazi In he was tried in R v Zundel and convicted under a false news law and sentenced to months imprisonment by an Ontario court for disseminating and publishing material denying the Holocaust The Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg was a witness for the prosecution at the trial Z ndel s conviction was overturned in an appeal on a legal technicality leading to a second trial in in which he was again convicted The trial included as witnesses for the defense Fred A Leuchter David Irving and Robert Faurisson The pseudo scientific Leuchter report was presented as a defense document and was published in Canada in by Zundel s Samisdat Publishers and in Britain in by Irving s Focal Point Publishing In both of his trials Z ndel was defended by Douglas Christie and Barbara Kulaszka His conviction was overturned in when the Supreme Court of Canada declared the false news law unconstitutional br Z ndel had a website web mastered by his wife Ingrid which publicized his viewpoints In January the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal delivered a ruling in a complaint involving his website in which it was found to be contravening the Canadian Human Rights Act The court ordered Z ndel to cease communicating hate messages In February the American INS arrested him in Tennessee US on an immigration violations matter and few days later Z ndel was sent back to Canada where he tried to gain refugee status Z ndel remained in prison until March when he was deported to Germany and prosecuted for disseminating hate propaganda On February Z ndel was convicted on counts of incitement under Germany s Volksverhetzung law which bans the incitement of hatred against a portion of the population and given the maximum sentence of five years in prison br br br Bradley Smith and the CODOH br In Bradley R Smith a former media director of the Institute for Historical Review founded the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust CODOH In the United States CODOH has repeatedly attempted to place advertisements questioning whether the Holocaust happened especially in college campus newspapers br Bradley Smith took his message to college students with little success Smith referred to his tactics as the CODOH campus project He said I don t want to spend time with adults anymore I want to go to students They are superficial They are empty vessels to be filled What I wanted to do was I wanted to set forth three or four ideas that students might be interested in that might cause them to think about things or to have questions about things And I wanted to make it as simple as possible and to set it up in a way that could not really be debated Holocaust deniers have placed Full page advertisements in college and university newspapers including those of Brandeis University Boston College Pennsylvania State University and Queens College Some of these ads arguing that the Holocaust never happened ran without comment others generated op ed pieces by professors and students On September student newspaper The Harvard Crimson ran a paid ad from Bradley R Smith It was quickly criticized and the editor issued an apology saying publishing the ad was a mistake br br br Ernst Nolte br The German philosopher and historian Ernst Nolte starting in the s advanced a set of theories which though not denying the Holocaust appeared to flirt with an Italian Holocaust denier Carlo Mattogno as a serious historian In a letter to the Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka of December Nolte criticized the work of the French Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson on the ground that the Holocaust did occur but went on to argue that Faurisson s work was motivated by what Nolte claimed were the admirable motives of sympathy towards the Palestinians and opposition to Israel In his book Der europ ische B rgerkrieg The European Civil War Nolte claimed that the intentions of Holocaust deniers are often honourable and that some of their claims are not obviously without foundation Nolte himself though he has never denied the occurrence of the Holocaust has claimed that the Wannsee Conference of never happened and that the minutes of the conference were post war forgeries done by biased Jewish historians designed to discredit Germany br The British historian Ian Kershaw has argued that Nolte was operating on the borderlines of Holocaust denial with his implied claim that the negative myth of Nazi Germany was created by Jewish historians his allegations of the domination of Holocaust scholarship by biased Jewish historians and his statements that one should withhold judgment on Holocaust deniers whom Nolte takes considerable pains to stress are not exclusively Germans or fascists In Kershaw s opinion Nolte is attempting to imply that perhaps Holocaust deniers are on to something br In a interview Nolte implied that there was something to the Leuchter report If the revisionists Holocaust deniers and Leuchter among them have made it clear to the public that even Auschwitz must be an object of scientific inquiry and controversy then they should be given credit for this Even if it finally turned out that the number of victims was even greater and the procedures were even more horrific than has been assumed until now In his book Streitpunkte Points of Contention Nolte praised the work of Holocaust deniers as superior to mainstream scholars Nolte wrote that radical revisionists have presented research which if one is familiar with the source material and the critique of the sources is probably superior to that of the established historians of Germany In a interview with Der Spiegel magazine Nolte stated I cannot rule out the importance of the investigation of the gas chambers in which they looked for remnants of the chemical process engendered by Zyklon B and that Of course I am against revisionists but Fred Leuchter s study of the Nazi gas ovens has to be given attention because one has to stay open to other ideas br br The British historian Richard J Evans in his book In Hitler s Shadow expressed the view that Nolte s reputation as a scholar was in ruins as a result of these and other controversial statements on his part The American historian Deborah Lipstadt in a interview stated Historians such as the German Ernst Nolte are in some ways even more dangerous than the deniers Nolte is an anti Semite of the first order who attempts to rehabilitate Hitler by saying that he was no worse than Stalin but he is careful not to deny the Holocaust Holocaust deniers make Nolte s life more comfortable They have with their radical argumentation pulled the center a little more to their side Consequently a less radical extremist such as Nolte finds himself closer to the middle ground which makes him more dangerous br br br Mayer controversy br In the American historian Arno J Mayer published a book entitled Why Did the Heavens Not Darken which did not explicitly deny the Holocaust but according to Lucy Dawidowicz lent support to Holocaust denial by stating that most people who died at Auschwitz were the victims of natural causes such as disease not gassing Dawidowicz argued that Mayer s statements about Auschwitz were a breathtaking assertion Holocaust historian Robert Jan van Pelt has written that Mayer s book is as close as a mainstream historian has ever come to supporting Holocaust denial Holocaust deniers such as David Irving have often cited Mayer s book as one reason for embracing Holocaust denial Though Mayer has been often condemned for his statement about the reasons for the Auschwitz death toll his book does not deny the use of gas chambers at Auschwitz as Holocaust deniers often claim br Some mainstream Holocaust historians have labeled Mayer a denier The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer wrote that Mayer popularizes the nonsense that the Nazis saw in Marxism and Bolshevism their main enemy and the Jews unfortunately got caught up in this when he links the destruction of the Jews to the ups and downs of German warfare in the Soviet Union in a book that is so cocksure of itself that it does not need a proper scientific apparatus he is really engaging in a much more subtle form of Holocaust denial br Defenders of Mayer argue that his statement that Sources for the study of the gas chambers are at once rare and unreliable has been taken out of context particularly by Holocaust deniers Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman observe that the paragraph from which the statement is taken asserts that the SS destroyed the majority of the documentation relating to the operation of the gas chambers in the death camps which is why Mayer feels that sources for the operation of the gas chambers are rare and unreliable br br br False equivalence and effect br br br Denialist focus on Allied war crimes br The focus on so called Allied atrocities during the war has been a theme in Holocaust denial literature particularly in countries where outright denial of the Holocaust is illegal According to historian Deborah Lipstadt the concept of comparable Allied wrongs such as the expulsion of Germans after World War II and the bombing of Dresden is at the center of and a continuously repeated theme of contemporary Holocaust denial she calls the phenomenon immoral equivalencies In historian Martin Broszat in a review of David Irving s book Hitler s War maintained that the picture of World War II drawn by Irving was done in a such way to imply moral equivalence between the actions of the Axis and Allied states with both sides equally guilty of terrible crimes leading to Hitler s fanatical destructive will to annihilate being downgraded to being no longer an exceptional phenomenon br br br Propaganda br According to James Najarian Holocaust deniers working for the Institute for Historical Review are not trained in history and put out sham scholarly articles in the mock academic publication the Journal of Historical Review They appeal to our objectivity our sense of fair play and our distrust of figurative language Thus they rely on facts to grab the readers attention These facts however are strung by what Najarian calls fabricated decorum and are re interpreted for their use For example they pay particular attention to inconsistencies in numbers br Holocaust denial propaganda in all forms has been shown to influence the audiences that it reaches In fact even the well educated that is college graduates and current university students alike are susceptible to such propaganda when it is presented before them This stems from the growing disbelief that audiences feel after being exposed to such information especially since Holocaust witnesses themselves are decreasing in number Studies centered on the psychological effects of Holocaust denial propaganda confirm this assertion Linda M Yelland and William F Stone in particular show that Denial essays decrease readers belief in the Holocaust regardless of their prior Holocaust awareness br br br Middle East br br br General br Gamal Abdel Nasser the President of Egypt told a German newspaper in that no person not even the most simple one takes seriously the lie of the six million Jews that were murdered in the Holocaust br Denials of the Holocaust have been promoted by various Middle Eastern figures and media Holocaust denial is sponsored by some Middle Eastern governments including Iran and Syria In Robert Satloff writing in The Washington Post reported that A respected Holocaust research institution recently reported that Egypt Qatar and Saudi Arabia all promote Holocaust denial and protect Holocaust deniers br Prominent figures from the Middle East have rarely made publicized visits to Auschwitz Israel s Arab community being the exception In Hadash MK Mohammed Barakeh visited following a previous visit of two other Arab Israeli lawmakers and a group of about Arab Israeli writers and clerics in br br br Palestinian territories br br Individuals from the Palestinian Authority Hamas and a number of Palestinian groups have engaged in various aspects of Holocaust denial br Hamas have promoted Holocaust denial Abdel Aziz al Rantissi held that the Holocaust never occurred that Zionists were behind the action of Nazis and that Zionists funded Nazism br A press release by Hamas in April decried the so called Holocaust which is an alleged and invented story with no basis In August Hamas told UNRWA that it would refuse to allow Palestinian children to study the Holocaust which it called a lie invented by the Zionists and referred to Holocaust education as a war crime Hamas continued to hold this position in when the organization s Ministry for Refugee Affairs said that Holocaust education was intended to poison the minds of our children br The thesis of the doctoral dissertation of Mahmoud Abbas a co founder of Fatah and president of the Palestinian National Authority was The Secret Connection between the Nazis and the Leaders of the Zionist Movement In his book The Other Side the Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism based on the dissertation Abbas denied that six million Jews had died in the Holocaust dismissing it as a myth and a fantastic lie At most he wrote Jews were murdered by the Germans Abbas claimed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated for political purposes It seems that the interest of the Zionist movement however is to inflate this figure of Holocaust deaths so that their gains will be greater This led them to emphasize this figure six million in order to gain the solidarity of international public opinion with Zionism Many scholars have debated the figure of six million and reached stunning conclusions fixing the number of Jewish victims at only a few hundred thousand br In his March interview with Haaretz Abbas stated I wrote in detail about the Holocaust and said I did not want to discuss numbers I quoted an argument between historians in which various numbers of casualties were mentioned One wrote there were million victims and another wrote there were I have no desire to argue with the figures The Holocaust was a terrible unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind The Holocaust was a terrible thing and nobody can claim I denied it While acknowledging the existence of the Holocaust in and Abbas has defended the position that Zionists collaborated with the Nazis to perpetrate it In Abbas told Al Mayadeen a Beirut TV station affiliated with Iran and Hezbollah that he challenges anyone who can deny that the Zionist movement had ties with the Nazis before World War II br Surveys conducted by Sammy Smooha of the University of Haifa found that the fraction of Israeli Arabs denying that millions of Jews were murdered by the Nazis increased from in to in Smooha commented br br In Arab eyes disbelief in the very happening of the Shoah is not hate of Jews embedded in the denial of the Shoah in the West but rather a form of protest Arabs not believing in the event of Shoah intend to express strong objection to the portrayal of the Jews as the ultimate victim and to the underrating of the Palestinians as a victim They deny Israel s right to exist as a Jewish state that the Shoah gives legitimacy to Arab disbelief in the Shoah is a component of the Israeli Palestinian conflict unlike the ideological and anti Semitic denial of the Holocaust and the desire to escape guilt in the West br br br Syria br In a speech delivered at the Arab Socialist Ba ath party s central committee meeting in December the Ba ath party secretary general Bashar al Assad claimed that there was no evidence of the killings of six million Jews during the Holocaust Assad alleged that the Holocaust was politicized by Allied powers to facilitate the mass deportation of European Jews to Palestine Assad also accused the U S government of financially and militarily sponsoring the rise of Nazism during the inter war period Higlighting the deaths of million Soviet citizens during the Second World War Assad said there was no specific method of torture or killing specific to the Jews The Nazis used the same methods everywhere br br br Iran br br Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad frequently denied the Holocaust formally questioning the reliability of the historical evidence although he on occasion confirmed belief in it In a December speech Ahmadinejad said that a legend was fabricated and had been promoted to protect Israel He said br br They have fabricated a legend under the name of the Massacre of the Jews and they hold it higher than God himself religion itself and the prophets themselves If somebody in their country questions God nobody says anything but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of Jews the Zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of Zionism will start to scream br The remarks immediately provoked international controversy as well as swift condemnation from government officials in Israel Europe and the United States All six political parties in the German parliament signed a joint resolution condemning Ahmadinejad s Holocaust denial In contrast Hamas political leader Khaled Mashaal described Ahmadinejad s comments as courageous and stated Muslim people will defend Iran because it voices what they have in their hearts in particular the Palestinian people In the United States the Muslim Public Affairs Council condemned Ahmadinejad s remarks In the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Mahdi Akef denounced what he called the myth of the Holocaust in defending Ahmadinejad s denial of the Holocaust br On December the Iranian state sponsored International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust began to widespread condemnation The conference called for and held at the behest of Ahmadinejad was widely described as a Holocaust denial conference or a meeting of Holocaust deniers though Iran denied it was a Holocaust denial conference A few months before it opened the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi stated The Holocaust is not a sacred issue that one can t touch I have visited the Nazi camps in Eastern Europe I think it is exaggerated br In in an interview with CNN newly elected Iranian President Hassan Rouhani condemned the Holocaust stating I can tell you that any crime that happens in history against humanity including the crime the Nazis created towards the Jews as well as non Jews is reprehensible and condemnable Whatever criminality they committed against the Jews we condemn Iranian media later accused CNN of fabricating Rouhani s comments br In his official Nowruz address Supreme Leader of Iran Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei questioned the veracity of the Holocaust remarking that The Holocaust is an event whose reality is uncertain and if it has happened it s uncertain how it has happened This was consistent with Khamenei s previous comments regarding the Holocaust br In the House of Cartoon and the Sarcheshmeh Cultural Complex in Iran organized the Second International Holocaust Cartoon Competition a competition in which artists were encouraged to submit cartoons on the theme of Holocaust denial The winner of the contest will receive Hamshahri a

was originally published the previous year entitled Soyk r m Yalan The Genocide Lie referring to the Holocaust and mailed unsolicited texts to American and European schools and colleges The publication of Soyk r m Yalan sparked much public debate This book claims what is presented as Holocaust is the death of some Jews due to the typhus plague during the war and the famine towards the end of the war caused by the defeat of the Germans In March a Turkish painter and intellectual Bedri Baykam published a strongly worded critique of the book in the Ankara daily newspaper Siyah Beyaz Black and White A legal suit for slander was brought against him During the trial in September Baykam exposed the real author of the book as Adnan Oktar The suit was withdrawn in March br br br Eastern Europe br In some Eastern European countries such as Ukraine Lithuania Latvia and Romania Holocaust deniers do not deny the very fact of mass murder of Jews but deny some national or regional elements of the Holocaust br According to Zvi Gitelman Soviet writers tended either to ignore or downplay the Holocaust treating it as one small part of a larger phenomenon of million dead Soviet citizens during the Great Patriotic War According to Gitelman Soviet authorities were concerned about raising the consciousness of Soviet Jews and retarding their assimilation to the greater Soviet population The Holocaust also raised the issue of collaboration with the Nazi occupiers an uncomfortable topic for Soviet historiography According to historian Yuri Pivovarov in modern Russia this trend has returned with the Russian invasion on Ukraine culminating with July article of Maria Zakharova who argued that it were the Soviet citizens who were the victims of Holocaust in the first place In a number of popular history project sponsored by Russian state Jews were mentioned as one of many victim groups or not mentioned at all Holocaust denial literature is freely published in Russia and one of the most prominent authors J rgen Graf lives there since his escape from prosecution in Switzerland in the s br In the United States Department of State warned about the

site far right rallies and the concert of the controversial band Thompson among other events Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center describes Croatia as a cradle of Holocaust distortion Holocaust denial in Croatia typically involves the downplaying or denial of the Holocaust carried out by the Ustasha regime particularly against Serbs and Jews at the Jasenovac concentration camp and it is done by public figures though the regime s victims also included Roma and anti fascist Croats The Society for Research of the Threefold Jasenovac Camp in Croatia an NGO with authors and academics among its members claims that Jasenovac was a labor camp during World War II and that it was later used by Yugoslav Communists to imprison Ustasha members and regular Croatian Home Guard army troops until then alleged Stalinists until Following a series of book publications denying the Ustashe regime s crimes the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Croatian authorities in to ban such works noting that they would immediately be banned in Germany and Austria and rightfully so br In Hungary Holocaust distortion and denial take place in the form of downplaying the country s role in the killing and deportation of Jews The Arrow Cross Party committed numerous crimes and killed or deported Jews A total of Jews were deported by Mikl s Horthy s government in the Kingdom of Hungary an Axis collaborator br In Serbia Holocaust distortion and denial is manifested in the downplaying of Milan Nedi and Dimitrije Ljoti s roles in the extermination of Serbia s Jews in concentration camps in Nedi s Serbia by a number of Serbian historians Serb collaborationist armed forces including the Chetniks were involved either directly or indirectly in the mass killings of mainly Jews and Roma as well as Croats Muslims and those Serbs who sided with any anti German resistance Since the end of the war Serbian collaboration in the Holocaust has been the subject of historical revisionism by Serbian leaders br In Slovakia some anti communist writers claim that Jozef Tiso was a savior of Jews or that the Slovak State was not responsible for the Holocaust in Slovakia br The post Soviet radical right activists do not question the existence of Nazi death camps or Jewish ghettos However they deny the participation of local population in anti Jewish pogroms or the contribution of national paramilitary organizations in capture and execution of Jews Thus denial of the antisemitic nature and participation in the Holocaust of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army has become a central component of the intellectual history of the Ukrainian diaspora and nationalists br br br Western Europe br In France Holocaust denial became more prominent in the s as n gationnisme though the movement has existed in ultra left French politics since at least the s led by figures such as Pierre Guillaume who was involved in the bookshop La Vieille Taupe during the s Elements of the extreme far right in France have begun to build on each other s negationist arguments which often span beyond the Holocaust to cover a range of antisemitic views incorporating attempts to tie the Holocaust to the Biblical massacre of the Canaanites critiques of Zionism and other material fanning what has been called a conspiratorial Judeo phobia designed to legitimize and banalize antisemitism br In Belgium in Roeland Raes the ideologue and vice president of one of the country s largest political parties the Vlaams Blok gave an interview on Dutch TV where he cast doubt over the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust In the same interview he questioned the scale of the Nazis use of gas chambers and the authenticity of Anne Frank s diary In response to the media assault following the interview Raes was forced to resign his position but vowed to remain active within the party Three years later the Vlaams Blok was convicted of racism and chose to disband Immediately afterwards it legally reformed under the new name Vlaams Belang Flemish Interest with the same leaders and the same membership br The trial of a Canadian woman Monika Schaefer and her German Canadian brother Alfred Schaefer started in Germany in early July They were charged with Volksverhetzung literally incitement of the people often phrased as incitement to hatred in English language media The pair had published video clips on YouTube of their denial of the genocide of Jews In the clips Alfred Schaefer said that Jews wanted to destroy Germans blamed them for starting both World Wars and referred to the Holocaust as a Jewish fantasy Monika Schaefer was arrested in January in Germany while attending a court hearing of Sylvia Stolz Schaefer had been the Green Party candidate in the Alberta riding of Yellowhead during the federal elections in and but was expelled from the party after news reports surfaced of a July video where she describes the Holocaust as the most persistent lie in all of history and insisted that those in concentration camps had been kept as healthy and as well fed as possible In late October Monika Schaefer was convicted of the charge of Volksverhetzung incitement of hatred literally incitement of the people She was sentenced to ten months while Alfred Schaefer also convicted received a sentence of three years and two months br In January a survey conducted by Opinion Matters on behalf of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust found that of UK adults did not believe the Holocaust took place and one in believed its scale has been exaggerated One in five respondents incorrectly answered that less than million Jews were murdered and couldn t say how many people were murdered in the Holocaust Speaking in light of the survey s findings Karen Pollock chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust said One person questioning the truth of the Holocaust is one too many and so it is up to us to redouble our efforts to ensure future generations know that it did happen and become witnesses to one of the darkest episodes in our history The BBC Radio programme More or Less specializing on statistics investigated the survey finding it was unlikely to be accurate Participants were incentivized to complete the online survey by shopping vouchers encouraging speedy answering and the principal question was a reverse question with most participants having to give the reverse answer to surrounding questions requiring careful answering Another question asked how many Jewish people had been murdered in the holocaust with only of participants giving the answer zero which was considered to be a closer estimate of the number of UK adults that did not believe the Holocaust took place br br br Other br Japanese Holocaust denial first appeared in and reached its peak in with the publication in February by the Japanese magazine Marco Polo a circulation monthly published by Bungei Shunju of a Holocaust denial article by physician Masanori Nishioka which stated The Holocaust is a fabrication There were no execution gas chambers in Auschwitz or in any other concentration camp Today what is displayed as gas chambers at the remains of the Auschwitz camp in Poland are a post war fabrication by the Polish communist regime or by the Soviet Union which controlled the country Not once neither at Auschwitz nor in any territory controlled by the Germans during the Second World War was there mass murder of Jews in gas chambers The Los Angeles based Simon Wiesenthal Center instigated a boycott of Bungei Shunju advertisers including Volkswagen Mitsubishi and Cartier Within days Bungei Shunju shut down Marco Polo and its editor Kazuyoshi Hanada quit as did the president of Bungei Shunju Kengo Tanaka br Holocaust denial started in Finland almost immediately after the war with many Finns who had been involved in the far right and Nazi movements publishing articles questioning the Holocaust Prominent early Finnish Holocaust deniers include doctor C A J Gadolin CEO Carl Gustaf Herlitz architech Carl O Nordling and ambassador Teo Snellman In the Simon Wiesenthal Centre asked President Niinist to condemn a neo Nazi newspaper circulated to some households The newspaper published articles denying the Holocaust and articles such as Zionist terrorism and CNN Goldman Sachs and Zionist Control translated from David Duke Popular Finnish alternative media sites MV media Verkkomedia and Magneettimedia are known for publishing articles denying the Holocaust br According to a survey of American adult Millennials and Generation Z members said the Holocaust might be a myth or had been exaggerated br br br Reactions to Holocaust denial br In the United Nations adopted a resolution aimed at combating Holocaust denial and antisemitism The resolution was proposed by Germany and Israel br br br Scholars br br Scholarly response to Holocaust denial can be roughly divided into three categories Some academics refuse to engage Holocaust deniers or their arguments at all on grounds that doing so lends them unwarranted legitimacy The second group of scholars typified by the American historian Deborah Lipstadt have tried to raise awareness of the methods and motivations of Holocaust denial without legitimizing the deniers themselves We need not waste time or effort answering the deniers contentions Lipstadt wrote It would be never ending Their commitment is to an ideology and their findings are shaped to support it A third group typified by the Nizkor Project responds to arguments and claims made by Holocaust denial groups by pointing out inaccuracies and errors in their evidence br In December the American Historical Association the oldest and largest society of historians and teachers of history in the United States issued the following statement The American Historical Association Council strongly deplores the publicly reported attempts to deny the fact of the Holocaust No serious historian questions that the Holocaust took place This followed a strong reaction by many of its members and commentary in the press against a near unanimous decision that the AHA had made in May that studying the significance of the Holocaust should be encouraged The association s May statement was in response to an incident where certain of its members had questioned the reality of the Holocaust The December declaration is a reversal of the AHA s earlier stance that the association should not set a precedent by certifying historical facts The AHA has also stated that Holocaust denial is at best a form of academic fraud br Literary theorist Jean Baudrillard described Holocaust denial as part of the extermination itself Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel during a discussion at the White House in Washington D C called the Holocaust the most documented tragedy in recorded history Never before has a tragedy elicited so much witness from the killers from the victims and even from the bystanders millions of pieces here in the museum what you have all other museums archives in the thousands in the millions br Deborah Lipstadt s book Denying the Holocaust sharply criticized various Holocaust deniers including British author David Irving for deliberately misrepresenting evidence to justify their preconceived conclusions In the book Lipstadt named Irving as one of the more dangerous Holocaust deniers because he was a published author and was viewed by some as a legitimate military historian He was familiar with historical evidence she wrote and bends it until it conforms with his ideological leanings and political agenda In Irving filed a libel suit against Lipstadt and her publisher Penguin Books Irving who appeared as a defense witness in Ernst Z ndel s trial in Canada and once declared at a rally of Holocaust deniers that more women died in the back seat of Edward Kennedy s car than ever died in a gas chamber at Auschwitz claimed that Lipstadt s allegation damaged his reputation American historian Christopher Browning an expert witness for the defense wrote a comprehensive essay for the court summarizing the voluminous evidence for the reality of the Holocaust and under cross examination effectively countered all of Irving s principal arguments to the contrary Cambridge historian Richard J Evans another defense expert witness spent two years examining Irving s writings and confirmed his misrepresentations including evidence that he had knowingly used forged documents as source material After a two month trial in London the trial judge Justice Charles Gray issued a page ruling against Irving which referred to him as a Holocaust denier and right wing pro Nazi polemicist br Ken McVay an American resident in Canada was disturbed by the efforts of organizations like the Simon Wiesenthal Center to suppress the speech of the Holocaust deniers feeling that it was better to confront them openly than to try to censor them On the Usenet newsgroup alt revisionism he began a campaign of truth fact and evidence working with other participants on the newsgroup to uncover factual information about the Holocaust and counter the arguments of the deniers by proving them to be based upon misleading evidence false statements and outright lies He founded the Nizkor Project to expose the activities of the Holocaust deniers who responded to McVay with personal attacks slander and death threats br br br Public figures br A number of public figures have spoken out against Holocaust denial In UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said Remembering is a necessary rebuke to those who say the Holocaust never happened or has been exaggerated Holocaust denial is the work of bigots we must reject their false claims whenever wherever and by whomever they are made In January the United Nations General Assembly condemned without reservation any denial of the Holocaust though Iran disassociated itself from the resolution br In July Iran s then president elect Hassan Rohani described Ahmadinejad s remarks about the Holocaust and Israel as hate rhetoric and in September Rohani stated that The Nazis carried out a massacre that cannot be denied especially against the Jewish people and The massacre by the Nazis was condemnable We never want to sit by side with the Nazis They committed a crime against Jews which is a crime against all of humanity While declining to give a specific number of Jewish victims Iranian analysts suggested that Rouhani pushed the envelope as far as it could go without infuriating the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other conservatives back home br br br Former Auschwitz SS personnel br Critics of Holocaust denial also include members of the Auschwitz SS Camp physician and SS Untersturmf hrer Hans M nch considered the facts of Auschwitz so firmly determined that one cannot have any doubt at all and described those who negate what happened at the camp as malevolent people who have personal interest to want to bury in silence things that cannot be buried in silence Zyklon B handler and SS Oberscharf hrer Josef Klehr said that anyone who maintains that nobody was gassed at Auschwitz must be crazy or in the wrong SS Unterscharf hrer Oswald Kaduk stated that he did not consider those who maintain such a thing as normal people Hearing about Holocaust denial compelled former SS Rottenf hrer Oskar Gr ning to publicly speak about what he witnessed at Auschwitz and denounce Holocaust deniers stating br br I would like you to believe me I saw the gas chambers I saw the crematoria I saw the open fires I was on the ramp when the selections took place I would like you to believe that these atrocities happened because I was there br br br Holocaust denial and antisemitism br Holocaust denial is given as an example of antisemitism in the Working Definition of Antisemitism adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance as well as the United Kingdom Israel Austria Scotland Romania Germany and Bulgaria The European Parliament voted in favor of a resolution calling for member states to adopt the definition on June br The Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity defines Holocaust denial as a new form of anti Semitism but one that hinges on age old motifs The Anti Defamation League has stated that Holocaust denial is a contemporary form of the classic anti Semitic doctrine of the evil manipulative and threatening world Jewish conspiracy and French historian Val rie Igounet has written that Holocaust denial is a convenient polemical substitute for anti semitism br According to Walter Reich psychiatrist and then a senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars one time director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and now professor of international affairs at George Washington University br br The primary motivation for most deniers is anti Semitism and for them the Holocaust is an infuriatingly inconvenient fact of history After all the Holocaust has generally been recognized as one of the most terrible crimes that ever took place and surely the very emblem of evil in the modern age If that crime was a direct result of anti Semitism taken to its logical end then anti Semitism itself even when expressed in private conversation is inevitably discredited among most people What better way to rehabilitate anti Semitism make anti Semitic arguments seem once again respectable in civilized discourse and even make it acceptable for governments to pursue anti Semitic policies than by convincing the world that the great crime for which anti Semitism was blamed simply never happened indeed that it was nothing more than a frame up invented by the Jews and propagated by them through their control of the media What better way in short to make the world safe again for anti Semitism than by denying the Holocaust br The French historian Pierre Vidal Naquet described the motivation of deniers more succinctly explaining One revives the dead in order the better to strike the living German political scientist Matthias K ntzel has argued Every denial of the Holocaust contains an appeal to repeat it br br br Examination of claims br br The key claims which cause Holocaust denial to differ from established fact are br br The Nazis had no official policy or intention of exterminating Jews br The Nazis did not use gas chambers to mass murder Jews br The figure of to million Jewish deaths is a gross exaggeration and the actual number is an order of magnitude lower br Other claims include the following br br Stories of the Holocaust were a myth initially created by the Allies of World War II to demonize Germans Jews having spread this myth as part of a grander plot intended to enable the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and now to garner continuing support for the state of Israel br Documentary evidence of the Holocaust from photographs to The Diary of Anne Frank is fabricated br Survivor testimonies are filled with errors and inconsistencies and are thus unreliable br Interrogators obtained Nazi prisoners confessions of war crimes through the use of torture br The Nazi treatment of Jews was no different from what the Allies did to their enemies in World War II br Holocaust denial is widely viewed as failing to adhere to principles for the treatment of evidence that mainstream historians as well as scholars in other fields regard as basic to rational inquiry br The Holocaust was well documented by the bureaucracy of the Nazi government itself It was further witnessed by the Allied forces who entered Germany and its associated Axis states towards the end of World War II It was also witnessed from the inside by non Jewish captives such as Catholic French Resistance member Andr Rogerie who wrote extensively and testified about his experiences in seven camps including Auschwitz Birkenau and also produced the oldest contemporary sketch of a camp crematorium br According to researchers Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman there is a convergence of evidence that proves that the Holocaust happened This evidence includes br br Written documents hundreds of thousands of letters memos blueprints orders bills speeches articles memoirs and confessions br Eyewitness testimony accounts from survivors Jewish Sonderkommandos who helped load bodies from the gas chambers into the crematoria in exchange for a chance of survival SS guards commandants local townspeople and even high ranking Nazis who spoke openly about the mass murder of the Jews br Photographs including official military and press photographs civilian photographs secret photographs taken by survivors aerial photographs German and Allied film footage and unofficial photographs taken by the German military br The camps themselves concentration camps work camps and extermination camps that still exist in varying degrees of originality and reconstruction br Inferential evidence or argument from silence population demographics reconstructed from the pre World War II era if six million Jews were not murdered what happened to them br Much of the controversy surrounding the claims of Holocaust deniers centers on the methods used to present arguments that the Holocaust allegedly never happened as commonly accepted Numerous accounts have been given by Holocaust deniers including evidence presented in court cases of claimed facts and evidence however independent research has shown these claims to be based upon flawed research biassed statements or even deliberately falsified evidence Opponents of Holocaust denial have documented numerous instances in which such evidence was altered or manufactured see Nizkor Project and David Irving According to Pierre Vidal Naquet in our society of image and spectacle extermination on paper leads to extermination in reality br br br Laws against Holocaust denial br br Holocaust denial is explicitly or implicitly illegal in countries Austria Belgium Canada the Czech Republic France Germany Hungary Israel Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg the Netherlands Poland Portugal Romania Russia Slovakia and Switzerland Romania officially denied the Holocaust occurred on its territory up until the Wiesel Commission in The European Union s Framework decision on Racism and Xenophobia states that denying or grossly trivializing crimes of genocide should be made punishable in all EU Member States br Such legislation remains controversial In October a tribunal declared Spain s genocide denial law unconstitutional In Italy rejected a denial law proposing a prison sentence of up to four years In the Netherlands rejected a draft law proposing a maximum sentence of one year on denial of genocidal acts in general although specifically denying the Holocaust remains a criminal offense there The United Kingdom has twice rejected Holocaust denial laws Denmark and Sweden have also rejected such legislation br A number of deniers have been prosecuted under various countries denial laws French literature professor Robert Faurisson for example was convicted and punished under the Gayssot Act in Some historians oppose such laws among them Pierre Vidal Naquet an outspoken critic of Faurisson on the grounds that denial legislation imposes historical truth as legal truth Other academics favor criminalization Holocaust denial they contend is the worst form of racism and its most respectable version because it pretends to be a research Holocaust historian Deborah E Lipstadt expressed her opposition to laws against expressing Holocaust denial saying I don t think they work I think they turn whatever is being outlawed into forbidden fruit She also said that politicians should not be able to decide what can and cannot be said br br br David Irving conviction br In February Irving was convicted in Austria where Holocaust denial is illegal for a speech he had made in in which he denied the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz Irving was aware of the outstanding arrest warrant but chose to go to Austria anyway to give a lecture to a far right student fraternity Although he pleaded guilty to the charge Irving said he had been mistaken and had changed his opinions on the Holocaust I said that then based on my knowledge at the time but by when I came across the Eichmann papers I wasn t saying that anymore and I wouldn t say that now The Nazis did murder millions of Jews Irving served months of a year sentence in an Austrian prison including the period between his arrest and conviction and was deported in early The episode sparked intense international debate over the limits of freedom of speech Upon hearing of Irving s sentence Lipstadt said I am not happy when censorship wins and I don t believe in winning battles via censorship The way of fighting Holocaust deniers is with history and with truth According to CNN upon Irving s return to the UK he vow ed to repeat views denying the Holocaust that led to his conviction stating he felt no need any longer to show remorse for his Holocaust views br br br Genocide denials br br Other acts of genocide have met similar attempts to deny and minimize them Gregory H Stanton formerly of the US State Department and the founder of Genocide Watch lists denial as the final stage of a genocide development Denial is the eighth stage that always follows a genocide It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves burn the bodies try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses They deny that they committed any crimes and often blame what happened on the victims br Holocaust denial is often compared to Armenian genocide denial because of similar tactics of misrepresenting evidence false equivalence claiming that atrocities were invented by war propaganda and that powerful lobbies manufacture genocide allegations for their own profit subsuming one sided systematic extermination into war deaths and shifting blame from the perpetrators to the victims of genocide Both forms of negationism share the goal of rehabilitating the ideologies which brought genocide about br br br See also br Holocaust br br
