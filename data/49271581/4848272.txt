conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton s emails Trump said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey s role in the ongoing Trump Russia investigations and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier At a private conversation in February Trump said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into Flynn In March and April Trump asked Comey to lift the cloud impairing his ability

the outbreak horrible but a temporary moment and saying there was no financial crisis On March he declared a national emergency freeing up federal resources Trump claimed that anybody that wants a test can get a test despite test availability being severely limited br On April Trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of immigration In late spring and early summer with infections and deaths continuing to rise he adopted a strategy of blaming the states rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the pandemic were overly optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership br br br White House Coronavirus Task Force br br Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January Beginning in mid March Trump held a daily task force press conference joined by medical experts and other administration officials sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments Trump was the main speaker at the briefings where he praised his own response to the pandemic frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden and denounced the press On March he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur His repeated use of Chinese virus and China virus to describe COVID drew criticism from health experts br By early April as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration s response Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak instead blaming the media Democratic state governors the previous administration China and the WHO The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April after a briefing at which Trump suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals br In early May Trump proposed the phase out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group

Health Organization br Prior to the pandemic Trump criticized the WHO and other international bodies which he asserted were taking advantage of U S aid His administration s proposed federal budget released in February proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half In May and April Trump accused the WHO of severely mismanaging COVID alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government s concealment of the pandemic s origins and announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization These were seen as attempts to

In April he first supported then later criticized Georgia Governor Brian Kemp s plan to reopen some nonessential businesses Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions to reverse the damage to the country s economy br Trump often refused to mask at public events contrary to his administration s April guidance to wear masks in public and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing spread of the virus By June Trump had said masks were a double edged sword ridiculed Biden for wearing masks continually emphasized that mask wearing was optional and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally Trump s contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic br In June and July Trump said several times that the U S would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing that having a large number of reported cases makes us look bad The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be quickly identified and tested even if they are not showing symptoms because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus In August the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing advising that people who have been exposed to the virus but are not showing symptoms do not necessarily need a test The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure against the wishes of CDC scientists The day after this political interference was reported the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation br Despite record numbers of COVID cases in the U S from mid June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results Trump largely continued to downplay the pandemic including his false claim in early July that percent of COVID cases are totally harmless He began insisting that all states should resume in person education in the fall despite a July spike in reported cases br br br Political pressure on health agencies br br Trump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored such as approving unproven treatments or speeding up vaccine approvals Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined Trump s claims that the pandemic was under control CDC resisted many of the changes but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a deep state opposing him and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically br br br Outbreak at the White House br br On October Trump tweeted that he had tested positive for COVID part of a White House outbreak Later that day Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center reportedly due to fever and labored breathing He was treated with antiviral and

that his condition had been far more serious he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels a high fever and lung infiltrates indicating a severe case br br br Effects on the presidential campaign br By July Trump s handling of the COVID pandemic had become a major issue in the presidential election Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue Polls suggested voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus with an Ipsos ABC News poll indicating percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response In the final months of the campaign Trump repeatedly said that the U S was rounding the turn in managing the pandemic despite increasing cases and deaths A few days before the November election the U S reported more than cases in a single day for the first time br br br Investigations br After he assumed office Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny with investigations covering his

comply with the subpoena and judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District Court of New York ruled that the banks must also comply Trump s attorneys appealed In September the committee and Trump agreed to a settlement about Mazars and the accounting firm began turning over documents br br br Russian election interference br br In January American intelligence agencies the CIA the FBI and the NSA represented by the Director of National Intelligence jointly stated with high confidence that the Russian government interfered in the presidential election to favor the election of Trump In March FBI Director James Comey told Congress T he FBI as part of our counterintelligence mission is investigating the Russian government s efforts to interfere in the presidential election That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia s efforts br Many suspicious links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spies were discovered and the relationships between Russians and team Trump including Manafort Flynn and Stone were widely reported by the press Members of Trump s campaign and his White House staff particularly Flynn were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the election On December Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that were imposed that same day Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence Trump told Kislyak and Sergei Lavrov in May he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U S elections br Trump and his allies promoted a conspiracy theory that Ukraine rather than Russia interfered in the election which was also promoted by Russia to frame Ukraine br br br FBI Crossfire Hurricane and counterintelligence investigations br In July the FBI launched an investigation codenamed Crossfire Hurricane into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump s personal and business dealings with Russia Crossfire Hurricane was transferred to the Mueller investigation but Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ended the investigation into Trump s direct ties to Russia while giving the bureau the false impression that the Robert Mueller s special counsel investigation would pursue the matter br br br Mueller investigation br br In May Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Mueller special counsel for the Department of Justice DOJ ordering him to examine any links and or coordination between the Russian government and the Trump campaign He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters in connection with Russia s election interference The special counsel also investigated whether Trump s dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice and the Trump campaign s possible ties to Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Turkey Qatar Israel and China Trump sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind br In March Mueller gave his final report to Attorney General William Barr which Barr purported to summarize in a letter to Congress A federal court and Mueller himself said Barr mischaracterized the investigation s conclusions and in so doing confused the public Trump repeatedly claimed that the investigation exonerated him the Mueller report expressly stated that it did not br A redacted version of the report publicly released in April found that Russia interfered in to favor Trump Despite numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign the report found that the prevailing evidence did not establish that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference The report revealed sweeping Russian interference and detailed how Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it believing it would benefit them electorally br The report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by Trump but did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President s conduct Investigators decided they could not apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes as an Office of Legal Counsel opinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court The report concluded that Congress having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing may apply the obstruction laws The House of Representatives subsequently launched an impeachment inquiry following the Trump Ukraine scandal but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation br Several Trump associates pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with Mueller s investigation and related cases including Manafort and Flynn Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump s attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build a Trump

that may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July and canceling Pence s May Ukraine trip br House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September Trump then confirmed that he withheld military aid from Ukraine offering contradictory reasons for the decision On September the Trump administration released a memorandum of the phone call which confirmed that after Zelenskyy mentioned purchasing American anti tank missiles Trump asked him to discuss investigating Biden and his son with Giuliani and Barr The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump s personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election In October William B Taylor Jr the charg d affaires for Ukraine testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani According to Taylor and others the goal was to coerce Zelenskyy into making a public commitment to investigate the company that employed Hunter Biden as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the U S presidential election He said it was made clear that until Zelenskyy made such an announcement the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelenskyy to the White House br On December the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment one for abuse of power and one for obstruction of Congress After debate the House of Representatives impeached Trump on both articles on December br br br Impeachment trial in the Senate br br During the trial in January the House impeachment managers cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress and asserted that Trump s actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the impeachment process br Trump s lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges but said Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress They argued that the impeachment was constitutionally and legally invalid because Trump was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense br On January the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents The impeachment trial was the first in U S history without witness testimony br Trump was acquitted of both charges by the Republican majority Senator Mitt Romney was the only

appeals to racism br br br presidential election br br Starting in the spring of Trump began to sow doubts about the election claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud When in August the House of Representatives voted for a billion grant to the U S Postal Service for the expected surge in

late as July Trump was still pressuring state legislators to overturn the election br Unlike other former presidents Trump continued to dominate his party he has been described as a modern party boss He continued fundraising raising more than twice as much as the Republican Party itself hinted at a third candidacy and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar a Lago Much of
