with the original Xbox br br As Microsoft developed the original Xbox console online gaming was designated as one of the key pillars for the greater Xbox strategy Sega had made an attempt to capitalize on the ever growing online gaming scene when it launched the Dreamcast video game console in including online support as standard with the SegaNet service in North America and Dreamarena in Europe Nevertheless due to lack of widespread broadband adoption at the time the Dreamcast shipped with only a dial up modem while a later released broadband adapter was neither widely supported nor widely available Downloadable content was available though limited in size due to the narrowband connection and the size limitations of a memory card The PlayStation did not initially ship with built in networking capabilities br Microsoft however hoped that the Xbox would succeed where the Dreamcast had failed The company determined that intense online gaming required the throughput of a broadband connection and the storage space of a hard disk drive and thus these features would be vital to the new platform This would allow not only for significant downloadable content such as new levels maps weapons challenges and characters to be downloaded quickly and stored but also would make it possible to standardize bandwidth intensive features such as voice communication Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates both had a vision of making premium download content and add ons that would attract many new customers Based on this reasoning the console included a standard Ethernet port in order to provide connectivity to common broadband networks but did not include a modem or any dial up support and its online service was designed to support broadband users only Critics scoffed at it citing poor broadband adoption at the turn of the century br When the Xbox launched on November the as yet unnamed online service was destined for a Summer deployment Xbox Live was finally given a name at E when the service was unveiled in its entirety Sound dampened booths and broadband connected Xbox consoles featuring an early version of Unreal Championship demonstrated the service on the show floor The Epic title was one of the flagship titles for the service which was slated for a debut on November marking the anniversary of the Xbox launch Microsoft announced that Xbox Live titles would be available by the end of Utilizing the required broadband bandwidth Xbox Live featured a unified gaming Friends List as well as a single identity across all titles regardless of the publisher and standardized voice chat with a headset and communication a feature that was still in its infancy br Leading up to the launch Microsoft enlisted several waves of beta testers to improve the service and receive feature feedback The first wave of beta testers were given Re Volt which was never released officially and NFL Fever to beta test Once beta testing concluded Microsoft sent these beta testers a translucent orange memory card a headset carrying case and a beta tester t shirt with the slogan I ve got great hands When the service debuted it lacked much of the functionality that later titles included but Xbox Live grew and evolved on the Xbox and many aspects of the service were included with the Xbox console out of the box rather than through a later update Microsoft granted Live related patent that gives Xbox users access to watch other gamers compete against each other over Xbox Live br The packaging for playable Xbox Live titles on the original Xbox console featured a trademark luminescent orange gold bar underneath the Xbox header Tom Clancy s Splinter Cell and Brute Force sported a Live bubble design as they only featured downloadable content It was changed later wherein all Xbox Live titles included the universal orange gold Live bar By the time of the Xbox all titles were required to provide at least a limited form of Xbox Live awareness In July Xbox Live had reached million online users In July Xbox Live had reached million online users br br br Subsequent growth br br On November Microsoft celebrated Xbox Live s th anniversary by offering its then over million subscribers the title Carcassonne free of charge and awarding gamers who had subscribed to Live since its inception free Microsoft Points Due to intermittent service interruptions during late December and early January Microsoft promised to offer a free Xbox Live Arcade game to all Xbox Live users as compensation in an open letter to all Xbox Live members from Marc Whitten Xbox LIVE

may still apply br On December both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live suffered network disruption after a denial of service attack Functionality was restored on December with some users experiencing difficulties in the days that followed A group called The Phantom Squad has threatened to disrupt the Xbox Live network through a denial of service attack on December br In the Official Xbox Magazine revealed that Xbox Live would be made cross platform and will serve Android iOS and Nintendo Switch br Microsoft added Xbox Live Gold to its Xbox Game Pass program as part of a new Xbox Game Pass

for the month subscription from by for the month subscription from and by double the price for the month subscription from However the month and month subscription price increases would not affect existing subscribers when they resubscribed at the same level nor those already subscribed through the Xbox Games Pass Ultimate program However after complaints from the Xbox community Microsoft made an announcement on the same day that they revoked their decision and that they would not increase the prices of any of the subscriptions thus they would remain the same as they were br Microsoft officially announced that they would be branding Xbox Live as Xbox network in March as to cover all the services related to Xbox and not just Xbox Live Xbox Live Gold would remain the same name and to distinguish the subscription program from the set of services Microsoft also stated that with this it will eliminate the requirement to have Xbox Live Gold to play free to play games on Xbox consoles br By January Microsoft reported that there were more than million Xbox users including those through the Xbox Game Pass subscription br br br User information br br br Gamertag br A gamertag is the universal name for a player s username on the Xbox network A gamertag is a unique identifier and can include numbers letters and spaces Gamertags can be changed using an Xbox Series X S Xbox One or Xbox console first time is free all other changes afterwards are charged while the Xbox supports eight Xbox network enabled profiles per memory unit and thirty two profiles on the hard drive br A player s Gamertag account status can be checked using a variety of online tools which is useful especially when looking for a new gamertag or confirming that a gamertag exists Using a valid gamertag any player can be found and messaged from within the network There are also several websites which allow users of gamertags to upload photos and information about themselves br br Gamertags also contain avatar images or gamer pictures with the stock images sometimes associated with certain games or game characters On Xbox individual gamerpics are available but they are usually bundled into packs It is also possible to take Public pictures which are shown to all that view a profile unless the user has a different personal picture set which can be taken of avatars while using the avatar editor On Xbox One and Xbox Series X S players are able to upload custom images of their choice through the Xbox app subject to Xbox approval br Users were formerly forbidden to use strings such as gay or refer to homosexuality in any way in their gamertag or profile due to it being considered content of a sexual nature even if the string occurs in a legitimate surname Incidents where a woman was suspended from the service for identifying herself as a lesbian and an incident where a male user was suspended for using his surname Gaywood in his username attracted controversy In February Xbox Live Lead Program Manager for Enforcement Stephen Toulouse clarified the service s policy on sexual identification stating that Expression of any sexual orientation is not allowed in Gamertags but that the company is examining how we can provide it in a way that won t get misused Changes announced in March permit Xbox Live members to express sexual orientation in their gamertags and profiles br br br Gamerscore br The Gamerscore G is an achievements point accumulation system that reflects the number of achievements accumulated by a user on Xbox through the displaying of the number of points accumulated These Achievement points are awarded for the completion of game specific challenges such as beating a level or amassing a specified number of wins against other players in online matches and other various in game challenges br Initially retail Xbox games offered up to G spread over a variable number of Achievements while each Xbox Live Arcade title contained Achievements totaling G On February Microsoft announced on their Gamerscore Blog some new policies that developers must follow related to Gamerscore and Achievements in future releases All regular disc based games must have Gamerscore points in the base game the title can ship with fewer than points but anything added later must be free Game developers also now have the option of adding up to points via downloadable content every quarter after the first year of release for a total of points Xbox Live Arcade titles also allowed players to obtain Gamerscore initially up to Gamerscore with additional points up to Gamerscore via downloadable content for a total of points but some XBLA games now contain up to Gamerscore without DLC br On March Microsoft cracked down on Gamerscore cheaters those who used external tools to artificially inflate their Gamerscore and reduced their Gamerscores to zero without the option to recover the scores that had been earned and branded the player by denoting on their Gamertag that they were a Cheater br The development of the Gamerscore system had created a new niche in the internet economy Many websites have been created to provide gamers with tips and tricks for getting achievement points Some sites are solely devoted to these achievement guides and some blogs provide gaming guides in addition to their other content br On March Ray Cox IV or Stallion became the first player in history to reach million Gamerscore br br br Gamecard br The Gamecard is an information panel used to summarize one s user profile on Microsoft s Xbox network The pieces of information on a Gamercard include br br Gamertag br Gamer picture avatar br Reputation only shown on Xbox One and Xbox Series X S if the viewed player is constantly violating the Community Standards br Gamerscore br Gamer Zone Xbox only br Recent games played br A player s Gamercard can be viewed via the guide the Xbox app or online through Xbox com br Similarly Mac OS X users were able to download widgets that display their Xbox Live Gamercard within Mac OS X s Dashboard These can be downloaded onto any Mac with OS X or higher via Apple s widget download page br On Xbox there were four Gamer Zones Recreation is for casual gamers Family is for family friendly gamers without profanity etc Pro is for competitive gamers who enjoy a challenge and Underground is for no holds barred gaming where anything goes as long as it does not violate the Xbox Live Terms of Use However in practice these gamer zones were displayed only on the Gamercard of the player and did not tend to affect the gameplay experience or the matching of players in online games br br br TrueSkill br br TrueSkill is a ranking and matchmaking system which was first implemented as part of the Xbox s Live service Developed at Microsoft Research Cambridge United Kingdom the TrueSkill ranking system is now used in over titles for the Xbox and was used in the Games for Windows Live game Warhammer Dawn of War II It uses a mathematical model of uncertainty to address weaknesses in existing ranking systems such as Elo For example a new player joining million player leagues can be ranked correctly in fewer than games It can predict the probability of each game outcome which enhances competitive matchmaking making it possible to assemble skill balanced teams from a group of players with different abilities br When matchmaking the system attempts to match individuals based on their estimated skill level If two individuals are competing head to head and have the same estimated skill level with low estimate uncertainty they should each have roughly a chance of winning a match In this way the system attempts to make every match as competitive as possible br In order to prevent abuse of the system the majority of ranked games have relatively limited options for matchmaking By design players cannot easily play with their friends in ranked games However these countermeasures have failed due to techniques such as alternate account s and system flaws where each system has its own individual TrueSkill rating To provide less competitive games the system supports unranked Player Matches which allow individuals of any skill level to be paired often including guests on an account Such matches do not contribute to the TrueSkill rating br br br Microsoft Store br br The Microsoft Store is the current digital marketplace for the Xbox ecosystem starting in for the Xbox One It is available on consoles and on Xbox s website as well as its own website offering games from across all of Xbox s generations in addition to movies television shows and multiple apps available as streaming services for music or television br br br Xbox stores br br Xbox Games Store formerly Xbox Live Marketplace
