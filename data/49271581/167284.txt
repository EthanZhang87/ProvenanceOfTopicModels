owned subsidiary of Comcast The news division s various operations report to the president of NBC News Rebecca Blumenstein The NBCUniversal News Group also comprises MSNBC the network s hour general news channel business and consumer news channels CNBC and CNBC World the Spanish language Noticias Telemundo and United Kingdom based Sky News br NBC News aired the first regularly scheduled news program in American broadcast television history on February The group s broadcasts are produced and aired from Rockefeller Plaza NBCUniversal s headquarters in New York City br The division presides over the flagship evening newscast NBC Nightly News the world s first of its genre morning television program Today and the longest running television series in American history Meet the Press the Sunday morning program of newsmakers interviews NBC News also offers years of rare historic footage from the NBCUniversal Archives online br br br History br br br Caravan era br The first regularly scheduled American television newscast in history was made by NBC News on February anchored by Lowell Thomas and airing weeknights at p m It was simply Lowell Thomas in front of a television camera while doing his NBC network radio broadcast the television simulcast seen only in New York In June NBC through its flagship station in New York City W XBS renamed commercial WNBT in now WNBC operating on channel one televised hours of coverage of the Republican National Convention live and direct from Philadelphia The station used a series of relays from Philadelphia to New York and on to upper New York State for rebroadcast on W XB in Schenectady now WRGB making this among the first network programs of NBC Television Due to wartime and technical restrictions there were no live telecasts of the conventions although films of the events were reportedly shown over WNBT the next day br About this time there were irregularly scheduled quasi network newscasts originating from NBC s WNBT in New York City WNBC and reportedly fed to WPTZ now KYW TV in Philadelphia and WRGB in Schenectady NY Such as Esso sponsored news features a well as The War As It Happens in the final days of World War II another irregularly scheduled NBC television newsreel program which was also seen in New York Philadelphia and Schenectady on the relatively few roughly television sets which existed at the time After the war NBC Television Newsreel aired filmed news highlights with narration Later in when sponsored by Camel Cigarettes NBC Television Newsreel was renamed Camel Newsreel Theatre and then when John Cameron Swayze was added as an on camera anchor in the program was renamed Camel News Caravan br In NBC teamed up with Life magazine to provide election night coverage of President Harry S Truman s surprising victory over New York governor Thomas E Dewey The television audience was small but NBC s share in New York was double that of any other outlet The following year the Camel News Caravan anchored by John Cameron Swayze debuted on NBC Lacking the graphics and technology of later years it nonetheless contained many of the elements of modern newscasts NBC hired its own film crews and in the program s early years it dominated CBS s competing program which did not hire its own film crews until by contrast CBS spent lavishly on Edward R Murrow s weekly series See It Now In David Brinkley began serving as the program s Washington correspondent but attracted little attention outside the network until paired with Chet Huntley in In the Camel News Caravan fell behind CBS Douglas Edwards with the News and Swayze lost the already tepid support of NBC executives The following year NBC replaced the program with the Huntley Brinkley Report br Beginning in NBC News was managed by Director of News Bill McAndrew who reported to Vice President of News and Public Affairs J Davidson Taylor br br br Huntley Brinkley era br br Television assumed an increasingly prominent role in American family life in the late s and NBC News was called television s champion of news coverage NBC president Robert Kintner provided the news division with ample amounts of both financial resources and air time In the network paired anchors Chet Huntley and David Brinkley and the two became celebrities supported by reporters including John Chancellor Frank McGee Edwin Newman Sander Vanocur Nancy Dickerson Tom Pettit and Ray Scherer br Created by Producer Reuven Frank NBC s The Huntley Brinkley Report had its debut on October During much of its year run it exceeded the viewership levels of its CBS News competition anchored initially by Douglas Edwards and beginning in April by Walter Cronkite br NBC s Vice President of News and Public Affairs J Davidson Taylor was a Southerner who with Producer Reuven Frank was determined that NBC would lead television s coverage of the civil rights movement In NBC provided national coverage of Martin Luther King Jr s leadership of the Montgomery bus boycott in Montgomery Alabama airing reports from Frank McGee then News Director of NBC s Montgomery affiliate WSFA TV who would later join the network A year later John Chancellor s coverage of the admission of black students to Central High School in Little Rock Arkansas was the first occasion when the key news story came from television rather than print and prompted a prominent U S senator to observe later When I think of Little Rock I think of John Chancellor Other reporters who covered the movement for the network included Sander Vanocur Herbert Kaplow Charles Quinn and Richard Valeriani who was hit with an ax handle at a demonstration in Marion Alabama in br While Walter Cronkite s enthusiasm for the space race eventually won the anchorman viewers for CBS and NBC News with the work of correspondents such as Frank McGee Roy Neal Jay Barbree and Peter Hackes also provided ample coverage of American crewed space missions in the Project Mercury Project Gemini and Project Apollo programs In an era when space missions rated continuous coverage NBC configured its largest studio Studio H for space coverage It utilized models and mockups of rockets and spacecraft maps of the Earth and Moon to show orbital trackage and stages on which animated figures created by puppeteer Bil Baird were used to depict movements of astronauts before on board spacecraft television cameras were feasible Studio H had been home to the NBC Symphony Orchestra and is now the home of Saturday Night Live NBC s coverage of the first Moon landing in earned the network an Emmy Award br In the late s Kintner reorganized the chain of command at the network making Bill McAndrew president of NBC News reporting directly to Kintner McAndrew served in that position until his death in McAndrew was succeeded by his Executive Vice President Producer Reuven Frank who held the position until br On November NBC interrupted various programs on its affiliate stations at p m to announce that President John F Kennedy had been shot in Dallas Texas Eight minutes later at p m NBC broke into programming with a network bumper slide and Chet Huntley Bill Ryan and Frank McGee informing the viewers what was going on as it happened but since a camera was not in service the reports were audio only However NBC did not begin broadcasting over the air until p m ET About minutes later after word came that JFK was pronounced dead NBC suspended regular programming and carried hours of uninterrupted news coverage of the assassination and the funeral of the president including the only live broadcast of the fatal shooting of Kennedy s assassin Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby as Oswald was being led in handcuffs by law enforcement officials through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters br br br NBC Nightly News era br br NBC s ratings lead began to slip toward the end of the s and fell sharply when Chet Huntley retired in he died of cancer four years later in The loss of Huntley along with a reluctance by RCA to fund NBC News at a similar level as CBS was funding its news division left NBC News in the doldrums NBC s primary news show gained its present title NBC Nightly News on August br The network tried a platoon of anchors Brinkley McGee and John Chancellor during the early months of Nightly News Despite the efforts of the network s eventual lead anchor the articulate even toned Chancellor and an occasional first place finish in the Nielsens Nightly News in the s was primarily a strong second By the end of the decade NBC had to contend not only with a powerful CBS but also a surging ABC led by Roone Arledge Tom Brokaw became sole anchor in after co anchoring with Roger Mudd for a year and began leading NBC s efforts In and NBC won the top spot in the Nielsens for the first time in years only to fall back when Nielsen s ratings methodology changed In late Nightly News again moved into first place a spot it has held onto in most of the succeeding years Brian Williams assumed primary anchor duties when Brokaw retired in December In February NBC suspended Williams for six months for telling an inaccurate story about his experience in the invasion of Iraq He was replaced by Lester Holt on an interim basis On June it was announced that Holt would become the permanent anchor and Williams would be moved to MSNBC as an anchor of breaking news and special reports beginning in August br br In Dateline NBC broadcast an investigative report about the safety of General Motors GM trucks GM discovered the actual footage utilized in the broadcast had been rigged by the inclusion of explosive incendiaries attached to the gas tanks and the use of improper sealants for those tanks GM subsequently filed an anti defamation lawsuit against NBC which publicly admitted the results of the tests were rigged and settled the lawsuit with GM on the very same day br On October Nightly News moved into its new high definition studios at Studio C at NBC Studios in Rockefeller Plaza in New York City The network s hour cable network MSNBC joined the network in New York on that day as well The new studios headquarters for NBC News and MSNBC are now located in one area br br br br br During the financial crisis of NBC News was urged to save million by NBC Universal On that occasion NBC News laid off several of its in house reporters such as Kevin Corke Jeannie Ohm and Don Teague This was the largest layoff in NBC News history br After the sudden death of the influential moderator Tim Russert of Meet the Press in June Tom Brokaw took over as an interim host and on December David Gregory became the new moderator of the show until August when NBC announced that NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd would take over as the th moderator of Meet the Press starting September David Gregory s last broadcast was August br By NBC had established leadership in network news airing the highest rated morning evening and Sunday interview news programs Its ability to share costs with MSNBC and share in the cable network s advertising and subscriber revenue made it far more profitable than its network rivals br br On March NBC News broadcast an edited segment from a call placed by George Zimmerman before he shot Trayvon Martin The editing made it appear that Zimmerman volunteered that Martin was black rather than merely responding to the dispatcher s inquiry which would support a view that the shooting was racially motivated A media watchdog organization accused NBC News of engaging in an all out falsehood While NBC News initially declined to comment the news agency did issue an apology to viewers The Washington Post called the statement skimpy on the details on just how the mistake unfolded br On December NBC News reporter Richard Engel and his five crew members Aziz Akyava Ghazi Balkiz John Kooistra Ian Rivers and Ammar Cheikh Omar were kidnapped in Syria Having escaped after five days in captivity Engel said he believed that a Shabiha group loyal to al Assad was behind the abduction and that the crew was freed by the Ahrar al Sham group five days later Engel s account was however challenged from early on In April NBC had to revise the kidnapping account following further investigations by The New York Times which suggested that the NBC team was almost certainly taken by a Sunni criminal element affiliated with the Free Syrian Army rather than by a loyalist Shia group br In John Lapinski was Director of Elections replacing Sheldon Gawiser In the election team s decision desk group was given its first permanent space at Rockefeller replacing the News Sales Archives that had occupied the space previously br The NBC News Division was the first news team to possess the tape of Donald Trump recorded by Access Hollywood after a producer of the NBC show had made the News Division aware of it the News Division internally debated publishing it for three days and then an unidentified source gave a copy of the tape to The Washington Post Reporter David Fahrenthold who contacted NBC for comment notified the Trump campaign that he had the video obtained confirmation of its authenticity and released a story and the tape itself scooping NBC Alerted that the Post might release the story immediately NBC News released its own story shortly after the Post story was published br br br Sexual misconduct and NBC News br br On November NBC News announced that Matt Lauer s employment had been terminated after an unidentified female NBC employee reported that Lauer had sexually harassed her during the Winter Olympics in Sochi Russia and that the harassment continued after they returned to New York NBC News management said it had been aware that The New York Times and Variety had been conducting independent investigations of Lauer s behavior but that management had been unaware of previous allegations against Lauer Linda Vester a former NBC News correspondent disputed the claims that management knew nothing saying that everybody knew that Lauer was dangerous According to Ronan Farrow multiple sources have stated that NBC News was not only aware of Lauer s misconduct beforehand but that Harvey Weinstein used this knowledge to pressure them into killing a story that would have outed his own sexual misconduct Variety reported allegations by at least ten of Lauer s current and former colleagues Additional accusations went public in the ensuing days br NBC News President Noah Oppenheim suggested an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein after NBC contributor Ronan Farrow pitched a general idea to report on sexual harassment in Hollywood After a month investigation by Farrow and NBC Producer Rich McHugh NBC chose not to publish it The story with very few changes was published a few weeks later in the New Yorker Magazine instead A story on the subject of Weinstein s alleged behavior also appeared several days earlier in The New York Times Following criticism for missing a major story it had initiated NBC News defended the decision saying that at the time Farrow was at NBC the early reporting still had important missing necessary elements Farrow later disputed this characterization saying that he had multiple named accusers willing to come forward and that the version ultimately published in the New Yorker had very few changes from the version that NBC News rejected This version went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in April A former NBC News executive has said that the story on Weinstein was killed because NBC News was aware of the sexual misconduct by Lauer in Catch and Kill Lies Spies and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators Ronan Farrow cites two sources within American Media Inc stating that the story was killed in response to an overt threat from Weinstein to out Lauer br br br Hiring of Ronna McDaniel br In March NBC News hired Ronna McDaniel the former chairwoman of the Republican National Committee RNC from to The hire stirred controversy as McDaniel had been a staunch Donald Trump loyalist during her tenure at the RNC She made false claims of voter fraud after Joe Biden won the presidential election which she sought to overturn br After she was hired by NBC McDaniel backtracked on her claims saying that Biden won the election fair and square and condemned political violence She said of her conduct as RNC chair When you re the RNC chair you you kind of take one for the whole team right Now I get to be a little bit more myself br br br Reversal of hiring br After a day of on air protests by various MSNBC anchors including Rachel Maddow Mika Brzezinski Joe Scarborough Chuck Todd and Nicolle Wallace NBC announced on March that McDaniel will not be hired by the network br br br Presidents br Thirteen people have served as president of NBC News during its history William R McAndrew managed since named president Reuven Frank Richard Wald Lester Crystal William J Small Lawrence Grossman Michael Gartner Andrew Lack Neal Shapiro and Steve Capus March In August Deborah Turness assumed the role as President of NBC News becoming the first woman to head the division In

most properties not pertaining to the NBC television network thus ending its direct participation in the radio business NBC Radio Network s news operation was merged into the Mutual Broadcasting System then into Westwood One s then corporate sibling CBS Radio and eventually assimilated into the syndicator itself br For years Westwood One has carried on syndicating several NBC branded shows to affiliate radio stations including audio versions of current affairs NBC TV shows such as Meet the Press a practice that continues to date As for hard news programming Westwood One used to provide an homonymous NBC News Radio service which was initially limited to a feed of one hour reports updated from a m to p m ET offered to subscriber local stations Dial Global which has branded itself
