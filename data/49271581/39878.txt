title: Domain name
id: 39878
In the Internet a domain name is a string that identifies a realm of administrative autonomy authority or control Domain names are often used to identify services provided through the Internet such as websites email services and more Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application specific naming and addressing purposes In general a domain name identifies a network domain or an Internet Protocol IP resource such as a personal computer used to access the Internet or a server computer br Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System DNS Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name Domain names are organized in subordinate levels subdomains of the DNS root domain which is nameless The first level set of domain names are the top level domains TLDs including the generic top level domains gTLDs such as the prominent domains com info net edu and org and the country code top level domains ccTLDs Below these top level domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second level and third level domain names that are typically open for reservation by end users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run websites br The registration of a second or third level domain name is usually administered by a domain name registrar who sell its services to the public br A fully qualified domain name FQDN is a domain name that is completely specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the DNS having no parts omitted Traditionally a FQDN ends in a dot to denote the top of the DNS tree Labels in the Domain Name System are case insensitive and may therefore be written in any desired capitalization method but most commonly domain names are written in lowercase in technical contexts br br br Purpose br Domain names serve to identify Internet resources such as computers networks and services with a text based label that is easier to memorize than the numerical addresses used in the Internet protocols A domain name may represent entire collections of such resources or individual instances Individual Internet host computers use domain names as host identifiers also called hostnames The term hostname is also used for the leaf labels in the domain name system usually without further subordinate domain name space Hostnames appear as a component in Uniform Resource Locators URLs for Internet resources such as websites e g en wikipedia org br Domain names are also used as simple identification labels to indicate ownership or control of a resource Such examples are the realm identifiers used in the Session Initiation Protocol SIP the Domain Keys used to verify DNS domains in e mail systems and in many other Uniform Resource Identifiers URIs br An important function of domain names is to provide easily recognizable and memorizable names to numerically addressed Internet resources This abstraction allows any resource to be moved to a different physical location in the address topology of the network globally or locally in an intranet Such a move usually requires changing the IP address of a resource and the corresponding translation of this IP address to and from its domain name br Domain names are used to establish a unique identity Organizations can choose a domain name that corresponds to their name helping Internet users to reach them easily br A generic domain is a name that defines a general category rather than a specific or personal instance for example the name of an industry rather than a company name Some examples of generic names are books com music com and travel info Companies have created brands based on generic names and such generic domain names may be valuable br Domain names are often simply referred to as domains and domain name registrants are frequently referred to as domain owners although domain name registration with a registrar does not confer any legal ownership of the domain name only an exclusive right of use for a particular duration of time The use of domain names in commerce may subject them to trademark law br br br History br br The practice of using a simple memorable abstraction of a host s numerical address on a computer network dates back to the ARPANET era before the advent of today s commercial Internet In the early network each computer on the network retrieved the hosts file host txt from a computer at SRI now SRI International which mapped computer hostnames to numerical addresses The rapid growth of the network made it impossible to maintain a centrally organized hostname registry and in the Domain Name System was introduced on the ARPANET and published by the Internet Engineering Task Force as RFC and RFC br The following table shows the first five com domains with the dates of their registration br br and the first five edu domains br br br Domain name space br br Today the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN manages the top level development and architecture of the Internet domain name space It authorizes domain name registrars through which domain names may be registered and reassigned br br The domain name space consists of a tree of domain names Each node in the tree holds information associated with the domain name The tree sub divides into zones beginning at the DNS root zone br br br Domain name syntax br A domain name consists of one or more parts technically called labels that are conventionally concatenated and delimited by dots such as example com br br The right most label conveys the top level domain for example the domain name www example com belongs to the top level domain com br The hierarchy of domains descends from the right to the left label in the name each label to the left specifies a subdivision or subdomain of the domain to the right For example the label example specifies a node example com as a subdomain of the com domain and www is a label to create www example com a subdomain of example com Each label may contain from to octets The empty label is reserved for the root node and when fully qualified is expressed as the empty label terminated by a dot The full domain name may not exceed a total length of ASCII characters in its textual representation br A hostname is a domain name that has at least one associated IP address For example the domain names www example com and example com are also hostnames whereas the com domain is not However other top level domains particularly country code top level domains may indeed have an IP address and if so they are also hostnames br Hostnames impose restrictions on the characters allowed in the corresponding domain name A valid hostname is also a valid domain name but a valid domain name may not necessarily be valid as a hostname br br br Top level domains br When the Domain Name System was devised in the s the domain name space was divided into two main groups of domains The country code top level domains ccTLD were primarily based on the two character territory codes of ISO country abbreviations In addition a group of seven generic top level domains gTLD was implemented which represented a set of categories of names and multi organizations These were the domains gov edu com mil org net and int These two types of top level domains TLDs are the highest level of domain names of the Internet Top level domains form the DNS root zone of the hierarchical Domain Name System Every domain name ends with a top level domain label br During the growth of the Internet it became desirable to create additional generic top level domains As of October generic top level domains and two letter country code top level domains existed In addition the ARPA domain serves technical purposes in the infrastructure of the Domain Name System br During the nd International Public ICANN Meeting in Paris in ICANN started a new process of TLD naming policy to take a significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top level domains This program envisions the availability of many new or already proposed domains as well as a new application and implementation process Observers believed that the new rules could result in hundreds of new top level domains to be registered In the program commenced and received applications By the milestone of live gTLD was reached br The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority IANA maintains an annotated list of top level domains in the DNS root zone database br For special purposes such as network testing documentation and other applications IANA also reserves a set of special use domain names This list contains domain names such as example local localhost and test Other top level domain names containing trade marks are registered for corporate use Cases include brands such as BMW Google and Canon br br br Second level and lower level domains br Below the top level domains in the domain name hierarchy are the second level domain SLD names These are the names directly to the left of com net and the other top level domains As an example in the domain example co uk co is the second level domain br Next are third level domains which are written immediately to the left of a second level domain There can be fourth and fifth level domains and so on with virtually no limitation Each label is separated by a full stop dot An example of an operational domain name with four levels of domain labels is sos state oh us sos is said to be a sub domain of state oh us and state a sub domain of oh us etc In general subdomains are domains subordinate to their parent domain An example of very deep levels of subdomain ordering are the IPv reverse resolution DNS zones e g ip arpa which is the reverse DNS resolution domain name for the IP address of a loopback interface or the localhost name br Second level or lower level depending on the established parent hierarchy domain names are often created based on the name of a company e g bbc co uk product or service e g hotmail com Below these levels the next domain name component has been used to designate a particular host server Therefore ftp example com might be an FTP server www example com would be a World Wide Web server and mail example com could be an email server each intended to perform only the implied function Modern technology allows multiple physical servers with either different cf load balancing or even identical addresses cf anycast to serve a single hostname or domain name or multiple domain names to be served by a single computer The latter is very popular in Web hosting service centers where service providers host the websites of many organizations on just a few servers br The hierarchical DNS labels or components of domain names are separated in a fully qualified name by the full stop dot br br br Internationalized domain names br br The character set allowed in the Domain Name System is based on ASCII and does not allow the representation of names and words of many languages in their native scripts or alphabets ICANN approved the Internationalized domain name IDNA system which maps Unicode strings used in application user interfaces into the valid DNS character set by an encoding called Punycode For example k benhavn eu is mapped to xn kbenhavn a eu Many registries have adopted IDNA br br br Domain name registration br br br History br The first commercial Internet domain name in the TLD com was registered on March in the name symbolics com by Symbolics Inc a computer systems firm in Cambridge Massachusetts br By fewer than com domains had been registered br In the first quarter of million domain names had been registered A large fraction of them are in the com TLD which as of December had million domain names including million online business and e commerce sites million entertainment sites million finance related sites and million sports sites As of July the com TLD had more registrations than all of the ccTLDs combined br As of December million domain names had been registered br br br Administration br The right to use a domain name is delegated by domain name registrars which are accredited by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN the organization charged with overseeing the name and number systems of the Internet In addition to ICANN each top level domain TLD is maintained and serviced technically by an administrative organization operating a registry A registry is responsible for maintaining the database of names registered within the TLD it administers The registry receives registration information from each domain name registrar authorized to assign names in the corresponding TLD and publishes the information using a special service the WHOIS protocol br Registries and registrars usually charge an annual fee for the service of delegating a domain name to a user and providing a default set of name servers Often this transaction is termed a sale or lease of the domain name and the registrant may sometimes be called an owner but no such legal relationship is actually associated with the transaction only the exclusive right to use the domain name More correctly authorized users are known as registrants or as domain holders br ICANN publishes the complete list of TLD registries and domain name registrars Registrant information associated with domain names is maintained in an online database accessible with the WHOIS protocol For most of the country code top level domains ccTLDs the domain registries maintain the WHOIS Registrant name servers expiration dates etc information br Some domain name registries often called network information centers NIC also function as registrars to end users The major generic top level domain registries such as for the com net org info domains and others use a registry registrar model consisting of hundreds of domain name registrars see lists at ICANN or VeriSign In this method of management the registry only manages the domain name database and the relationship with the registrars The registrants users of a domain name are customers of the registrar in some cases through additional layers of resellers br There are also a few other alternative DNS root providers that try to compete or complement ICANN s role of domain name administration however most of them failed to receive wide recognition and thus domain names offered by those alternative roots cannot be used universally on most other internet connecting machines without additional dedicated configurations br br br Technical requirements and process br In the process of registering a domain name and maintaining authority over the new name space created registrars use several key pieces of information connected with a domain br br Administrative contact A registrant usually designates an administrative contact to manage the domain name The administrative contact usually has the highest level of control over a domain Management functions delegated to the administrative contacts may include management of all business information such as name of record postal address and contact information of the official registrant of the domain and the obligation to conform to the requirements of the domain registry in order to retain the right to use a domain name Furthermore the administrative contact installs additional contact information for technical and billing functions br Technical contact The technical contact manages the name servers of a domain name The functions of a technical contact include assuring conformance of the configurations of the domain name with the requirements of the domain registry maintaining the domain zone records and providing continuous functionality of the name servers that leads to the accessibility of the domain name br Billing contact The party responsible for receiving billing invoices from the domain name registrar and paying applicable fees br Name servers Most registrars provide two or more name servers as part of the registration service However a registrant may specify its own authoritative name servers to host a domain s resource records The registrar s policies govern the number of servers and the type of server information required Some providers require a hostname and the corresponding IP address or just the hostname which must be resolvable either in the new domain or exist elsewhere Based on traditional requirements RFC typically a minimum of two servers is required br A domain name consists of one or more labels each of which is formed from the set of ASCII letters digits and hyphens a z A Z but not starting or ending with a hyphen The labels are case insensitive for example label is equivalent to Label or LABEL In the textual representation of a domain name the labels are separated by a full stop period br br br Business models br Domain names are often seen in analogy to real estate in that domain names are foundations on which a website can be built and the highest quality domain names like sought after real estate tend to carry significant value usually due to their online brand building potential use in advertising search engine optimization and many other criteria br A few companies have offered low cost below cost or even free domain registration with a variety of models adopted to recoup the costs to the provider These usually require that domains be hosted on their website within a framework or portal that includes advertising wrapped around the domain holder s content revenue from which allows the provider to recoup the costs Domain registrations were free of charge when the DNS was new A domain holder may provide an infinite number of subdomains in their domain For example the owner of example org could provide subdomains such as foo example org and foo bar example org to interested parties br br Many desirable domain names are already assigned and users must search for other acceptable names using Web based search features or WHOIS and dig operating system tools Many registrars have implemented domain name suggestion tools which search domain name databases and suggest available alternative domain names related to keywords provided by the user br br br Resale of domain names br br The business of resale of registered domain names is known as the domain aftermarket Various factors influence the perceived value or market value of a domain name Most of the high prize domain sales are carried out privately br br br Domain name confusion br Intercapping is often used to emphasize the meaning of a domain name because DNS names are not case sensitive Some names may be misinterpreted in certain uses of capitalization For example Who Represents a database of artists and agents chose whorepresents com which can be misread In such situations the proper meaning may be clarified by placement of hyphens when registering a domain name For instance Experts Exchange a programmers discussion site used expertsexchange com but changed its domain name to experts exchange com br br br Uses in website hosting br The domain name is a component of a uniform resource locator URL used to access websites for example br br URL http www example net index html br Top level domain net br Second level domain example br Hostname www br A domain name may point to multiple IP addresses to provide server redundancy for the services offered a feature that is used to manage the traffic of large popular websites br Web hosting services on the other hand run servers that are typically assigned only one or a few addresses while serving websites for many domains a technique referred to as virtual web hosting Such IP address overloading requires that each request identifies the domain name being referenced for instance by using the HTTP request header field Host or Server Name Indication br br br Abuse and regulation br Critics often claim abuse of administrative power over domain names Particularly noteworthy was the VeriSign Site Finder system which redirected all unregistered com and net domains to a VeriSign webpage For example at a public meeting with VeriSign to air technical concerns about Site Finder numerous people active in the IETF and other technical bodies explained how they were surprised by VeriSign s changing the fundamental behavior of a major component of Internet infrastructure not having obtained the customary consensus Site Finder at first assumed every Internet query was for a website and it monetized queries for incorrect domain names taking the user to VeriSign s search site Other applications such as many implementations of email treat a lack of response to a domain name query as an indication that the domain does not exist and that the message can be treated as undeliverable The original VeriSign implementation broke this assumption for mail because it would always resolve an erroneous domain name to that of Site Finder While VeriSign later changed Site Finder s behaviour with regard to email there was still widespread protest about VeriSign s action being more in its financial interest than in the interest of the Internet infrastructure component for which VeriSign was the steward br Despite widespread criticism VeriSign only reluctantly removed it after the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN threatened to revoke its contract to administer the root name servers ICANN published the extensive set of letters exchanged committee reports and ICANN decisions br There is also significant disquiet regarding the United States Government s political influence over ICANN This was a significant issue in the attempt to create a xxx top level domain and sparked greater interest in alternative DNS roots that would be beyond the control of any single country br Additionally there are numerous accusations of domain name front running whereby registrars when given whois queries automatically register the domain name for themselves Network Solutions has been accused of this br br br Truth in Domain Names Act br In the United States the Truth in Domain Names Act of in combination with the PROTECT Act of forbids the use of a misleading domain name with the intention of attracting Internet users into visiting Internet pornography sites br The Truth in Domain Names Act follows the more general Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act passed in aimed at preventing typosquatting and deceptive use of names and trademarks in domain names br br br Seizures br br Seizure notices br br br br br br br br br br br br br br In the early st century the US Department of Justice DOJ pursued the seizure of domain names based on the legal theory that domain names constitute property used to engage in criminal activity and thus are subject to forfeiture For example in the seizure of the domain name of a gambling website the DOJ referenced U S C and U S C d In the US government seized Liberty Reserve citing U S C a br The U S Congress passed the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act in Consumer Electronics Association vice president Michael Petricone was worried that seizure was a blunt instrument that could harm legitimate businesses After a joint operation on February the DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security claimed to have seized ten domains of websites involved in advertising and distributing child pornography but also mistakenly seized the domain name of a large DNS provider temporarily replacing websites with seizure notices br In the United Kingdom the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit PIPCU has been attempting to seize domain names from registrars without court orders br br br Suspensions br PIPCU and other UK law enforcement organisations make domain suspension requests to Nominet which they process on the basis of breach of terms and conditions Around domains are suspended annually and about of the requests originate from PIPCU br br br Property rights br Because of the economic value it represents the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the exclusive right to a domain name is protected as property under article of Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights br br br IDN variants br ICANN Business Constituency BC has spent decades trying to make IDN variants work at the second level and in the last several years at the top level Domain name variants are domain names recognized in different character encodings like a single domain presented in traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese It is an Internationalization and localization problem Under Domain Name Variants the different encodings of the domain name in simplified and traditional Chinese would resolve to the same host br According to John Levine an expert on Internet related topics Unfortunately variants don t work The problem isn t putting them in the DNS it s that once they re in the DNS they don t work anywhere else br br br Fictitious domain name br A fictitious domain name is a domain name used in a work of fiction or popular culture to refer to a domain that does not actually exist often with invalid or unofficial top level domains such as web a usage exactly analogous to the dummy telephone number prefix used in film and other media The canonical fictitious domain name is example com specifically set aside by IANA in RFC for such use along with the example TLD br Domain names used in works of fiction have often been registered in the DNS either by their creators or by cybersquatters attempting to profit from it This phenomenon prompted NBC to purchase the domain name Hornymanatee com after talk show host Conan O Brien spoke the name while ad libbing on his show O Brien subsequently created a website based on the concept and used it as a running gag on the show br br br Misspelled domain names br br Misspelled domain names also known as typosquatting or URL hijacking are domain names that are intentionally or unintentionally misspelled versions of popular or well known domain names The goal of misspelled domain names is to capitalize on internet users who accidentally type in a misspelled domain name and are then redirected to a different website br Misspelled domain names are often used for malicious purposes such as phishing scams or distributing malware In some cases the owners of misspelled domain names may also attempt to sell the domain names to the owners of the legitimate domain names or to individuals or organizations who are interested in capitalizing on the traffic generated by internet users who accidentally type in the misspelled domain names br To avoid being caught by a misspelled domain name internet users should be careful to type in domain names correctly and should avoid clicking on links that appear suspicious or unfamiliar Additionally individuals and organizations who own popular or well known domain names should consider registering common misspellings of their domain names in order to prevent others from using them for malicious purposes br br br Domain name spoofing br The term Domain name spoofing or simply though less accurately Domain spoofing is used generically to describe one or more of a class of phishing attacks that depend on falsifying or misrepresenting an internet domain name These are designed to persuade unsuspecting users into visiting a web site other than that intended or opening an email that is not in reality from the address shown or apparently shown Although website and email spoofing attacks are more widely known any service that relies on domain name resolution may be compromised br br br Types br There are a number of better known types of domain spoofing br br Typosquatting also called URL hijacking a sting site or a fake URL is a form of cybersquatting and possibly brandjacking which relies on mistakes such as typos made by Internet users when inputting a website address into a web browser or composing an email address Should a user accidentally enter an incorrect domain name they may be led to any URL including an alternative website owned by a cybersquatter br The typosquatter s URL will usually be one of five kinds all similar to the victim site address br A common misspelling or foreign language spelling of the intended site br A misspelling based on a typographical error br A plural of a singular domain name br A different top level domain i e com instead of org br An abuse of the Country Code Top Level Domain ccTLD cm co or om instead of com br br IDN homograph attack This type of attack depends on registering a domain name that is similar to the target domain differing from it only because its spelling includes one or more characters that come from a different alphabet but look the same to the naked eye For example the Cyrillic Latin and Greek alphabets each have their own letter A each of which has its own binary code point Turkish has a dotless letter i that may not be perceived as different from the ASCII letter i Most web browsers warn of mixed alphabet domain names Other services such as email applications may not provide the same protection Reputable top level domain and country code domain registrars will not accept applications to register a deceptive name but this policy cannot be presumed to be infallible br DNS spoofing Cyberattack using corrupt DNS data br Website spoofing Creating a website as a hoax with the intention
