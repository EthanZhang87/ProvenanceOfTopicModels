vulnerable to online brute force attacks br In December Telegram launched a Bugs and Suggestions platform where users can submit bug reports and suggestion cards for new features Others can then vote and comment on the cards br br br Architecture br br br Privacy br br For encrypted chats branded as Secret Chats Telegram uses a custom built symmetric encryption scheme called MTProto The protocol was developed by Nikolai Durov and other developers at Telegram and as of version is based on bit symmetric AES encryption bit RSA encryption and Diffie Hellman key exchange br MTProto was deprecated in favor of MTProto in December which was deployed in Telegram clients as of v br Version was proven formally correct in December by a team from the University of Udine Italy The team reviewed the protocol after realizing that they could only find in depth verifications done of version where most criticisms were levied They used ProVerif a verifier based on the symbolic Dolev Yao model In the published paper they provide a fully automated proof of the soundness of MTProto s protocols for authentication normal chat end to end encrypted chat and re keying mechanisms with respect to several security properties including authentication integrity confidentiality and perfect forward secrecy MTProto is assumed to be a perfect authenticated encryption scheme IND CCA and INT CTXT br However the team also stated that because all communication including plaintext and ciphertext passes through Telegram servers and because the server is responsible for choosing Diffie Hellman parameters the server should not be considered as trusted They also concluded that a man in the middle attack is possible if users fail to check the fingerprints of their shared keys Finally they qualified their conclusion with the caveat that properties need to be formally proved in order to deem MTProto definitely secure This proof cannot be done in a symbolic model like ProVerif s but it can be achieved in a computational model using tools like CryptoVerif or EasyCrypt br br br Servers br As with most instant messaging protocols Telegram uses centralized servers Telegram Messenger LLP has servers in a number of countries throughout the world to improve the response time of their service Telegram s server side software is closed source and proprietary Pavel Durov said that it would require a major architectural redesign of the server side software to connect independent servers to the Telegram cloud br For users who signed in from the European Economic Area EEA or United Kingdom the General Data Protection Regulations GDPR are supported by storing data only on servers in the Netherlands and designating a London based company as their responsible data controller br br br Clients br

Vorbis Opus and AAC for audio br In the Telegram team announced a direct build of its Android app Telegram for Android is available directly from the Telegram website It is automatically updated and will most likely get new versions faster than the apps in the Play Store and App Store A distinctive feature of this version is the ability to view channels groups on a specific topic without censorship which cannot be viewed from an app distributed from Google Play or the Apple Store due to their policies br Common specifications br br No cloud backup option for secret chat br br br APIs br Telegram has public APIs with which developers can access the same functionality as Telegram s official apps to build their own messaging applications In February creators of the unofficial WhatsApp client released the Telegram Plus app later renamed to Plus Messenger after their original project got a cease and desist order from WhatsApp In September Samsung released a messaging application based on these APIs br Telegram also offers an API that allows developers to create bots which are accounts controlled by programs Such bots are used among other things to emulate and play old games in the app and inform users about vaccine availability for COVID br In addition Telegram offers functions for making payments directly within the platform alongside an external service such as Stripe br br br Business br The company was initially supported by founding CEO Pavel Durov s personal funds after the sale of his stake in VK In January it launched a private placement and collected billion from investors such as Kleiner Perkins Sequoia Capital and Benchmark After the shutdown of the TON project the company needed to repay the investors the money that was not spent on its development during and the beginning of while the project was active br On March Telegram conducted a five year public bonds placement worth billion The funding was required to cover the debts amounting to million including million to investors who bought futures for Gram tokens in and included purchasers such as David Yakobashvili On March Telegram also sold additional bonds worth million to the Abu Dhabi Mubadala Investment Company and Abu Dhabi Catalyst Partners A day later the Mubadala Investment Company stated that Russia s sovereign wealth fund participated in its deal undisclosed through the Russia UAE joint investment platform to buy convertible bonds A Telegram spokesperson stated RDIF is not in the list of investors we sold bonds to We wouldn t be open to any transaction with this fund and t he funds that did invest including Mubadala confirmed to us that RDIF was not among their LPs limited partners According to the contract the holders of the bonds will be provided with an option to convert them to shares at a discount if the company conducts an open IPO Durov stated that the move aimed to enable Telegram to continue growing globally while sticking to its values and remaining independent According to press reports prior to the bonds placement Durov had rejected an investment offer for a stake in the company as well as several undisclosed ones valuing the company in a billion range In March Telegram sold an additional million in bonds Durov said the bond sale will further solidify our position as an independent platform that is able to challenge the Goliaths of our industry br br br Advertising and monetization br Telegram has stated that the company will never serve advertisements in private chats In late Durov announced that the company was working on its own ad platform and would integrate non targeted ads in public one to many channels that already were selling and displaying ads in the form of regular messages Ads from Telegram s Sponsored Messages platform began to appear in channels with more than followers in October br In late Durov announced that Telegram will consider adding paid features aimed at enterprise clients According to him these features will require more bandwidth and the added cost will be covered by the feature prices in addition to covering some of the costs incurred by regular users br br br Pay per view bots br In Telegram canceled a bot monetization upgrade program because Apple demanded a cut br br br TON Telegram Open Network br br In in an attempt to monetize Telegram without advertising the company began the development of a blockchain platform dubbed either The Open Network or Telegram Open Network TON and its native cryptocurrency Gram The project was announced in mid December and its page technical paper became available in January The codebase behind TON was developed by Pavel Durov s brother Nikolai Durov the core developer of Telegram s MTProto protocol In January a page white paper and a detailed page technical paper for TON blockchain became available br Durov planned to power TON with the existing Telegram user base and turn it into the largest blockchain and a platform for apps and services akin to a decentralized WeChat Google Play and App Store Besides the TON had the potential to become a decentralized alternative to Visa and MasterCard due to its ability to scale and support millions of transactions per second In January and February the company ran a private sale of futures contracts for Grams raising around billion No public offering took place br The development of TON took place in a completely isolated manner and the release was postponed several times The test network was launched in January The launch of the TON main network was scheduled for October On October the U S Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a temporary restrictive order to prevent the distribution of Grams to initial purchasers the regulator considered the legal scheme employed by Telegram as an unregistered securities offering with initial buyers acting as underwriters br The judge hearing the Telegram v SEC case P Kevin Castel ultimately agreed with the SEC s argument and kept the restrictions on Gram distribution in force The ban applied to non U S based purchasers as well because Telegram could not prevent the re sale of Grams to U S citizens on a secondary market as the anonymity of users was one of the key features of TON Following that Durov announced the end of Telegram s active involvement with TON On June the judge approved the settlement between Telegram and SEC The company agreed to pay an million penalty and return billion to Gram purchasers In March Telegram launched a bonds offering to cover the debt and fund further growth of the app br br br Criticism br Due to Telegram s mixed nature as both a private communication method and a social media like platform with mass groups and channels along with its minimal restrictions on content with only calls to violence illegal forms of pornography and scamming forbidden the platform has been used by organizations and large groups for recruitment and spreading of their agenda Organized use of the app has been linked to pro democracy protests in Belarus Russia Hong Kong and Iran as well as to the dissemination of state propaganda and violent rhetoric in oppressive regimes the promotion of extremist views and the digitalization of services provided by government entities and private businesses br The app has been criticized by numerous research institutions and internet monitoring bodies due to violent organizations like ISIS Proud Boys and the Myanmar junta using the app to communicate both privately between members and publicly

and channels for doxing citizens and warmongering propaganda br br br ISIS br In September in response to a question about the use of Telegram by Islamic State ISIS Pavel Durov stated I think that privacy ultimately and our right for privacy is more important than our fear of bad things happening like terrorism Durov sarcastically suggested to ban words because terrorists use them for communication ISIS recommended Telegram to its supporters and members and in October they were able to double the number of followers of their official channel to In November Telegram announced that it had blocked public channels operated by ISIS for spreading its propaganda and mass communication Telegram stated that it would block public channels and bots that are related to terrorism but it

encryption debate and encrypted messaging applications faced new scrutiny br In August French anti terrorism investigators asserted that the two ISIS directed terrorists who murdered a priest in Saint tienne du Rouvray in Normandy France and videoed the murder had communicated via Telegram and used the app to coordinate their plans for the attack ISIS s media wing subsequently posted a video on Telegram showing the pair pledging allegiance A CNN news report stated that Telegram had become known as a preferred means of communication for the terror group ISIS and was used by the ISIS cell that plotted the Paris terror attacks in November after the attacks Daily Mirror called Telegram a jihadi messaging app br In June the Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor hinted at the possibility of a blocking of Telegram in Russia due to its usage by terrorists br In July Director General of Application and Informatics of the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Informatics

removed them The League also points to the RapeWaffen Division channel which openly advocates rape and murder as part of a race war br Telegram has also been used by the alt right organization Proud Boys to coordinate throughout the United States In the United Kingdom Telegram is one of the main platforms for far right publication TR news maintained by Tommy Robinson and Britain First whose pages

telecommunications fraud for Mandarin speakers and human trafficking for mainland Chinese br In March the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Telegram to allocate resources to identify prevent and mitigate human rights abuses on its platform As of March Telegram had blocked at least pro military accounts br br br Fraudulent jobs br Telegram has received criticism for its failure to curb fraud on the platform The most common mode of fraud involves scammers sending messages to unsuspecting users offering part time online jobs which comprise a series of tasks Scammers employ a variety of confidence tricks to entice users into completing prepaid tasks in which users deposit money into scammers accounts with the expectation of receiving high returns br In July Hyderabad Police uncovered a fraud wherein Indian citizens were duped out of crore US million in less than a year all related to prepaid tasks on Telegram a cybercrime police investigation of the money trail revealed that the fraud originated from China and the money was laundered by mules through cryptocurrency wallets br In September the Singapore Police stated that more than Singaporeans had lost over S million US million to prepaid job scams on Telegram and WhatsApp since the start of the year br br br Copyright infringement br In March a judge of Spain s Audiencia Nacional ordered the temporary blocking of Telegram in the country The order came following a complaint from media organizations Mediaset Atresmedia y Movistar Plus saying that the app allowed users to share copyrighted content without their consent A few days later and after several criticism the same judge suspended his order until the police issue a report on the consequences that this measure would have for users Finally the judge annulled the order considering it disproportionate br br br Reception br Channels have been used by celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and politicians President of France Emmanuel Macron former President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo an President of Moldova Maia Sandu President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy Mexican President Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong former US President Donald Trump President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev former Taiwan President Tsai Ing wen Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others br br br Security br Telegram s security model has received notable criticism by cryptography experts They criticized how unless modified first the default general security model stores all contacts messages and media together with their decryption keys on its servers continuously and that it does not enable end to end encryption for messages by default Pavel Durov has argued that this is because it helps to avoid third party unsecured backups and to allow users to access messages and files from any device Criticisms were also aimed at Telegram s use of a custom designed encryption protocol However in December a study titled Automated Symbolic Verification of Telegram s MTProto was published confirming the security of the updated MTProto and reviewing it while pointing out several theoretical vulnerabilities The paper provides fully automated proof of the soundness of MTProto s authentication normal chat end to end encrypted chat and re keying mechanisms with respect to several security properties including authentication integrity confidentiality and perfect forward secrecy and proves the formal correctness of MTProto This partially addresses the concern about the lack of scrutiny while confirming the formal security of the protocol s latest version br The desktop clients excluding the macOS client do not feature options for end to end encrypted messages When the user assigns a local password in the desktop application data is locally encrypted also Telegram has defended the lack of ubiquitous end to end encryption by claiming the online backups that do not use client side encryption are the most secure solution currently possible br In May critics disputed claims by Telegram that it is more secure than mass market messengers like WhatsApp and Line as WhatsApp claims to apply end to end encryption to all of its traffic by default and uses the Signal Protocol which has been reviewed and endorsed by leading security experts while Telegram does neither and stores all messages media and contacts in their cloud Since July Line has also applied end to end encryption to all of its messages by default though it has also been criticized for being susceptible to replay attacks and the lack of forward secrecy between clients br In an author on the Russian programming website Habr discovered a weakness in the first version of MTProto that would allow an attacker to mount a man in the middle attack and prevent the victim from being alerted by a changed key fingerprint The bug was fixed on the day of the publication with a payout to the author and a statement on Telegram s official blog br On February the German consumer organization Stiftung Warentest evaluated several data protection aspects of Telegram along with other popular instant messaging clients Among the aspects considered were the security of the data transmission the service s terms of use the accessibility of the source code and the distribution of the app Telegram was rated problematic kritisch overall The organization was favorable to Telegram s secure chats and partially free code but criticized the mandatory transfer of contact data to Telegram s servers and the lack of an imprint or address on the service s website It noted that while the message data is encrypted on the device it could not analyse the transmission due to a lack of source code br The Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF listed Telegram on its Secure Messaging Scorecard in February Telegram s default chat function received a score of out of points on the scorecard It received points for having communications encrypted in transit having its code open to independent review having the security design properly documented and having completed a recent independent security audit Telegram s default chat function missed points because the communications were not encrypted with keys the provider did not have access to users could not verify contacts identities and past messages were not secure if the encryption keys were stolen Telegram s optional secret chat function which provides end to end encryption received a score of out of points on the scorecard The EFF said that the results should not be read as endorsements of individual tools or guarantees of their security and that they were merely indications that the projects were on the right track br In December two researchers from Aarhus University published a report in which they demonstrated that MTProto did not achieve indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack IND CCA or authenticated encryption The researchers stressed that the attack was of a theoretical nature and they did not see any way of turning the attack into a full plaintext recovery attack Nevertheless they said they saw no reason why Telegram should use a less secure encryption scheme when more secure and at least as efficient solutions exist The Telegram team responded that the flaw does not affect message security and that a future patch would address the concern Telegram released in December supports MTProto which now satisfied the conditions for IND CCA MTProto is seen by qualified cryptographers as a vast improvement to Telegram s security br In April the accounts of several Russian opposition members were hijacked by intercepting the SMS messages used for login authorization In response Telegram recommended using the optional two factor authentication feature In May the Committee to Protect Journalists and Nate Cardozo senior staff attorney at Electronic Frontier Foundation recommended against using Telegram because of its lack of end to end encryption by default and its use of non standard MTProto encryption protocol which has been publicly criticized by cryptography researchers including Matthew Green br On August Reuters reported that Iranian hackers compromised more than a dozen Telegram accounts and identified the phone numbers of million Iranian users as well as the associated user IDs Researchers said the hackers belonged to a group known as Rocket Kitten Rocket Kitten s attacks were similar to ones attributed to Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps The attackers took advantage of a programming interface built into Telegram According to Telegram these mass checks are no longer possible because of limitations introduced into its API earlier in br Login SMS messages are known to have been intercepted in Iran Russia and Germany possibly in coordination with phone or telecom companies Pavel Durov has said that Telegram users in troubled countries should enable two factor authentication by creating passwords in order to prevent this br In June Pavel Durov in an interview claimed that U S intelligence agencies tried to bribe the company s developers to weaken Telegram s encryption or install a backdoor during their visit to the U S in br In Telegram sent a message to all Iranian users stating that the Telegram Talai and Hotgram unofficial clients are not secure br In March Telegram promised that all code will be released eventually including all the various client applications Android iOS desktop etc and the server side code As of May Telegram had not published their server side source code In January Durov explained his rationale for not releasing server side code citing reasons such as inability for end users to verify that the released code is the same code run on servers and a government that wanted to acquire the server code and make a messaging app that would end competitors br On June The Intercept released leaked Telegram messages exchanged between current Brazilian Minister of Justice and former judge S rgio Moro and federal prosecutors The hypothesis is that either mobile devices were hacked by SIM swap or the targets computers were compromised The Telegram team tweeted that it was either because the user had malware or they were not using two step verification br On June Telegram confirmed that it suffered a denial of service attack which disrupted normal app functionality for approximately one hour Pavel Durov tweeted that the IP addresses used in the attack mostly came from China br In December multiple Russian businessmen suffered account takeovers that involved bypassing SMS single factor authentication Security company Group IB suggested SS mobile signalling protocol weaknesses illegal usage of surveillance equipment or telecom insider attacks br On March an Elasticsearch database holding million records containing user IDs and phone numbers of Iranian users was exposed online without a password The accounts were extracted from not Telegram but an unofficial version of Telegram in what appears to be a possibly government sanctioned fork It took days for the database to be taken down but the researchers say the data was accessed by other parties including a hacker who reported the information to a specialized forum br In September it was reported that Iran s RampantKitten ran a phishing and surveillance campaign against dissidents on Telegram The attack relied on people downloading a malware infected file from any source at which point it would replace Telegram files on the device and clone session data David Wolpoff a former Department of Defense contractor has stated that the weak link in the attack was the device itself and not any of the affected apps There s no way for a secure communication app to keep a user safe when the end devices are compromised br In July researchers from Royal Holloway University of London and ETH Zurich published an analysis of the MTProto protocol concluding that the protocol could provide a confidential and integrity protected channel for communication They also found that attackers had the theoretical ability to reorder messages coming from the client to the server though the attacker would not be able to see the content of the messages Several other theoretical vulnerabilities were reported as well in response to which Telegram released a document stating that the MITM attack on the key exchange was impossible as well as detailing the changes made to the protocol to protect from it in the future All issues were patched before the paper s publication with a security bounty paid out to the researchers br In September a Russian researcher published details about a bug with the self destruct feature that allowed the user to recover deleted photos from their own device The bug was patched prior to publication and Telegram representatives offered a bug bounty The researcher did not sign the NDA that came with the offer and did not receive the award opting to disclose the bug br In March the Norwegian National Security Authority NSM advised against the use of Telegram and TikTok on business devices especially the ones used for government related activities the assessment has been commissioned and supported by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security Emilie Enger Mehl Regarding Telegram the report cites its lack of end to end encryption by default its Russian origins and third party open source intelligence as major critical points br In July ESET reported a vulnerability allowed malicious files being sent to users masked in multimedia br br br Cryptography contests br Telegram has organized two cryptography contests to challenge its own security Third parties were asked to break the service s cryptography and disclose the information contained within a secret chat between two computer controlled users A reward of respectively US and US was offered Both of these contests expired with no winners Security researcher Moxie Marlinspike founder of the competing Signal messenger and commenters on Hacker News criticized the first contest for being rigged or framed in Telegram s favor and said that Telegram s statements on the value of these contests as proof of the cryptography s quality are misleading This was because the cryptography contest could not be won even with completely broken algorithms such as MD hash function used as key stream extractor and primitives such as the Dual EC DRBG that is known to be backdoored br br br Censorship br br Telegram has been blocked temporarily or permanently by some governments including Iran China Brazil and Pakistan The Russian government blocked Telegram for several years before lifting the ban in The company s founder has said he wants the app to have an anti censorship tool for Iran and China similar to the app s role in fighting censorship in Russia On April Apple removed Telegram from the App Store in China br br br Puerto Rico Telegramgate br br Telegram was the main subject surrounding the Puerto Rico riots that ended up in the resignation of then Governor Ricardo Rossell Hundreds of pages of a group chat between Rossell and members of his staff were leaked The messages were considered vulgar racist and homophobic with members of the chat discussing how they would use the media to target potential political opponents br br br shutdown of Russian political bots br In September prior to the regional elections in Russia Telegram suspended several bots spreading information about the election including a bot run by the opposition party and critics of incumbent president Vladimir Putin s government citing election silence as the reason though a blog post by the company s CEO implied the company was following Apple and Google which dictate the rules of the game to developers The blocking of the main Smart Voting bot was criticized by allies of Alexei Navalny a Kremlin critic and former opposition leader Navalny s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh called the block and the deletion of the tactical voting app from app stores censorship imposed by private companies In a later blog post Durov directly stated that the block was a result of pressure from Google and Apple as refusal to comply with their policies would result in an immediate shutdown of Telegram for millions of users The post included a screenshot showing an internal email sent by the App Store to developers demanding the takedown of content related to Navalny br br br Delhi High Court ruling br On November following an order by the Delhi High Court Telegram was ordered to disclose the admin names phone numbers and IP addresses of channels accused of unauthorised sharing of national exam study materials Telegram originally argued that its regional servers were located in Singapore and thus no data could be disclosed as the local laws prohibit it br br br See also br Alt tech br Comparison of cross platform instant messaging clients br Internet privacy br Secure instant messaging br br br br br
