id: 54361
Neo Nazism comprises the post World War II militant social and political movements that seek to revive and reinstate Nazi ideology Neo Nazis employ their ideology to promote hatred and racial supremacy often white supremacy to attack racial and ethnic minorities often antisemitism and Islamophobia and in some cases to create a fascist state br Neo Nazism is a global phenomenon with organized representation in many countries and international networks It borrows elements from Nazi doctrine including antisemitism ultranationalism racism xenophobia ableism homophobia anti communism and creating a Fourth Reich Holocaust denial is common in neo Nazi circles br Neo Nazis regularly display Nazi symbols and express admiration for Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders In some European and Latin American countries laws prohibit the expression of pro Nazi racist antisemitic or homophobic views Nazi related symbols are banned in many European countries especially Germany in an effort to curtail neo Nazism br br br Definition br The term neo Nazism describes any post World War II militant social or political movements seeking to revive the ideology of Nazism in whole or in part br The term neo Nazism can also refer to the ideology of these movements which may borrow elements from Nazi doctrine including ultranationalism anti communism racism ableism xenophobia homophobia antisemitism up to initiating the Fourth Reich Holocaust denial is a common feature as is the incorporation of Nazi symbols and admiration of Adolf Hitler br Neo Nazism is considered a particular form of far right politics and right wing extremism br br br Hyperborean racial doctrine br br Neo Nazi writers have posited a spiritual esoteric doctrine of race which moves beyond the primarily Darwinian inspired materialist scientific racism popular mainly in the Anglosphere during the th century Figures influential in the development of neo Nazi racism such as Miguel Serrano and Julius Evola writers who are described by critics of Nazism such as the Southern Poverty Law Center as influential within what it presents as parts of the bizarre fringes of National Socialism past and present claim that the Hyperborean ancestors of the Aryans were in the distant past far higher beings than their current state having suffered from involution due to mixing with the Telluric peoples supposed creations of the Demiurge Within this theory if the Aryans are to return to the Golden Age of the distant past they need to awaken the memory of the blood An extraterrestrial origin of the Hyperboreans is often claimed These theories draw influence from Gnosticism and Tantrism building on the work of the Ahnenerbe Within this racist theory Jews are held up as the antithesis of nobility purity and beauty br br br Ecology and environmentalism br Neo Nazism generally aligns itself with a blood and soil variation of environmentalism which has themes in common with deep ecology the organic movement and animal protectionism This tendency sometimes called ecofascism was represented in the original German Nazism by Richard Walther Darr who was the Reichsminister of Food from until br br br History br br br Germany and Austria s br Following the defeat of Nazi Germany the political ideology of the ruling party Nazism was in complete disarray The final leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party NSDAP was Martin Bormann He died on May during the Battle of Berlin but the Soviet Union did not reveal his death to the rest of the world and his ultimate fate remained a mystery for many years Conspiracy theories emerged about Hitler himself that he had secretly survived the war and fled to South America or elsewhere br The Allied Control Council officially dissolved the NSDAP on October marking the end of Old Nazism A process of denazification began and the Nuremberg trials took place where many major leaders and ideologues were condemned to death by October others committed suicide br br In both the East and West surviving ex party members and military veterans assimilated to the new reality and had no interest in constructing a neo Nazism However during the West German elections a number of Nazi advocates such as Fritz R ssler had infiltrated the national conservative Deutsche Rechtspartei which had members elected R ssler and others left to found the more radical Socialist Reich Party SRP under Otto Ernst Remer At the onset of the Cold War the SRP favoured the Soviet Union over the United States br In Austria national independence had been restored and the Verbotsgesetz explicitly criminalised the NSDAP and any attempt at restoration West Germany adopted a similar law to target parties it defined as anti constitutional Article Paragraph in the Basic Law banning the SRP in for being opposed to liberal democracy br As a consequence some members of the nascent movement of German neo Nazism joined the Deutsche Reichspartei of which Hans Ulrich Rudel was the most prominent figure Younger members founded the Wiking Jugend modelled after the Hitler Youth The Deutsche Reichspartei stood for elections from until fetching around of the vote each time Rudel befriended French born Savitri Devi who was a proponent of Esoteric Nazism In the s she wrote a number of books such as Pilgrimage which concerns prominent Third Reich sites and The Lightning and the Sun in which she claims that Adolf Hitler was an avatar of the God Vishnu She was not alone in this reorientation of Nazism towards its Thulean roots the Artgemeinschaft founded by former SS member Wilhelm Kusserow attempted to promote a new paganism br In the German Democratic Republic East Germany a former member of SA Wilhelm Adam founded the National Democratic Party of Germany It reached out to those attracted by the Nazi Party before and provide them with a political outlet so that they would not be tempted to support the far right again or turn to the anti communist Western Allies Joseph Stalin wanted to use them to create a new pro Soviet and anti Western strain in German politics According to top Soviet diplomat Vladimir Semyonov Stalin even suggested that they could be allowed to continue publishing their own newspaper V lkischer Beobachter While in Austria former SS member Wilhelm Lang founded an esoteric group known as the Vienna Lodge he popularised Nazism and occultism such as the Black Sun and ideas of Third Reich survival colonies below the polar ice caps br br With the onset of the Cold War the allied forces had lost interest in prosecuting anyone as part of the denazification In the mid s this new political environment allowed Otto Strasser an NS activist on the left of the NSDAP who had founded the Black Front to return from exile In Strasser founded the German Social Union as a Black Front successor promoting a Strasserite nationalist and socialist policy which dissolved in due to lack of support Other Third Reich associated groups were the HIAG and Stille Hilfe dedicated to advancing the interests of Waffen SS veterans and rehabilitating them into the new democratic society However they did not claim to be attempting to restore Nazism instead functioning as lobbying organizations for their members before the government and the two main political parties the conservative CDU CSU and the Nazis one time archenemies the Social Democratic Party br Many bureaucrats who served under the Third Reich continued to serve in German administration after the war According to the Simon Wiesenthal Center many of the more than Nazi war criminals recorded in German files were serving in positions of prominence under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer Not until the s were the former concentration camp personnel prosecuted by West Germany in the Belzec trial Frankfurt Auschwitz trials Treblinka trials Che mno trials and the Sobib r trial However the government had passed laws prohibiting Nazis from publicly expressing their beliefs br br br Universal National Socialism s s br br Neo Nazism found expression outside of Germany including in countries who fought against the Third Reich during the Second World War and sometimes adopted pan European or universal characteristics beyond the parameters of German nationalism The two main tendencies with differing styles and even worldviews were the followers of the American Francis Parker Yockey who was fundamentally anti American and advocated for a pan European nationalism and those of George Lincoln Rockwell an American conservative br Yockey a neo Spenglerian author had written Imperium The Philosophy of History and Politics dedicated to the hero of the twentieth century namely Adolf Hitler and founded the European Liberation Front He was interested more in the destiny of Europe to this end he advocated a National Bolshevik esque red brown alliance against American culture and influenced s figures such as SS veteran Jean Fran ois Thiriart Yockey was also fond of Arab nationalism in particular Gamal Abdel Nasser and saw Fidel Castro s Cuban Revolution as a positive visiting officials there Yockey s views impressed Otto Ernst Remer and the radical traditionalist philosopher Julius Evola He was constantly hounded by the FBI and was eventually arrested in before committing suicide Domestically Yockey s biggest sympathisers were the National Renaissance Party including James H Madole H Keith Thompson and Eustace Mullins prot g of Ezra Pound and the Liberty Lobby of Willis Carto br Rockwell an American conservative was first politicised in the anti communism and anti racial integration movements before becoming anti Jewish In response to his opponents calling him a Nazi he theatrically appropriated the aesthetic elements of the NSDAP to own the intended insult In Rockwell founded the American Nazi Party and instructed his members to dress in imitation SA style brown shirts while flying the flag of the Third Reich In contrast to Yockey he was pro American and cooperated with FBI requests despite the party being targeted by COINTELPRO due to the mistaken belief that they were agents of Nasser s Egypt during a brief intelligence brown scare Later leaders of American white nationalism came to politics through the ANP including a teenage David Duke and William Luther Pierce of the National Alliance although they soon distanced themselves from explicit self identification with neo Nazism br In the World Union of National Socialists was founded by Rockwell and Colin Jordan of the British National Socialist Movement adopting the Cotswold Declaration French socialite Fran oise Dior was involved romantically with Jordan and his deputy John Tyndall and a friend of Savitri Devi who also attended the meeting The National Socialist Movement wore quasi SA uniforms was involved in streets conflicts with the Jewish Group In the s Tyndall s earlier involvement with neo Nazism would come back to haunt the National Front which he led as they attempted to ride a wave of anti immigration populism and concerns over British national decline Televised exposes on This Week in and World in Action in showed their neo Nazi pedigree and damaged their electoral chances In Rockwell was killed by a disgruntled former member Matthias Koehl took control of the ANP and strongly influenced by Savitri Devi gradually transformed it into an esoteric group known as the New Order br In Franco s Spain certain SS refugees most notably Otto Skorzeny L on Degrelle and the son of Klaus Barbie became associated with CEDADE C rculo Espa ol de Amigos de Europa an organisation which disseminated Third Reich apologetics out of Barcelona They intersected with neo Nazi advocates from Mark Fredriksen in France to Salvador Borrego in Mexico br In the post fascist Italian Social Movement splinter groups such as Ordine Nuovo and Avanguardia Nazionale involved in the Years of Lead considered Nazism a reference Franco Freda created a Nazi Maoist synthesis br In Germany itself the various Third Reich nostalgic movements coalesced around the National Democratic Party of Germany in and in Austria the National Democratic Party in as the primary sympathisers of the NSDAP past although more publicly cautious than earlier groups br br br Holocaust denial and subcultures s s br Holocaust denial the claim that six million Jews were not deliberately and systematically exterminated as an official policy of the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler became a more prominent feature of neo Nazism in the s Before this time Holocaust denial had long existed as a sentiment among neo Nazis but it had not yet been systematically articulated as a theory with a bibliographical canon Few of the major theorists of Holocaust denial who call themselves revisionists can be uncontroversially classified as outright neo Nazis though some works such as those of David Irving forward a clearly sympathetic view of Hitler and the publisher Ernst Z ndel was deeply tied to international neo Nazism however the main interest of Holocaust denial to neo Nazis was their hope that it would help them rehabilitate their political ideology in the eyes of the general public Did Six Million Really Die by Richard Verrall and The Hoax of the Twentieth Century by Arthur Butz are popular examples of Holocaust denial material br br Key developments in international neo Nazism during this time include the radicalisation of the Vlaamse Militanten Orde under former Hitler Youth member Bert Eriksson They began hosting an annual conference the Iron Pilgrimage at Diksmuide which drew kindred ideologues from across Europe and beyond As well as this the NSDAP AO under Gary Lauck arose in the United States in and challenged the international influence of the Rockwellite WUNS Lauck s organisation drew support from the National Socialist Movement of Denmark of Povl Riis Knudsen and various German and Austrian figures who felt that the National Democratic parties were too bourgeois and insufficiently Nazi in orientation This included Michael K hnen Christian Worch Bela Ewald Althans and Gottfried K ssel of the founded ANS NS which called for the establishment of a Germanic Fourth Reich Some ANS NS members were imprisoned for planning paramilitary attacks on NATO bases in Germany and planning to liberate Rudolf Hess from Spandau Prison The organisation was officially banned in by the Minister of the Interior br During the late s a British subculture came to be associated with neo Nazism the skinheads Portraying an ultra masculine crude and aggressive image with working class references some of the skinheads joined the British Movement under Michael McLaughlin successor of Colin Jordan while others became associated with the National Front s Rock Against Communism project which was meant to counter the SWP s Rock Against Racism The most significant music group involved in this project was Skrewdriver led by Ian Stuart Donaldson Together with ex BM member Nicky Crane Donaldson founded the international Blood Honour network in By this network with input from Harold Covington had developed a paramilitary wing Combat which intersected with football hooligan firms such as the Chelsea Headhunters The neo Nazi skinhead movement spread to the United States with groups such as the Hammerskins It was popularised from onwards by Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance Since then it has spread across the world Films such as Romper Stomper and American History X would fix a public perception that neo Nazism and skinheads were synonymous br br New developments also emerged on the esoteric level as former Chilean diplomat Miguel Serrano built on the works of Carl Jung Otto Rahn Wilhelm Landig Julius Evola and Savitri Devi to bind together and develop already existing theories Serrano had been a member of the National Socialist Movement of Chile in the s and from the early days of neo Nazism he had been in contact with key figures across Europe and beyond Despite this he was able to work as an ambassador to numerous countries until the rise of Salvador Allende In he published his book Adolf Hitler The Ultimate Avatar Serrano claimed that the Aryans were extragalactic beings who founded Hyperborea and lived the heroic life of Bodhisattvas while the Jews were created by the Demiurge and were concerned only with coarse materialism Serrano claimed that a new Golden Age can be attained if the Hyperboreans repurify their blood supposedly the light of the Black Sun and restore their blood memory As with Savitri Devi before him Serrano s works became a key point of reference in neo Nazism br br br Lifting of the Iron Curtain s present br With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union during the early s neo Nazism began to spread its ideas in the East as hostility to the triumphant liberal order was high and revanchism a widespread feeling In Russia during the chaos of the early s an amorphous mixture of KGB hardliners Orthodox neo Tsarist nostalgics i e Pamyat and explicit neo Nazis found themselves strewn together in the same camp They were united by opposition to the influence of the United States against the liberalising legacy of Mikhail Gorbachev s perestroika and on the Jewish question Soviet Zionology merged with a more explicit anti Jewish sentiment The most significant organisation representing this was Russian National Unity under the leadership of Alexander Barkashov where black uniform clad Russians marched with a red flag incorporating the Swastika under the banner of Russia for Russians These forces came together in a last gasp effort to save the Supreme Soviet of Russia against Boris Yeltsin during the Russian constitutional crisis As well as events in Russia in newly independent ex Soviet states annual commemorations for SS volunteers now took place particularly in Latvia Estonia and Ukraine br br The Russian developments excited German neo Nazism who dreamed of a Berlin Moscow alliance against the supposedly decadent Atlanticist forces a dream which had been thematic since the days of Remer Z ndel visited Russia and met with ex KGB general Aleksandr Stergilov and other Russian National Unity members Despite these initial aspirations international neo Nazism and its close affiliates in ultra nationalism would be split over the Bosnian War between and as part of the breakup of Yugoslavia The split would largely be along ethnic and sectarian lines The Germans and the French would largely back the Western Catholic Croats Lauck s NSDAP AO explicitly called for volunteers which K hnen s Free German Workers Party answered and the French formed the Groupe Jacques Doriot while the Russians and the Greeks would back the Orthodox Serbs including Russians from Barkashov s Russian National Unity Eduard Limonov s National Bolshevik Front and Golden Dawn members joined the Greek Volunteer Guard Indeed the revival of National Bolshevism was able to steal some of the thunder from overt Russian neo Nazism as ultra nationalism was wedded with veneration of Joseph Stalin in place of Adolf Hitler while still also flirting with Nazi aesthetics br br br Analogous European movements br Outside Germany in other countries which were involved with the Axis powers and had their own native ultra nationalist movements which sometimes collaborated with the Third Reich but were not technically German style National Socialists revivalist and nostalgic movements have emerged in the post war period which as neo Nazism has done in Germany seek to rehabilitate their various loosely associated ideologies These movements include neo fascists and post fascists in Italy Vichyites P tainists and national Europeans in France Usta e sympathisers in Croatia neo Chetniks in Serbia Iron Guard revivalists in Romania Hungarists and Horthyists in Hungary and others br br br Issues br br br Ex Nazis in mainstream politics br br The most significant case on an international level was the election of Kurt Waldheim to the Presidency of Austria in It came to light that Waldheim had been a member of the National Socialist German Students League the SA and served as an intelligence officer during the Second World War Following this he served as an Austrian diplomat and was the Secretary General of the United Nations from until After revelations of Waldheim s past were made by an Austrian journalist Waldheim clashed with the World Jewish Congress on the international stage Waldheim s record was defended by Bruno Kreisky an Austrian Jew who served as Chancellor of Austria The legacy of the affair lingers on as Victor Ostrovsky has claimed the Mossad doctored the file of Waldheim to implicate him in war crimes br br br Contemporary right wing populism br Some critics have sought to draw a connection between Nazism and modern right wing populism in Europe but the two are not widely regarded as interchangeable by most academics In Austria the Freedom Party of Austria FP served as a shelter for ex Nazis almost from its inception In scandals undermined Austria s two main parties and the economy stagnated J rg Haider became leader of the FP and offered partial justification for Nazism calling its employment policy effective In the Austrian election the FP won percent of the vote as well as percent of the vote in Carinthia and percent in Vienna showing that it had become a force capable of reversing the old pattern of Austrian politics br Historian Walter Laqueur writes that even though Haider welcomed former Nazis at his meetings and went out of his way to address Schutzstaffel SS veterans the FP is not a fascist party in the traditional sense since it has not made anti communism an important issue and it does not advocate the overthrow of the democratic order or the use of violence In his view the FP is not quite fascist although it is part of a tradition similar to that of th century Viennese mayor Karl Lueger which involves nationalism xenophobic populism and authoritarianism Haider who in left the Freedom Party and formed the Alliance for Austria s Future was killed in a traffic accident in October br Barbara Rosenkranz the Freedom Party s candidate in Austria s presidential election was controversial for having made allegedly pro Nazi statements Rosenkranz is married to Horst Rosenkranz a key member of a banned neo Nazi party who is known for publishing far right books Rosenkranz says she cannot detect anything dishonourable in her husband s activities br br br Around the world br br br Europe br br br Armenia br The Armenian Aryan Racialist Political Movement is a National Socialist movement in Armenia It was founded in and supports Aryanism Antisemitism and White supremacy br br br Belgium br br A Belgian neo Nazi organization Bloed Bodem Eer en Trouw Blood Soil Honour and Loyalty was created in after splitting from the international network Blood and Honour The group rose to public prominence in September after members including soldiers were arrested under the December anti terrorist laws and laws against racism antisemitism and supporters of censorship According to Justice Minister Laurette Onkelinx and Interior Minister Patrick Dewael the suspects of whom were members of the military were preparing to launch terrorist attacks in order to destabilize Belgium According to the journalist Manuel Abramowicz of the Resistances the extremists of the radical right have always had as its aim to infiltrate the state mechanisms including the army in the s and the s through Westland New Post and the Front de la Jeunesse br A police operation which mobilized agents searched five military barracks in Leopoldsburg near the Dutch border Kleine Brogel Peer Brussels Royal military school and Zedelgem as well as private addresses in Flanders They found weapons munitions explosives and a homemade bomb large enough to make a car explode The leading suspect B T was organizing the trafficking of weapons and was developing international links in particular with the Dutch far right movement De Nationale Alliantie br br br Bosnia and Herzegovina br The neo Nazi white nationalist organization Bosanski Pokret Nacionalnog Ponosa Bosnian Movement of National Pride was founded in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July Its model is the Waffen SS Handschar Division which was composed of Bosniak volunteers It proclaimed its main enemies to be Jews Roma Serbian Chetniks the Croatian separatists Josip Broz Tito Communists homosexuals and blacks Its ideology is a mixture of Bosnian nationalism National Socialism and white nationalism It says Ideologies that are not welcome in Bosnia are Zionism Islamism communism capitalism The only ideology good for us is Bosnian nationalism because it secures national prosperity and social justice The group is led by a person nicknamed Sauberzwig after the commander of the th SS Handschar The group s strongest area of operations is in the Tuzla area of Bosnia br br br Bulgaria br The primary neo Nazi political party to receive attention in post WWII Bulgaria is the Bulgarian National Union New Democracy br On February of every year since Bulgarian neo Nazis and like minded far right nationalists gather at Sofia to honor Hristo Lukov a late World War II general known for his antisemitic and pro Nazi stance From to the annual event was hosted by Bulgarian National Union br br br Croatia br br Neo Nazis in Croatia base their ideology on the writings of Ante Paveli and the Usta e a fascist anti Yugoslav separatist movement The Usta e regime committed a genocide against Serbs Jews and Roma At the end of World War II many Usta e members fled to the West where they found sanctuary and continued their political and terrorist activities which were tolerated due to Cold War hostilities br In Zagreb s Square of the Victims of Fascism was renamed Croatian Nobles Square provoking widespread criticism of Croatia s attitude towards the Holocaust In the Zagreb City Council again renamed the square into Square of the Victims of Fascism Many streets in Croatia were renamed after the prominent Usta e figure Mile Budak which provoked outrage amongst the Serbian minority Since there has been a reversal of this development and streets with the name of Mile Budak or other persons connected with the Usta e movement are few or non existent A plaque in Slunj with the inscription Croatian Knight Jure Franceti was erected to commemorate Franceti the notorious Usta e leader of the Black Legion The plaque remained there for four years until it was removed by the authorities br In Croatian penal code was amended with provisions prohibiting the public display of Nazi symbols the propagation of Nazi ideology historical revisionism and holocaust denial but the amendments were annulled in since they were not enacted in accordance with a constitutionally prescribed procedure Nevertheless since Croatian penal code explicitly prohibits any type of hate crime based on race color gender sexual orientation religion or national origin br There have been instances of hate speech in Croatia such as the use of the phrase Srbe na vrbe Hang Serbs on the willow trees In an Orthodox church was spray painted with pro Usta e graffiti During some protests in Croatia supporters of Ante Gotovina and other at the time suspected war criminals all acquitted in have carried nationalist symbols and pictures of Paveli On May a concert in Zagreb by Thompson a popular Croatian singer was attended by people some of them wearing Usta e uniforms Some gave Usta e salutes and shouted the Usta e slogan Za dom spremni For the homeland ready This event prompted the Simon Wiesenthal Center to publicly issue a protest to the Croatian president Cases of displaying Ustashe memorabilia have been recorded at the Bleiburg commemoration held annually in Austria br br br Czech Republic br br The government of the Czech Republic strictly punishes neo Nazism Czech Neonacismus According to a report by the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic neo Nazis committed more than crimes in The Czech Republic has various neo Nazi groups One of them is the group Wotan Jugend based in Germany br br br Denmark br The National Socialist Movement of Denmark was formed in and was formally a neo nazi party that would actively promote the nazi ideology in Denmark The party did not gain any political influence and were regarded as a failed political project by neo nazi expert Frede Farmand Long time party leader Johnni Hansen was replaced by Esben Rohde Kristensen in which resulted in a large amount of party members leaving the party While the party never has been formally dissolved there has been very little activity from its core member since Former neo nazi Daniel Carlsen formed the small national party Party of the Danes in which officially rejected nazism but were none the less categorized as such by professor in politics Peter Nedergaard It was dissolved in after its founder Daniel Stockholm announced retirement from politics br br br Estonia br In Roman Ilin a Jewish theatre director from St Petersburg Russia was attacked by neo Nazis when returning from a tunnel after a rehearsal Ilin subsequently accused Estonian police of indifference after filing the incident When a dark skinned French student was attacked in Tartu the head of an association of foreign students claimed that the attack was characteristic of a wave of neo Nazi violence An Estonian police official however stated that there were only a few cases involving foreign students over the previous two years In November the Estonian government passed a law banning the display of Nazi symbols br The United Nations Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur s Report noted that community representatives and non governmental organizations devoted to human rights had pointed out that neo Nazi groups were active in Estonia particularly in Tartu and had perpetrated acts of violence against non European minorities br The neo Nazi terrorist organization Feuerkrieg Division was found and operates in the country with some members of the Conservative People s Party of Estonia having been linked to the Feuerkrieg Division br br br Finland br br In Finland neo Nazism is often connected to the s and s fascist and pro Nazi Patriotic People s Movement IKL its youth movement Blues and Blacks and its predecessor Lapua Movement Post war fascist groups such as Patriotic People s Movement Patriotic People s Front Patriotic National Movement Blue and Black Movement and many others consciously copy the style of the movement and look up to its leaders as inspiration A Finns Party councillor and police officer in Sein joki caused small scandal wearing the fascist blue and black uniform br During the Cold War all partied deemed fascist were banned according to the Paris Peace Treaties and all former fascist activists had to find new political homes Despite Finlandization many continued in public life Three former members of the Waffen SS served as ministers the Finnish SS Battalion officers Sulo Suorttanen Centre Party and Pekka Malinen People s Party as well as Mikko Laaksonen Social Democrat a soldier in the Finnish SS Company formed of pro Nazi defectors Neo Nazi activism was limited to small illegal groups like the clandestine Nazi occultist group led by Pekka Siitoin who made headlines after arson and bombing of the printing houses of the Communist Party of Finland His associates also sent letter bombs to leftists including to the headquarters of the Finnish Democratic Youth League Another group called the New Patriotic People s Movement bombed the left wing Kansan Uutiset newspaper and the embassy of communist Bulgaria Member of the Nordic Realm Party Seppo Seluska was convicted of the torture and murder of a gay Jewish person br The skinhead culture gained momentum during the late s and peaked during the late s In Finland received a number of Somali immigrants who became the main target of Finnish skinhead violence in the following years including four attacks using explosives and a racist murder Asylum seeker centres were attacked in Joensuu skinheads would force their way into an asylum seeker centre and start shooting with shotguns At worst Somalis were assaulted by skinheads at the same time br The most prominent neo Nazi group is the Nordic Resistance Movement which is tied to multiple murders attempted murders and assaults of political enemies was found in and proscribed in The second biggest Finnish party the Finns Party politicians have frequently supported far right and neo Nazi movements such as the Finnish Defense League Soldiers of Odin Nordic Resistance Movement Rajat Kiinni Close the Borders and Suomi Ensin Finland First br The NRM and other far right nationalist parties organize an annual torch march demonstration in Helsinki in memory of the Finnish SS battalion on the Finnish independence day which ends at the Hietaniemi cemetery where members visit the tomb of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim and the monument to the Finnish SS Battalion The event is protested by antifascists leading to counterdemonstrators being violently assaulted by NRM members who act as security The demonstration attracts close to participants according to the estimates of the police and hundreds of officers patrol Helsinki to prevent violent clashes br br br France br br In France the most enthusiastic collaborationists during the German occupation of France had been the National Popular Rally of Marcel D at former SFIO members and the French Popular Party of Jacques Doriot former French Communist Party members These two groups like the Germans saw themselves as combining ultra nationalism and socialism In the south there existed the vassal state of Vichy France under the military Hero of the Verdun Marshal Philippe P tain whose R volution nationale emphasised an authoritarian Catholic conservative politics Following the liberation of France and the creation of the Fourth French Republic collaborators were prosecuted during the puration l gale and nearly put to death for treason under Charles de Gaulle br In the aftermath of the Second World War the main concern of the French radical right was the collapse of the French Empire in particular the Algerian War which led to the creation of the OAS Outside of this individual fascistic activists such as Maurice Bard che brother in law of Robert Brasillach as well as SS veterans Saint Loup and Ren Binet were active in France and involved in the European Social Movement and later the New European Order alongside similar groups from across Europe Early neo fascist groups included Jeune Nation which introduced the Celtic cross into use by radical right groups an association which would spread internationally A neither East nor West pan Europeanism was most popular among French fascistic activists until the late s partly motivated by feelings of national vulnerability following the collapse of their empire thus the Belgian SS veteran Jean Fran ois Thiriart s group Jeune Europe also had a considerable French contingent br It was the s during the Fifth French Republic that a considerable upturn in French neo fascism occurred some of it in response to the Protests of The most explicitly pro Nazi of these was the FANE of Mark Fredriksen Neo fascist groups included Pierre Sidos Occident the Ordre Nouveau which was banned after violent clashes with the Trotskyist LCR and the student based Groupe Union D fense A number of these activists such as Fran ois Duprat were instrumental in founding the Front National under Jean Marie Le Pen but the FN also included a broader selection from the French hard right including not only these neo fascist elements but also Catholic integrists monarchists Algerian War veterans Poujadists and national conservatives Others from these neo fascist micro groups formed the Parti des forces nouvelles working against Le Pen br Within the FN itself Duprat founded the FANE backed Groupes nationalistes r volutionnaires faction until his assassination The subsequent history of the French hard right has been the conflict between the national conservative controlled FN and national revolutionary fascistic and National Bolshevik splinter or opposition groups The latter include groups in the tradition of Thiriart and Duprat such as the Parti communautaire national europ en Troisi me voie the Nouvelle R sistance of Christian Bouchet Unit Radicale and most recently Bloc identitaire Direct splits from the FN include the founded FANE revival Parti nationaliste fran ais et europ en which was disbanded in Neo Nazi organizations are outlawed in the Fifth French Republic yet a significant number of them still exist br br br Germany br br Following the failure of the National Democratic Party of Germany in the election of small groups committed to the revival of Nazi ideology began to emerge in Germany The NPD splintered giving rise to paramilitary Wehrsportgruppe These groups attempted to organize under a national umbrella organization the Action Front of National Socialists National Activists Neo Nazi movements in East Germany began as a rebellion against the Communist regime the banning of Nazi symbols helped neo Nazism to develop as an anti authoritarian youth movement Mail order networks developed to send illegal Nazi themed music cassettes and merchandise to Germany br Turks in Germany have been victims of neo Nazi violence on several occasions In two young girls were killed in the M lln arson attack along with their grandmother nine others were injured In five Turks were killed in the Solingen arson attack In response to the fire Turkish youth in Solingen rioted chanting Nazis out and We want Nazi blood In other parts of Germany police had to intervene to protect skinheads from assault The Hoyerswerda riots and Rostock Lichtenhagen riots targeting migrants and ethnic minorities living in Germany also took place during the s br Between and eight Turkish immigrants one Greek and a German policewoman were murdered by the neo Nazi National Socialist Underground The NSU has its roots in the former East German area of Thuringia which The Guardian identified as one of the heartlands of Germany s radical right The German intelligence services have been criticized for extravagant distributions of cash to informants within the far right movement Tino Brandt publicly boasted on television that he had received around in funding from the German state Though Brandt did not give the state useful information the funding supported recruitment efforts in Thuringia during the early s Brandt was eventually sentenced to five and a half years in prison on for counts of child prostitution and child sexual abuse br Police were only able to locate the killers when they were tipped off following a botched bank robbery in Eisenach As the police closed in on them the two men committed suicide They had evaded capture for years Beate Zsch pe who had been living with the two men in Zwickau turned herself in to the German authorities a few days later Zsch pe s trial began in May she was charged with nine counts of murder She pleaded not guilty According to The Guardian the NSU may have enjoyed protection and support from certain elements of the state Anders Behring Breivik a fan of Zsch pe s reportedly sent her a letter from prison in br According to the annual report of Germany s interior intelligence service Verfassungsschutz for at the time there were right wing extremists living in Germany including neo Nazis In January Combat was banned in Germany and raids directed against the organization were made across the country In March United German Peoples and Tribes which is part of Reichsb rger a neo Nazi movement that rejects the German state as a legal entity was raided by the German police Holocaust denial is a crime according to the German Criminal Code Strafgesetzbuch a and public incitement br br br Greece br br The far right political party Golden Dawn Chrysi Avyi is generally labelled neo Nazi although the group rejects this label A few Golden Dawn members participated in the Bosnian War in the Greek Volunteer Guard GVG and were present in Srebrenica during the Srebrenica massacre The party has its roots in Papadopoulos regime br There is often collaboration between the state and neo Nazi elements in Greece In during the trial of sixty nine members of the Golden Dawn party evidence was presented of the close ties between the party and the Hellenic Police br Golden Dawn has spoken out in favour of the Assad regime in Syria and the Strasserist group Black Lily have claimed to have sent mercenaries to Syria to fight alongside the Syrian regime specifically mentioning their participation in the Battle of al Qusayr In the May legislative election Golden Dawn received of the votes entering the Greek parliament for the first time with representatives but when the elected parties were unable to form a coalition government a second election was held in June Golden Dawn received of the votes in the June election and entered the Greek parliament with representatives br Since neo Nazi violence in Greece has targeted immigrants leftists and anarchist activists In certain far right groups announced that Agios Panteleimonas in Athens was off limits to immigrants Neo Nazi patrols affiliated with the Golden Dawn party began attacking migrants in this neighborhood The violence continued escalating through In after the murder of anti fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas the number of hate crimes in Greece declined for several years until Many of the crimes in have been attributed to other groups like the Crypteia Organisation and Combat Hellas br br br Hungary br br In Hungary the historical political party which allied itself ideologically with German National Socialism and drew inspiration from it was the Arrow Cross Party of Ferenc Sz lasi They referred to themselves explicitly as National Socialists and within Hungarian politics this tendency is known as Hungarism After the Second World War exiles such as rp d Henney kept the Hungarist tradition alive Following the fall of the Hungarian People s Republic in which was a Marxist Leninist state and a member of the Warsaw Pact many new parties emerged Amongst these was the Hungarian National Front of Istv n Gy rk s which was a Hungarist party and considered itself the heirs of Arrow Cross style National Socialism a self description they explicitly embraced In the s Gy rk s movement moved closer to a national bolshevist and neo Eurasian position aligned with Aleksandr Dugin cooperating with the Hungarian Workers Party Some Hungarists opposed this and founded the Pax Hungarica Movement br In modern Hungary the ultranationalist Jobbik is regarded by some
