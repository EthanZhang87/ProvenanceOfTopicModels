Google Cloud Platform GCP is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google that provides a series of modular cloud services including computing data storage data analytics and machine learning alongside a set of management tools It runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end user products such as Google Search Gmail and Google Docs according to Verma et al Registration requires a credit card or bank account details br Google Cloud Platform provides infrastructure as a service platform as a service and serverless computing environments br In April Google announced App Engine a platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google managed data centers which was the first cloud computing service from the company The service became generally available in November Since the announcement of App Engine Google added multiple cloud services to the platform br Google Cloud Platform is a part of Google Cloud which includes the Google Cloud
