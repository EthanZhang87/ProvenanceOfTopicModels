The furry fandom is a subculture interested in anthropomorphic animal characters Some examples of anthropomorphic attributes include exhibiting human intelligence and facial expressions speaking walking on two legs and wearing clothes The term furry fandom is also used to refer to the community of people who gather on the Internet and at furry conventions br br br History br The furry fandom has its roots in the underground comix movement of the s a genre of comic books that depict explicit content In a pair of cartoonists created the amateur press association Vootie which was dedicated to animal focused art Many of its featured works contained adult themes such as Omaha the Cat Dancer which contained explicit sex Vootie grew a small following over the next several years and its contributors began meeting at science fiction and comics conventions br According to fandom historian Fred Patten the concept of furry originated at a science fiction convention in when a character drawing from Steve Gallacci s Albedo Anthropomorphics started a discussion of anthropomorphic characters in science fiction novels This led to the formation of a discussion group that met at science fiction conventions and comics conventions br The specific term furry fandom was being used in fanzines as early as and had become the standard name for the genre by the mid s when it was defined as the organized appreciation and dissemination of art and prose regarding Furries or fictional mammalian anthropomorphic characters However fans consider the origins of furry fandom to be much earlier with fictional works such as Kimba the White Lion released in Richard Adams novel Watership Down published in and its film adaptation as well as Disney s Robin Hood as oft cited examples Internet newsgroup discussion in the s created some separation between fans of funny animal characters and furry characters meant to avoid the baggage that was associated with the term furry br During the s furry fans began to publish fanzines developing a diverse social group that eventually began to schedule social gatherings By there was sufficient interest to stage the first furry convention The convention was called Confurence and it was held at the Holiday Inn Bristol Plaza in Costa Mesa California Once the Internet became accessible to the general population in the s it became the most popular means for furry fans to socialize The newsgroup alt fan furry was created in November and virtual environments such as MUCKs also became popular places on the internet for fans to meet and communicate br br br Inspiration br Allegorical novels including works of both science fiction and fantasy and cartoons featuring anthropomorphic animals are often cited as the earliest inspiration for the fandom A survey conducted in suggested that when compared with a non furry control group a higher proportion of those self identifying as furries liked cartoons a great deal as children and recalled watching them significantly more often as well as being more likely to enjoy works of science fiction than those outside of the community br br br Activities br According to a survey from most furries believe that visual art conventions literature and online communities are strongly important to the fandom The furry fandom is male dominated with surveys reporting around male respondents br br br Crafts br br Fans with craft skills create their own plush toys sometimes referred to as plushies and also build elaborate costumes called fursuits which are worn for fun or to participate in parades convention masquerades dances or fund raising charity events as entertainers Fursuits range from designs featuring simple construction resembling some entertainment and sports mascots to those with more sophisticated features such as moving jaw mechanisms animatronic parts prosthetic makeup and other features Fursuits range in price from for mascot like designs to an upwards of for models incorporating animatronics While about of furries do not own a full fursuit often citing their expensive cost as the decisive factor a majority of them hold positive feelings towards fursuiters and the conventions in which they participate Some fans may also wear partial suits consisting simply of ears and a tail or a head paws and a tail A much larger proportion of individuals who attend conventions own a full or partial fursuit according to a survey done at Anthrocon which has been attributed to convention attendees generally higher likelihood to be able to afford to buy a fursuit if they can afford convention travel expenses br Furry fans also pursue puppetry recording videos and performing live shows such as Rapid T Rabbit and Friends and the Funday PawPet Show and create furry accessories such as ears or tails br br br Role playing br br Anthropomorphic animal characters created by furry fans known as fursonas are used for role playing in MUDs on internet forums or on electronic mailing lists A variety of species are employed as the basis of these personas although many furry fans for example over of those surveyed in choose to identify themselves with carnivorans The longest running online furry role playing environment is FurryMUCK which was established in Many furry fans had their first exposure to the fandom come from multiplayer online role playing games Another popular online furry social game is called Furcadia created by Dragon s Eye Productions There are also several furry themed areas and communities in the virtual world Second Life br br br Conventions br br Sufficient interest and membership has enabled the creation of many furry conventions in North America and Europe A furry convention is for the fans to get together to buy and sell artwork participate in workshops wear costumes and socialize Anthrocon in the largest furry convention with more than attendees is estimated to have generated approximately million to Pittsburgh s economy that year Another convention Further Confusion held in San Jose each January closely follows Anthrocon in scale and attendance was raised in conventions for charity from to As of December Midwest FurFest is the world s largest furry convention It had a self reported attendance of br The first known furry convention ConFurence is no longer held Califur has replaced it as both conventions were based in Southern California A University of California Davis survey suggested that about of furries had attended at least one furry convention br br br Websites and online communities br The internet contains a multitude of furry websites and online communities such as art community websites Fur Affinity Inkbunny SoFurry and Weasyl and WikiFur a collaborative furry wiki br There are several webcomics featuring animal characters created by or for furry fans as such they may be referred to as furry comics One such comic T H E Fox was first published on CompuServe in predating the World Wide Web by several years while another Kevin and Kell by Bill Holbrook has been awarded both a Web Cartoonists Choice Award and an Ursa Major Award br The Ursa Major Award is given in the field of furry fandom works and are the main awards in the field of anthropomorphism It has been awarded to many comics and animated series over the years including Helluva Boss Beastars while BNA Brand New Animal Centaurworld Aggretsuko Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts and Odd Taxi and Helluva Boss episodes such as Murder Family Loo Loo Land and The Circus were nominated for the Best Dramatic Series category Some of these series also feature LGBT characters such as Helluva Boss and Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts In a review of Helluva Boss in Brendan Kachel of the furry site Flayrah wrote that while Loona is the only one character who is truly furry and a furry sex goddess they would still recommend furries at least try the series br br br IT industry and tech br It is often suggested that furries run the internet as members of the furry community are overrepresented in the IT industry often in senior or other important positions br br br Furry lifestyle br br The phrases furry lifestyle and furry lifestyler first appeared in July on the newsgroup alt fan furry during an ongoing dispute within the online community The Usenet newsgroup was created to accommodate discussion beyond furry art and literature and to resolve disputes concerning what should or should not be associated with the fandom its members quickly adopted the term furry lifestylers and still consider the fandom and the lifestyle to be separate social entities They have defined and adopted an alternative meaning of the word furry specific to this group a person with an important emotional spiritual connection with an animal or animals real fictional or symbolic br In their survey Gerbasi et al examined what it meant to be a furry and proposed a taxonomy in which to categorise different types of furries The largest group of those surveyed described their interest in furry fandom predominantly as a route to socializing with others who share common interests such as anthropomorphic art and costumes However they also identified furries who saw themselves as other than human or who desired to become more like the furry species which they identified with br br br Sexual aspects br br According to four different surveys of the fandom members report homosexuality bisexuality heterosexuality and other forms of alternative sexual relationships Approximately half of the respondents reported being in a relationship of which were in a relationship with another member of the furry fandom Examples of sexual aspects within the furry fandom include erotic art and furry themed cybersex The term yiff is sometimes used to indicate sexual activity or sexual material within the fandom this applies to sexual activity and interaction within the subculture whether in the form of cybersex or offline br Sexual attraction to furry characters is a polarizing issue In one survey with furry respondents answered that sexual attraction is important in their furry activities were ambivalent and answered that it has little or nothing to do with their furry activities In an earlier online survey of furry respondents answered that they have a significant sexual interest in furry another stated they have a minor sexual interest in furry and the remaining stated they have a non sexual interest in furry The survey specifically avoided adult oriented websites to prevent bias br Another survey at a furry convention in found that of male furry respondents reported viewing furry pornography compared with of female males estimated of all furry art they view is pornographic compared with for females The respondents to the survey had a slight preference for pornographic furry artwork over non pornographic artwork of males reported that when they viewed pornography it was exclusively or near exclusively furry pornography and only about reported that pornography was the top factor that got them into the fandom br br br Public perception and media coverage br Early portrayal of the furries in magazines such as Wired Loaded Vanity Fair and the syndicated sex column Savage Love focused mainly on the sexual aspect of the furry fandom Fictional portrayals of the furry fandom have appeared in television shows such as The Simpsons ER CSI Crime Scene Investigation The Drew Carey Show Sex K on MTV Entourage Ways to Die Tosh Check It Out with Dr Steve Brule and Rock Most furry fans claim that these media portrayals are misconceptions while more recent coverage focuses on addressing the myths and stereotypes that have come to be associated with the furry fandom A reporter attending Anthrocon noted that despite their wild image from Vanity Fair MTV and CSI furry conventions aren t about kinky sex between weirdos gussied up in foxy costumes that conference attendees were not having sex more than the rest of us and that the furry convention was about people talking and drawing animals and comic book characters in sketchbooks In October a Hartford Advocate reporter attended FurFright undercover because of media restrictions She learned that the restrictions were intended to prevent misinformation and reported that the scandalous behavior she had expected was not evident Recent coverage of the furry fandom has been more balanced According to Ian Wolf a article from the BBC entitled Who are the furries was the first piece of journalism to be nominated for an Ursa Major Award the main award given in the field of anthropomorphism br Milwaukee Brewers broadcaster Jim Powell was sharing a hotel with Anthrocon attendees a day before the convention and reported a negative opinion of the furries Several downtown Pittsburgh businesses welcome furries during the event with local business owners creating special T shirts and drawing paw prints in chalk outside their shops to attract attendees Dr Samuel Conway CEO of Anthrocon said that For the most part people give us curious stares but they re good natured curious stares We re here to have fun people have fun having us here everybody wins Positive coverage was generated following a furry convention that was held in a Vancouver hotel where a number of Syrian refugees were being temporarily housed Despite some concerns and warnings by staff that there could be a seriously negative culture clash if the two groups interacted the refugee children were on the whole delighted to meet the convention goers especially the ones in fursuits who seemed like cartoon characters come to life br According to Furry survey about half of furries perceive public reaction to the fandom as negative less than a fifth stated that the public responded to them more negatively than they did most furries Furry fans belief that they will be portrayed as mainly obsessed with sex has led to distrust of the media and social researchers br In addition the fandom has grown to be such a significant demographic that by the film company Walt Disney Studios marketed their animated feature film Zootopia in pre release to the fandom to encourage interest in the film which proved a major critical and commercial success br In and media coverage in Canada and the United States focused on false rumors about litter boxes in schools being provided for furries which was part of a cultural backlash amplified by conservative and far right politicians against transgender accommodations in schools br br br Sociological aspects br br The International Anthropomorphic Research Project IARP a team of social scientists from various disciplines led by Plante Reysen Roberts and Gerbasi has been collecting data on the furry fandom using numerous methodologies Their publication collects several peer reviewed and self published studies into a single volume Among their findings were that the average adult furry is between and years of age with more than of furries reporting being years of age or younger and of adult furries being under the age of Minors were not included in the study for professional ethics reasons However IARP estimated that were under the age of of furries identified themselves as male on the surveys while identified as female While only of furries identified themselves as transgender of furries identified themselves as genderqueer non binary of furries self identify as White with small minorities of furries self identifying as Asian Black and Hispanic of furries consider themselves to be bronies consider themselves to be anime fans and consider themselves sport fans Furries as a group are more politically liberal and less religious than the average American or other comparable fan groups such as anime fans while still containing contentious groups such as neo Nazis and alt right activists whose affiliation is partly in jest and partly in earnest In terms of religious preference of furries self identified as Christian as atheist as agnostic as Pagan Wiccan as Buddhist as Jewish as Deist as Satanist and as other including participants who had their own belief systems were undecided refused to answer or had uncommon belief systems Approximately of adult furries have either completed or are currently completing post secondary education A Pittsburgh based researcher has found that up to of furries may have autism spectrum disorder compared with the about in the general population estimated by the CDC The figure includes people who may have never received a diagnosis but self identify as autistic br One of the most universal behaviors in the furry fandom is the creation of a fursona an anthropomorphic animal representation or avatar More than of furries have a fursona Nearly half of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to represent themselves relatively few furries have had more than three or four fursonas in part this is due to the fact that for many furries their fursonas are a personally significant meaningful representation of their ideal self The most popular fursona species include wolves foxes dogs large felines and dragons Data suggests that there is generally no association between personality traits and different fursona species However furries report different degrees of personality traits when thinking of themselves in their everyday identity compared with their fan identity Some furries identify as partly non human say they do not feel human compared with of non furries and say they would be human if they could compared with of non furries br Inclusion and belongingness are central themes in the furry fandom compared with members of other fandoms such as anime or fantasy sports furries are significantly more likely to identify with other members of their fan community On average half of a furry s friends are also furries themselves Furries rate themselves higher compared with a comparison community sample of non furries on the degree of global awareness knowledge of the world and felt connections to others in the world global citizenship identification psychological connection with global citizens and environmental sustainability br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br Ferreday
