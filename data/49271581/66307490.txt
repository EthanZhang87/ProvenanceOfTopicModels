id: 66307490
On January the United States Capitol Building in Washington D C was attacked by a mob of supporters of then U S president Donald Trump two months after his defeat in the presidential election They sought to keep Trump in power by occupying the Capitol and preventing a joint session of Congress counting the Electoral College votes to formalize the victory of President elect Joe Biden The attack was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the certification of the election results According to the bipartisan House select committee that investigated the incident the attack was the culmination of a seven part plan by Trump to overturn the election Within hours five people died one was shot by Capitol Police another died of a drug overdose and three died of natural causes including a police officer Many people were injured including police officers Four officers who responded to the attack died by suicide within seven months Damage caused by attackers exceeded million br Encouraged by Trump on January and thousands of his supporters gathered in Washington D C to support his false claims that the election had been stolen by emboldened radical left Democrats and to demand that then Vice President Mike Pence and Congress reject Biden s victory Starting at noon on January at a Save America rally on the Ellipse Trump gave a speech in which he repeated false claims of election irregularities and said If you don t fight like hell you re not going to have a country anymore As Congress began the electoral vote count thousands of attendees some armed walked to the Capitol with hundreds breaching police perimeters Among the rioters were leaders of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers militia groups who conspired to use violence and interfere with the peaceful transfer of power br The FBI estimates that between and people entered the Capitol Building on January with some vandalizing and looting including the offices of then House speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Congress members Rioters also assaulted Capitol Police officers and reporters and attempted to capture and harm lawmakers A gallows was erected west of the Capitol with rioters chanting to Hang Mike Pence after he rejected requests from Trump and others to use authority they believed he had to overturn the election results With building security breached Capitol Police evacuated and locked down both chambers of Congress and several buildings in the Complex Rioters occupied the empty Senate chamber while federal law enforcement officers defended the evacuated House floor Pipe bombs were found at both the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters and Molotov cocktails were discovered in a vehicle near the Capitol Trump resisted sending the National Guard to quell the mob Later that afternoon in a Twitter video he reasserted the inaccurate claim that the election was fraudulent and told his supporters to go home in peace The Capitol was cleared of rioters by mid evening and the electoral vote count was resumed and completed by the early morning of January Pence declared President elect Biden and Vice President elect Kamala Harris victorious Pressured by his cabinet the threat of removal and many resignations Trump later conceded to an orderly transition of power in a televised statement br A week after the attack the House of Representatives impeached Trump for incitement of insurrection making him the only U S president to be impeached twice In February after Trump had left office the Senate voted in favor of conviction but fell short of the required two thirds resulting in his acquittal Senate Republicans blocked a bill to create a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the attack so the House instead approved a select investigation committee consisting of seven Democrats and two Republicans They held nine televised public hearings on the attack voted to subpoena Trump and recommended that the Department of Justice DOJ prosecute Trump On August following a special counsel investigation Trump was indicted on four charges As of May people have been charged with federal crimes relating to the event As of May defendants had pleaded guilty people have pleaded guilty to felonies while have pleaded guilty to misdemeanors As of the same date defendants have been sentenced with people receiving a jail sentence as a penalty Some participants in the attack were linked to far right extremist groups or conspiratorial movements including the Oath Keepers Proud Boys and Three Percenters Numerous plotters were convicted of seditious conspiracy including Oath Keepers and Proud Boys members the longest sentence to date was given to then Proud Boy chairman Enrique Tarrio who was sentenced to years in prison br br br Background br br br Attempts to overturn the presidential election br br Joe Biden of the Democratic Party defeated incumbent Republican Party president Donald Trump in the presidential election Trump and other Republicans attempted to overturn the election falsely claiming widespread voter fraud br br Within hours after the closing of the polls while votes were still being tabulated Trump declared victory demanding that further counting be halted He began a campaign to subvert the election through legal challenges and an extralegal effort Ten days after the election Trump s attorneys came to the conclusion that there was neither a factual foundation nor a valid legal argument for challenging the election results Despite those analyses Trump sought to overturn the results by filing at least sixty lawsuits including two that came before the Supreme Court Those actions sought to nullify election certifications and to void votes that had been cast for Biden Those challenges were all rejected by the courts for lack of evidence or the absence of legal standing Trump s legal team led by Sidney Powell filed those lawsuits while knowing they had no factual basis or legal merit In August Powell and other Trump attorneys were formally sanctioned for participating in a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process by filing baseless and frivolous lawsuits in order to undermine public confidence in the democratic process br Trump then mounted a campaign to pressure Republican governors secretaries of state and state legislatures to nullify results by replacing slates of Biden electors with slates pledged to Trump or by manufacturing evidence of fraud Trump s role in the plot to use fake electors led to his being prosecuted in Michigan Georgia and in federal court He further demanded that lawmakers investigate ostensible election irregularities such as by conducting signature matches of mailed in ballots disregarding any prior analytic efforts Trump also personally made inquiries regarding the possibility of invoking martial law to re run or reverse the election and appointing a special counsel to find instances of fraud despite conclusions by federal and state officials that such cases were few and isolated or non existent Trump ultimately undertook neither step Trump repeatedly urged Vice President Mike Pence to alter the results and to stop Biden from taking office None of those actions would have been within Pence s constitutional powers as vice president and president of the Senate Trump repeated this call in his rally speech on the morning of January br Numerous scholars historians political scientists and journalists have characterized these efforts to overturn the election as an attempted self coup by Trump and an implementation of the big lie On July Donald Trump was notified that he was officially a target in the Smith special counsel investigation Trump attorney Sidney Powell would later plead guilty to conspiring to interfere with the election br br br Planning of January events br On December four days after the Electoral College voted Trump called for supporters to attend a rally before the

For several weeks before January there were over one million mentions of storming the Capitol on social media including calls for violence against Congress Pence and the police Many of the posters

Miller by name That day Trump ordered Miller to do whatever was necessary to protect the demonstrators on January The next day Miller signed a memo severely limiting the ability of the D C National Guard to deploy without his personal permission Since his appointment in March D C National Guard commanding major general William J Walker had standing orders to respond to civil disturbances in the district but on January Walker received new orders from Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy forbidding him to respond to a civil disturbance without explicit prior approval from McCarthy and Miller

prevent Biden from taking office One of his tweets posted on January at a m was Get smart Republicans FIGHT The same afternoon Pence released a letter to Congress in which he said he could not challenge Biden s victory br Although the initial plan for the rally called for people to remain at the Ellipse until the counting of electoral slates was complete the White House said they should march to the Capitol as Trump repeatedly urged during his speech Trump called for his supporters to walk down to the Capitol to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women and we re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them He told the crowd that he would be with them but he ultimately did not go to the Capitol As to counting Biden s electoral votes Trump said We can t

moment as the last stand suggested that Pence and other Republican officials put themselves in danger by accepting Biden s victory and told the crowd he would march with them to the Capitol but was prevented from doing so by his security detail In addition to the twenty times he used the term fight Trump once used the term peacefully saying I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard br During Trump s speech his supporters chanted Take the Capitol Taking the Capitol right now Invade the Capitol Storm the

back to the west side which allowed them to assess building defenses and to look for weaknesses br Enroute comments from one of the Proud Boys served as an early indicator of a plan to attack the Capitol according to a documentary filmmaker who was on scene br br There s only one moment where that the sort of facade of marching and protesting might have fallen which is there was a one of the Proud Boys called Milkshake and Eddie Block on his livestream catches Milkshake saying well let s go storm the Capitol with Nordean Rufio one of the leaders of the Proud Boys saying you could keep that quiet please Milkshake And then we continued on marching br Around a crowd of about assembled east of the Capitol Senator Josh Hawley R MO a leader of the group of lawmakers who vowed to

begins near Peace Monument led by Proud Boys br br The Proud Boys contingent reached the west perimeter of the Capitol grounds which was protected only by a sparse line of police in front of a temporary fence Other Trump supporters arrived adding to a growing crowd The Proud Boys tactically coordinated their attacks from the first moment of violence to multiple breaches of the Capitol while leaving the impression that it was just ordinary protesters leading the charge Proud Boys targeted an access point and began to rile up the previously peaceful crowd In a tipping point moment a man later identified as Ryan Samsel approached Joe Biggs and talked with him even embracing him Samsel later told the FBI that Biggs encouraged him to push at the barricades and that when he hesitated the Proud Boys leader flashed a gun questioned his manhood and repeated his demand to move upfront and challenge the police according to The New York Times Proud Boy Dominic Pezzola recalled seeing Biggs flash a handgun and goading Samsel telling him to defend his manhood by attacking the police line but later tried to retract this statement As soon as that exchange ended Samsel became the first to violently attack Capitol Police Capitol police officer Caroline Edwards described the attack br br Ms Edwards described how a Proud Boys leader named Joseph Biggs encouraged another man to approach the bike rack barricade where she was posted That man Ryan Samsel she said pushed the bike rack over causing her to hit her head and lose consciousness br But before she blacked out Ms Edwards

back behind a bicycle rack as Proud Boys pushed barricades towards her knocking her off her feet and causing her to hit her head on the concrete steps br br The Proud Boys led the charge toward the Capitol to the next police line repeating the same set of tactics identifying building access points riling up other protesters and sometimes directly joining in the violence When met with resistance leaders of the group reassessed and teams of Proud Boys targeted new entry points to the Capitol br Around p m hundreds of Trump supporters clashed with a second thin line of officers and pushed through barriers erected along the perimeter of the Capitol The crowd swept past barriers and officers with some members of the mob spraying officers with chemical agents or hitting them with lead pipes Many rioters walked up the external stairways while some resorted to ropes and makeshift ladders Police blocked the entrance to a tunnel at the lower west terrace where rioters waged a three hour fight to enter To gain access to the Capitol several rioters scaled the west wall Representative Zoe Lofgren D CA aware that rioters had reached the Capitol steps could not reach Capitol police chief Steven Sund by phone House sergeant at arms Paul D Irving told Lofgren the doors to the Capitol were locked and nobody can get in br Telephone logs released by Capitol Police show that Sund had

to remove barricades prompting the previously peaceful crowd on the east side to overrun barriers along the entire police line br Meanwhile on the west side Joe Biggs led a team of Proud Boys that targeted the stairs covered by a temporary scaffolding Within two minutes of Bigg s arrival a team of over a dozen Proud Boys approached the entrance to the scaffolding and attacked police Proud Boy

northeast side of the Capitol allowing hundreds of protestors to stream onto the grounds br br br Attackers on west terrace breach Senate Wing hallway br br Just before p m attackers reached the doors and windows of the Capitol and began attempts to break in The Los Angeles Times observed that whether by sheer luck real time trial and error or advance knowledge the first attackers to break through the police line onto the upper west terrace ran past reinforced windows making a beeline for the recessed area near the Senate where two unreinforced windows and two doors with unreinforced glass were the only protection from attack At Proud Boy leader Dominic Pezzola used a stolen police riot shield to smash one of those un reinforced windows on the west side of the Capitol breaching the building itself By the Capitol was officially breached Although most of the Capitol s windows had been reinforced attackers targeted those that remained as single pane glass and could be broken easily Joe

completely unarmed protest The Department of Justice said in a January official statement that over people had been charged in relation to the attack with entering a restricted area while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon including some armed with guns stun guns knives batons baseball bats axes and chemical sprays According to testimony from Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson a Secret

vehicle and lunged at Engel s clavicle She testified Engel was present with Ornato as he related the incident but never contradicted the account Three days after Hutchinson s testimony CNN reported that it had spoken with two Secret Service agents who had heard accounts of the incident from multiple other agents since February including Trump s driver Although details differed agents confirmed there was an angry confrontation with one agent relating that Trump tried to lunge over the seat for what reason nobody had any idea but no one asserted Trump attacked Engel A separate Secret Service official told CNN that Engel denied that Trump grabbed at the steering wheel or lunged toward an agent on his detail and that Ornato denied telling Hutchinson that The same day Politico reported that

hiding in the Capitol Trump tweeted that Pence didn t have the courage to do what should have been done Trump followers on far right social media called for Pence to be hunted down and the mob began chanting Where is Pence and Find Mike Pence Outside the mob chanted Hang Mike Pence which some crowds continued to chant as they stormed the Capitol at least three rioters were overheard by a reporter as saying that they wanted to find Pence and execute him as a traitor by hanging him from a tree outside the building One official recalled that The members of the Vice President s Secret Service detail at this time were starting to fear for their own lives they re screaming and saying things like say goodbye to the family According to witnesses White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told

Trump did nothing to stop the attack despite numerous urgent requests that he intervene They described Trump s inaction as a dereliction of duty Cheney said that Trump had attempted to overturn a free and fair democratic election by promoting a seven part conspiracy According to Representative Thompson Jan was the culmination of an attempted coup a brazen attempt as one rioter put it shortly after Jan to overthrow the government The violence was no accident It represents Trump s last stand most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power Trump according to the committee lied to the American people ignored all evidence refuting his false fraud claims pressured state and federal officials to throw out election results favoring his challenger encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol and even signaled support for the execution of his own vice president br After the June hearing Congressman Tom Rice reiterated his long held view of Trump s conduct saying He watched it happen He

Capitol but rather to protect him and his supporters from any supposed threats by left wing counterprotesters br At p m D C mayor Muriel Bowser had a telephone call with army secretary Ryan McCarthy

noted that the Pentagon needed Capitol Police authorization to step onto Capitol grounds Metro Police chief Robert Contee asked for clarification from Capitol Police chief Sund Steve are you requesting National Guard assistance at the Capitol to which Sund replied I am making urgent urgent immediate request for National Guard assistance According to Sund Piatt stated I don t like the visual of the National Guard standing a police line with the Capitol in the background Sund pleaded with Piatt to send the Guard but Piatt stated that only Army secretary McCarthy had the authority to approve such a request and he could not recommend that Secretary McCarthy approve the request for assistance directly to the Capitol The D C officials were subsequently described as flabbergasted at this message McCarthy would later state that he was not in this conference call because he was already entering a meeting with senior department leadership General Charles A Flynn brother of General Michael Flynn participated in the call br By p m the Pentagon dispatched its own security forces to guard the homes of senior defense leaders even though no rioters or criminal attacks are occurring at those locations Sund later opined This demonstrates to me that the Pentagon fully understands the urgency and danger of the situation even as it does nothing to support us on the Hill br In response to the reluctance expressed by Department of Defense leaders during the conference call D C officials contacted the State of Virginia The Public Safety secretary of Virginia Brian Moran dispatched the Virginia State Police to the U S Capitol as permitted by a mutual aid agreement with D C At p m after leaders of the Department of Defense learned that the Virginia National Guard may have mobilized the head of the National Guard Bureau General Hokanson called the Virginia commander to verify that the Virginia Guard would not move without prior permission from the Pentagon At Hokanson made a similar call to the commander of the Maryland National Guard br br On January Secretary Miller ultimately withheld permission to deploy the National Guard until p m after assets from Virginia had already entered the district FBI tactical teams had arrived at the Capitol and Trump had instructed rioters to go home Miller s permission would not actually be relayed to the commander

directing rioters inside the building while wearing a Make America Great Again hat and the other for taking a selfie with a rioter br br br Analysis br br In February an academic analysis in The Atlantic found that of the persons so far arrested for invading the Capitol percent had no clear public connection to established far right militias known white nationalist gangs or any other known militant organizations The overwhelming reason for action cited again and again in court documents was that arrestees were following Trump s orders to keep Congress from certifying Joe Biden as the presidential election winner They were older than participants in previous far right violent demonstrations and more likely to be employed with being business owners The researchers concluded that these middle aged middle class insurrectionists represented a new force in American politics not merely a mix of right wing organizations but a broader mass political movement that has violence at its core and draws strength even from places where Trump supporters are in the minority br The Associated Press reviewed public and online records of more than participants after the attack and found that many of them shared conspiracy theories about the presidential election on social media and had also believed other QAnon and deep state conspiracy theories Additionally several had threatened Democratic and Republican politicians before the attack The event was described as extremely online with pro Trump internet personalities and fans streaming live footage while taking selfies br According to the University of Maryland s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism br br The ordinary people argument misses or at least obscures the extent to which the Capitol rioters were linked to dangerous groups and ideas at least of the individuals charged with committing crimes on Jan were associated with extremist groups or conspiratorial movements This includes defendants who had links to the Proud Boys a group with a history of violence members of the anti government Oath Keepers militia individuals who embraced the similarly anti government and militant views of the Three Percenters movement and defendants who promoted aspects of QAnon br These individuals make up approximately percent of the Capitol defendants While it is true that they do not represent a majority of the more than people who have been charged in connection with the riot A percent rate of participation in extremism among a collective of apparently ordinary individuals is an astounding number one that should shake us to our core br br Federal officials estimate that about ten thousand rioters entered the Capitol grounds and the Secret Service and FBI have estimated

attackers employed tactics body armor and technology such as two way radio headsets similar to those of the very police they were confronting Some rioters wore riot gear including helmets and military style vests A pair of rioters carried plastic handcuffs which they found on a table inside the Capitol In an analysis of later court documents it was reported that at least participants in the riot

of the protesters and rioters who were mostly white Joe Biden stated No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday they wouldn t have been treated very very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol We all know that s true and it is unacceptable Michelle Obama wrote Yesterday made it painfully clear that certain Americans are in fact allowed to denigrate the flag and symbols of our nation They ve just got to look the right way Capitol Police chief Steven Sund who later resigned explained they had prepared for a peaceful protest

th and th centuries this event was the most severe assault on the building since the burning of Washington by British forces during the War of The last attempt on the life of the vice president was a

closer than miles km from the Capitol at the Battle of Fort Stevens during the American Civil War br Douglas Brinkley a historian at Rice University remarked on how January would be remembered in American history Now every Jan we re going to have to remember what happened I worry if we lose the date that it will lose some of its wallop over time He also wrote about Trump s responsibility during the attack There are always going to be puzzle pieces added to what occurred on Jan because the president of the United States was sitting there watching this on television in the White House as we all know allowing it to go on and on br Speaking on January historians Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jon Meacham warned that the U S remained at a crucial turning point Meacham commented What you saw a year ago today was the worst instincts of both human nature and American politics and it s either a step on the way to the abyss or it is a call to arms figuratively for citizens to engage Goodwin

on today That s what we need in these years and months ahead br Robert Paxton considered the attack to be evidence that Trump s movement was an example of fascism a characterization that Paxton had
