Geoffrey Chaucer s The Canterbury Tales In the Nun s Priest s Tale a vain cock Chauntecleer is tricked by a fox on Since March began thirty days and two i e days since March began which is April However it is not clear that Chaucer was referencing April since the text of the Nun s Priest s Tale also states that the story takes place on the day when the sun is in the sign of Taurus had y rune Twenty degrees and one which would not be April Modern scholars believe that there is a copying error in the extant manuscripts and that Chaucer actually wrote Syn March was gon If so the passage would have originally meant days after March i e May br In French poet Eloy d Amerval referred to a poisson d avril April fool literally April s fish possibly the first reference to the celebration in France Some historians suggest that April Fools originated because in the Middle Ages New Year s Day was celebrated on March in most European towns with a holiday that in some areas of France specifically ended on April and those who celebrated New Year s Eve on January made fun of those who celebrated on other dates by the invention of April Fools Day The use of January as New Year s Day became common in France only in the mid th century and that date was not adopted officially until by the Edict of Roussillon as called for during the Council of Trent in However there are issues with this theory because there is an unambiguous reference to April Fools Day in a poem by Flemish poet Eduard de Dene of a nobleman who sent his servant on foolish errands on April predating the change

Some authorities gravely go back with it to the time of Noah and the ark The London Public Advertiser of March prints the following paragraph concerning this theory The mistake of Noah sending the dove out of the ark before the water had abated on the first day of April and to perpetuate the memory of this deliverance it was thought proper whoever forgot so remarkable a circumstance to punish
