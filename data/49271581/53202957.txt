ScyllaDB is an open source distributed NoSQL wide column data store It was designed to be compatible with Apache Cassandra while achieving significantly higher throughputs and lower latencies It supports the same protocols as Cassandra CQL and Thrift and the same file formats SSTable but is a completely rewritten implementation using the C language replacing Cassandra s Java and the Seastar asynchronous programming library replacing classic Linux programming techniques such as threads shared memory and mapped files In addition to implementing Cassandra s protocols ScyllaDB also implements the Amazon DynamoDB API br ScyllaDB uses a sharded design on each node meaning that each CPU core handles a different subset of data Cores do not share data but rather communicate explicitly when they need to The ScyllaDB authors claim that this design allows ScyllaDB to achieve much better performance on modern NUMA SMP machines and to scale very well with the number of cores They have measured as much as million requests per second on a single machine and also claim that a ScyllaDB cluster can serve as many requests as a Cassandra cluster times its size and do so with lower latencies Independent testing has not always been able to confirm such fold throughput improvements and sometimes measured smaller speedups such as x A benchmark from Samsung observed the x speedup on high end machines the Samsung benchmark reported that ScyllaDB outperformed Cassandra on a cluster of core machines by a margin of x depending on the YCSB workload br ScyllaDB is available on premises on major public cloud providers or as a DBaaS ScyllaDB Cloud br br br History br ScyllaDB was started in December by the startup Cloudius Systems later renamed ScyllaDB Inc previously known for having created OSv ScyllaDB was released as open source in September under the AGPL license Employees of ScyllaDB Inc remain the primary coders behind Scylla but its development is open to the public and uses public GitHub repositories and public mailing lists br br br br br br External links br Scylla public GitHub repository with source code repository and bug tracker br ScyllaDB Inc homepage br ScyllaDB another contender to the open source NoSQL database crown br How Scylla Scaled to One Billion Rows a Second br ClickHouse Cost Efficiency in Action Analyzing Billion Rows on an Intel NUC
