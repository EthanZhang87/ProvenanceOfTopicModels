Jitsi from Bulgarian wires is a collection of free and open source multiplatform voice VoIP video conferencing and instant messaging applications for the Web platform Windows Linux macOS iOS and Android The Jitsi project began with the Jitsi Desktop previously known as SIP Communicator With the growth of WebRTC the project team focus shifted to the Jitsi Videobridge for allowing web based multi party video calling Later the team added Jitsi Meet a full video conferencing application that includes web Android and iOS clients Jitsi also operates meet jit si a version of Jitsi Meet hosted by Jitsi for free community use Other projects include Jigasi lib jitsi meet Jidesha and Jitsi br Jitsi has received support from various institutions such as the NLnet Foundation the University of Strasbourg and the Region of Alsace Data Consultancy Services the European Commission and it has also had multiple participations in the Google Summer of Code program br br br History br Work on Jitsi then SIP Communicator started in in the context of a student project by Emil Ivov at the University of Strasbourg It was originally released as an example video phone in the JAIN SIP stack and later spun off as a standalone project br br br BlueJimp br In Emil Ivov founded the BlueJimp company which has employed some of Jitsi s main contributors in order to offer professional support and development services related to the project br In after successfully adding support for audio video communication over XMPP s Jingle extensions the project was renamed to Jitsi since it was no longer a SIP only Communicator This name originates from the Bulgarian wires br Jitsi introduced the Videobridge in to support multiparty video calling with its Jitsi clients using a new Selective Forwarding Unit SFU architecture Later that year initial support was added to the Jitsi Videobridge allowing WebRTC calling from the browser To demonstrate how Jitsi Videobridge could be used as a production service BlueJimp offered a free use of its hosted system at meet jit si br On November Jitsi Ostel scored out of points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation s secure messaging scorecard They lost a point because there has not been a recent independent code audit br On February Hristo Terezov Ingo Bauersachs and the rest of the team released version from their stand at the Free and Open Source Software Developers European Meeting event in Brussels This release includes security fixes removes support of the deprecated MSN protocol along with SSLv in XMPP Among other notable improvements the OS X version bundles a Java runtime enables echo cancelling by default and uses the CoreAudio subsystem The Linux build addresses font issues with the GTK native look and feel and fixes some long standing issues about microphone level on call setup when using the PulseAudio sound system This release also adds the embedded Java database Hyper SQL Database to improve performance for users with huge configuration files a feature which is disabled by default A full list of changes is available on the project web site br br br Ownership by Atlassian br Atlassian acquired BlueJimp on April After the acquisition the new Jitsi team under Atlassian ceased meaningful new development work on the Jitsi Desktop project and expanded its efforts on projects related to the Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet Regular contributions from the open source community have maintained the Jitsi Desktop project br In jitsi was added as a widget to Element instant messaging client br br br x br In October x acquired Jitsi from Atlassian br br br Primary projects br br The Jitsi open source repository on GitHub currently contains repositories The major projects include br br Jitsi Meet br Video conferencing server designed for quick installation on Debian Ubuntu servers br Jitsi Videobridge br WebRTC Selective Forwarding Unit engine for powering multiparty conferences br Jigasi br Server side application that allows regular SIP clients to join Jitsi Meet conferences hosted by Jitsi Videobridge br lib jitsi meet br Low level JavaScript API for providing a customized UI for Jitsi Meet br Jidesha br Chrome extension for Jitsi Meet br Jitsi br Known as Jitsi Desktop an audio video and chat communicator application that supports protocols such as SIP XMPP Jabber AIM ICQ and IRC br br br Jitsi Meet br br Jitsi Meet is an open source JavaScript WebRTC application used primarily for video conferencing In addition to audio and video screen sharing is available and new members can be invited via a generated link The interface is accessible via web browser or with a mobile app The Jitsi Meet server software can be downloaded and installed on Linux based computers Jitsi owner x maintains a free public use server for up to participants at meet jit si br br br Key Features of Jitsi Meet br Jitsi implemented end to end encryption E EE with dynamic key management in The original static E EE configurations that were initially required while the dynamic key management system was first implemented have since been deprecated and removed and additional support for mobile applications added In addition the Jitsi Videobridge JVB adds an additional layer of TLS encryption at the transport layer between the server and the desktop mobile API clients for enhanced security br Recording Jitsi offers the ability to record meetings by streaming them to youtube Self installed Jitsi Meet deployments need to install and set up Jibri to support this capability The client also has the capability to save a local recording br Using only a standards compliant web browser to run Jitsi Meet in a browser no additional client software besides a browser is required to join a Jitsi meeting br br br Jitsi Videobridge br Jitsi Videobridge is a video conferencing solution supporting WebRTC that allows multiuser video communication It is a Selective Forwarding Unit SFU and only forwards the selected streams to other participating users in the video conference call therefore CPU horsepower is not that critical for performance br br br Jitsi Desktop br Jitsi spawned some sister projects such as the Jitsi Videobridge Selective Forwarding Unit SFU and Jitsi Meet a video and web conferencing application To prevent misunderstanding due to the increasing popularity of these other Jitsi projects the Jitsi client application was rebranded as Jitsi Desktop br Originally the project was mostly used as an experimentation tool because of its support for IPv Through the years as the project gathered members it also added support for protocols other than SIP br Jitsi Desktop is no longer actively maintained by the Jitsi team but it is still maintained by the community br br Features br Jitsi supports multiple operating systems including Windows as well as Unix like systems such as Linux Mac OS X and BSD The mobile apps can be downloaded on the App Store for iOS and on the Google Play Store and F droid platform for Android It also includes br br Attended and blind call transfer br Auto away br Auto re connect br Auto answer and auto forward br Call recording br Call encryption with SRTP and ZRTP br Conference calls br Direct media connection establishment with the ICE protocol br Desktop Streaming br Encrypted password storage using a master password br File transfer for XMPP AIM ICQ Windows Live Messenger YIM br Instant messaging encryption with OTR end to end encrypted br IPv support for SIP and XMPP br Media relaying with the TURN protocol br Message waiting indication RFC br Voice and video calls for SIP and XMPP using H and H or VP for video encoding br Wideband audio with SILK G Speex and Opus br DTMF support with SIP INFO RTP RFC RFC In band br Zeroconf via mDNS DNS SD la Apple s Bonjour br DNSSEC br Group video support Jitsi Videobridge br Packet loss concealment with the SILK and Opus codecs br br br Reception and Usage br In an April test of video conferencing services US product review owned by the New York Times Wirecutter recommended Jitsi Meet as one of its two picks after the more feature rich Cisco Webex which it found preferable for large groups and enterprises stating that Jitsi was easy to use and reliable and that in our testing the video quality and audio quality were both great noticeably sharper and crisper than on Zoom or Webex br During the COVID pandemic in April x reported million active users globally per month br Several organisations and universities have set up their own Jitsi based video conferencing services among them fairkom with fairmeeting hosted on a scalable kubernetes cluster in the EU or Goethe University Frankfurt br The non profit organisation Digitalcourage discourages in the usage of the free meet jit si service as it is not free of tracking requires authentication at either Google GitHub or Facebook and is hosted at AWS which is not considered GDPR compliant br br br
