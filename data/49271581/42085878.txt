id: 42085878
The ongoing Russo Ukrainian War began in February Following Ukraine s Revolution of Dignity Russia occupied and annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported pro Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas War These first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents and cyberwarfare In February Russia launched a full scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the country starting the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II br In early the Euromaidan protests led to the Revolution of Dignity and the ousting of Ukraine s pro Russian president Viktor Yanukovych Shortly after pro Russian unrest erupted in eastern and southern Ukraine while unmarked Russian troops occupied Crimea Russia soon annexed Crimea after a highly disputed referendum In April Russian backed militants seized towns in Ukraine s eastern Donbas region and proclaimed the Donetsk People s Republic DPR and the Luhansk People s Republic LPR as independent states starting the Donbas war Russia covertly supported the separatists with its own troops tanks and artillery and Ukraine failed to fully retake the territory In February Russia and Ukraine signed the Minsk II agreements to end the conflict but they were never fully implemented in the years that followed The Donbas war settled into a violent but static conflict between Ukraine and the Russian and separatist forces with many brief ceasefires but no lasting peace and few changes in territorial control br Beginning in there was a massive Russian military buildup near Ukraine s borders including within neighbouring Belarus Russian officials repeatedly denied plans to attack Ukraine Russia s president Vladimir Putin expressed irredentist views and denied Ukraine s right to exist He demanded that Ukraine be barred from ever joining the NATO military alliance In early Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states br br On February Putin announced a special military operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine claiming Russia had no plans to occupy the country The Russian invasion that followed was internationally condemned many countries imposed sanctions against Russia and increased existing sanctions In the face of fierce resistance Russia abandoned an attempt to take Kyiv in early April From August Ukrainian forces began recapturing territories in the north east and south In late September Russia declared the annexation of four partially occupied regions which was internationally condemned Russia spent the winter conducting inconclusive offensives in the Donbas In spring Russia dug into positions ahead of another Ukrainian counteroffensive which failed to gain significant ground The war has resulted in a refugee crisis and tens of thousands of deaths br br br Background br br br Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution br br After the dissolution of the Soviet Union USSR in Ukraine and Russia maintained close ties In Ukraine agreed to accede to the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non nuclear weapon state Former Soviet nuclear weapons in Ukraine were removed and dismantled In return Russia the United Kingdom and the United States agreed to uphold the territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine through the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances In Russia was one of the signatories of the Charter for European Security which reaffirmed the inherent right of each and every participating State to be free to choose or change its security arrangements including treaties of alliance as they evolve In the years after the dissolution of the USSR several former Eastern Bloc countries joined NATO partly in response to regional security threats involving Russia such as the Russian constitutional crisis the War in Abkhazia and the First Chechen War Putin said Western powers broke promises not to let any Eastern European countries join br br The Ukrainian presidential election was controversial During the election campaign opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned by TCDD dioxin he later accused Russia of involvement In November Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych was declared the winner despite allegations of vote rigging by election observers During a two month period which became known as the Orange Revolution large peaceful protests successfully challenged the outcome After the Supreme Court of Ukraine annulled the initial result due to widespread electoral fraud a second round re run was held bringing to power Yushchenko as president and Yulia Tymoshenko as prime minister and leaving Yanukovych in opposition The Orange Revolution is often grouped together with other early st century protest movements particularly within the former USSR known as colour revolutions According to Anthony Cordesman Russian military officers viewed such colour revolutions as attempts by the US and European states to destabilise neighbouring countries and undermine Russia s national security Russian President Vladimir Putin accused organisers of the Russian protests of being former advisors to Yushchenko and described the protests as an attempt to transfer the Orange Revolution to Russia Rallies in favour of Putin during this period were called anti Orange protests br At the Bucharest summit Ukraine and Georgia sought to join NATO The response among NATO members was divided Western European countries opposed offering Membership Action Plans MAP to Ukraine and Georgia in order to avoid antagonising Russia while US President George W Bush pushed for their admission NATO ultimately refused to offer Ukraine and Georgia MAPs but also issued a statement agreeing that these countries will become members of NATO at some point Putin strongly opposed Georgia and Ukraine s NATO membership bids By January the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO remained remote br In Yanukovych announced his intent to again run for president in the Ukrainian presidential election which he subsequently won In November a wave of large pro European Union EU protests erupted in response to Yanukovych s sudden decision not to sign the EU Ukraine Association Agreement instead choosing closer ties to Russia and the Eurasian Economic Union On February the Ukrainian parliament overwhelmingly approved of finalizing Ukraine s agreement with the EU Subsequently Russia pressurized Ukraine to reject this agreement by threatening sanctions Kremlin adviser Sergei Glazyev stated that if the agreement was signed Russia could not guarantee Ukraine s status as a state br br br Euromaidan Revolution of Dignity and pro Russian unrest br br On February following months of protests as part of the Euromaidan movement Yanukovych and the leaders of the parliamentary opposition signed a settlement agreement that provided for early elections The following day Yanukovych fled from the capital ahead of an impeachment vote that stripped him of his powers as president On February the Rada Ukrainian Parliament adopted a bill to repeal the law which made Russian an official language The bill was not enacted but the proposal provoked negative reactions in the Russian speaking regions of Ukraine intensified by Russian media claiming that the ethnic Russian population was in imminent danger br On February an interim government was established and early presidential elections were scheduled The following day Yanukovych resurfaced in Russia and in a press conference declared that he remained the acting president of Ukraine just as Russia was commencing a military campaign in Crimea Leaders of Russian speaking eastern regions of Ukraine declared continuing loyalty to Yanukovych triggering the pro Russian unrest in Ukraine br br br Russian military bases in Crimea br br At the onset of the Crimean conflict Russia had roughly military personnel from the Black Sea Fleet in several locations in the Crimean peninsula such as Sevastopol Kacha Hvardiiske Simferopol Raion Sarych and others In a dispute broke out between Russia and Ukraine over control of the Sarych cape lighthouse near Yalta and a number of other beacons Russian presence was allowed by the basing and transit agreement with Ukraine Under this agreement the Russian military in Crimea was constrained to a maximum of troops Russia was required to respect the sovereignty of Ukraine honor its legislation not interfere in the internal affairs of the country and show their military identification cards when crossing the international border Early in the conflict the agreement s generous troop limit allowed Russia to significantly strengthen its military presence deploy special forces and other required capabilities to conduct the operation in Crimea under the pretext of addressing security concerns br According to the original treaty on the division of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet signed in Russia was allowed to have its military bases in Crimea until after which it would evacuate all military units including its portion of the Black Sea Fleet from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol On April former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych signed a new deal with Russia known as the Kharkiv Pact to resolve the Russia Ukraine gas dispute The pact extended Russia s stay in Crimea to with an option to renew br br br Legality and declaration of war br br No formal declaration of war has been issued in the ongoing Russo Ukrainian War When Putin announced the Russian invasion of Ukraine he claimed to commence a special military operation side stepping a formal declaration of war The statement was however regarded as a declaration of war by the Ukrainian government and reported as such by many international news sources While the Ukrainian parliament refers to Russia as a terrorist state in regard to its military actions in Ukraine it has not issued a formal declaration of war on its behalf br The Russian invasion of Ukraine violated international law including the Charter of the United Nations The invasion has also been called a crime of aggression under international criminal law and under some countries domestic criminal codes including those of Ukraine and Russia although procedural obstacles exist to prosecutions under these laws br br br History br br br Russian annexation of Crimea br br In late February Russia began to occupy Crimea marking the beginning of the Russo Ukrainian War On and February in the relative power vacuum immediately after the ousting of Yanukovych Russian troops and special forces were moved close to the border with Crimea On February Russian forces without insignia began to occupy Crimea Russia consistently denied that the soldiers were theirs instead claiming they were local self defense units They seized the Crimean parliament and government buildings as well as setting up checkpoints to restrict movement and cut off the Crimean peninsula from the rest of Ukraine In the following days unmarked Russian special forces occupied airports and communications centers and blockaded Ukrainian military bases such as the Southern Naval Base Russian cyberattacks shut down websites associated with the Ukrainian government news media and social media Cyberattacks also enabled Russian access to the mobile phones of Ukrainian officials and members of parliament further disrupting communications On March the Russian parliament approved the use of armed forces in Crimea br While Russian special forces occupied Crimea s parliament it dismissed the Crimean government installed the pro Russian Aksyonov government and announced a referendum on Crimea s status The referendum was held under Russian occupation and according to the Russian installed authorities the result was in favor of joining Russia It annexed Crimea on March Following this Russian forces seized Ukrainian military bases in Crimea and captured their personnel On March Ukraine ordered its remaining troops to withdraw by March all Ukrainian forces had left the peninsula br On April the Ukrainian parliament declared Crimea a territory temporarily occupied by Russia After the annexation the Russian government militarized the peninsula and made nuclear threats Putin said that a Russian military task force would be established in Crimea In November NATO stated that it believed Russia was deploying nuclear capable weapons to Crimea After the annexation of Crimea some NATO members began providing training for the Ukrainian army br br br War in the Donbas br br br Pro Russia unrest br br From late February demonstrations by pro Russian and anti government groups took place in major cities across the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine The first protests across southern and eastern Ukraine were largely native expressions of discontent with the new Ukrainian government Russian involvement at this stage was limited to voicing support for the demonstrations Russia exploited this however launching a coordinated political and military campaign against Ukraine Putin gave legitimacy to the separatists when he described the Donbas as part of New Russia Novorossiya and expressed bewilderment as to how the region had ever become part of Ukraine br Russia continued to marshal forces near Ukraine s eastern border in late March reaching troops by April The deployment was used to threaten escalation and disrupt Ukraine s response This threat forced Ukraine to divert forces to its borders instead of the conflict zone br Ukrainian authorities cracked down on the pro Russian protests and arrested local separatist leaders in early March Those leaders were replaced by people with ties to the Russian security services and interests in Russian businesses By April Russian citizens had taken control of the separatist movement supported by volunteers and materiel from Russia including Chechen and Cossack fighters According to Donetsk People s Republic DPR commander Igor Girkin without this support in April the movement would have dissipated as it had in Kharkiv and Odesa The separatist groups held disputed referendums in May which were not recognised by Ukraine or any other UN member state br br br Armed conflict br br In April armed conflict began in eastern Ukraine between Russian backed separatists and Ukraine On April a fifty man unit of pro Russian militants seized the towns of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk The heavily armed men were Russian Armed Forces volunteers under the command of former GRU colonel Igor Girkin Strelkov They had been sent from Russian occupied Crimea and wore no insignia Girkin said that this action sparked the Donbas War He said I m the one who pulled the trigger of war If our unit hadn t crossed the border everything would have fizzled out br br In response on April the interim Ukrainian government launched an Anti Terrorist Operation ATO however Ukrainian forces were poorly prepared and ill positioned and the operation quickly stalled By the end of April Ukraine announced it had lost control of the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk It claimed to be on full combat alert against a possible Russian invasion and reinstated conscription to its armed forces During May the Ukrainian campaign focused on containing the separatists by securing key positions around the ATO zone to position the military for a decisive offensive once Ukraine s national mobilization had completed br As conflict between the separatists and the Ukrainian government escalated in May Russia began to employ a hybrid approach combining disinformation tactics irregular fighters regular Russian troops and conventional military support The First Battle of Donetsk Airport followed the Ukrainian presidential elections It marked a turning point in conflict it was the first battle between the separatists and the Ukrainian government that involved large numbers of Russian volunteers According to Ukraine at the height of the conflict in the summer of Russian paramilitaries made up between and of the combatants From June Russia trickled in arms armor and munitions br On July Russian controlled forces shot down a passenger aircraft Malaysia Airlines Flight as it was flying over eastern Ukraine Investigations and the recovery of bodies began in the conflict zone as fighting continued br By the end of July Ukrainian forces were pushing into cities to cut off supply routes between the two isolating Donetsk and attempting to restore control of the Russo Ukrainian border By July the strategic heights of Savur Mohyla were under Ukrainian control along with the town of Debaltseve an important railroad hub These operational successes of Ukrainian forces threatened the existence of the DPR and LPR statelets prompting Russian cross border shelling targeted at Ukrainian troops on their own soil from mid July onwards br br br August Russian invasion br br After a series of military defeats and setbacks for the separatists who united under the banner of Novorossiya Russia dispatched what it called a humanitarian convoy of trucks across the border in mid August Ukraine called the move a direct invasion Ukraine s National Security and Defence Council reported that convoys were arriving almost daily in November up to convoys on November and that their contents were mainly arms and ammunition Strelkov claimed that in early August Russian servicemen supposedly on vacation from the army began to arrive in Donbas br By August the Ukrainian Anti Terrorist Operation shrank the territory under pro Russian control and approached the border Igor Girkin urged Russian military intervention and said that the combat inexperience of his irregular forces along with recruitment difficulties amongst the local population had caused the setbacks He stated Losing this war on the territory that President Vladimir Putin personally named New Russia would threaten the Kremlin s power and personally the power of the president br In response to the deteriorating situation Russia abandoned its hybrid approach and began a conventional invasion on August On the following day the Russian Defence Ministry said these soldiers had crossed the border by accident According to Nikolai Mitrokhin s estimates by mid August during the Battle of Ilovaisk between and troops were fighting in the Donbas on the separatist side and only were locals br On August Amvrosiivka was occupied by Russian paratroopers supported by armoured vehicles and artillery pieces The same day Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko referred to the operation as Ukraine s Patriotic War of and a war against external aggression On August a column of Russian military vehicles was reported to have crossed into Ukraine near Novoazovsk on the Azov sea coast It appeared headed towards Ukrainian held Mariupol in an area that had not seen pro Russian presence for weeks Russian forces captured Novoazovsk and Russian soldiers began deporting Ukrainians who did not have an address registered within the town Pro Ukrainian anti war protests took place in Mariupol The UN Security Council called an emergency meeting br br The Pskov based th Guards Air Assault Division allegedly entered Ukrainian territory in August and engaged in a skirmish near Luhansk suffering dead The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said that they had seized two of the unit s armoured vehicles near Luhansk and reported destroying another three tanks and two armoured vehicles in other regions br The speaker of Russia s upper house of parliament and Russian state television channels acknowledged that Russian soldiers entered Ukraine but referred to them as volunteers A reporter for Novaya Gazeta an opposition newspaper in Russia stated that the Russian military leadership paid soldiers to resign their commissions and fight in Ukraine in the early summer of and then began ordering soldiers into Ukraine Russian opposition MP Lev Shlosberg made similar statements although he said combatants from his country are regular Russian troops disguised as units of the DPR and LPR br In early September Russian state owned television channels reported on the funerals of Russian soldiers who had died in Ukraine but described them as volunteers fighting for the Russian world Valentina Matviyenko a top United Russia politician also praised volunteers fighting in our fraternal nation Russian state television for the first time showed the funeral of a soldier killed fighting in Ukraine br br br Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire br br On September Poroshenko said he and Putin had reached a permanent ceasefire agreement Russia denied this denying that it was a party to the conflict adding that they only discussed how to settle the conflict Poroshenko then recanted On September Russia s Permanent OSCE Representative Andrey Kelin said that it was natural that pro Russian separatists are going to liberate Mariupol Ukrainian forces stated that Russian intelligence groups had been spotted in the area Kelin said there might be volunteers over there On September a NATO officer said that several thousand regular Russian forces were operating in Ukraine br On September the Minsk Protocol ceasefire agreement drew a line of demarcation between Ukraine and separatist controlled portions of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts br br br End of and Minsk II agreement br br On and November NATO officials reconfirmed the Russian presence citing tanks howitzer cannons and trucks of troops entering the country US general Philip M Breedlove said Russian tanks Russian artillery Russian air defence systems and Russian combat troops had been sighted NATO said it had seen an increase in Russian tanks artillery pieces and other heavy military equipment in Ukraine and renewed its call for Moscow to withdraw its forces The Chicago Council on Global Affairs stated that Russian separatists enjoyed technical advantages over the Ukrainian army since the large inflow of advanced military systems in mid effective anti aircraft weapons Buk MANPADS suppressed Ukrainian air strikes Russian drones provided intelligence and Russian secure communications system disrupted Ukrainian communications intelligence The Russian side employed electronic warfare systems that Ukraine lacked Similar conclusions about the technical advantage of the Russian separatists were voiced by the Conflict Studies Research Centre At the United Nations Security Council meeting on November the United Kingdom s representative accused Russia of intentionally constraining OSCE observation missions capabilities stating that the observers were allowed to monitor only two kilometers of border and drones deployed to extend their capabilities were jammed or shot down br In January Donetsk Luhansk and Mariupol represented the three battle fronts Poroshenko described a dangerous escalation on January amid reports of more than additional Russian troops tanks and armed personnel carriers crossing the border He abbreviated his visit to the World Economic Forum because of his concerns br A new package of measures to end the conflict known as Minsk II was agreed on February On February Ukrainian forces withdrew from Debatlseve in the last high intensity battle of the Donbas war until In September the United Nations Human Rights Office estimated that casualties had resulted from the conflict br br br Line of conflict stabilizes br br After the Minsk agreements the war settled into static trench warfare around the agreed line of contact with few changes in territorial control The conflict was marked by artillery duels special forces operations and trench warfare Hostilities never ceased for a substantial period of time but continued at a low level despite repeated attempts at ceasefire In the months after the fall of Debaltseve minor skirmishes continued along the line of contact but no territorial changes occurred Both sides began fortifying their position by building networks of trenches bunkers and tunnels turning the conflict into static trench warfare The relatively static conflict was labelled frozen by some but Russia never achieved this as the fighting never stopped Between and there were ceasefires each agreed to remain in force indefinitely However none of them lasted more than two weeks br br US and international officials continued to report the active presence of Russian military in eastern Ukraine including in the Debaltseve area In Russian separatist forces were estimated to number around troops compared to Ukrainian of whom were Russian soldiers Additionally around GRU troops were operating in the area Another estimate held that Ukrainian forces outnumbered Russian forces to In on average one Ukrainian soldier died in combat every three days with an estimated Russian and separatist troops in the region br Cases of killed and wounded Russian soldiers were discussed in local Russian media Recruiting for Donbas was performed openly via veteran and paramilitary organisations Vladimir Yefimov leader of one such organisation explained how the process worked in the Ural area The organisation recruited mostly army veterans but also policemen firefighters etc with military experience The cost of equipping one volunteer was estimated at rubles around plus salary of to rubles per month The recruits received weapons only after arriving in the conflict zone Often Russian troops traveled disguised as Red Cross personnel Igor Trunov head of the Russian Red Cross in Moscow condemned these convoys saying they complicated humanitarian aid delivery Russia refused to allow OSCE to expand its mission beyond two border crossings br The volunteers were issued a document claiming that their participation was limited to offering humanitarian help to avoid Russian mercenary laws Russia s anti mercenary legislation defined a mercenary as someone who takes part in fighting with aims counter to the interests of the Russian Federation br br In August the Ukrainian intelligence service the SBU published telephone intercepts from of Sergey Glazyev Russian presidential adviser Konstantin Zatulin and other people in which they discussed covert funding of pro Russian activists in Eastern Ukraine the occupation of administration buildings and other actions that triggered the conflict As early as February Glazyev gave direct instructions to various pro Russian parties on how to take over local administration offices what to do afterwards how to formulate demands and promised support from Russia including sending our guys br br br Kerch Strait incident br br Russia gained de facto control of the Kerch Strait in In Ukraine appealed to a court of arbitration over the use of the strait By Russia had built a bridge over the strait limiting the size of ships that could pass through imposed new regulations and repeatedly detained Ukrainian vessels On November three Ukrainian boats traveling from Odesa to Mariupol were seized by Russian warships Ukrainian sailors were detained A day later on November the Ukrainian parliament overwhelmingly backed the imposition of martial law along Ukraine s coastal regions and those bordering Russia br br br br br More than Ukrainian soldiers were killed in the conflict in In May newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took office promising to end the war in Donbas In December Ukraine and pro Russian separatists began swapping prisoners of war Around prisoners were exchanged on December According to Ukrainian authorities Ukrainian soldiers were killed in Between and Russia issued over internal Russian passports to Ukrainians br There were conflict related civilian deaths in deaths in and deaths in over half of them from mines and unexploded ordnance br br br Russian military buildup around Ukraine br br From March to April Russia commenced a major military build up near the border followed by a second build up between October to February in Russia and Belarus Throughout the Russian government repeatedly denied it had plans to attack Ukraine br In early December following Russian denials the US released intelligence of Russian invasion plans including satellite photographs showing Russian troops and equipment near the border The intelligence reported a Russian list of key sites and individuals to be killed or neutralized The US released multiple reports that accurately predicted the invasion plans br br br Russian accusations and demands br br In the months preceding the invasion Russian officials accused Ukraine of inciting tensions Russophobia and repressing Russian speakers They made multiple security demands of Ukraine NATO and other EU countries On December Putin said that Russophobia is a first step towards genocide Putin s claims were dismissed by the international community and Russian claims of genocide were rejected as baseless In a February speech Putin questioned the legitimacy of the Ukrainian state repeating an inaccurate claim that Ukraine never had a tradition of genuine statehood He incorrectly stated that Vladimir Lenin had created Ukraine by carving a separate Soviet Republic out of what Putin said was Russian land and that Nikita Khrushchev took Crimea away from Russia for some reason and gave it to Ukraine in br Putin falsely claimed that Ukrainian society and government were dominated by neo Nazism invoking the history of collaboration in German occupied Ukraine during World War II and echoing an antisemitic conspiracy theory that cast Russian Christians rather than Jews as the true victims of Nazi Germany Ukraine does have a far right fringe including the neo Nazi linked Azov Battalion and Right Sector Analysts described Putin s rhetoric as greatly exaggerated Zelenskyy who is Jewish stated that his grandfather served in the Soviet army fighting against the Nazis three of his family members were killed in the Holocaust br br During the second build up the Russian government demanded NATO end all activity in its Eastern European member states and ban Ukraine or any former Soviet state from ever joining NATO among other demands A treaty to prevent Ukraine joining NATO would go against the alliance s open door policy and the right of countries to choose their own security although NATO had made no progress on Ukraine s requests to join NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that Russia has no say on whether Ukraine joins and that Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbors NATO offered to improve communication with Russia and discuss limits on missile placements and military exercises as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine s borders but Russia did not withdraw br br br Prelude to full invasion br br Fighting in Donbas escalated significantly from February onwards The Ukrainians and the pro Russian separatists each accused the other of attacks There was a sharp increase in artillery shelling by the Russian led militants in Donbas which was considered by Ukraine and its supporters to be an attempt to provoke the Ukrainian army or create a pretext for invasion On February the Donetsk and Luhansk people s republics ordered mandatory emergency evacuations of civilians from their respective capital cities although observers noted that full evacuations would take months The Russian government intensified its disinformation campaign with Russian state media promoting fabricated videos false flags on a nearly hourly basis purporting to show Ukrainian forces attacking Russia Many of the disinformation videos were amateurish and evidence showed that the claimed attacks explosions and evacuations in Donbas were staged by Russia br On February at UTC Putin announced that the Russian government would diplomatically recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk people s republics The same evening Putin directed that Russian troops deploy into Donbas in what Russia referred to as a peacekeeping mission On February the Federation Council unanimously authorised Putin to use military force outside Russia In response Zelenskyy ordered the conscription of army reservists The following day Ukraine s parliament proclaimed a day nationwide state of emergency and ordered the mobilisation of all reservists Russia began to evacuate its embassy in Kyiv br On the night of February Zelenskyy gave a speech in Russian in which he appealed to the citizens of Russia to prevent war He rejected Russia s claims about neo Nazis and stated that he had no intention of attacking the Donbas Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on February that the separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk had sent a letter to Putin stating that Ukrainian shelling had caused civilian deaths and appealing for military support br br br Full scale Russian invasion of Ukraine present br br The Russian invasion of Ukraine began on the morning of February when Putin announced a special military operation to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine Minutes later missiles and airstrikes hit across Ukraine including Kyiv shortly followed by a large ground invasion along multiple fronts Zelenskyy declared martial law and a general mobilisation of all male Ukrainian citizens between and who were banned from leaving the country br Russian attacks were initially launched on a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv a southern front from Crimea and a south eastern front from Luhansk and Donetsk and towards Kharkiv In the northern front amidst heavy losses and strong Ukrainian resistance surrounding Kyiv Russia s advance stalled in March and by April its troops retreated On April Russia placed its forces in southern and eastern Ukraine under the command of General Aleksandr Dvornikov and some units withdrawn from the north were redeployed to the Donbas On April Russia launched a renewed attack across a kilometres mi long front extending from Kharkiv to Donetsk and Luhansk By May a Ukraine counter offensive had driven back Russian forces near Kharkiv By May Mariupol fell to Russian troops following a prolonged siege of the Azovstal steel works Russian forces continued to bomb both military and civilian targets far from the frontline The war caused the largest refugee and humanitarian crisis within Europe since the Yugoslav Wars in the s the UN described it as the fastest growing such crisis since World War II In the first week of the invasion the UN reported over a million refugees had fled Ukraine this subsequently rose to over by September a reduction from over eight million due to some refugees return br br Ukrainian forces launched counteroffensives in the south in August and in the northeast in September On September Russia annexed four oblasts of Ukraine which it had partially conquered during the invasion This annexation was generally unrecognized and condemned by the countries of the world After Putin announced that he would begin conscription drawn from the citizens with military training and potentially the pool of about million Russians who could be eligible for conscription one way tickets out of the country nearly or completely sold out The Ukrainian offensive in the northeast successfully recaptured the majority of Kharkiv Oblast in September In the course of the southern counteroffensive Ukraine retook the city of Kherson in November and Russian forces withdrew to the east bank of the Dnieper River br The invasion was internationally condemned as a war of aggression A United Nations General Assembly resolution demanded a full withdrawal of Russian forces the International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia Many countries imposed new sanctions which affected the economies of Russia and the world and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine In September Putin signed a law that would punish anyone who resists conscription with a year prison sentence resulting in an international push to allow asylum for Russians fleeing conscription br As of August the total number of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers killed or wounded during the Russian invasion of Ukraine was nearly More than civilians were killed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine According to a declassified US intelligence assessment as of December Russia had lost of the troops that made up Russia s pre invasion ground force and of the tanks br Between December and May Russia was assessed to have increased its drone and missile attacks firing harder to hit weapons such as ballistic missiles By the same measure Ukraine forces were seen to be low on ammunition particularly the Patriot systems that have been its best defense against such attacks br br br Human rights violations br br Violations of human rights and atrocity crimes have both occurred during the war From to there were more than civilian casualties with most occurring in and The right of movement was impeded for the inhabitants of the conflict zone Arbitrary detention was practiced by both sides in the first years of the conflict It decreased after in government held areas while in the separatist held ones it continued Investigations into the abuses committed by both sides made little progress br br Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in Russian authorities and armed forces have committed multiple war crimes in the form of deliberate attacks against civilian targets massacres of civilians torture and rape of women and children and indiscriminate attacks in densely populated areas After the Russian withdrawal from areas north of Kyiv overwhelming evidence of war crimes by Russian forces was discovered In particular in the town of Bucha evidence emerged of a massacre of civilians perpetrated by Russian troops including torture mutilation rape looting and deliberate killings of civilians the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine OHCHR has documented the murder of at least civilians mostly men but also women and children in Bucha More than bodies of civilians were found in the Kyiv region after Russian forces withdrew some of them summarily executed There were reports of forced deportations of thousands of civilians including children to Russia mainly from Russian occupied Mariupol as well as sexual violence including cases of rape sexual assault and gang rape and deliberate killing of Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces Russia has also systematically attacked Ukrainian medical infrastructure with the World Health Organization reporting attacks as of December br Ukrainian forces have also been accused of committing various war crimes including mistreatment of detainees though on a much smaller scale than Russian forces br In early May Artem Lysohor the Head of the Luhansk Regional Military Civil Administration announced that since May mothers giving births in the Russia s controlled part of the Luhansk Oblast hospitals will have to prove that one of the newborn s parents have a Russian citizenship otherwise they will not be allowed to leave the hospitals with their newborns who may be taken away br br br Related issues br br br Spillover br br On September CNN reported that it was likely that Ukrainian Special Operations Forces were behind a series of drone strikes and a ground operation directed against the Wagner backed RSF near Khartoum on September Kyrylo Budanov chief of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine stated in an interview on September that he could neither deny nor confirm the involvement of Ukraine in the conflict in Sudan but said that Ukraine would punish Russian war criminals anywhere in the world br In September and October a series of fragments were reported found in Romania a NATO member state which were suspected to have been the remains of a Russian drone attack near the Romanian border with Ukraine br br br Gas disputes and Nord Stream sabotage br br Until Ukraine was the main transit route for Russian natural gas sold to Europe which earned Ukraine about US billion a year in transit fees making it the country s most lucrative export service Following Russia s launch of the Nord Stream pipeline which bypasses Ukraine gas transit volumes steadily decreased Following the start of the Russo Ukrainian War in February severe tensions extended to the gas sector The subsequent outbreak of war in the Donbas region forced the suspension of a project to develop Ukraine s own shale gas reserves at the Yuzivska gas field which had been planned as a way to reduce Ukrainian dependence on Russian gas imports Eventually the EU commissioner for energy G nther Oettinger was called in to broker a deal securing supplies to Ukraine and transit to the EU br An explosion damaged a Ukrainian portion of the Urengoy Pomary Uzhhorod pipeline in Ivano Frankivsk Oblast in May Ukrainian officials blamed Russian terrorists Another section of the pipeline exploded in the Poltava Oblast on June one day after Russia limited the supply of gas to Ukrainian customers due to non payment Ukraine s Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said the following day that the explosion had been caused by a bomb br In Russian state media reported that Russia planned to completely abandon gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine after Russia s state owned energy giant Gazprom had already substantially reduced the volumes of gas transited across Ukraine and expressed its intention to reduce the level further by means of transit diversification pipelines Turkish Stream Nord Stream etc Gazprom and Ukraine agreed to a five year deal on Russian gas transit to Europe at the end of br In the TurkStream natural gas pipeline running from Russia to Turkey changed the regional gas flows in South East Europe by diverting the transit through Ukraine and the Trans Balkan Pipeline system br In May the Biden administration waived Trump s CAATSA sanctions on the company behind Russia s Nord Stream gas pipeline to Germany Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said he was surprised and disappointed by Joe Biden s decision In July the U S urged Ukraine not to criticise a forthcoming agreement with Germany over the pipeline br In July Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel concluded a deal that the U S might trigger sanctions if Russia used Nord Stream as a political weapon The deal aimed to prevent Poland and Ukraine from being cut off from Russian gas supplies Ukraine will get a million loan for green technology until and Germany will set up a billion dollar fund to promote Ukraine s transition to green energy to compensate for the loss of the gas transit fees The contract for transiting Russian gas through Ukraine will be prolonged until if the Russian government agrees br In August Zelenskyy warned that the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline between Russia and Germany was a dangerous weapon not only for Ukraine but for the whole of Europe In September Ukraine s Naftogaz CEO Yuriy Vitrenko accused Russia of using natural gas as a geopolitical weapon Vitrenko stated that A joint statement from the United States and Germany said that if the Kremlin used gas as a weapon there would be an appropriate response We are now waiting for the imposition of sanctions on a subsidiary of Gazprom the operator of Nord Stream br On September a series of underwater explosions and consequent gas leaks occurred on the Nord Stream NS and Nord Stream NS natural gas pipelines The investigations by Sweden and Denmark described the explosions as sabotage and were closed without identifying perpetrators in February The German government refused to publish the preliminary results of its own investigation in July br br br Hybrid warfare br The Russo Ukrainian conflict has also included elements of hybrid warfare using non traditional means Cyberwarfare has been used by Russia in operations including successful attacks on the Ukrainian power grid in December and in December which was the first successful cyber attack on a power grid and the Mass hacker supply chain attack in June which the US claimed was the largest known cyber attack In retaliation Ukrainian operations have included the Surkov Leaks in October which released e mails in relation to Russian plans for seizing Crimea from Ukraine and fomenting separatist unrest in Donbas The Russian information war against Ukraine has been another front of hybrid warfare waged by Russia br A Russian fifth column in Ukraine has also been claimed to exist among the Party of Regions the Communist Party the Progressive Socialist Party and the Russian Orthodox Church br br br Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns br br Russian propaganda used Nazi allegations for foreign auditory with Nazi term being used the most frequently followed by Hitler with the goal to gather more support for Russian actions in Ukraine For domestic coverage Russian media was almost three times more likely to invoke Bandera than the Nazis Putin and Russian media have described the government of Ukraine as being led by neo Nazis persecuting ethnic Russians who are in need of protection by Russia despite Ukraine s President Zelenskyy being Jewish According to journalist Natalia Antonova Russia s present day war of aggression is refashioned by propaganda into a direct continuation of the legacy of the millions of Russian soldiers who died to stop Nazi Germany in World War II Ukraine s rejection of the adoption of Russia initiated General Assembly resolutions on combating the glorification of Nazism the latest iteration of which is General Assembly Resolution A C L Rev on Combating Glorification of Nazism Neo Nazism and other Practices that Contribute to Fueling Contemporary Forms of Racism Racial
