MongoDB is a source available cross platform document oriented database program Classified as a NoSQL database product MongoDB utilizes JSON like documents with optional schemas MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc and current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License SSPL MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance br br br History br br The American software company gen began developing MongoDB in as a component of a planned platform as a service product In the company shifted to an open source development model and began offering commercial support and other services In gen changed its name to MongoDB Inc br On October MongoDB became a publicly traded company listed on NASDAQ as MDB with an IPO price of per share br On November with the stable release the software s license changed from AGPL to SSPL br On October MongoDB teamed with Alibaba Cloud to offer Alibaba Cloud customers a MongoDB as a service solution Customers can use the managed offering from Alibaba s global data centers br br br Main features br br br Ad hoc queries br MongoDB supports field range query and regular expression searches Queries can return specific fields of documents and also include user defined JavaScript functions Queries can also be configured to return a random sample of results of a given size br br br Indexing br Fields in a MongoDB document can be indexed with primary and secondary indices br br br Replication br MongoDB provides high availability with replica sets A replica set consists of two or more copies of the data Each replica set member may act in the role of primary or secondary replica at any time All writes and reads are done on the primary replica by default Secondary replicas maintain a copy of the data of the primary using built in replication When a primary replica fails the replica set automatically conducts an election process to determine which secondary should become the primary Secondaries can optionally serve read operations but that data is only eventually consistent by default br If the replicated MongoDB deployment only has a single secondary member a separate daemon called an arbiter must be added to the set It has the single responsibility of resolving the election of the new primary As a consequence an ideal distributed MongoDB deployment requires at least three separate servers even in the case of just one primary and one secondary br br br Load balancing br MongoDB scales horizontally using sharding The user chooses a shard key which determines how the data in a collection will be distributed The data is split into ranges based on the shard key and distributed across multiple shards which are masters with one or more replicas Alternatively the shard key can be hashed to map to a shard enabling an even data distribution br MongoDB can run over multiple servers balancing the load or duplicating data to keep the system functional in case of hardware failure br br br File storage br MongoDB can be used as a file system called GridFS with load balancing and data replication features over multiple machines for storing files br This function called a grid file system is included with MongoDB drivers MongoDB exposes functions for file manipulation and content to developers GridFS can be accessed using the mongofiles utility or plugins for Nginx and lighttpd GridFS divides a file into parts or chunks and stores each of those chunks as a separate document br br br Aggregation br MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation the aggregation pipeline the map reduce function and single purpose aggregation methods br Map reduce can be used for batch processing of data and aggregation operations However according to MongoDB s documentation the aggregation pipeline provides better performance for most aggregation operations br The aggregation framework enables users to obtain results similar to those returned by queries that include the SQL GROUP BY clause Aggregation operators can be strung together to form a pipeline analogous to Unix pipes The aggregation framework includes the lookup operator which can join documents from multiple collections as well as statistical operators such as standard deviation br br br Server side JavaScript execution br JavaScript can be used in queries aggregation functions such as MapReduce and sent directly to the database to be executed br br br Capped collections br MongoDB supports fixed size collections called capped collections This type of collection maintains insertion order and once the specified size has been reached behaves like a circular queue br br br Transactions br MongoDB supports multi document ACID transactions since the release in June br br br Editions br br br MongoDB Community Server br The MongoDB Community Edition is free and available for Windows Linux and macOS br br br MongoDB Enterprise Server br MongoDB Enterprise Server is the commercial edition of MongoDB and is available as part of the MongoDB Enterprise Advanced subscription br br br MongoDB Atlas br MongoDB is also available as an on demand fully managed service MongoDB Atlas runs on AWS Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform br On March MongoDB warned its users in Russia and Belarus that their data stored on the MongoDB Atlas platform will be destroyed as a result of American sanctions related to the Russo Ukrainian War br br br Architecture br br br Programming language accessibility br MongoDB has official drivers for major programming languages and development environments There are also a large number of unofficial or community supported drivers for other programming languages and frameworks br br br Serverless access br br br Management and graphical front ends br br The primary interface to the database has been the mongo shell Since MongoDB MongoDB Compass is introduced as the native GUI There are products and third party projects that offer user interfaces for administration and data viewing br br br Licensing br br br MongoDB Community Server br As of October MongoDB is released under the Server Side Public License SSPL a non free license developed by the project It replaces the GNU Affero General Public License and is nearly identical to the GNU General Public License version but requires that those making the software publicly available as part of a service must make the service s entire source code insofar that a user would be able to recreate the service themselves available under this license By contrast the AGPL only requires the source code of the licensed software to be provided to users when the software is conveyed over a network The SSPL was submitted for certification to the Open Source Initiative but later withdrawn In January the Open Source Initiative stated that SSPL is not an open source license The language drivers are available under an Apache License In addition MongoDB Inc offers proprietary licenses for MongoDB The last versions licensed as AGPL version are stable and br MongoDB has been removed from the Debian Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions because of the licensing change Fedora determined that the SSPL version is not a free software license because it is intentionally crafted to be aggressively discriminatory towards commercial users br br br Bug reports and criticisms br br br Security br Because of MongoDB s default security configuration which allows any user full access to the database data from tens of thousands of MongoDB installations has been stolen Furthermore many MongoDB servers have been held for ransom In September Davi Ottenheimer head of product security at MongoDB proclaimed that measures had been taken to defend against these risks br From the MongoDB release onward the binaries for the official MongoDB RPM and DEB packages bind to localhost by default From MongoDB this default behavior was extended to all MongoDB packages across all platforms As a result all networked connections to the database are denied unless explicitly configured by an administrator br br br Technical criticisms br In some failure scenarios in which an application can access two distinct MongoDB processes that cannot access each other it is possible for MongoDB to return stale reads It is also possible for MongoDB to roll back writes that have been acknowledged The issue was addressed in version released in November and applied to earlier releases from v onward br Before version locks were implemented on a per server process basis With version locks were implemented at the database level Beginning with version pluggable storage engines are available and each storage engine may implement locks differently With MongoDB locks are implemented at the collection level for the MMAPv storage engine while the WiredTiger storage engine uses an optimistic concurrency protocol that effectively provides document level locking Even with versions prior to one approach to increase concurrency is to use sharding In some situations reads and writes will yield their locks If MongoDB predicts that a page is unlikely to be in memory operations will yield their lock while the pages load The use of lock yielding expanded greatly in version br Until version MongoDB could not perform collation based sorting and was limited to bytewise comparison via memcmp which would not provide correct ordering for many non English languages when used with a Unicode encoding The issue was fixed on August br Prior to MongoDB queries against an index were not atomic Documents that were updated while queries was running could be missed The introduction of the snapshot read concern in MongoDB eliminated this risk br MongoDB claimed that version had passed the industry s toughest data safety correctness and consistency tests by Jepsen and that MongoDB offers among the strongest data consistency correctness and safety guarantees of any database available today Jepsen which describes itself as a distributed systems safety research company disputed both claims on Twitter saying In that report MongoDB lost data and violated causal by default In its May report on MongoDB version Jepsen wrote that MongoDB had only mentioned tests that version had passed and that version had introduced more problems Jepsen s test summary reads in part br br Jepsen evaluated MongoDB version and found that even at the strongest levels of read and write concern it failed to preserve snapshot isolation Instead Jepsen observed read skew cyclic information flow duplicate writes and internal consistency violations Weak defaults meant that transactions could lose writes and allow dirty reads even downgrading requested safety levels at the database and collection level Moreover the snapshot read concern did not guarantee snapshot unless paired with write concern majority even for read only transactions These design choices complicate the safe use of MongoDB transactions br On May Jepsen updated the report to say MongoDB identified a bug in the transaction retry mechanism which they believe was responsible for the anomalies observed in this report a patch is scheduled for The issue has been patched as of that version and Jepsen criticisms of the default write concerns have also been addressed with the default write concern now elevated to the majority concern w majority from
