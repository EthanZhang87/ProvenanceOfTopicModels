Revenge porn is the distribution of sexually explicit images or videos of individuals without their consent The material may have been made by a partner in an intimate relationship with the knowledge and consent of the subject at the time or it may have been made without their knowledge The subject may have experienced sexual violence during the recording of the material in some cases facilitated by narcotics such as date rape drugs which also cause a reduced sense of pain and involvement in the sexual act dissociative effects and amnesia The possession of the material may be used by the perpetrators to blackmail the subjects into performing other sexual acts to coerce them into continuing a relationship or to punish them for ending one to silence them to damage their reputation and or for financial gain In the wake of civil lawsuits and the increasing numbers of reported incidents legislation has been passed in a number of countries and jurisdictions to outlaw the practice though approaches have varied and been changed over the years The practice has also been described as a form of psychological abuse and domestic violence as well as a form of sexual abuse br Revenge porn most commonly refers to the uploading of sexually explicit material to the Internet to humiliate and intimidate a subject who has broken off a relationship The term is also often misused to describe non revenge scenarios including nonconsensual pornography distributed by hackers or by individuals seeking profit or notoriety more properly referred to by the terms non consensual intimate imagery NCII or image based sexual abuse IBSA The images are usually accompanied by sufficient information to identify the pictured individual a process known as doxing typically names and locations and can include risqu comments links to social media profiles home addresses and workplaces In some cases victims are exposed to workplace discrimination cyber stalking or physical attack Some companies search the Internet for potential sources of bad publicity resulting in many victims of revenge porn losing their jobs and finding themselves effectively unhirable Some academics argue that the term revenge porn should not be used and instead that it should be referred to as image based sexual abuse br Jurisdictions which have passed laws against revenge porn include Canada Germany Italy Israel Singapore Spain the United Kingdom states of the United States plus Washington D C the U S military and U S territories including Puerto Rico and Guam Australia has also passed a law at the Commonwealth level that commenced on September The Australian states and territories of South Australia Victoria New South Wales the Australian Capital Territory the Northern Territory Queensland Western Australia and Tasmania have complementary state level laws that criminalize this behaviour Furthermore Australia also has a civil penalties scheme br In recent years the rise of computer image and video generation technology has raised concerns about the rise of revenge porn made using deepfake pornography techniques As of in the U S states of New York Virginia and California it is illegal to disseminate pornographic images created using image generation technology without the consent of subjects depicted in the image br br br Background br In the s Hustler magazine began a monthly feature of reader submitted images of naked women called Beaver Hunt Beaver Hunt photographs were often accompanied by details about the woman like her hobbies her sexual fantasies and sometimes her name Not all of the women featured in Beaver Hunt submitted their own images and several women sued the magazine for publishing their photographs without their permission or without verifying information on forged consent forms br Two decades later Italian researcher Sergio Messina identified realcore pornography a new genre consisting of images and videos of ex girlfriends distributed through Usenet groups In amateur porn aggregator XTube began receiving complaints that pornographic content had been posted without subjects consent Several sites began staging consensual pornography to resemble revenge porn as well as hosting authentic user submitted content br Revenge porn began garnering international media attention when Hunter Moore launched the website IsAnyoneUp in The site featured user submitted images and was one of the first sites to adopt the model initiated by Beaver Hunt IsAnyoneUp often included identifying information such as the subjects names employers addresses and links to social networking profiles Activist Charlotte Laws was the first person to speak out against Moore and one of the first people to publicly support revenge porn victims This prompted backlash from some of Moore s devotees who stalked Laws and sent her death threats Laws became known around the world as the Erin Brockovich of revenge porn and she was one of the first activists to meet with legislators in an effort to get laws passed against revenge porn br In February the social media site and online bulletin board Reddit announced a change to its privacy policy to ban the posting of sexually explicit content without the consent of those depicted The announcement was made after a company meeting at which the issue of illicit pornography pictures and video was a burning one In March Twitter followed suit with new rules to address the posting of unauthorized content and specifically revenge porn Starting March of that year Twitter stated it would immediately remove any link to a photograph video or digital image of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct that has been posted without consent According to a Washington Post article the changes were in response to growing concerns that Twitter has not done enough to prevent bad behavior on its site br In June Google announced it would remove links to revenge porn on request Microsoft followed suit in July Both have placed forms on line for victims to complete Together the two organizations account for nearly of the internet search market in the U S br The term revenge porn is controversial because those who share images without permission may be motivated by profit notoriety entertainment or other goals besides revenge and because not all visual depictions of nudity or sexual activity are pornographic br br br Advocacy br The website endrevengeporn org was founded by Holly Jacobs a revenge porn victim to campaign for the criminalization of revenge porn which it considered a form of sexual abuse Jacobs also founded the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative CCRI a nonprofit organization that seeks to challenge cyber harassment Danielle Citron known for her discourse on cyber harassment as a civil rights issue the vice president of the CCRI Mary Anne Franks CCRI s president and Legislative Tech Policy Director has been heavily involved with legislative and policy efforts to combat revenge porn Dr Laura Hilly and Kira Allmann of the Oxford Human Rights Hub have characterized revenge porn as a kind of gendered hate speech designed to silence women An article of theirs argues that this stifling of free expression is often ignored in debates over revenge porn Dr Charlotte Laws often called the Erin Brockovich of revenge porn was a CCRI board member until She is perhaps the first victims advocate and one of the first to meet with elected officials in an effort to get legislation passed against nonconsensual pornography br Katie Hill U S representative for California announced in late she would advocate against revenge porn br While not solely focused on revenge porn the non profit organization Without My Consent provided legal resources related to it and lobbies to protect the privacy and free speech rights of online harassment victims In Without My Consent ceased operating and transferred to CCRI all of the comprehensive resources it had developed to aid victims of online abuse Since there has also been a website Women Against Revenge Porn calling itself not an organization or a business which has been cited as an advocacy group for people exposed in revenge porn In late Elisa D Amico and David Bateman partners at the law firm K L Gates launched the Cyber Civil Rights Legal Project CCRLP a project offering free legal help to victims of revenge porn br To better facilitate the introduction of relevant legislation some anti revenge porn activists have called upon others in their community to use gender neutral language more often when discussing the issue The term revenge porn itself has also come under fire The CCRI for instance prefers the term nonconsensual pornography In analogy with child sexual abuse images being the preferred term for child pornography McGlynn and Rackley proposed image based sexual abuse Along with journalist Sarah Jeong they have argued that it is harmful to associate revenge porn with pornography which revolves around consent Jeong also considers it a mistake for activists to focus on revenge porn itself as the main problem rather than the underlying culture which leads to its subjects being socially ostracized br In the Australian Capital Territory an electronic petition was started in March that called upon the A C T Legislative Assembly to consider criminalizing the non consensual disclosure of sexual images and videos The A C T Legislative Assembly consequently passed the Crimes Intimate Image Abuse Amendment Act ACT that criminalised the distribution or threatened distribution of intimate photos and videos on August br br br Legislation br Laws banning revenge porn have been slow to emerge Contributing factors include a lack of understanding about the gravity of the problem free speech concerns belief that existing law provides adequate protection a lack of care historically for women s issues and misunderstandings of First Amendment doctrine Citron Franks The American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have drawn attention to the implications for free speech if legislation is too broad br One concern with revenge porn laws is that they may not be tailored narrowly enough to satisfy the strict scrutiny applicable to content based restrictions on speech Prohibition of revenge porn may not be constitutional according to the Miller v California decision if the porn does not categorically appeal to the prurient interest if it is not in itself patently offensive or if it has literary or political value br br br Africa br In South Africa the Films and Publications Amendment Act makes it a crime to distribute a private sexual photograph or film without the consent of the pictured individual and with the intent to cause them harm The penalty is a fine of up to R and or up to two years imprisonment or double that if the victim is identifiable in the photograph or film br br br Asia br Since the

imprisonment or by a fine of up to million South Korean won If the subject is filmed illicitly the penalty is up to ten years in prison or a fine of up to million won The use of hidden cameras for

prison sentence The website Sora net specialised in the publishing of spy cam porn until it was banned in following a campaign against it Some of those depicted had committed suicide In May ten thousand women demonstrated in Seoul demanding increased official action against digital sex crime In October a petition of over signatories called for increased punishment for the possession of revenge porn regardless of whether it had been distributed br br br Israel br Israel responded quickly to public pressure in January and passed a law making sharing sexually explicit videos without the consent of the pictured individual punishable by up to five years in prison After Israel s bill was passed it was widely predicted that nearby countries such as Egypt Lebanon and Saudi Arabia would not introduce similar bills as they have been slow to adopt legislation against sexual harassment in general However some commentators have suggested that victims could find recourse in existing laws against pornography indecency defamation and invasion of privacy br br br Singapore br Singapore passed the Criminal Law Reform Act on May which includes the criminalisation of revenge porn Penalties include a jail term of up to five years with fines and caning as a sentencing option If the crime is committed against a victim under years of age a mandatory jail term will be imposed The

the number of people prosecuted for disclosing private sexual images during the legislation s first year was It emerged that cases of those who had been victims of revenge porn before April were not
