to apply br br br Sales Model br Atlassian operates under the principle that software should be bought not sold Instead of running a traditional sales team they opted to build a self service purchase experience This was considered risky in the early s but the strategy worked better than expected when they awoke one morning to an order form from American Airlines in the fax machine While a majority

disseminate sensitive Atlassian Jira data including Blue Origin staff s competitor discussions and technical issues with sensors equipment and manifolds br DataSpii circumvented the most effective security measures enabling the unauthorized dissemination of Jira data from the internal corporate networks of leading cybersecurity firms This resulted in the real time leakage of Jira tickets containing the cybersecurity issues of entities such as the Pentagon Bank of America AT T and others Jadali s investigation revealed that DDMR facilitated rapid dissemination of the data to additional third parties often within minutes of acquisition endangering the privacy of the sensitive data collected br The DataSpii leak harvested data from millions of Chrome and Firefox users through compromised browser extensions exploiting Atlassian s method of embedding project tasks and other corporate data directly within page titles The leak demonstrated a vulnerability in data security
