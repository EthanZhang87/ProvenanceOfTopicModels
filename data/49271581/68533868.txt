A tweet is a short status update on the social networking site Twitter and later X under post which can include images videos GIFs straw polls hashtags mentions and hyperlinks Around of all tweets are made by of users averaging tweets per month with the median user making only two tweets per month br The service has experimented with changing how tweets work over the years to attract more users and to keep them on the site The character limit was originally characters when the service started had media attachments no longer count in the mid s and doubled altogether in br br br Content br A tweet can contain up to characters and include media Users subscribed to Twitter Blue and later X Premium can post up to characters and can include bold and italic styling br br br Character limit br Tweets originally were limited to characters when the service launched in Twitter was originally designed to be used on SMS text messages which are limited to characters Twitter reserved characters for the username leaving characters for the post The original limit was seen as an iconic fixture of the platform encouraging speed and brevity br Increasing the limit had been a topic of discussion inside the company for years and had been resurfaced in for ways to grow the userbase At the time internal discussion also involved excluding links and mentions from the character limit By January an internal product named Beyond was in development targeting Q of the same year for expanding tweet limits By the end of the company was moving close to introducing a or character limit An unfinalized version had tweets that went over the old character threshold only showing the first characters with a call to action that there was more in the tweet Clicking on the tweet would reveal the rest which was done to retain the same feel of the timeline br The change was controversial internally and met with backlash by users Dorsey confirmed that the character limit would remain but had told employees upon his return as CEO that the once sacred aspects of Twitter were no longer untouchable br In May a week after being leaked Twitter announced that media attachments images GIFs videos polls quote tweets nor mentions in replies would no longer increase the character limit to be rolled out later in the year to ready developers The changes rolled out in September except for the replies which were tested in October and then rolled out in March a year after the original announcement These changes were a compromise to internal resistance to a character limit from the year before br On September Twitter announced the company was testing doubling the character limit from to It was an effort for users to be more expressive with their tweets as users would be cramming ideas into a single tweet by rewriting and removing vowels or not tweeting at all It began testing to a small group of users in all languages excluding Japanese Chinese and Korean because the three languages can say double the amount of information in one character According to the company s statistics of tweets in Japanese hit the character ceiling while of tweets in English hit the ceiling Users not in the test group were able to see and interact with them normally br The change was similarly controversial internally as the character limit proposal The immediate reaction by Twitter users was largely negative br br br Links br URLs can be linked on Twitter A tweet s links are converted to the t co link shortener and use up characters out of the limit The shortener was introduced in June to allow users to save space on their links without needing a third party service like Bitly or TinyURL br br br Media br br Some users use screenshots of text and uploaded them as images to increase the amount of words they could include in a tweet br br br Cards br br Beginning in tweets linking to partnered websites would show below the content of the tweet expanded media an excerpt of a linked news article or an embedded video Twitter already had a way to see Instagram posts and YouTube videos called expanded tweets Twitter then began allowing websites apply to test offering cards for Twitter users Later in notably after Facebook purchased it Instagram started cropping images displayed in cards with the plan to end them all together br br br CoTweets br Between July and January Twitter tested a feature where two users could be the author of a tweet which would be posted on both of their accounts Both users profile pictures names and handles are shown One user drafts a tweet in the Composer field then invite a user that is both following them and has their account published Edits could not be made once the invite was sent with the alternative being deleting the invitation and making a second one The second author could accept the invitation at which the tweet would then be posted to both accounts Once published the second user could revoke them being a co author and the tweet would change to being written by the first author and being removed from the second author s tweets Until the second author accepts the invitation the tweet would be unlisted not appearing on the authors timelines or in searches but available via a direct link br It was tested with some accounts in the US Canada and South Korea The company noted during the test that the feature may be turned off and all CoTweets deleted The feature was spotted in code in December br On January Twitter suddenly and quietly decided to stop new CoTweets from being made though noted that it could return in the future CoTweets were able to be seen for another month before being converted to a normal tweet for the first author and a retweet for the second author Though Twitter s support page offered a generic reasoning for discontinuing the feature Elon Musk said that it was to focus on allowing users to add text attachments br br br Vibes br Twitter briefly tested a feature in that allowed users to set the current status codenamed vibe for a tweet or account from a small set of emoji phrase combinations It would allow the user to either tag per tweet or on the profile level with it showing on tweets and the profile Testing began on vibes in June with a wider selection that could be put above tweets but disappeared after some time Phrases included Current status and Case of the Mondays Twitter removed the ability to add vibes to tweets br br br Interactions br Users can interact with tweets by retweeting reblogging liking quoting the tweet or replying to it br br br Retweets br In November Twitter began rolling out the ability to retweet a tweet Prior to this people would write RT username before quoting the original tweet Some people limited their character limit down further so that other people could always fit their entire tweet in a proto retweet In with the rebranding of Twitter to X retweets were quietly renamed to reposts but retweets are still the commonly used term br br br Liking br Tweets can be liked by users adding them to a list that other users used to be able to view prior to likes becoming private for all users The feature was available when Twitter launched in Until likes were called favorites or favs The service renamed them because people often misunderstood the feature and people reacted more positively in user tests Users had the option of hiding their likes from the public though their like would not be hidden from the list of users who likes a given tweet Jack Dorsey said in that if he had to create Twitter over again he would deemphasize the like or not include it altogether because it did not positively contribute to healthy conversations br Likes used to be public they are now hidden by default and they are not broadcast to the user s tweets timeline When likes were public users would often forget their likes were public or liked more revealing tweets High profile users and politicians accounts have liked pornographic hateful and racist tweets For instance in Ted Cruz s account liked a tweet with a two minute porn video about a day after it was posted Cruz said that many people had access to his account and one of his staff members pressed the like button in an honest mistake br When not logged in users tweets are sorted by how many likes they received opposed to reverse chronological br br br Quote tweets br In Twitter began testing a new feature that allows users to embed a tweet inside their tweet to add additional commentary Prior to this users could include a snippet of another tweet in a new tweet but were limited to quoting the at the time character limit It was originally called retweet with comment and was later named quote tweet Following the rebranding of Twitter to X quote tweets were renamed simply dropping the tweet to become quotes The common name still largely remains quote tweets br br br Threads br Multiple tweets in reply to each other are grouped together in threads The character limit prevented users from posting as complete thoughts as they desired and resorted to making upwards of dozens of tweets which all showed in a disjointed manner dubbed a tweetstorm It was popularized by Marc Andreessen br br br Bookmarking br Users are able to add a bookmark to individual tweets via the share icon saving them to revisit them later The bookmarks are private but tweets display the number of times it has been bookmarked if at all br The development was revealed to in October The feature highly requested by Japanese users started from an annual hack week at the company and called ShareForLater Previously users would resort to liking the tweet or by sending it to themselves Liking tweets is often seen as an endorsement or positive endorsement and the likes are public and are notified to the user who made the tweet The feature was tested in November for some users and rolled out in February on mobile alongside a new share menu The web version of Twitter did not test the bookmark feature until November When released the user who made the tweet would have been unaware that a tweet was bookmarked br br br Fact checking br br In March Twitter added a label to a manipulated video of then candidate Joe Biden that Donald Trump retweeted Two months later as a result of the COVID pandemic Twitter introduced a policy that would label or warn users on tweets with COVID misinformation The company said at the time that other areas would have labels covered and shortly afterwards misleading information on elections were included br On March then US president Donald Trump made two false statements about mail in ballots claiming they were substantially fraudulent Within hours of the tweet Twitter s general counsel and the acting head of policy jointly decided to label Trump s tweets with several hours of internal debate from company leaders and then CEO Jack Dorsey signed off on the decision shortly before the label was applied The labels which told readers to Get the facts about mail in ballots was the first time they were applied to Trump s tweets A spokesperson for Twitter said that the tweets contained potentially misleading information about voting processes and have been labeled to provide additional context around mail in ballots The label linked to articles by CNN The Washington Post and The Hill as well as summaries of claims of fraud br Three days later a tweet about the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis Saint Paul was hidden from view br br br Community Notes br br In the weeks after the January United States Capitol attack Twitter rolled out a new program that allowed users to add notes underneath tweets that would benefit from additional context br br br History br br The first tweet made by Jack Dorsey was made on March It has the Snowflake ID of br The Iconfactory was developing a Twitter application in called Twitterrific and developer Craig Hockenberry began a search for a shorter way to refer to Post a Twitter Update In they began using twit before Twitter developer Blaine Cook suggested that tweet be used instead br Tweet was added to the Merriam Webster dictionary in and to the Oxford English Dictionary in Both its use as a verb and noun were added This was notable as the Oxford English Dictionary normally waits ten years after the coining of a word to add it to the dictionary br In the terms tweet and retweet were quietly retired in favor of the terms post and repost as a part of Twitter s rebrand to X but some users continue to use the former terms on the X platform br br br Demographics br br The median Twitter user tweets twice a month Around of tweets made are from of the users who tweet times per month of the prolific users are women compared to of the bottom Most of the prolific users tweet about political issues There is no difference in political views between the two groups of the prolific users use automated tools to make tweets compared to
