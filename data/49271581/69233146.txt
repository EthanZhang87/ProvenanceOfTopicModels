Web also known as Web is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as decentralization blockchain technologies and token based economics Some technologists and journalists have contrasted it with Web wherein they say data and content are centralized in a small group of companies sometimes referred to as Big Tech The term Web was coined in by Ethereum co founder Gavin Wood and the idea gained interest in from cryptocurrency enthusiasts large technology companies and venture capital firms The concepts of Web were first represented in br Critics have expressed concerns over the centralization of wealth to a small group of investors and individuals or a loss of privacy due to more expansive data collection Billionaires like Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey have argued that Web only serves as a buzzword or marketing term br br br Background br br Web and Web refer to eras in the history of the World Wide Web as it evolved through various technologies and formats Web refers roughly to the period from to where most sites consisted of static pages and the vast majority of users were consumers not producers of content Web is based around the idea of the web as platform and centers on user created content uploaded to forums social media and networking services blogs and wikis among other services Web is generally considered to have begun around and continues to the current day br br br Terminology br Web is distinct from Tim Berners Lee s concept for a Semantic Web In Berners Lee described the Semantic Web as a component of Web which is different from the meaning of Web in blockchain contexts br The term Web was coined by Polkadot founder and Ethereum co founder Gavin Wood in referring to a decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain In the idea of Web gained popularity Particular interest spiked toward the end of largely due to interest from cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investments from high profile technologists and companies Executives from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz traveled to Washington DC in October to lobby for the idea as a potential solution to questions about regulation of the web with which policymakers have been grappling br br br Concept br Specific visions for Web differ and the term has been described by Olga Kharif as hazy but they revolve around the idea of decentralization and often incorporate blockchain technologies such as various cryptocurrencies and non fungible tokens NFTs Kharif has described Web as an idea that would build financial assets in the form of tokens into the inner workings of almost anything you do online A policy brief published by the Bennett Institute for Public Policy at the University of Cambridge defined Web as the putative next generation of the web s technical legal and payments infrastructure including blockchain smart contracts and cryptocurrencies According to Liu Zhuotao et al three fundamental architectural enablers of Web were identified as a combination of decentralized or federated platforms secured interoperability and verifiable computing through distributed ledger technologies br Some visions are based around the concept of decentralized autonomous organizations DAOs Decentralized finance DeFi is another key concept in it users exchange currency without bank or government involvement Self sovereign identity allows users to identify themselves without relying on an authentication system such as OAuth in which a trusted party has to be reached in order to assess identity br br br Reception br Academic researchers such as Tomer J Chaffer and Justin Goldston in have described Web as a possible solution to concerns about the over centralization of the web in a few Big Tech companies Some have expressed the notion that Web could improve data security scalability and privacy beyond what is currently possible with Web platforms Bloomberg states that skeptics say the idea is a long way from proving its use beyond niche applications many of them tools aimed at crypto traders The New York Times reported that several investors are betting billion that Web is the future of the internet br Some Web companies including Reddit and Discord have explored incorporating Web technologies into their platforms On November CEO Jason Citron tweeted a screenshot suggesting Discord might be exploring integrating cryptocurrency wallets into their platform Two days later and after heavy user backlash Discord announced they had no plans to integrate such technologies and that it was an internal only concept that had been developed in a company wide hackathon br Some legal scholars quoted by The Conversation have expressed concerns over the difficulty of regulating a decentralized web which they reported might make it more difficult to prevent cybercrime online harassment hate speech and the dissemination of child pornography But the news website also states that decentralized web represents the cyber libertarian views and hopes of the past that the internet can empower ordinary people by breaking down existing power structures Some other critics of Web see the concept as a part of a cryptocurrency bubble or as an extension of blockchain based trends that they see as overhyped or harmful particularly NFTs Some critics have raised concerns about the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies and NFTs Cryptocurrencies vary in efficiency with proof of stake having been designed to be less energy intensive than the more widely used proof of work although there is disagreement about how secure and decentralized this is in practice Others have expressed beliefs that Web and the associated technologies are a pyramid scheme br Jack Dorsey co founder and former CEO of Twitter dismissed Web as a venture capitalists plaything Dorsey opined that Web will not democratize the internet but it will shift power from players like Facebook to venture capital funds like Andreessen Horowitz br br br Buzzword br Liam Proven writing for The Register concludes that Web is a myth a fairy story It s what parents tell their kids about at night if they want them to grow up to become economists br In SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk expressed skepticism about Web in a tweet saying that Web seems more marketing buzzword than reality right now br In November James Grimmelmann of Cornell University referred to Web as vaporware calling it a promised future internet that fixes all the things people don t like about the current internet even when it s contradictory Grimmelmann also argued that moving the internet toward a blockchain focused infrastructure would centralize and cause more data collection compared to the current internet br Software engineer Stephen Diehl described Web in a blog post as a vapid marketing campaign that attempts to reframe the public s negative associations of crypto assets into a false narrative about disruption of legacy tech company hegemony br br br Decentralization concerns br Kevin Werbach author of The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust has said that many so called Web solutions are not as decentralized as they seem while others have yet to show they are scalable secure and accessible enough for the mass market adding that this may change but it s not a given that all these limitations will be overcome br In early Moxie Marlinspike creator of Signal articulated how Web is not as decentralized as it appears to be mainly due to consolidation in the cryptocurrency field including in blockchain application programming interfaces which are currently mainly controlled by the companies Alchemy and Infura cryptocurrency exchanges which are mainly dominated by Binance Coinbase MetaMask and OpenSea and the stablecoin market which is currently dominated by Tether Marlinspike also remarked that the new web resembles the old web br An Ad Age article from stated early adopters want to make a new internet that alleviates the problems of the old one but said if companies put the same type of people in charge as on the earlier version and those people had similar attitudes the same problems would happen Another article in the same issue of the magazine quoted Alex Smeele co founder of Non Fungible Labs who said companies that wanted to participate in Web were actually going to have to rethink their entire business model br Ana Constantino founder of meetup platform Nowhere said the metaverse did not really welcome everyone because owners of NFT virtual real estate on sites such as Decentraland could keep people out who did not have the assets br br br See also br Distributed social network br InterPlanetary File System br History of the World Wide Web br br br
