explicitly pornographic to mildly suggestive romantic or in rare cases entirely nonsexual in which case it is not usually classified as true shotacon As with lolicon shotacon is related to the concepts of kawaii cuteness and moe in which characters are presented as young cute or helpless in order to increase reader identification and inspire protective feelings As such shotacon themes and characters are used in a variety of children s media Elements of shotacon like yaoi are comparatively common in sh jo manga such as the popular translated manga Loveless which features an eroticized but unconsummated relationship between the year old male protagonist and a twenty year old male or the young appearing character Honey in Ouran High School Host Club Seinen manga primarily aimed at

is a Japanese contraction of Sh tar complex Sh tar konpurekkusu a reference to the young male character Sh tar from Tetsujin go In the anime and manga series Sh tar is a bold self assertive detective who frequently outwits his adversaries and helps to solve cases Throughout the series Sh tar develops close friends within the world His bish nen cuteness embodied and formed the term shotacon putting a name to an old sexual subculture The word shotacon itself was coined in the magazine Fan Road in br Where the shotacon concept developed is hard to pinpoint but some of its earliest roots are in reader responses to detective series written by Edogawa Rampo In his works a character named Yoshio Kobayashi of Sh nentanteidan Junior Detective Group similar to the Baker Street Irregulars of Sherlock Holmes forms a deep dependency with adult protagonist Kogoro Akechi Kobayashi a beautiful teenager constantly concerns himself with Kogoro s cases and well being and for a time moves in with the unmarried man This nonsexual but intimate adult boy relationship in part inspired the evolution of the shotacon community br Tamaki Sait writes that although the modern shotacon audience has a roughly even split between males and females the genre is rumored to have roots in early s d jinshi as an offshoot of yaoi Sait suggests that shotacon was adopted by male readers who were influenced by lolicon thus he claims shota texts by female yaoi authors are structurally identical to yaoi texts while shota by male otaku clearly position these little boys as young girls with penises Kaoru Nagayama writes that the manga anthology U C BOYS Under Cover Boys started a boom in commercial shotacon in the second half of the s During this time male oriented shotacon emerged and mixed with female oriented shotacon the situation was such that shota works targeting women men and a combination of both were all in close proximity The boom collapsed at the end of the s but male targeted
