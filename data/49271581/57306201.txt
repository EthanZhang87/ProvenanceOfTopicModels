title: Non-fungible token
id: 57306201
A non fungible token NFT is a unique digital identifier that is recorded on a blockchain and is used to certify ownership and authenticity It cannot be copied substituted or subdivided The ownership of an NFT is recorded in the blockchain and can be transferred by the owner allowing NFTs to be sold and traded Initially pitched as a new class of investment asset by September one report claimed that over of NFT collections had zero monetary value br NFTs can be created by anybody and require few or no coding skills to create NFTs typically contain references to digital files such as artworks photos videos and audio Because NFTs are uniquely identifiable they differ from cryptocurrencies which are fungible br Proponents claim that NFTs provide a public certificate of authenticity or proof of ownership but the legal rights conveyed by an NFT can be uncertain The ownership of an NFT as defined by the blockchain has no inherent legal meaning and does not necessarily grant copyright intellectual property rights or other legal rights over its associated digital file An NFT does not restrict the sharing or copying of its associated digital file and does not prevent the creation of NFTs that reference identical files br NFT trading increased from US million in to US billion in NFTs have been used as speculative investments and have drawn criticism for the energy cost and carbon footprint associated with some types of blockchain as well as their use in art scams The NFT market has also been compared to an economic bubble or a Ponzi scheme At their peak the three biggest NFT platforms were Ethereum Solana and Cardano In the NFT market collapsed a May estimate was that the number of sales was down over compared to br br br Characteristics br An NFT is a data file stored on a type of digital ledger called a blockchain which can be sold and traded The NFT can be associated with a particular asset digital or physical such as an image art music or recording of a sports event It may confer licensing rights to use the asset for a specified purpose An NFT and if applicable the associated license to use copy or display the underlying asset can be traded and sold on digital markets However the extralegal nature of NFT trading usually results in an informal exchange of ownership over the asset that has no legal basis for enforcement and so often confers little more than use as a status symbol br NFTs function like cryptographic tokens but unlike cryptocurrencies NFTs are not usually mutually interchangeable so they are not fungible A non fungible token contains data links for example which point to details about where the associated art is stored that can be affected by link rot br br br Copyright br br An NFT solely represents a proof of ownership of a blockchain record and does not necessarily imply that the owner possesses intellectual property rights to the digital asset the NFT purports to represent Someone may sell an NFT that represents their work but the buyer will not necessarily receive copyright to that work and the seller may not be prohibited from creating additional NFT copies of the same work According to legal scholar Rebecca Tushnet In one sense the purchaser acquires whatever the art world thinks they have acquired They definitely do not own the copyright to the underlying work unless it is explicitly transferred br Certain NFT projects such as Bored Apes explicitly assign intellectual property rights of individual images to their respective owners The NFT collection CryptoPunks was a project that initially prohibited owners of its NFTs from using the associated digital artwork for commercial use but later allowed such use upon acquisition by the collection s parent company br br br History br br br Early projects br The first known NFT Quantum was created by Kevin McCoy and Anil Dash in May It consists of a video clip made by McCoy s wife Jennifer McCoy registered the video on the Namecoin blockchain and sold it to Dash for during a live presentation for the Seven on Seven conferences at the New Museum in New York City McCoy and Dash referred to the technology as monetized graphics This explicitly linked a non fungible tradable blockchain marker to a work of art via on chain metadata enabled by Namecoin br In October the first NFT project Etheria was launched and demonstrated at DEVCON in London Ethereum s first developer conference three months after the launch of the Ethereum blockchain Most of Etheria s purchasable and tradable hexagonal tiles went unsold for more than five years until March when renewed interest in NFTs sparked a buying frenzy Within hours all tiles of the current version and a prior version each hardcoded to ETH US at the time of launch were sold for a total of US million br In Rare Pepes a semi fungible NFT project centered around the Pepe the Frog meme involving a collective of artists contributing their works into a curated directory emerged on Bitcoin through a protocol known as Counterparty which had been created in and used to create other assets br In several NFT projects emerged on Ethereum that utilized a fungible token standard known as ERC Curio Cards in May of that year is credited with being Ethereum s first art NFT project using the fungible standard and features artwork in the shape of a card among a variety of image types including satirized corporate logos The generative art project of pixelated characters known as CryptoPunks emerged soon after in June and would later establish itself as one of the most commercially successful NFT projects In December a clipart based collection featuring images of rocks called EtherRock emerged br in November the widely acclaimed blockchain game on Ethereum known as CryptoKitties launched and is credited with pioneering what is considered to be the first bona fide non fungible token standard known as ERC It used an early version of ERC that differed from the formally published version of the standard in br br br ERC Non Fungible Token Standard br While experiments around non fungibility have existed on blockchains since as early as with Colored Coins on Bitcoin a community driven paper called ERC Non Fungible Token Standard was published in under the initiative of civic hacker and lead author William Entriken and is recognized as pioneering the foundation for NFTs and enabling the growth of the wider eco system It introduced the formalization and defining of the term Non Fungible Token NFT in blockchain nomenclature by establishing a standard for smart contracts known as ERC whose tokens would have unique attributes and ownership details ensuring no two tokens are alike The creation of derivative standards followed from its influence on Ethereum like ERC enabling semi fungibility and other blockchains Its versatility enabled the pioneering of numerous use cases including digital artwork deeds to physical items real estate including virtual access passes and game assets Ultimately the emergence of ERC is recognized for having fundamentally changed the landscape of digital verification authentication and ownership br br br Origins of the term NFT and its adoption br The term NFT prior to the blockchain game CryptoKitties adoption of ERC is not known to have been used for earlier projects Through discussion among stakeholders for the ERC draft the word deed was given consideration among other alternatives including distinguishable asset title token asset equity ticket Ultimately through Entriken s initiative under the moniker Fulldecent a vote was held during the paper s drafting phase to decide which word would be used in the published version and NFT was chosen by the stakeholders br The term NFT and the awareness of the ERC standard received significant exposure and adopted use through the popularity of CryptoKitties in While using the standard CryptoKitties earned the recognition of being the first mainstream NFT dApp the game s usage was significant enough to have overwhelmed Ethereum s processing power at the time br br br Influence br During the height of the breakout success of CryptoKitties and the emergence of ERC tokens in an NFT marketplace called OpenSea emerged to capitalize off of the new non fungible token standard It positioned itself early in the NFT market landscape and grew to a billion market cap in during the then ongoing NFT boom br in ArtReview s Power ranked ERC at the spot praising it as the most powerful art entity in the world for creating a new kind of market for artworks that deviated from traditional gatekeeping norms and ushered in a different kind of collector Artist Beeple sold an ERC NFT of his composite artwork known as Everydays The First Days at Christie s for million and was the first instance of a legacy arthouse dealing in NFTs br br br General NFT market br The NFT market experienced rapid growth during with its value tripling to US million In the first three months of more than US million were spent on NFTs br In the early months of interest in NFTs increased after a number of high profile sales and art auctions br In May The Wall Street Journal reported that the NFT market was collapsing Daily sales of NFT tokens had declined from September and the number of active wallets in the NFT market fell from November While rising interest rates had impacted risky bets across the financial markets the Journal said NFTs are among the most speculative br In December a programmer named Casey Rodarmor introduced a new way to add NFTs to the Bitcoin blockchain called ordinals By February the popularity of ordinals had led to an increase in bitcoin s payment fees and may have also partially contributed to an increase in bitcoin s price br A September report from cryptocurrency gambling website dappGambl claimed of NFTs had fallen to zero monetary value br br br Uses br br br Commonly associated files br NFTs have been used to exchange digital tokens that link to a digital file asset Ownership of an NFT is often associated with a license to use such a linked digital asset but generally does not confer the copyright to the buyer Some agreements only grant a license for personal non commercial use while other licenses also allow commercial use of the underlying digital asset This kind of decentralized intellectual copyright poses an alternative to established forms of safeguarding copyright controlled by state institutions and middlemen within the respective industry br br br Digital art br br Digital art is a common use case for NFTs High profile auctions of NFTs linked to digital art have received considerable public attention the first such major house auction took place at Christie s in The work entitled Merge by artist Pak was the most expensive NFT with an auction price of US million and Everydays the First Days by artist Mike Winkelmann known professionally as Beeple the second most expensive at US million in br br Some NFT collections including Bored Apes EtherRocks and CryptoPunks are examples of generative art where many different images are created by assembling a selection of simple picture components in different combinations br In March the blockchain company Injective Protocol bought a original screen print entitled Morons White from English graffiti artist Banksy and filmed somebody burning it with a cigarette lighter They uploaded known as minting in the NFT scene and sold the video as an NFT The person who destroyed the artwork who called themselves Burnt Banksy described the act as a way to transfer a physical work of art to the NFT space br American curator and art historian Tina Rivers Ryan who specializes in digital works said that art museums are widely not convinced that NFTs have lasting cultural relevance Ryan compares NFTs to the net art fad before the dot com bubble In July after the controversial sale of Michelangelo s Doni Tondo in Italy the sale of NFT reproductions of famous artworks was prohibited in Italy Given the complexity and lack of regulation of the matter the Ministry of Culture of Italy temporarily requested that its institutions refrain from signing contracts involving NFTs br No centralized means of authentication exists to prevent stolen and counterfeit digital works from being sold as NFTs although auction houses like Sotheby s Christie s and various museums and galleries worldwide started collaborations and partnerships with digital artists such as Refik Anadol Dangiuz and Sarah Zucker br NFTs associated with digital artworks could be sold and bought via NFT platforms OpenSea launched in was one of the first marketplaces to host various types of NFTs In July

artist Krista Kim sold in for Ether ETH at that time equivalent to US br br br Games br br NFTs can represent in game assets Some commentators describe these as being controlled by the user instead of the game developer if they can be traded on third party marketplaces without permission from the game developer Their reception from game developers though has been generally mixed with some like Ubisoft embracing the technology but Valve and Microsoft formally prohibiting them br br CryptoKitties was an early successful blockchain online game in which players adopt and trade virtual cats The monetization of NFTs within the game raised a million investment with some kitties selling for over each Following its success CryptoKitties was added to the ERC standard which was created in January and finalized in June br In October Valve Corporation banned applications from their Steam platform if those applications use blockchain technology or NFTs to exchange value or game artifacts br In December Ubisoft announced Ubisoft Quartz an NFT initiative which allows people to buy artificially scarce digital items using cryptocurrency The announcement was heavily criticized by audiences with

NFTs would not be permitted in Minecraft saying that they went against the game s values of creative inclusion and playing together br br br Music and film br NFTs have been proposed for use within the film industry as a way to tokenize movie scenes and sell them as collectibles in the form of NFTs Artists involved in the entertainment industry can seek royalties through NFTs br So far NFTs have often been used in both the music as well as the film industry br br In May th Century Fox partnered with Atom Tickets and released limited edition Deadpool digital posters to promote the film They

well as Charlie Bit My Finger Nyan Cat and Disaster Girl br Some virtual worlds often marketed as metaverses have incorporated NFTs as a means of trading virtual items and virtual real estate br Some pornographic works have been sold as NFTs though hostility from NFT marketplaces towards pornographic material has presented significant drawbacks for creators By using NFTs people engaged in this area of the entertainment industry are able to publish their works without third party platforms being able to delete them br The first credited political protest NFT Destruction of Nazi Monument

via NFTs and use the profits to finance research conducted by Nebula Genomics In June NFTs with his likeness were published instead of the originally planned NFTs of his DNA due to the market conditions at the time Despite mixed reactions the project is considered to be part of an effort to use the genetic data of individuals to support genetic research By using NFTs the project wants to ensure that the users submitting their genetic data are able to receive direct payment for their contributions Several other companies have been involved in similar and often criticized efforts to use blockchain based genetic data in order to guarantee users more control over their data and enable them to receive direct financial compensation whenever their data is being sold br Molecule Protocol a project based in Switzerland is trying to use NFTs to digitize the intellectual copyright of individual scientists and research teams to finance research The project s whitepaper explains the aim is to represent the copyright of scientific papers as NFTs and enable their trade between researchers and investors on a future marketplace The project was able to raise US million in seed money in July A similar approach has been announced by RMDS Lab br br br Speculation br NFTs representing digital collectables and artworks are a speculative asset The NFT buying surge was called an economic bubble by experts who also compared it to the Dot com bubble In March Mike Winkelmann called NFTs an irrational exuberance bubble By mid April demand subsided causing prices to fall significantly Financial theorist William J Bernstein compared the NFT market to th century tulip mania saying any speculative bubble requires a technological advance for people to get excited about with part of that enthusiasm coming from the extreme predictions being made about the product For regulatory policymakers NFTs have exacerbated challenges such as speculation fraud and high volatility br br br Money laundering br NFTs as with other blockchain securities and with traditional art sales can potentially be used for money laundering NFTs can be used for wash trading by creating several wallets for one individual generating several fictitious sales and consequently selling the respective NFT to a third party According to a report by Chainalysis these types of wash trades are becoming popular among money launderers because of the largely anonymous nature of transactions on NFT marketplaces Looksrare created in early came to be known for the large sums generated through the sale of NFTs in its earliest days amounting to US a day These large sums were generated in large part through wash trading The Royal United Services Institute said that any risks in relation to money laundering through NFTs could be mitigated through the use of KYC best practices strong cyber security measures and a stolen art registry without restricting the growth of this new market br Auction platforms for NFTs may face regulatory pressure to comply with anti money laundering legislation Gou Wenjun the director of a monitoring centre for the People s Bank of China said that NFTs could easily become money laundering tools He pointed to unlawful exploitation of cryptographic technologies and said that illicit actors often presented themselves as innovators in financial technology br A study from the United States Treasury assessed that there was some evidence of money laundering risk in the high value art market including through the emerging digital art market such as the use of non fungible tokens NFTs The study considered how NFT transactions may be a simpler option for laundering money through art by avoiding the transportation or insurance complications in trading physical art Several NFT exchanges were labeled as virtual asset service providers that may be subject to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network regulations In March two people were charged for the execution of a million dollar NFT scheme through wire fraud br The European Commission announced in July that it was planning to draw up regulations to combat money laundering by br br br Other uses br In Nike patented a system called CryptoKicks that would use NFTs to verify the authenticity of its physical products and would give a virtual version of the shoe to the customer br Certain NFT releases have also added exclusivity to the NFT utility including access to private online clubs br br br Standards in blockchains br Several blockchains have added support for NFTs since Ethereum created its ERC standard br ERC is an inheritable smart contract standard which means that developers can create contracts by copying from a reference implementation ERC provides core methods that allow tracking the owner of a unique identifier as well as a way for the owner to transfer the asset to others Another standard ERC offers semi fungibility whereby a token represents a class of interchangeable assets br br br Issues and criticisms br br br Unenforceability of content ownership br br Because the contents of NFTs are publicly accessible anybody can easily copy a file referenced by an NFT Furthermore the ownership of an NFT on the blockchain does not inherently convey legally enforceable intellectual property rights to the file br It has become well known that an NFT image can be copied or saved from a web browser by using a right click menu to download the referenced image NFT supporters disparage this duplication of NFT artwork as a right clicker mentality One collector quoted by Vice compared the value of a purchased NFT in contrast to an unpurchased copy of the underlying asset to that of a status symbol to show off that they can afford to pay that much br The right clicker mentality phrase spread virally after its introduction particularly among those who were critical of the NFT marketplace and who appropriated the term to flaunt their ability to capture digital art backed by NFT with ease This criticism was promoted by Australian programmer Geoffrey Huntley who created The NFT Bay modeled after The Pirate Bay The NFT Bay advertised a torrent file purported to contain terabytes of digital art NFT images Huntley compared his work to an art project from Pauline Pantsdown and hoped the site would help educate users on what NFTs are and are not br br br Storage off chain br NFTs that represent digital art generally do not store the associated artwork file on the blockchain due to the large size of such a file and the limited processing speed of blockchains Such a token functions like a certificate of ownership with a web address that points to the piece of art in question this however makes the art itself vulnerable to link rot br br br Environmental concerns br br NFT purchases and sales have been enabled by the high energy usage and consequent greenhouse gas emissions associated with some kinds of blockchain transactions Though all forms of Ethereum transactions have had an impact on the environment the direct impact of these transaction has also depended on the size of the transaction The proof of work protocol required to regulate and verify blockchain transactions on networks including Ethereum until consumes a large amount of electricity To estimate the carbon footprint of a given NFT transaction requires a variety of assumptions or estimations about the manner in which that transaction is set up on the blockchain the economic behavior of blockchain miners and the energy demands of their mining equipment and the amount of renewable energy being used on these networks There are also conceptual questions such as whether the carbon footprint estimate for an NFT purchase should incorporate some portion of the ongoing energy demand of the underlying network or just the marginal impact of that particular purchase An analogy might be the carbon footprint associated with an additional passenger on a given airline flight br In Ethereum cut its energy usage by percent by switching to proof of stake Other approaches to reducing electricity include the use of off chain transactions as part of minting an NFT Some NFT markets have offered the option of buying carbon offsets when making NFT purchases although the environmental benefits of this have been questioned In some instances NFT artists have decided against selling some of their own work to limit carbon emission contributions br br br Artist and buyer fees br Sales platforms charge artists and buyers fees for minting listing claiming and secondary sales Analysis of NFT markets in March in the immediate aftermath of Beeple s Everydays the First Days selling for US million found that most NFT artworks were selling for less than US with a third selling for less than US Those selling NFTs below were paying platform fees between and of that amount On average the fees make up of the price meaning that such artists were on average paying more money in fees than they were making in sales br br br Plagiarism and fraud br There have been cases of artists and creators having their work sold by others as an NFT without permission After the artist Qing Han died in her identity was assumed by a fraudster and a number of her works became available for purchase as NFTs Similarly a seller posing as Banksy succeeded in selling an NFT supposedly made by the artist for in the seller refunded the money after the case drew media attention In it was discovered that as part of their NFT marketing campaign an NFT company that voice actor Troy Baker announced his partnership with had plagiarized voice lines generated from ai a free AI text to speech project br The anonymity associated with NFTs and the ease with which they can be forged make it difficult to pursue legal action against NFT plagiarists br In February artist Mason Rothschild was ordered to pay in damages to Herm s by a New York court after a jury sided with the copyright holder for his digital depictions of the brand s Birkin handbag br Some NFT marketplaces responded to cases of plagiarism by creating takedown teams to respond to artist complaints The NFT marketplace OpenSea has rules against plagiarism and deepfakes non consensual intimate imagery Some artists criticized OpenSea s efforts saying they are slow to respond to takedown requests and that artists are subject to support scams from users who claim to be representatives of the platform Others argue that there is no market incentive for NFT marketplaces to crack down on plagiarism br br A process known as sleepminting allows a fraudster to mint an NFT in an artist s wallet and transfer it back to their own account without the artist becoming aware This allowed a white hat hacker to mint a fraudulent NFT that had seemingly originated from the wallet of the artist Beeple br Plagiarism concerns led the art website DeviantArt to create an algorithm that compares user art posted on the DeviantArt website against art on popular NFT marketplaces If the algorithm identifies art that is similar it notifies and instructs the author how they can contact NFT marketplaces to request that they take down their plagiarized work br The BBC reported a case of insider trading when an employee of the NFT marketplace OpenSea bought specific NFTs before they were launched with prior knowledge those NFTs would be promoted on the company s home page NFT trading is an unregulated market in which there is no legal recourse for such abuses br When Adobe announced they were adding NFT support to their graphics editor Photoshop the company proposed creating an InterPlanetary File System database as an alternative means of establishing authenticity for digital works br The price paid for specific NFTs and the sales volume of a particular NFT author may be artificially inflated by wash trading which is prevalent due to a lack of government regulation on NFTs br br br Security br In January it was reported that some NFTs were being exploited by sellers to unknowingly gather users IP addresses The exploit works via the off chain nature of NFT as the user s computer automatically follows a web address in the NFT to display the content The server at the address can then log the IP address and in some cases dynamically alter the returned content to show the result OpenSea has a particular vulnerability to this loophole because it allows HTML files to be linked br br br Pyramid Ponzi scheme claims br Critics compare the structure of the NFT market to a pyramid or Ponzi scheme in which early adopters profit at the expense of those buying in later In June Bill Gates stated his belief that NFTs are based on greater fool theory br br br Rug pull exit scams br A rug pull is a scam similar to an exit scam or a pump and dump scheme in which the developers of an NFT or other blockchain project hype the value of a project to pump up the price and then suddenly sell all their tokens to lock in massive profits or otherwise abandon the project while removing liquidity permanently destroying the value of the project br br br See also br Decentralized autonomous organization
