games via its online network It required a network adaptor which was available as an add on for original models and integrated into the hardware on slimline models However Sony provided no unified service for the system so support for network features was specific to each game and third party server and there was no interoperability of cross game presence Five years later during the development stage for its third home console the PlayStation Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a PlayStation World network In March Sony officially introduced its unified online service tentatively named PlayStation Network Platform A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year br Sony launched an optional premium subscription service on top of the free PSN service in June Known as PlayStation Plus the system provides access to exclusive content complementary games regular store discounts and early access to forthcoming games br Following a security intrusion the PlayStation Network had a temporary suspension of operation which began on April and affected million registered accounts Lasting days this outage was the longest amount of time the PSN had been offline since its inception in Sony reported that user data had been obtained during the intrusion In June Sony launched a Welcome Back program following the outage allowing all PSN subscribers who joined prior to April to download two free PlayStation titles and two free PlayStation Portable games Users also received free days of PlayStation Plus while users who were already subscribed before the outage got free days After the disruption Sony changed the PlayStation Network s license agreement to legally bar users from filing lawsuits and joining class action lawsuits without first trying to resolve issues with an arbitrator br In July Sony Computer Entertainment announced that they had acquired video game streaming service Gaikai for million The acquisition was later strengthened when Sony acquired the assets of Gaikai s market rival OnLive At the Consumer

devices During Sony rolled out the service in North America on PlayStation and PlayStation in beta form as a means for users to test performance and pricing structures br On December PlayStation Network and Xbox Live suffered a network disruption after a denial of service attack Both services were flooded with millions of inauthentic connection requests making it hard for genuine users to establish a connection Functionality was restored on December with some users experiencing difficulties in the days that followed On January Sony announced that users would be compensated for the downtime with a five day extension to PlayStation Plus memberships br Formerly the gaming provision of the much broader Sony Entertainment Network the PlayStation Network became Sony s premier

or reaching certain milestones such as completing a difficult level or defeating a certain number of enemies There are four different types of trophy awarded a bronze silver or gold trophy is contingent upon the difficulty of the accomplishment with each reward contributing to a level system attached to a player s profile A platinum trophy is awarded to the player once they unlock all other trophies in the base game smaller sized games however generally do not offer a platinum trophy In addition each trophy is graded by popularity common rare very rare and ultra rare based on the percentage of people who have unlocked it Developers can choose to make various trophies hidden so that their value and description are not revealed until after the user has obtained them br In an effort to discourage cheating in terms of how soon Trophies are awarded the PlayStation Network requires consoles to maintain an accurate time and date setting before a digitally downloaded game can be started which also extends to virtually all physically released software for the PS and certain physical games for the PS Without a connection to PlayStation Network consoles would rely on a CMOS battery to maintain the date and time If a console is unable to obtain an accurate date and time from PlayStation Network due to loss of connectivity and CMOS battery charge combined games can be rendered unplayable on it leading critics to decry this anti cheat system as a form of always on DRM and a threat to video game preservation upon discovery of this issue known as the C bomb several months after the PlayStation s launch as Sony was contemplating an equally controversial decision to shut down the PlayStation Store for previously discontinued systems that used it In late September Sony resolved the C bomb issue for the PS with firmware update so that an inability to obtain an accurate date and time from PSN would only disable time stamping of Trophies instead of blocking startup of games Sony later resolved the same issue for the PlayStation in November allowing all physical and digital PS and PS games to run without any need for an accurate date and time reading from PSN except for PlayStation Plus games which require online verification to access them br br br PlayStation Plus br br PlayStation Plus PS Plus is a paid tiered subscription service that provides
