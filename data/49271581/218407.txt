Sexual assault is an act in which one intentionally sexually touches another person without that person s consent or coerces or physically forces a person to engage in a sexual act against their will It is a form of sexual violence that includes child sexual abuse groping rape forced sexual penetration no matter how slight drug facilitated sexual assault and the torture of the person in a sexual manner br br br Definition br Generally sexual assault is defined as unwanted sexual contact The National Center for Victims of Crime states br br Sexual assault takes many forms including attacks such as rape or attempted rape as well as any unwanted sexual contact or threats Usually a sexual assault occurs when someone touches any part of another person s body in a sexual way even through clothes without that person s consent br In the United States the definition of sexual assault varies widely among the individual states However in most states sexual assault occurs when there is lack of consent from one of the individuals involved Consent must take place between two adults who are not incapacitated and consent may change by being withdrawn at any time during the sexual act Sexual assault can be defined as violation of consent according to standards of substantive equality or formal equality br br br Types br br br Child sexual abuse br br Child sexual abuse is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent abuses a child for sexual stimulation Forms of child sexual abuse include asking or pressuring a child to engage in sexual activities regardless of the outcome indecent exposure of the genitals to a child displaying pornography to a child actual sexual contact against a child physical contact with the child s genitals viewing of the child s genitalia without physical contact or using a child to produce child pornography including live streaming sexual abuse br The effects of child sexual abuse include depression post traumatic stress disorder anxiety propensity to re victimization in adulthood physical injury to the child and increased risk for future interpersonal violence perpetration among males among other problems Sexual assault among teenagers has been shown to lead to worse school performance an increase in mental health problems and social exclusion Sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest It is more common than other forms of sexual assault on a child and can result in more serious and long term psychological trauma especially in the case of parental incest br Approximately to percent of women and to percent of men were sexually abused when they were children Most sexual abuse offenders are acquainted with their victims Approximately percent of the perpetrators are relatives of the child most often brothers sisters fathers mothers uncles aunts or cousins Around percent are other acquaintances such as friends of the family babysitters or neighbors Strangers are the offenders in approximately percent of child sexual abuse cases br Studies have shown that the psychological damage is particularly severe when sexual assault is committed by parents against children due to the incestuous nature of the assault Incest between a child and a related adult has been identified as the most widespread form of child sexual abuse with a huge capacity for damage to a child Often sexual assault on a child is not reported by the child for several of the following reasons br br children are too young to recognize their victimization or put it into words br they were threatened or bribed by the abuser br they feel confused by fearing the abuser br they are afraid no one will believe them br they blame themselves or believe the abuse is a punishment br they feel guilty for consequences to the perpetrator br In addition many states have criminalized sexual contact between teachers or school administrators and students even if the student is over the age of consent br br br Domestic violence br br Domestic violence is violence or other abuse by one person against another in a domestic setting such as in marriage or cohabitation It is strongly correlated with sexual assault Not only can domestic abuse be emotional physical psychological and financial but it can be sexual Some of the signs of sexual abuse are similar to those of domestic violence br br br Elderly sexual assault br br About percent of people age or older who are sexually assaulted in the U S report it to the police Assailants may include strangers caretakers adult children spouses and fellow facility residents although perpetrators of elder sexual assault are less likely to be related to the victim than perpetrators of other types of elder abuse br br br Groping br br The term groping is used to define the touching or fondling of another person in a sexual way without the person s consent Groping may occur under or over clothing br br br Rape br br Outside of law the term rape sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person s consent is often used interchangeably with sexual assault Although closely related the two terms are technically distinct in most jurisdictions Sexual assault typically includes rape and other forms of non consensual sexual activity br Abbey et al state that female victims are much more likely to be assaulted by an acquaintance such as a friend or co worker a dating partner an ex boyfriend or a husband or other intimate partner than by a complete stranger In a study of hospital emergency room treatments for rape Kaufman et al stated that the male victims as a group sustained more physical trauma and were more likely to have been a victim of multiple assaults from multiple assailants It was also stated that male victims were more likely to have been held captive longer br In the U S rape is a crime committed primarily against youth A national telephone survey on violence against women conducted by the National Institute of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that of women surveyed had experienced a completed or attempted rape at some time in their lives Of these were younger than years and were between and years old when they were first raped br In the U K attempted rape under the Criminal Attempts Act is a sexual offence within section of the Criminal Justice Act br The removal of a condom during intercourse without the consent of the sex partner known as stealthing may be treated as a sexual assault or rape in some jurisdictions br br br Sexual harassment br br Sexual harassment is intimidation bullying or coercion of a sexual nature It may also be defined as the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors The legal and social definition of what constitutes sexual harassment differ widely by culture Sexual harassment includes a wide range of behaviors from seemingly mild transgressions to serious forms of abuse Some forms of sexual harassment overlap with sexual assault br In the United States sexual harassment is a form of discrimination which violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC Unwelcome sexual advances requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual s employment unreasonably interferes with an individual s work performance or creates an intimidating hostile or offensive work environment br In the United States br br of victims are women are men br are harassed by a supervisor br Business Trade Banking and Finance are the biggest industries where sexual harassment occurs br received threats of termination if they did not comply with their requests br people in the armed forces were assaulted in br of the cases pursued by victims were prosecuted br of the cases were committed by someone of a higher rank br Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of br Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of is a federal law that prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex race color national origin and religion It generally applies to employers with or more employees including federal state and local governments Title VII also applies to private and public colleges and universities employment agencies and labor organizations br It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation terms conditions or privileges of employment because of such individual s race color religion sex or national origin br br br Mass sexual assault br br Mass sexual assault takes place in public places and in crowds It involves large group of people surrounding and assaulting the other gender and engaging in conduct such as groping manual penetration and frottage but usually stopping short of penile rape br br br Emotional and psychological effects br Aside from physical traumas rape and other sexual assault often result in long term emotional effects particularly in child victims These can include but are not limited to denial learned helplessness genophobia anger self blame anxiety shame nightmares fear depression flashbacks guilt rationalization moodswings numbness hypersexuality loneliness social anxiety difficulty trusting oneself or others and difficulty concentrating br Sexual assault increases an individual s risk to developing psychopathology It is most strongly related to the development of suicidality and trauma related disorders including post traumatic stress disorder as well as the development of bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders Experiencing sexual assault also increases the risk of developing anxiety disorders major depressive disorder eating disorders addiction or other psychopathologies Individuals who develop psychological disorders following sexual assault have increased frequency and severity of psychopathology compared with individuals who have not experienced sexual assault br Family and friends of individuals who have been sexually assaulted experience emotional scarring including a strong desire for revenge a desire to fix the problem and or move on and a rationalization that it wasn t that bad br br br Physical effects br While sexual assault including rape can result in physical trauma many people who experience sexual assault will not suffer any physical injury Rape myths suggest that the stereotypical victim of sexual violence is a bruised and battered young woman The central issue in many cases of rape or other sexual assault is whether or not both parties consented to the sexual activity or whether or not both parties had the capacity to do so Thus physical force resulting in visible physical injury is not always seen This stereotype can be damaging because people who have experienced sexual assault but have no physical trauma may be less inclined to report to the authorities or to seek health care However women who experienced rape or physical violence by a partner were more likely than people who had not experienced this violence to report frequent headaches chronic pain difficulty sleeping activity limitation poor physical health and poor mental health br br br Economic effects br Due to rape or sexual assault or the threat of there are many resulting impacts on income and commerce at the macro level Excluding child abuse each rape or sexual assault costs in tangible losses lost productivity medical and mental health care police fire services and property damage and in lost quality of life This issue has been addressed in the Supreme Court In his dissenting opinion of the U S Supreme Court case U S v Morrison Justice Souter explained that of women never go to the movies alone at night and nearly will not ride public transportation out of fear of rape or sexual assault It also stated that less than of victims collect damages and of women lose their jobs or quit after the trauma The court ruled in U S v Morrison that Congress did not have the authority to enact part of the Violence Against Women Act because it did not have a direct impact on commerce The Commerce Clause of Article I Section VII of the U S Constitution gives authority and jurisdiction to the Federal government in matters of interstate commerce As a result the victim was unable to sue her attacker in Federal Court br Sexual assault also has adverse economic effects for survivors on the micro level For instance survivors of sexual assault often require time off from work and face increased rates of unemployment Survivors of rape by an intimate partner lose an average of per day due to unpaid time off from work Sexual assault is also associated with numerous negative employment consequences including unpaid time off diminished work performance job loss and inability to work all of which can lead to lower earnings for survivors br The ability to test backlogged sexual assault kits and have the results uploaded into CODIS is cost effective in terms of reducing the costs associated with sexual assaults by spending the money on testing evidence br br br Treatment of victims br In the emergency room emergency contraceptive medications are offered to women raped by men because about of such rapes result in pregnancy Preventative medication against sexually transmitted infections are given to victims of all types of sexual assault especially for the most common diseases like chlamydia gonorrhea trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis and a blood serum is collected to test for STIs such as HIV hepatitis B and syphilis Any survivor with abrasions are immunized for tetanus if five years have elapsed since the last immunization Short term treatment with a benzodiazepine may help with acute anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of PTSD depression and panic attacks Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing EMDR has also been proposed as a psychiatric treatment for victims of sexual assault With regard to long term psychological treatment prolonged exposure therapy has been tested as a method of long term PTSD treatment for victims of sexual abuse br br br Mistreatment of victims br br After the assault victims may become the target of slut shaming to cyberbullying In addition their credibility may be challenged During criminal proceedings publication bans and rape shield laws may operate to protect victims from excessive public scrutiny Negative social responses to victims disclosures of sexual assault have the potential to lead to post traumatic stress disorder symptoms Social isolation following a sexual assault can result in the victim experiencing a decrease in their self esteem and likelihood of rejecting unwanted sexual advances in the future Victims have already been through a traumatic assault and it can be exacerbated the unwillingness of law enforcement to move their case along in the forensic testing process because law enforcement officials develop preconceived notions about the victims willingness to participate in the investigation br br br Prevention br br Sexual harassment and assault may be prevented by secondary school college workplace and public education programs At least one program for fraternity men produced sustained behavioral change At least one study showed that creative campaigns with attention grabbing slogans and images that market consent are effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues br Several research based rape prevention programs have been tested and verified through scientific studies The rape prevention programs that have the strongest empirical data in the research literature include the following br The Men s and Women s Programs also known as the One in Four programs were written by John Foubert and is focused on increasing empathy toward rape survivors and motivating people to intervene as bystanders in sexual assault situations Published data shows that high risk persons who saw the Men s and Women s Program committed fewer acts of sexually coercive behavior than those who did not They also committed acts of sexual coercion that were eight times less severe than a control group Further research also shows that people who saw the Men s and Women s Program reported more efficacy in intervening and greater willingness to help as a bystander after seeing the program Several additional studies are available documenting its efficacy br Bringing in the Bystander was written by Victoria Banyard Its focus is on who bystanders are when they have helped and how to intervene as a bystander in risky situations The program includes a brief empathy induction component and a pledge to intervene in the future Several studies show strong evidence of favorable outcomes including increased bystander efficacy increased willingness to intervene as a bystander and decreased rape myth acceptance br The MVP Mentors in Violence Prevention was written by Jackson Katz This program focuses on discussing a male bystander who did not intervene when a woman was in danger An emphasis is placed on encouraging men to be active bystanders rather than standing by when they notice abuse The bulk of the presentation is on processing hypothetical scenarios Outcomes reported in research literature include lower levels of sexism and increased belief that participants could prevent violence against women br The Green Dot program was written by Dorothy Edwards This program includes both motivational speeches and peer education focused on bystander intervention Outcomes show that program participation is associated with reductions in rape myth acceptance and increased bystander intervention br The city of Edmonton Canada initiated a public education campaign aimed at potential perpetrators Posters in bar bathrooms and public transit centers reminded men that It s not sex when she s wasted and It s not sex when he changes his mind The campaign was so effective that it spread to other cities The number of reported sexual assaults fell by per cent last year in Vancouver after the ads were featured around the city It was the first time in several years that there was a drop in sexual assault activity br President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden introduced in September a nationwide campaign against sexual assault entitled It s on us The campaign includes tips against sexual assault as well as broad scale of private and public pledges to change to provoke a cultural shift with a focus on student activism to achieve awareness and prevention nationwide UC Berkeley NCAA and Viacom have publicly announced their partnership br Additionally CODIS checks whether the qualifying offense sample DNA taken from an offender for committing a crime was also a sexual assault If a person committed sexual offenses in the past this system would reveal a pattern of serial sexual offending Using CODIS to compare backlogged rape kit tests can lead to prevention of future sexual assaults br br br Prevalence br br A United Nations report compiled from government sources showed that more than cases of rape or attempted rape were recorded by police annually The reported data covered countries br br br United States br br The U S Department of Justice s National Crime Victimization Survey states that on average there are victims age or older of sexual assault and rape each year According to RAINN every seconds someone in America is sexually assaulted Sexual assault in the United States military also is a salient issue Some researchers assert that the unique professional and socially contained context of military service can heighten the destructive nature of sexual assault and therefore improved support is needed for these victims br The victims of sexual assault br Age br br are under the age of br are age br are under age br are under age br are the highest risk years br By gender br A study from finds that br br of women have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime br An estimated of men have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime br Over million women have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime br Almost million men have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime br An estimated million men have been forced to penetrate during their lifetime having done so before the age of br The National Crime Victimization Survey conducted by the U S Justice Department Bureau of Justice Statistics found that from to men represented of victims of sexual assault and rape on college campuses and of non campus sexual assaults and rapes br LGBT br LGBT identifying individuals with the exception of lesbian women are more likely to experience sexual assault on college campuses than heterosexual individuals br br in lesbian women and nearly of bisexual women and men experience sexual assault in their lifetime br Nearly in gay men experience sexual violence in their lifetime br of transgender people have experienced sexual assault in their lifetime br Effects br br times more likely to suffer from depression br times more likely to suffer from post traumatic stress disorder br times more likely to abuse alcohol br times more likely to abuse drugs br times more likely to contemplate suicide br The reporting of sexual assault br br on average of sexual assaults go unreported br of rapists will not spend time in jail br The assailants br According to the U S Department of Justice Sex Offenses and Offenders Study br br A rapist s age on average is years old br of offenders are white br of rapists imprisoned report that they are married br Juveniles accounted for of forcible rape arrestees in and of those arrested for other sex offenses br In br br of rapes involved the use of a weapon br used a gun br used a knife br used another form of weapon br of victims reported the use of physical force only br According to the U S Department of Justice National Crime Victimization Study br br About of rapes were committed by someone known to the victim br of sexual assaults were perpetrated by a non stranger br of rapists are a friend or acquaintance br are an intimate partner br are a relative br College br br In the United States several studies since have indicated that one in four college women have experienced rape or attempted rape at some point in their lifetime These studies are based on anonymous surveys of college women not reports to the police and the results are disputed br In Texas A M University professor Jason Lindo and his colleagues analyzed over two decades worth of FBI data noting that reports of rape increased around the times of major American Football games at Division schools while attempting to find a link between campus rape and alcohol br A report from the U S Department of Justice titled The Sexual Victimization of College Women reports that of undergraduates survived rape or attempted rape during a month academic year with an additional surviving rape prior to college and an additional surviving attempted rape prior to college With no overlap between these groups these percentages add to or One in Four br Koss Gidycz Wisniewski published a study in where they interviewed approximately college students on college campuses nationwide They asked several questions covering a wide range of behaviors From this study of college women answered yes to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of rape An additional of women answered yes to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of attempted rape thus the statistic One in Four br A point of contention lies in the leading nature of the questions in the study conducted by Koss Gidycz Wisniewski Koss herself later admitted that the question that had garnered the largest rape result was flawed and ultimately rendered the study invalid Most prominently the problem was that many respondents who had answered yes to several questions had their responses treated as having been raped The issue being that these same respondents did not feel they had been victimized and never sought redress for grievances The resultant change shows a prevalence of only in college women having been raped or attempted to be raped during their time at college br In the CDC replicated part of this study however they examined rape only and did not look at attempted rape They used a two stage cluster sample design to produce a nationally representative sample of undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to years The first stage sampling frame contained primary sampling units PSUs consisting of and year colleges and universities The second sampling stage consisted of a random sample drawn from the primary sample unit frame enrolled in the participating colleges and universities to increase the sample size to undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to years old with a representative sample demographic matching the national demographic Differential sampling rates of the PSU were used to ensure sufficient numbers of male and female black and Hispanic students in the total sample population After differential sample weighting female students represented of the sample white students represented of the sample black students Hispanic students and were other It was determined that nationwide of college students reported that they had been forced to have sexual intercourse against their will during their lifetime Female students were significantly more likely than male students to report they had ever been forced to have sexual intercourse of approximately females of samples and of males reported experiencing rape thus far in the course of their lifetime br Other studies concerning the annual incidence of rape some studies conclude an occurrence of The National Survey of Children s Exposure to Violence found that in the academic year of girls ages experienced sexual assault or sexual abuse In another study Mohler Kuo Dowdall Koss Weschler found in a study of approximately college women nationwide that experienced rape or attempted rape during a single academic year This study did not measure lifetime incidence of rape or attempted rape Similarly Kilpatrick Resnick Ruggiero Conoscenti McCauley found in a study of college women nationwide that experienced rape every year br On campuses it has been found that alcohol is a prevalent issue in regards to sexual assault It has been estimated that in women experience an assault and of those women have had either the attacker the woman or both consume alcohol prior to the assault Not only has it been a factor in the rates of sexual assault on campus but because of the prevalence assaults are also being affected specifically by the inability to give consent when intoxicated and bystanders not knowing when to intervene due to their own intoxication or the intoxication of the victim br Children br Other research has found that about American children are sexually abused each year br br br By jurisdiction br br br Australia br Within Australia the term sexual assault is used to describe a variation of sexual offences This is due to a variety of definitions and use of terminology to describe sexual offences within territories and states as each territory and state have their own legislation to define rape attempted rape sexual assault aggravated sexual assault sexual penetration or intercourse without consent and sexual violence br In the State of New South Wales sexual assault is a statutory offence punishable under s I of the Crimes Act The term sexual assault is equivalent to rape in ordinary parlance while all other assaults of a sexual nature are termed indecent assault br To be liable for punishment under the Crimes Act an offender must intend to commit an act of sexual intercourse as defined under s H while having one of the states of knowledge of non consent defined under s HA But s HA is an objective standard which only require the person has no reasonable grounds for believing the other person is consenting The maximum penalty for sexual assault is years imprisonment br Aggravated sexual assault is sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation The maximum penalty is imprisonment for years under s J of the Crimes Act br In the state of Victoria rape is punishable under s of the Crimes Act with a maximum penalty of years imprisonment br In the state of South Australia rape is punishable under s of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act SA with a maximum term of life imprisonment br In the state of Western Australia sexual penetration is punishable under s the Criminal Code Act with a maximum sentence of years imprisonment br In the Northern Territory offences of sexual intercourse and gross indecency without consent are punishable under s of the Criminal Code Act and punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment br In Queensland rape and sexual assault are punishable under s Chapter of the Criminal Code Act with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment br In Tasmania rape is punishable under s of the Criminal Code Act with a maximum punishment of years under s of the Criminal Code Act br In the Australian Capital Territory sexual assault is punishable under Part of the Crimes Act with a maximum punishment of years br Sexual assault is considered a gendered crime which results in of sexual assaults never coming to the attention of the criminal justice system according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics This is due to low reporting rates treatment of victims and distrust of the criminal justice system difficulty in obtaining evidence and the belief in sexual assault myths br However once a person is charged the public prosecutor will decide whether the case will proceed to trial based on whether there is sufficient evidence and whether a case is in the public interest Once the matter has reached trial the matter will generally be heard in the District Court This is because sexually violent crimes are mostly categorised as indictable offences serious offences as opposed to summary offences minor offences Sexual offences can also be heard in the Supreme Court but more generally if the matter is being heard as an appeal br Once the matter is being heard the prosecution must provide evidence which proves beyond reasonable doubt that the offence was committed by the defendant The standard of proof is vital in checking the power of the State While as previously stated that each jurisdiction State and Territory has its own sexual offence legislation there are many common elements to any criminal offence that advise on how the offence is defined and what must be proven by the prosecution in order to find the defendant guilty These elements are known as Actus Reus which comprises the physical element see Ryan v Regina and the Mens Rea which comprises the mental element see He Kaw Teh br Notable sexual assault cases which have resulted in convictions are Regina v Bilal Skaf and Regina v Mohommed Skaf which were highly visible in New South Wales within the media the s These cases were closely watched by the media and led to legislative changes such as the passing of the Crimes Amendment Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company Act No which dramatically increased the sentences for gang rapists by creating a new category of crime known as Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company Changes were also made to the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act This change is known as the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Amendment Victim Impact Statements Act No which expands the category of offences in respect of which a Local Court may receive and consider Victim Impact Statements to include some indictable offences which are usually dealt with summarily br br br Canada br Sexual assault is defined as sexual contact with

consensual but other circumstances not described in this section can also deem the act as having been committed without consent No consent to sexual assault is also subject to Section which also outlines several situations where the act is deemed non consensual In the Supreme Court of Canada in R v J A interpreted the provisions below to find that a person must have an active mind during the sexual activity in order to consent and that they cannot give consent in advance br br Meaning of consent br Subject to subsection and subsection consent means for the purposes of sections and the

determination of the honesty of the accused s belief to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief furthermore according to section b the accused must show that he or she

term sexual assault is generally used to describe non penetrative sexual offences Section of the Criminal Law Rape Act of states that a man has committed rape if he has sexual intercourse with a woman

assault when a person forces another person to masturbate or commit various other sexual acts on theirself br br br Spain br br In August Spain passed a revolutionary only yes means yes sexual consent law which expanded the legal definition of sexual assault in Spain to being also sexual related conduct without consent and now required that consent must be affirmative and cannot be assumed to have been given by default or silence It also increased the nation s maximum rape sentence to years in tandem with year sentences that were handed to perpetrators in the nation s wolf pack gang rape case However it did receive some criticism for the way it enacted sentencing reductions for some offenders The law went into effect in October It was later amended in April to close loopholes which
