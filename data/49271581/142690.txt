title: Disinformation
id: 142690
Disinformation is false information deliberately spread to deceive people Disinformation is an orchestrated adversarial activity in which actors employ strategic deceptions and media manipulation tactics to advance political military or commercial goals Disinformation is implemented through attacks that weaponize multiple rhetorical strategies and forms of knowing including not only falsehoods but also truths half truths and value judgements to exploit and amplify culture wars and other identity driven controversies br In contrast misinformation refers to inaccuracies that stem from inadvertent error Misinformation can be used to create disinformation when known misinformation is purposefully and intentionally disseminated Fake news has sometimes been categorized as a type of disinformation but scholars have advised not using these two terms interchangeably or using fake news altogether in academic writing since politicians have weaponized it to describe any unfavorable news coverage or information br br br Etymology br br The English word disinformation comes from the application of the Latin prefix dis to information making the meaning reversal or removal of information The rarely used word had appeared with this usage in print at least as far back as br Some consider it a loan translation of the Russian transliterated as dezinformatsiya apparently derived from the title of a KGB black propaganda department Soviet planners in the s defined disinformation as dissemination in br the press on the radio etc of false reports intended to mislead public opinion br Disinformation first made an appearance in dictionaries in specifically Webster s New College Dictionary and the American Heritage Dictionary In the term disinformation was not defined in Webster s New World Thesaurus or New Encyclop dia Britannica After the Soviet term became widely known in the s native speakers of English broadened the term as any government communication either overt or covert containing intentionally false and misleading material often combined selectively with true information which seeks to mislead and manipulate either elites or a mass audience br By use of the term disinformation had fully established itself in the English language within the lexicon of politics By the term disinformation had come to be known as simply a more civil phrase for saying someone was lying Stanley B Cunningham wrote in his book The Idea of Propaganda that disinformation had become pervasively used as a synonym for propaganda br br br Operationalization br The Shorenstein Center at Harvard University defines disinformation research as an academic field that studies the spread and impacts of misinformation disinformation and media manipulation including how it spreads through online and offline channels and why people are susceptible to believing bad information and successful strategies for mitigating its impact According to a research article published in New Media Society disinformation circulates on social media through deception campaigns implemented in multiple ways including astroturfing conspiracy theories clickbait culture wars echo chambers hoaxes fake news propaganda pseudoscience and rumors br In order to distinguish between similar terms including misinformation and malinformation scholars collectively agree on the definitions for each term as follows disinformation is the strategic dissemination of false information with the intention to cause public harm misinformation represents the unintentional spread of false information and malinformation is factual information disseminated with the intention to cause harm these terms are abbreviated DMMI br In Camille Fran ois devised the ABC framework of understanding different modalities of online disinformation br br Manipulative Actors who engage knowingly and with clear intent in viral deception campaigns that are covert designed to obfuscate the identity and intent of the actor orchestrating them Examples include personas such as Guccifer Internet trolls state media and military operatives br Deceptive Behavior which encompasses the variety of techniques viral deception actors may use to enhance and exaggerate the reach virality and impact of their campaigns Examples include troll farms Internet bots astroturfing and paid engagement br Harmful Content which includes health misinformation manipulated media such as deepfakes online harassment violent extremism hate speech or terrorism br In the Brookings Institution proposed amending this framework to include Distribution defined by the technical protocols that enable constrain and shape user behavior in a virtual space Similarly the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace proposed adding Degree distribution of the content and the audiences it reaches and Effect how much of a threat a given case poses br br br Comparisons with propaganda br Whether and to what degree disinformation and propaganda overlap is subject to debate Some like U S Department of State define propaganda as the use of non rational arguments to either advance or undermine a political ideal and use disinformation as an alternative name for undermining propaganda While others consider them to be separate concepts altogether One popular distinction holds that disinformation also describes politically motivated messaging designed explicitly to engender public cynicism uncertainty apathy distrust and paranoia all of which disincentivize citizen engagement and mobilization for social or political change br br br Practice br Disinformation is the label often given to foreign information manipulation and interference FIMI Studies on disinformation are often concerned with the content of activity whereas the broader concept of FIMI is more concerned with the behaviour of an actor that is described through the military doctrine concept of tactics techniques and procedures TTPs br Disinformation is primarily carried out by government intelligence agencies but has also been used by non governmental organizations and businesses Front groups are a form of disinformation as they mislead the public about their true objectives and who their controllers are Most recently disinformation has been deliberately spread through social media in the form of fake news disinformation masked as legitimate news articles and meant to mislead readers or viewers Disinformation may include distribution of forged documents manuscripts and photographs or spreading dangerous rumours and fabricated intelligence Use of these tactics can lead to blowback however causing such unintended consequences such as defamation lawsuits or damage to the dis informer s reputation br br br Worldwide br br br Soviet disinformation br br br Russian disinformation br br br Chinese disinformation br br br American disinformation br br The United States Intelligence Community appropriated use of the term disinformation in the s from the Russian dezinformatsiya and began to use similar strategies during the Cold War and in conflict with other nations The New York Times reported in that during the CIA s effort to substitute Mohammed Reza Pahlavi for then Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mossadegh the CIA placed fictitious stories in the local newspaper Reuters documented how subsequent to the Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet Afghan War the CIA put false articles in newspapers of Islamic majority countries inaccurately stating that Soviet embassies had invasion day celebrations Reuters noted a former U S intelligence officer said they would attempt to gain the confidence of reporters and use them as secret agents to affect a nation s politics by way of their local media br In October the term gained increased currency in the U S when it was revealed that two months previously the Reagan Administration had engaged in a disinformation campaign against then leader of Libya Muammar Gaddafi White House representative Larry Speakes said reports of a planned attack on Libya as first broken by The Wall Street Journal on August were authoritative and other newspapers including The Washington Post then wrote articles saying this was factual U S State Department representative Bernard Kalb resigned from his position in protest over the disinformation campaign and said Faith in the word of America is the pulse beat of our democracy br The executive branch of the Reagan administration kept watch on disinformation campaigns through three yearly publications by the Department of State Active Measures A Report on the Substance and Process of Anti U S Disinformation and Propaganda Campaigns Report on Active Measures and Propaganda and Report on Active Measures and Propaganda br According to a report by Reuters the United States ran a propaganda campaign to spread disinformation about the Sinovac Chinese COVID vaccine including using fake social media accounts to spread the disinformation that the Sinovac vaccine contained pork derived ingredients and was therefore haram under Islamic law Reuters said the ChinaAngVirus disinformation campaign was designed to counter what it perceived as China s growing influence in the Philippines and was prompted by the fear that China s COVID diplomacy and propaganda could draw other Southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia and Malaysia closer to Beijing The campaign was also described as payback for Beijing s efforts to blame Washington for the pandemic The campaign primarily targeted people in the Philippines and used a social media hashtag for China is the virus in Tagalog The campaign ran from to mid The primary contractor for the U S military on the project was General Dynamics IT which received million for its role br br br Response br br br Responses from cultural leaders br Pope Francis condemned disinformation in a interview after being made the subject of a fake news website during the U S election cycle which falsely claimed that he supported Donald Trump He said the worst thing the news media could do was spread disinformation He said the act was a sin comparing those who spread disinformation to individuals who engage in coprophilia br br br Ethics in warfare br In a contribution to the book Military Ethics and Emerging Technologies writers David Danks and Joseph H Danks discuss the ethical implications in using disinformation as a tactic during information warfare They note there has been a significant degree of philosophical debate over the issue as related to the ethics of war and use of the technique The writers describe a position whereby the use of disinformation is occasionally allowed but not in all situations Typically the ethical test to consider is whether the disinformation was performed out of a motivation of good faith and acceptable according to the rules of war By this test the tactic during World War II of putting fake inflatable tanks in visible locations on the Pacific Islands in order to falsely present the impression that there were larger military forces present could be considered as ethically permissible Conversely disguising a munitions plant as a healthcare facility in order to avoid attack would be a war crime outside the bounds of acceptable use of disinformation during war br Use of disinformation is inherently dishonest as it intends to deceive and therefore it is always ethically questionable to some degree even when used with the best of intentions When discovered disinformation undermines trust and thereby jeopardises the ability of parties to generate a lasting and just peace upon cessation of hostilities Use of disinformation is a Machiavellian act of duplicity usually based on the premise that the ends justify the means However ethically such acts distort the truth or are outright falsehoods and are therefore wrong They also irresponsibly expose people to the risk of unintended consequences based on false information in addition to the intended harms or deceptions that can be caused to the targets of disinformation br Harms can also accrue to those that deploy disinformation such as intelligence agencies organised crime military commands paramilitary bodies and covert operations personnel including moral injury such as a bad conscience loss of the moral high ground potential falsification of their own history resulting in dangerous delusions and ignorance and the generation of long lasting ill will and recriminations against the disseminator by the target groups Crucially there is the serious risk of blowback that can harm the disseminators upon discovery in the form of terrorism mistrust or punitive sanctions such as exclusion from international bodies Other risks and harms include the erosion of public life respect for the truth and mutual trust in society Legal accountability for war crimes and provocations is essential under international law br br br Research br br Research related to disinformation studies is increasing as an applied area of inquiry The call to formally classify disinformation as a cybersecurity threat is made by advocates due to its increase in social networking sites Researchers working for the University of Oxford found that over a three year period the number of governments engaging in online disinformation rose from in to in and in Despite the proliferation of social media websites Facebook and Twitter showed the most activity in terms of active disinformation campaigns Techniques reported on included the use of bots to amplify hate speech the illegal harvesting of data and paid trolls to harass and threaten journalists br Whereas disinformation research focuses primarily on how actors orchestrate deceptions on social media primarily via fake news new research investigates how people take what started as deceptions and circulate them as their personal views As a result research shows that disinformation can be conceptualized as a program that encourages engagement in oppositional fantasies i e culture wars through which disinformation circulates as rhetorical ammunition for never ending arguments As disinformation entangles with culture wars identity driven controversies constitute a vehicle through which disinformation disseminates on social media This means that disinformation thrives not despite raucous grudges but because of them The reason is that controversies provide fertile ground for never ending debates that solidify points of view br Scholars have pointed out that disinformation is not only a foreign threat as domestic purveyors of disinformation are also leveraging traditional media outlets such as newspapers radio stations and television news media to disseminate false information Current research suggests right wing online political activists in the United States may be more likely to use disinformation as a strategy and tactic Governments have responded with a wide range of policies to address concerns about the potential threats that disinformation poses to democracy however there is little agreement in elite policy discourse or academic literature as to what it means for disinformation to threaten democracy and how different policies might help to counter its negative implications br br br Consequences of exposure to disinformation online br There is a broad consensus amongst scholars that there is a high degree of disinformation misinformation and propaganda online however it is unclear to what extent such disinformation has on political attitudes in the public and therefore political outcomes This conventional wisdom has come mostly from investigative journalists with a particular rise during the U S election some of the earliest work came from Craig Silverman at Buzzfeed News Cass Sunstein supported this in Republic arguing that the internet would become rife with echo chambers and informational cascades of misinformation leading to a highly polarized and ill informed society br Research after the election found for percent of Americans social media was their most important source of election news known false news stories favoring Trump were shared a total of million times on Facebook while those favoring Clinton were shared million times the average American adult saw fake news stories with just over half of those who recalled seeing them believing them and people are more likely to believe stories that favor their preferred candidate especially if they have ideologically segregated social media networks Correspondingly whilst there is wide agreement that the digital spread and uptake of disinformation during the election was massive and very likely facilitated by foreign agents there is an ongoing debate on whether all this had any actual effect on the election For example a double blind randomized control experiment by researchers from the London School of Economics LSE found that exposure to online fake news about either Trump or Clinton had no significant effect on intentions to vote for those candidates Researchers who examined the influence of Russian disinformation on Twitter during the US presidential campaign found that exposure to disinformation was concentrated among a tiny group of users primarily among Republicans and eclipsed by exposure to legitimate political news media and politicians Finally they find no evidence of a meaningful relationship between exposure to the Russian foreign influence campaign and changes in attitudes polarization or voting behavior As such despite its mass dissemination during the Presidential Elections online fake news or disinformation probably did not cost Hillary Clinton the votes needed to secure the presidency br Research on this topic is continuing and some evidence is less clear For example internet access and time spent on social media does not appear correlated with polarisation Further misinformation appears not to significantly change political knowledge of those exposed to it There seems to be a higher level of diversity of news sources that users are exposed to on Facebook and Twitter than conventional wisdom would dictate as well as a higher frequency of cross spectrum discussion Other evidence has found that disinformation campaigns rarely succeed in altering the foreign policies of the targeted states br Research is also challenging because disinformation is meant to be difficult to detect and some social media companies have discouraged outside research efforts For example researchers found disinformation made existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ineffective or not applicable because disinformation is intentionally written to mislead readers and users social engagements with fake news produce data that is big incomplete unstructured and noisy Facebook the largest social media company has been criticized by analytical journalists and scholars for preventing outside research of disinformation br br br Alternative perspectives and critiques br Researchers have criticized the framing of disinformation as being limited to technology platforms removed from its wider political context and inaccurately implying that the media landscape was otherwise well functioning The field possesses a simplistic understanding of the effects of media technologies overemphasizes platforms and underemphasizes politics focuses too much on the United States and Anglocentric analysis has a shallow understanding of political culture and culture in general lacks analysis of race class gender and sexuality as well as status inequality social structure and power has a thin understanding of journalistic processes and has progressed more through the exigencies of grant funding than the development of theory and empirical findings br Alternative perspectives have been proposed br br Moving beyond fact checking and media literacy to study a pervasive phenomenon as something that involves more than news consumption br Moving beyond technical solutions including AI enhanced fact checking to understand the systemic basis of disinformation br Develop a theory that goes beyond Americentrism to develop a global perspective understand cultural imperialism and Third World dependency on Western news and understand disinformation in the Global South br Develop market oriented disinformation research that examines the financial incentives and business models that nudge content creators and digital platforms to circulate disinformation online br Include a multidisciplinary approach involving history political economy ethnic studies feminist studies and science and technology studies br Develop understandings of Gendered based disinformation GBD defined as the dissemination of false or misleading information attacking women especially political leaders journalists and public figures basing the attack on their identity as women br br br Strategies for spreading disinformation br br br Disinformation attack br br The research literature on how disinformation spreads is growing Studies show that disinformation spread in social media can be classified into two broad stages seeding and echoing Seeding when malicious actors strategically insert deceptions like fake news into a social media ecosystem and echoing is when the audience disseminates disinformation argumentatively as their own opinions often by incorporating disinformation into a confrontational fantasy br br br Internet manipulation br br Studies show four main methods of seeding disinformation online br br Selective censorship br Manipulation of search rankings br Hacking and releasing br Directly
