Electron formerly known as Atom Shell is a free and open source software framework developed and maintained by OpenJS Foundation The framework is designed to create desktop applications using web technologies mainly HTML CSS and JavaScript although other technologies such as front end frameworks and WebAssembly are possible that are rendered using a version of the Chromium browser engine and a back end using the Node js runtime environment It also uses various APIs to enable functionality such as native integration with Node js services and an inter process communication module br Electron was originally built for Atom and is the main GUI framework behind several other open source projects including GitHub Desktop Light Table Visual Studio Code WordPress Desktop and Eclipse Theia br br br Architecture br Electron applications include a main process and several renderer processes The main process runs the logic for the application e g menus shell commands lifecycle events and can then launch multiple renderer processes by instantiating an instance of the BrowserWindow class which loads a window that appears on the screen by rendering HTML and CSS br Both the main and renderer processes can run with Node js integration if the nodeIntegration field in the main process is set to true br Most of Electron s APIs are written in C or Objective C and are exposed directly to the application code through JavaScript bindings br br br History br In September Electron moved to an eight week release cycle between major versions to match the release cycle of Chromium Extended Stable and to comply with a new requirement from the Microsoft Store that requires browser based apps to be within two major versions of the latest release of the browser engine br Electron frequently releases new major versions along every other Chromium release The latest three stable versions are supported by the Electron team br br br Usage br br Desktop applications built with Electron include Atom balenaEtcher Eclipse Theia Microsoft Teams Slack and Visual Studio Code Brave Browser was based on Electron before it was rewritten to use Chromium directly br br br Reception br The most common criticism of Electron is that it necessitates software bloat when used for simple programs As a result Michael Larabel has referred to the framework as notorious among most Linux desktop users for being resource heavy not integrating well with most desktops and generally being despised Meanwhile Joey Sneddon states that this tradeoff is sensible as Electron greatly lowers the cost of developing and maintaining cross platform software br Researchers have shown that Electron s large feature set can be hijacked by bad actors with write access to the source JavaScript files This requires root access on nix systems and isn t considered to be a vulnerability by the Electron developers Those who are concerned that Electron is not always based on the newest version of Chromium have recommended progressive web applications as an alternative br br br See also br br br br br br External links br Official website
