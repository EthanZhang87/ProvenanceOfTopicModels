id: 66516682
In January a short squeeze of the stock of the American video game retailer GameStop and other securities took place causing major financial consequences for certain hedge funds and large losses for short sellers Approximately percent of GameStop s public float had been sold short and the rush to buy shares to cover those positions as the price rose caused it to rise even further The short squeeze was initially and primarily triggered by users of the subreddit r wallstreetbets an Internet forum on the social news website Reddit although a number of hedge funds also participated At its height on January the short squeeze caused the retailer s stock price to reach a pre market value of over US per share split adjusted nearly times the valuation at the beginning of the month The price of many other heavily shorted securities and cryptocurrencies also increased br On January some brokerages particularly app based brokerage services such as Robinhood halted the buying of GameStop and other securities citing the next day their inability to post sufficient collateral at clearing houses to execute their clients orders This decision attracted criticism and accusations of market manipulation from prominent politicians and businesspeople from across the political spectrum Dozens of class action lawsuits have been filed against Robinhood in U S courts and the U S House Committee on Financial Services held a congressional hearing on the incident br The unusually high price and volatility continued after the peak in late January On February the GameStop stock price doubled within a minute period and then averaged in the neighborhood of per share for another month On March the GameStop stock price fell percent to per share after earnings were released and the company announced plans for issuing a new secondary stock offering On March the stock recovered dramatically rising by percent br br br Background br br br Short selling and short squeezes br br Short selling is a finance practice in which an investor known as the short seller borrows shares and immediately sells them in the hope that they will be able to buy them back later covering at a lower price return the borrowed shares plus interest to the lender and profit off the difference The practice carries an unlimited risk of losses because there is no inherent limit to how high a stock s price can rise should the short seller be proven wrong in their belief that the stock price was going to fall This is in contrast with taking a long position simply owning the stock where the investor s loss is limited to the cost of their initial investment br Short sellers are exposed to a risk of short squeezing which occurs when the shorted stock jumps in value because for instance there is a sudden piece of favorable news Short sellers are then forced to buy back the stock they had initially sold in an effort to keep their losses from mounting The market demand they create by purchasing the stock to cover their short positions further raises the price of the shorted stock thus triggering more short sellers to cover their positions by buying the stock This can result in a cascade of stock purchases and an even bigger jump of the share price br br br GameStop br br GameStop an American chain of brick and mortar video game stores had struggled in the years leading up to the short squeeze due to competition from digital distribution services as well as the economic effects of the COVID pandemic which reduced the number of people who shopped in person As a result GameStop s stock price declined leading many institutional investors to believe it would continue falling thus short selling the stock On January approximately percent of GameStop s public float had been sold short meaning some shorted shares had been re lent and shorted again Analysts at Goldman Sachs later noted that short interest exceeding percent of a company s public float had only occurred times in the prior years br However in mid investor Michael Burry s Scion Asset Management acquired a percent stake in GameStop and wrote to the company s board of directors identifying overlooked value in the

community is known for discussion about meme stocks and high risk stock transactions Observers congregating around r wallstreetbets believed the company was being significantly undervalued and with
