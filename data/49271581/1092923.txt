br br br History br br br Early years br br Google began in January as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California The project initially involved an unofficial third founder Scott Hassan the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine but he left before Google was officially founded as a company Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in br While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites They called this algorithm PageRank it determined a website s relevance by the number of pages and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site Page told his ideas to Hassan who began writing the code to implement Page s ideas br Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine BackRub because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine published in H ctor Garc a Molina and Jeffrey Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project PageRank was influenced by a similar page ranking and site scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex developed by Robin Li in with Larry Page s PageRank patent including a citation to Li s earlier RankDex patent Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu br Eventually they changed the name to Google the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word googol a very large number written followed by zeros picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information br br Google was initially funded by an August investment of from Andy Bechtolsheim co founder of Sun Microsystems This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in Stanford and they knew he had startup experience having recently sold the company he co founded Granite Systems to Cisco for million David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co founder Andy Bechtolsheim The meeting was set for a m at the front porch of David s home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco where he now worked after the acquisition at a m Andy briefly tested a demo of the website liked what he saw and then went back to his car to grab the check David Cheriton later also joined in with a investment br Google received money from two other angel investors in Amazon com founder Jeff Bezos and entrepreneur Ram Shriram Page and Brin had first approached Shriram who was a venture capitalist for funding and counsel and Shriram invested in Google in February Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee at which Shriram was the president It was Shriram who told Bezos about Google Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google s founders and they met six months after Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area Google s initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos status as CEO of Amazon was enough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment br Between these initial investors friends and family Google raised around which is what allowed them to open up their original

if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer which had been made verbally during investment negotiations Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either as
