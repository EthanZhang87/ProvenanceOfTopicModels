division Time Warner Entertainment US West s stake eventually passed to acquired cable company MediaOne then to AT T Broadband in when that company acquired MediaOne then finally to Comcast in when that company bought the AT T Broadband division Comcast sold their stake in the company in relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable br On October Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System which was established by Ted Turner in Not only did this result in the company re entering the cable television industry as a national programmer but Warner Bros also regained the rights to their pre film library which by then had been owned by Turner the films are still technically held by Turner but Warner Bros is responsible for sales and distribution while Turner gained access to Warner Bros post library as well as other Warner Bros owned properties The Turner deal also brought two separate film companies New Line Cinema and Castle Rock Entertainment both of which were integrated into Warner Bros The Turner deal also gave Time Warner Entertainment access to Metro Goldwyn Mayer MGM s pre May library br Time Warner Entertainment completed its purchase of Six Flags Theme Parks in after buying half of the company in saving it from financial trouble The company was later sold to Oklahoma based theme park operator Premier Parks under certain terms and conditions on April br Dick Parsons already a director on the board since was hired as Time Warner Entertainment president in although the division operational heads continued to report directly to chairman and CEO Gerald Levin br In HBO and Cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers with companion channels supplementing the main networks In HBO became the world s first digitally transmitted television service In CNN introduced CNN com which later became a leading destination for global digital news both online and mobile In Warner Bros spearheaded the introduction of the DVD which gradually replaced VHS tapes as the standard format for home video in the late s and early to mid s In HBO became the first national cable television network to broadcast a high definition version of its channel br br br AOL Time Warner br br In January America Online AOL stated its intentions to purchase Time Warner Entertainment for billion Due to the larger market capitalization of AOL their shareholders would own of the new company while Time Warner Entertainment shareholders owned only so in actual practice AOL had merged with Time Warner Entertainment even though Time Warner Entertainment had far more assets and revenues Time Warner Entertainment had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution while AOL wanted to anchor its stock price with more tangible assets br The deal officially filed on February employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity The Federal Trade Commission FTC cleared the deal on December and gave final approval on January the company completed the merger later that day The deal was approved on the same day by the Federal Communications Commission FCC and had already been cleared by the European Commission EC on October br AOL Time Warner Inc as the company was then called was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides Gerald Levin who had served as chairman and CEO of Time Warner Entertainment was CEO of the new company AOL co founder Steve Case served as Executive Chairman of the board of directors Robert W Pittman president and COO of AOL and Dick Parsons president of Time Warner served as Co Chief Operating Officers and J Michael Kelly the CFO from AOL became the chief financial officer br According to AOL President and COO Bob Pittman the slow moving Time Warner Entertainment would now take off at Internet speed accelerated by AOL All you need to do is put a catalyst to Time Warner Entertainment and in a short period you can alter the growth rate The growth rate will be like an Internet company The vision for Time Warner Entertainment s future seemed clear and straightforward by tapping into AOL Time Warner Entertainment would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers AOL would use Time Warner Entertainment s high speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers Time Warner Entertainment s branded magazines books music and movies This would have created million subscription relationships br However the growth and profitability of the AOL division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers The value of the AOL division dropped significantly not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell and forced a goodwill write off causing AOL Time Warner to report a loss of billion in at the time the largest loss ever reported by a company The total value of AOL stock subsequently went from billion to about billion br An outburst by Vice Chairman Ted Turner at a board meeting prompted Steve Case to contact each of the directors and push for CEO Gerald Levin s ouster Although Case s coup attempt was rebuffed by Parsons and several other directors Levin became frustrated with being unable to regain the rhythm at the combined company and handed in his resignation in the fall of effective in May Although Co COO Bob Pittman was the strongest supporter of Levin and largely seen as the heir apparent Dick Parsons was instead chosen as CEO Time Warner Entertainment CFO J Michael Kelly was demoted to COO of the AOL division and replaced as CFO by Wayne Pace AOL Chairman and CEO Barry Schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new content creation division being replaced on an interim basis by Pittman who was already serving as the sole COO after Parsons promotion br Many of the expected synergies between AOL and other Time Warner Entertainment divisions never materialized as most Time Warner Entertainment divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger A new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of AOL Time Warner replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division caused resentment among Time Warner Entertainment division heads who blamed the AOL division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company AOL Time Warner COO Pittman who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives who also criticized Pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for AOL Time Warner that were never met Some of the attacks on Pittman were reported to come from the print media in the Time Inc division under Don Logan Furthermore CEO Parsons democratic style prevented Pittman from exercising authority over the old guard division heads who resisted Pittman s synergy initiatives br Pittman resigned as AOL Time Warner COO after July being reportedly burned out by the AOL special assignment and almost hospitalized unhappy about the criticism from Time Warner executives and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as Parsons was firmly entrenched as CEO Pittman s departure was seen as a great victory to Time Warner executives who wanted to undo the merger In a sign of AOL s diminishing importance to the media conglomerate Pittman s responsibilities were divided between two Time Warner Entertainment veterans Jeffrey Bewkes who was CEO of Home Box Office and Don Logan who had been CEO of Time Logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group overseeing America Online Time Time Warner Cable the AOL Time Warner Book Group and the Interactive Video unit relegating AOL to being just another division in the conglomerate Bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group comprising HBO Cinemax New Line Cinema The WB TNT Turner Networks Warner Bros and Warner Music Group Both Logan and Bewkes who had initially opposed the merger were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons Logan generally admired at Time Warner Entertainment and reviled by AOL for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker moved to purge AOL of Pittman allies br br br Time Warner br br AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case took on added prominence as the co head of a new strategy committee of the board making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the Internet However under pressure from institutional investor vice president Gordon Crawford who lined up dissenters Case stated in January that he would not stand for re election as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting

dissolve into Warner Bros br In Time Warner spun out its Time Warner Cable division it is now part of Charter Communications and later AOL as independent companies AOL was later purchased by Verizon

mica br In the wake of the U S presidency of Donald Trump Time Warner s ownership of CNN was considered a potential source of scrutiny for the deal as Trump had repeatedly criticized the network for how it covered his administration and stated during his campaign that he planned to block the acquisition because of the potential impact of the resulting consolidation Following his election however his transition team stated that the government planned to evaluate the deal without prejudice br On November reports of a meeting between AT T CEO Randall L Stephenson and Makan Delrahim assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice s Antitrust Division indicated that AT T had been recommended to divest DirecTV or Turner Broadcasting seek alternative antitrust remedies or abandon the acquisition Some news outlets reported that AT T had been ordered to specifically divest CNN but these claims were denied by both Stephenson and a government official the following day with the latter criticizing the reports as being an effort to politicize the deal Stephenson also disputed the relevance of CNN to the antitrust concerns surrounding the acquisition as AT T did not already own a

this suit was a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent On December the merger agreement deadline was extended to June under a vote of confidence br On June District Judge Richard J Leon ruled in favor of AT T thus allowing the acquisition to go ahead with no conditions or remedies Leon argued that the Department of Justice provided insufficient evidence that the

Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal with the D C Circuit to reverse the District Court s approval Although the Department of Justice reportedly contemplated requesting an injunction to stop the deal from closing after the District Court s ruling the department ultimately did not file the motion because WarnerMedia s operation as a separate group from the rest of AT T would make the business relatively easy to unwind should the appeal be successful The next day however AT T CEO Randall Stephenson told CNBC that the appeal would not affect its plans to integrate WarnerMedia into AT T or services already launched In a brief filed by the Justice Department it was argued that the decision to approve the acquisition ran contrary to fundamental economic logic and the evidence br On August AT T acquired the remaining controlling stake in Otter Media from the Chernin Group for an undisclosed amount The company operated as a division of WarnerMedia br On August Makan Delrahim told Recode that if the government were to win the appeal AT T would only sell Turner and if they lost the appeal then the February expiration of a consent decree AT T reached with the Justice
