A data center American English or data centre Commonwealth English is a building a dedicated space within a building or a group of buildings used to house computer systems and associated components such as telecommunications and storage systems br Since IT operations are crucial for business continuity it generally includes redundant or backup components and infrastructure for power supply data communication connections environmental controls e g air conditioning fire suppression and various security devices A large data center is an industrial scale operation using as much electricity as a small town Estimated global data center electricity consumption in was TWh or roughly of global electricity demand This excludes energy used for cryptocurrency mining which was estimated to be around TWh in or another of global electricity demand br Data centers can vary widely in terms of size power requirements redundancy and overall structure Four common categories used to segment types of data centers are onsite data centers colocation facilities hyperscale data centers and edge data centers br br br History br br Data centers have their roots in the huge computer rooms of the s typified by ENIAC one of the earliest examples of a data center Early computer systems complex to operate and maintain required a special environment in which to operate Many cables were necessary to connect all the components and methods to accommodate and organize these were devised such as standard racks to mount equipment raised floors and cable trays installed overhead or under the elevated floor A single mainframe required a great deal of power and had to be cooled to avoid overheating Security became important computers were expensive and were often used for military purposes Basic design guidelines for controlling access to the computer room were therefore devised br During the boom of the microcomputer industry and especially during the s users started to deploy computers everywhere in many cases with little or no care about operating requirements However as information technology IT operations started to grow in complexity organizations grew aware of the need to control IT resources The availability of inexpensive networking equipment coupled with new standards for the network structured cabling made it possible to use a hierarchical design that put the servers in a specific room inside the company The use of the term data center as applied to specially designed computer rooms started to gain popular recognition about this time br A boom of data centers came during the dot com bubble of Companies needed fast Internet connectivity and non stop operation to deploy systems and to establish a presence on the Internet Installing such equipment was not viable for many smaller companies Many companies started building very large facilities called internet data centers IDCs which provide enhanced capabilities such as crossover backup If a Bell Atlantic line is cut we can transfer them to to minimize the time of outage br The term cloud data centers CDCs has been used Data centers typically cost a lot to build and maintain Increasingly the division of these terms has almost disappeared and they are being integrated into the term data center br The global data center market saw steady growth in the s with a notable acceleration in the latter half of the decade According to Gartner worldwide data center infrastructure spending reached billion in representing a increase from despite the economic challenges posed by the COVID pandemic br The latter part of the s and early s saw a significant shift towards AI and machine learning applications generating a global boom for more powerful and efficient data center infrastructure As of March global data creation was projected to grow to more than zettabytes by up from zettabytes in br Amidst the recent boom of development the United States has established a position as the leader in data center infrastructure hosting data centers as of March the highest number of any country worldwide According to global consultancy McKinsey Co U S market demand is expected to double to gigawatts GW by up from GW in As of the U S accounts for roughly percent of the global market br A study published by the Electric Power Research Institute EPRI in May estimates U S data center power consumption could range from to of the country s generation by As of about of U S data center load was concentrated in states led by Virginia and Texas br br br Requirements for modern data centers br br Modernization and data center transformation enhances performance and energy efficiency br Information security is also a concern and for this reason a data center has to offer a secure environment that minimizes the chances of a security breach A data center must therefore keep high standards for assuring the integrity and functionality of its hosted computer environment br Industry research company International Data Corporation IDC puts the average age of a data center at nine years old Gartner another research company says data centers older than seven years are obsolete The growth in data zettabytes by is one factor driving the need for data centers to modernize br Focus on modernization is not new concern about obsolete equipment was decried in and in Uptime Institute was concerned about the age of the equipment therein By concern had shifted once again this time to the age of the staff data center staff are aging faster than the equipment br br br Meeting standards for data centers br The Telecommunications Industry Association s Telecommunications Infrastructure Standard for Data Centers specifies the minimum requirements for telecommunications infrastructure of data centers and computer rooms including single tenant enterprise data centers and multi tenant Internet hosting data centers The topology proposed in this document is intended to be applicable to any size data center br Telcordia GR NEBS Requirements for Telecommunications Data Center Equipment and Spaces provides guidelines for data center spaces within telecommunications networks and environmental requirements for the equipment intended for installation in those spaces These criteria were developed jointly by Telcordia and industry representatives They may be applied to data center spaces housing data processing or Information Technology IT equipment The equipment may be used to br br Operate and manage a carrier s telecommunication network br Provide data center based applications directly to the carrier s customers br Provide hosted applications for a third party to provide services to their customers br Provide a combination of these and similar data center applications br br br Data center transformation br Data center transformation takes a step by step approach through integrated projects carried out over time This differs from a traditional method of data center upgrades that takes a serial and siloed approach The typical projects within a data center transformation initiative include standardization consolidation virtualization automation and security br br Standardization consolidation Reducing the number of data centers and avoiding server sprawl both physical and virtual often includes replacing aging data center equipment and is aided by standardization br Virtualization Lowers capital and operational expenses reduces energy consumption Virtualized desktops can be hosted in data centers and rented out on a subscription basis Investment bank Lazard Capital Markets estimated in that percent of enterprise operations will be virtualized by Gartner views virtualization as a catalyst for modernization br Automating Automating tasks such as provisioning configuration patching release management and compliance is needed not just when facing fewer skilled IT workers br Securing Protection of virtual systems is integrated with the existing security of physical infrastructures br br br Raised floor br br A raised floor standards guide named GR was developed by Telcordia Technologies a subsidiary of Ericsson br Although the first raised floor computer room was made by IBM in and they ve been around since the s it was the s that made it more common for computer centers to thereby allow cool air to circulate more efficiently br The first purpose of the raised floor was to allow access for wiring br br br Lights out br The lights out data center also known as a darkened or a dark data center is a data center that ideally has all but eliminated the need for direct access by personnel except under extraordinary circumstances Because of the lack of need for staff to enter the data center it can be operated without lighting All of the devices are accessed and managed by remote systems with automation programs used to perform unattended operations In addition to the energy savings reduction in staffing costs and the ability to locate the site further from population centers implementing a lights out data center reduces the threat of malicious attacks upon the infrastructure br br br Noise levels br Generally speaking local authorities prefer noise levels at data centers to be dB below the existing night time background noise level at the nearest residence br OSHA regulations require monitoring of noise levels inside data centers if noise exceeds decibels The average noise level in server areas of a data center may reach as high as dB A br Residents living near data centers have described the sound as a high pitched whirring noise saying It s like being on a tarmac with an airplane engine running constantly Except that the airplane keeps idling and never leaves br External sources of noise include HVAC equipment and energy generators br br br Data center design br The field of data center design has been growing for decades in various directions including new construction big and small along with the creative re use of existing facilities like abandoned retail space old salt mines and war era bunkers br br a story data center has already been proposed br the number of data centers as of had grown beyond million USA wide and more than triple that number worldwide br Local building codes may govern the minimum ceiling heights and other parameters Some of the considerations in the design of data centers are br br Size one room of a building one or more floors or an entire building br Capacity can hold up to or past servers br Other considerations Space power cooling and costs in the data center br Mechanical engineering infrastructure heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC humidification and dehumidification equipment pressurization br Electrical engineering infrastructure design utility service planning distribution switching and bypass from power sources uninterruptible power source UPS systems and more br br br Design criteria and trade offs br Availability expectations The costs of avoiding downtime should not exceed the cost of the downtime itself br Site selection Location factors include proximity to power grids telecommunications infrastructure networking services transportation lines and emergency services Other considerations should include flight paths neighboring power drains geological risks and climate associated with cooling costs br Often power availability is the hardest to change br br br High availability br br Various metrics exist for measuring the data availability that results from data center availability beyond uptime with the top of the scale counting how many nines can be placed after br br br Modularity and flexibility br br Modularity and flexibility are key elements in allowing for a data center to grow and change over time Data center modules are pre engineered standardized building blocks that can be easily configured and moved as needed br A modular data center may consist of data center equipment contained within shipping containers or similar portable containers Components of the data center can be prefabricated and standardized which facilitates moving if needed br br br Environmental control br Temperature and humidity are controlled via br br Air conditioning br indirect cooling such as using outside air Indirect Evaporative Cooling IDEC units and also using sea water br It is important that computers do not get humid or overheat as high humidity can lead to dust clogging the fans which leads to overheat or can cause components to malfunction ruining the board and running a fire hazard Overheat can cause components usually the silicon or copper of the wires or circuits to melt causing connections to loosen causing fire hazards br br br Electrical power br br Backup power consists of one or more uninterruptible power supplies battery banks and or diesel gas turbine generators br To prevent single points of failure all elements of the electrical systems including backup systems are typically given redundant copies and critical servers are connected to both the A side and B side power feeds This arrangement is often made to achieve N redundancy in the systems Static transfer switches are sometimes used to ensure instantaneous switchover from one supply to the other in the event of a power failure br br br Low voltage cable routing br Options include br br Data cabling can be routed through overhead cable trays br Raised floor cabling both for security reasons and to avoid the extra cost of cooling systems over the racks br Smaller less expensive data centers may use anti static tiles instead for a flooring surface br br br Air flow br Air flow management addresses the need to improve data center computer cooling efficiency by preventing the recirculation of hot air exhausted from IT equipment and reducing bypass airflow There are several methods of separating hot and cold airstreams such as hot cold aisle containment and in row cooling units br br br Aisle containment br Cold aisle containment is done by exposing the rear of equipment racks while the fronts of the servers are enclosed with doors and covers This is similar to how large scale food companies refrigerate and store their products br Computer cabinets Server farms are often organized for containment of hot cold aisles Proper air duct placement prevents the cold and hot air from mixing Rows of cabinets are paired to face each other so that the cool and hot air intakes and exhausts don t mix air which would severely reduce cooling efficiency br Alternatively a range of underfloor panels can create efficient cold air pathways directed to the raised floor vented tiles Either the cold aisle or the hot aisle can be contained br Another option is fitting cabinets with vertical exhaust duct chimneys Hot exhaust pipes vents ducts can direct the air into a Plenum space above a Dropped ceiling and back to the cooling units or to outside vents With this configuration traditional hot cold aisle configuration is not a requirement br br br Fire protection br br Data centers feature fire protection systems including passive and Active Design elements as well as implementation of fire prevention programs in operations Smoke detectors are usually installed to provide early warning of a fire at its incipient stage br Although the main room usually does not allow Wet Pipe based Systems due to the fragile nature of Circuit boards there still exist systems that can be used in the rest of the facility or in cold hot aisle air circulation systems that are closed systems such as br br Sprinkler systems br Misting using high pressure to create extremely small water droplets which can be used in sensitive rooms due to the nature of the droplets br However there also exist other means to put out fires especially in Sensitive areas usually using Gaseous fire suppression of which Halon gas was the most popular until the negative effects of producing and using it were discovered br br br Security br br Physical access is usually restricted Layered security often starts with fencing bollards and mantraps Video camera surveillance and permanent security guards are almost always present if the data center is large or contains sensitive information Fingerprint recognition mantraps are starting to be commonplace br Logging access is required by some data protection regulations some organizations tightly link this to access control systems Multiple log entries can occur at the main entrance entrances to internal rooms and at equipment cabinets Access control at cabinets can be integrated with intelligent power distribution units so that locks are networked through the same appliance br br br Energy use br br Energy use is a central issue for data centers Power draw ranges from a few kW for a rack of servers in a closet to several tens of MW for large facilities Some facilities have power densities more than times that of a typical office building For higher power density facilities electricity costs are a dominant operating expense and account for over of the total cost of ownership TCO of a data center br br br Greenhouse gas emissions br In data centers excluding cryptocurrency mining and data transmission each used about of world electricity Although some of this electricity was low carbon the IEA called for more government and industry efforts on energy efficiency renewables procurement and RD D as some data centers still use electricity generated by fossil fuels They also said that lifecycle emissions should be considered that is including embodied emissions such as in buildings Data centers are estimated to have been responsible for of US greenhouse gas emissions in Some Chinese companies such as Tencent have pledged to be carbon neutral by while others such as Alibaba have been criticized by Greenpeace for not committing to become carbon neutral Google and Microsoft now each consume more power than some fairly big countries surpassing the consumption of more than countries br br br Energy efficiency and overhead br The most commonly used energy efficiency metric for data centers is power usage effectiveness PUE calculated as the ratio of total power entering the data center divided by the power used by IT equipment br br br br br br P br U br E br br br br br br br Total Facility Power br br br br br IT Equipment Power br br br br br br br displaystyle mathrm PUE mbox Total Facility Power over mbox IT Equipment Power br br br PUE measures the percentage of power used by overhead devices cooling lighting etc The average USA data center has a PUE of meaning two watts of total power overhead IT equipment for every watt delivered to IT equipment State of the art data centers are estimated to have a PUE of roughly Google publishes quarterly efficiency metrics from its data centers in operation PUEs of as low as have been achieved with two phase immersion cooling br The U S Environmental Protection Agency has an Energy Star rating for standalone or large data centers To qualify for the ecolabel a data center must be within the top quartile in energy efficiency of all reported facilities The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of United States requires federal facilities including data centers to operate more efficiently California s Title of the California Code of Regulations mandates that every newly constructed data center must have some form of airflow containment in place to optimize energy efficiency br The European Union also has a similar initiative EU Code of Conduct for Data Centres br br br Energy use analysis and projects br The focus of measuring and analyzing energy use goes beyond what is used by IT equipment facility support hardware such as chillers and fans also use energy br In server racks in data centers were designed for more than kW and the typical server was estimated to waste about of the electricity it consumed The energy demand for information storage systems is also rising A high availability data center is estimated to have a megawatt MW demand and consume in electricity over its lifetime with cooling representing to of the data center s total cost of ownership Calculations show that in two years the cost of powering and cooling a server could be equal to the cost of purchasing the server hardware Research in has shown that a substantial amount of energy could still be conserved by optimizing IT refresh rates and increasing server utilization br In Facebook Rackspace and others founded the Open Compute Project OCP to develop and publish open standards for greener data center computing technologies As part of the project Facebook published the designs of its server which it had built for its first dedicated data center in Prineville Making servers taller left space for more effective heat sinks and enabled the use of fans that moved more air with less energy By not buying commercial off the shelf servers energy consumption due to unnecessary expansion slots on the motherboard and unneeded components such as a graphics card was also saved In Google joined the project and published the designs of its V DC shallow data center rack This design had long been part of Google data centers By eliminating the multiple transformers usually deployed in data centers Google had achieved a increase in energy efficiency In sales for data center hardware built to OCP designs topped billion and are expected to reach billion by br br br Power and cooling analysis br br Power is the largest recurring cost to the user of a data center Cooling it at or below F C wastes money and energy Furthermore overcooling equipment in environments with a high relative humidity can expose equipment to a high amount of moisture that facilitates the growth of salt deposits on conductive filaments in the circuitry br A power and cooling analysis also referred to as a thermal assessment measures the relative temperatures in specific areas as well as the capacity of the cooling systems to handle specific ambient temperatures A power and cooling analysis can help to identify hot spots over cooled areas that can handle greater power use density the breakpoint of equipment loading the effectiveness of a raised floor strategy and optimal equipment positioning such as AC units to balance temperatures across the data center Power cooling density is a measure of how much square footage the center can cool at maximum capacity The cooling of data centers is the second largest power consumer after servers The cooling energy varies from of the total energy consumption in the most efficient data centers and goes up to in standard air cooled data centers br br br Energy efficiency analysis br An energy efficiency analysis measures the energy use of data center IT and facilities equipment A typical energy efficiency analysis measures factors such as a data center s Power Use Effectiveness PUE against industry standards identifies mechanical and electrical sources of inefficiency and identifies air management metrics However the limitation of most current metrics and approaches is that they do not include IT in the analysis Case studies have shown that by addressing energy efficiency holistically in a data center major efficiencies can be achieved that are not possible otherwise br br br Computational Fluid Dynamics CFD analysis br br This type of analysis uses sophisticated tools and techniques to understand the unique thermal conditions present in each data center predicting the temperature airflow and pressure behavior of a data center to assess performance and energy consumption using numerical modeling By predicting the effects of these environmental conditions CFD analysis of a data center can be used to predict the impact of high density racks mixed with low density racks and the onward impact on cooling resources poor infrastructure management practices and AC failure or AC shutdown for scheduled maintenance br br br Thermal zone mapping br Thermal zone mapping uses sensors and computer modeling to create a three dimensional image of the hot and cool zones in a data center br This information can help to identify optimal positioning of data center equipment For example critical servers might be placed in a cool zone that is serviced by redundant AC units br br br Green data centers br br Data centers use a lot of power consumed by two main usages The power required to run the actual equipment and then the power required to cool the equipment Power efficiency reduces the first category br Cooling cost reduction through natural means includes location decisions When the focus is avoiding good fiber connectivity power grid connections and people concentrations to manage the equipment a data center can be miles away from the users Mass data centers like Google or Facebook don t need to be near population centers Arctic locations that can use outside air which provides cooling are becoming more popular br Renewable electricity sources are another plus Thus countries with favorable conditions such as Canada Finland Sweden Norway and Switzerland are trying to attract cloud computing data centers br br br Direct current data centers br br Direct current data centers are data centers that produce direct current on site with solar panels and store the electricity on site in a battery storage power station Computers run on direct current and the need for inverting the AC power from the grid would be eliminated The data center site could still use AC power as a grid as a backup solution DC data centers could be more efficient and use less floor space for inverting components br br br Energy reuse br It is very difficult to reuse the heat which comes from air cooled data centers For this reason data center infrastructures are more often equipped with heat pumps An alternative to heat pumps is the adoption of liquid cooling throughout a data center Different liquid cooling techniques are mixed and matched to allow for a fully liquid cooled infrastructure that captures all heat with water Different liquid technologies are categorized in main groups indirect liquid cooling water cooled racks direct liquid cooling direct to chip cooling and total liquid cooling complete immersion in liquid see server immersion cooling This combination of technologies allows the creation of a thermal cascade as part of temperature chaining scenarios to create high temperature water outputs from the data center br br br Dynamic infrastructure br br Dynamic infrastructure provides the ability to intelligently automatically and securely move workloads within a data center anytime anywhere for migrations provisioning to enhance performance or building co location facilities It also facilitates performing routine maintenance on either physical or virtual systems all while minimizing interruption A related concept is Composable Infrastructure which allows for the dynamic reconfiguration of the available resources to suit needs only when needed br Side benefits include br br reducing cost br facilitating business continuity and high availability br enabling cloud and grid computing br br br Network infrastructure br br Communications in data centers today are most often based on networks running the Internet protocol suite Data centers contain a set of routers and switches that transport traffic between the servers and to the outside world which are connected according to the data center network architecture Redundancy of the internet connection is often provided by using two or more upstream service providers see Multihoming br Some of the servers at the data center are used for running the basic internet and intranet services needed by internal users in the organization e g e mail servers proxy servers and DNS servers br Network security elements are also usually deployed firewalls VPN gateways intrusion detection systems and so on Also common are monitoring systems for the network and some of the applications Additional off site monitoring systems are also typical in case of a failure of communications inside the data center br br br Software data backup br Non mutually exclusive options for data backup are br br Onsite br Offsite br Onsite is traditional and one of its major advantages is immediate availability br br br Offsite backup storage br br Data backup techniques include having an encrypted copy of the data offsite Methods used for transporting data are br br Having the customer write the data to a physical medium such as magnetic tape and then transporting the tape elsewhere br Directly transferring the data to another site during the backup using appropriate links br Uploading the data into the cloud br br br Modular data center br br For quick deployment or disaster recovery several large hardware vendors have developed mobile modular solutions that can be installed and made operational in a very short amount of time br br br Micro data center br Micro data centers MDCs are access level data centers which are smaller in size than traditional data centers but provide the same features They are typically located near the data source to reduce communication delays as their small size allows several MDCs to be spread out over a wide area MDCs are well suited to user facing front end applications They are commonly used in edge computing and other areas where low latency data processing is needed
