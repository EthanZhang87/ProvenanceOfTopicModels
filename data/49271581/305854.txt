Text messaging or texting is the act of composing and sending electronic messages typically consisting of alphabetic and numeric characters between two or more users of mobile devices desktops laptops or another type of compatible computer Text messages may be sent over a cellular network or may also be sent via satellite or Internet connection br The term originally referred to messages sent using the Short Message Service SMS It has grown beyond alphanumeric text to include multimedia messages using the Multimedia Messaging Service MMS and Rich Communication Services RCS which can contain digital images videos and sound content as well as ideograms known as emoji happy faces sad faces and other icons and instant messenger applications usually the term is used when on mobile devices br Text messages are used for personal family business and social purposes Governmental and non governmental organizations use text messaging for communication between colleagues In the s the sending of short informal messages became an accepted part of many cultures as happened earlier with emailing This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends family and colleagues including in contexts where a call would be impolite or inappropriate e g calling very late at night or when one knows the other person is busy with family or work activities Like e mail and voicemail and unlike calls in which the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient texting does not require the caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment this permits communication even between busy individuals Text messages can also be used to interact with automated systems for example to order products or services from e commerce websites or to participate in online contests Advertisers and service providers use direct text marketing to send messages to mobile users about promotions payment due dates and other notifications instead of using postal mail email or voicemail br br br Terminology br br The service is referred to by different colloquialisms depending on the region It may simply be referred to as a text in North America the United Kingdom Australia New Zealand and the Philippines an SMS in most of mainland Europe or an MMS or SMS in the Middle East Africa and Asia The sender of a text message is commonly referred to as a texter br br br History br The electrical telegraph systems developed in the early th century used electrical signals to send text messages In the late th century wireless telegraphy was developed using radio waves br In the German Reichspost Reich postal service introduced the first telex service br The University of Hawaii began using radio to send digital information as early as using ALOHAnet Friedhelm Hillebrand conceptualised SMS in while working for Deutsche Telekom Sitting at a typewriter at home Hillebrand typed out random sentences and counted every letter number punctuation mark and space Almost every time the messages contained fewer than characters thus giving the basis for the limit one could type via text messaging With Bernard Ghillebaert of France T l com he developed a proposal for the GSM Groupe Sp cial Mobile meeting in February in Oslo The first technical solution evolved in a GSM subgroup under the leadership of Finn Trosby It was further developed under the leadership of Kevin Holley and Ian Harris see Short Message Service SMS forms an integral part of Signalling System No SS Under SS it is a state with characters of data coded in the ITU T T text format that has a sequence lead in to determine different language codes and may have special character codes that permit for example sending simple graphs as text This was part of ISDN Integrated Services Digital Network and since GSM is based on this it made its way to the mobile phone Messages could be sent and received on ISDN phones and these can send SMS to any GSM phone The possibility of doing something is one thing implementing it is another but systems existed in that sent SMS messages to mobile phones compare ND NOTIS br SMS messaging was used for the first time on December at the Three Tuns Public House in Reading Berkshire when Neil Papworth a year old test engineer for Sema Group in the UK now Airwide Solutions used a personal computer to send the text message Merry Christmas via the Vodafone network to the phone of Richard Jarvis who was at a party in Newbury Berkshire which had been organized to celebrate the event Modern SMS text messaging is usually sent from one mobile phone to another Finnish Radiolinja became the first network to offer a commercial person to person SMS text messaging service in When Radiolinja s domestic competitor Telecom Finland now part of TeliaSonera also launched SMS text messaging in and the two networks offered cross network SMS functionality Finland became the first nation where SMS text messaging was offered on a competitive as well as a commercial basis GSM was allowed in the United States but the radio frequencies were blocked and awarded to US Carriers to use US technology which limited development of mobile messaging services in the US The GSM in the US had to use a frequency allocated for private communication services PCS what the ITU frequency r gime had blocked for DECT Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications a foot range picocell but it survived American Personal Communications APC the first GSM carrier in America provided the first text messaging service in the United States Sprint Telecommunications Venture a partnership of Sprint Corp and three large cable TV companies owned percent of APC The Sprint venture was the largest single buyer at a government run spectrum auction that raised billion in for PCS licenses APC operated under the brand name Sprint Spectrum and launched its service on November in Washington D C and Baltimore Maryland Vice President Al Gore in Washington D C made the initial phone call to launch the network calling Mayor Kurt Schmoke in Baltimore br Initial growth of text messaging worldwide was slow with customers in sending on average only messages per GSM customer per month One factor in the slow take up of SMS was that operators were slow to set up charging systems especially for prepaid subscribers and to eliminate billing fraud which was possible by changing SMSC settings on individual handsets to use the SMSCs of other operators Over time this issue was eliminated by switch billing instead of billing at the SMSC and by new features within SMSCs that allowed the blocking of foreign mobile users sending messages through them SMS is available on a wide range of networks including G networks However not all text messaging systems use SMS some notable alternate implementations of the concept include J Phone s SkyMail and NTT Docomo s Short Mail both in Japan E mail messaging from phones as popularized by NTT Docomo s i mode and the RIM BlackBerry also typically use standard mail protocols such as SMTP over TCP IP As of text messaging was the most widely used mobile data service with of all mobile phone users worldwide or billion out of billion phone subscribers being active users of the Short Message Service at the end of In countries such as Finland Sweden and Norway over of the population used SMS The European average was about and North America was rapidly catching up with over active users of SMS by end of The largest average usage of the service by mobile phone subscribers occurs in the Philippines with an average of texts sent per day per subscriber br br br Uses br br Text messaging is most often used between private mobile phone users as a substitute for voice calls in situations where voice communication is impossible or undesirable e g during a school class or a work meeting Texting is also used to communicate very brief messages such as informing someone that you will be late or reminding a friend or colleague about a meeting As with e mail informality and brevity have become an accepted part of text messaging Some text messages such as SMS can also be used for the remote control of home appliances It is widely used in domotics systems Some amateurs have also built their own systems to control some of their appliances via SMS A Flash SMS is a type of text message that appears directly on the main screen without user interaction and is not automatically stored in the inbox It can be useful in cases such as an emergency e g fire alarm or confidentiality e g one time password br SMS has historically been particularly popular in Europe Asia excluding Japan see below the United States Australia and New Zealand while also gaining influence in Africa Popularity has grown to a sufficient extent that the term texting used as a verb meaning the act of mobile phone users sending short messages back and forth has entered the common lexicon In young Asians considered SMS as the most popular mobile phone application In the same year percent of American teens send text messages or more per day making it their most frequent form of communication In in China SMS was very popular and brought service providers significant profit billion short messages were sent in br It has been a very influential and powerful tool in the Philippines where in the average user sent text messages a day The same year the Philippines alone sent on average over billion text messages a day more than the annual average SMS volume of the countries in Europe and even China and India SMS saw hugely popular in India where youngsters often exchanged many text messages and companies provide alerts infotainment news cricket scores updates railway airline booking mobile billing and banking services on SMS br Similarly in text messaging played a primary role in the implication of former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick in an SMS sex scandal Short messages are particularly popular among young urbanites In many markets the service is comparatively cheap For example in Australia a message typically costs between A and to send some prepaid services charge between their own phones compared with a voice call which costs somewhere between and per minute commonly charged in half minute blocks The service is enormously profitable to the service providers At a typical length of only bytes including protocol overhead more than of these messages per minute can be transmitted at the same data rate as a usual voice call kbit s There are also free SMS services available which are often sponsored that allow sending and receiving SMS from a PC connected to the Internet Mobile service providers in New Zealand such as One NZ and Spark New Zealand provided up to SMS messages for NZ per month Users on these plans sent on average SMS messages every month Text messaging became so popular that advertising agencies and advertisers jumped into the text messaging business Services that provide bulk text message sending are also becoming a popular way for clubs associations and advertisers to reach a group of opt in subscribers quickly br In research suggested that Internet based mobile messaging would grow to equal the popularity of SMS by the end of with nearly trillion messages being sent through each technology Services such as Facebook Messenger Snapchat WhatsApp and Viber have led to a decline in the use of SMS in parts of the world br br br Applications br br br Microblogging br br Of many texting trends a system known as microblogging has surfaced which consists of a miniaturized blog inspired mainly by people s tendency to jot down informal thoughts and post them online They consist of websites like X formerly Twitter and its Chinese equivalent Weibo As of of all American adults used Twitter As of Weibo had million active users br br br Emergency services br In some countries text messages can be used to contact emergency services In the UK text messages can be used to call emergency services only after registering with the emergency SMS service This service is primarily aimed at people who because of disability are unable to make a voice call It has recently been promoted as a means for walkers and climbers to call emergency services from areas where a voice call is not possible due to low signal strength br In the US there is a move to require both traditional operators and over the top messaging providers to support texting to In Asia SMS is used for tsunami warnings and in Europe SMS is used to inform individuals of imminent disasters Since the location of a handset is known systems can alert everyone in an area that the events have made impossible to pass through e g an avalanche A similar system known as Emergency Alert is used in Australia to notify the public of impending disasters through both SMS and landline phone calls These messages can be sent based on either the location of the phone or the address to which the handset is registered br In the early s device manufacturers have begun to integrate satellite messaging connectivity and satellite emergency services into conventional mobile phones for use in remote regions where there is no reliable terrestrial cellular network br br br Reminders of medical appointments br SMS messages are used in some countries as reminders of medical appointments Missed outpatient clinic appointments cost the National Health Service England more than million million a year SMS messages are thought to be more cost effective swifter to deliver and more likely to receive a faster response than letters A study by Sims and colleagues examined the outcomes of outpatient appointments scheduled in mental health services in South East London The study found that SMS message reminders could reduce the number of missed psychiatric appointments by representing a potential national yearly saving of over million br Because of the COVID pandemic medical facilities in the United States are using text messaging to coordinate the appointment process including reminders cancellations and safe check in US based cloud radiology information system vendor AbbaDox includes this in their patient engagement services br br br Commercial uses br br br Short codes br Short codes are special telephone numbers shorter than full telephone numbers that can be used to address SMS and MMS messages from mobile phones or fixed phones There are two types of short codes dialling and messaging br br br Text messaging gateway providers br SMS gateway providers facilitate the SMS traffic between businesses and mobile subscribers being mainly responsible for carrying mission critical messages SMS for enterprises content delivery and entertainment services involving SMS e g TV voting Considering SMS messaging performance and cost as well as the level of text messaging services SMS gateway providers can be classified as resellers of the text messaging capability of another provider s SMSC or offering the text messaging capability as an operator of their own SMSC with SS SMS messaging gateway providers can provide gateway to mobile Mobile Terminated MT services Some suppliers can also supply mobile to gateway text in or Mobile Originated MO services Many operate text in services on short codes or mobile number ranges whereas others use lower cost geographic text in numbers br br br Premium content br SMS has been widely used for delivering digital content such as news alerts financial information pictures GIFs logos and ringtones Such messages are also known as premium rated short messages PSMS The subscribers are charged extra for receiving this premium content and the amount is typically divided between the mobile network operator and the value added service provider VASP either through revenue share or a fixed transport fee Services like ASK and Any Question Answered have used the PSMS model to enable rapid response to mobile consumers questions using on call teams of experts and researchers In November amidst complaints about unsolicited charges on bills major mobile carriers in the US agreed to stop billing for PSMS in states effectively ending its use in the United States br Outside the United States premium short messages have been used for real world services For example some vending machines now allow payment by sending a premium rated short message so that the cost of the item bought is added to the user s phone bill or subtracted from the user s prepaid credits Recently premium messaging companies have come under fire from consumer groups due to a large number of consumers racking up huge phone bills A new type of free premium or hybrid premium content has emerged with the launch of text service websites These sites allow registered users to receive free text messages when items they are interested in go on sale or when new items are introduced An alternative to inbound SMS is based on long numbers international mobile number format e g or geographic numbers that can handle voice and SMS e g which can be used in place of short codes or premium rated short messages for SMS reception in several applications such as TV voting product promotions and campaigns Long numbers are internationally available as well as enabling businesses to have their own number rather than short codes which are usually shared across a lot of brands Additionally long numbers are non premium inbound numbers br br br In workplaces br The use of text messaging for workplace purposes grew significantly during the mid s As companies seek competitive advantages many employees used new technology collaborative applications and real time messaging such as SMS instant messaging and mobile communications to connect with teammates and customers Some practical uses of text messaging include the use of SMS for confirming delivery or other tasks for instant communication between a service provider and a client e g a payment card company and a consumer and for sending alerts Several universities have implemented a system of texting students and faculties campus alerts One such example is Penn State br As text messaging has proliferated in business so too have regulations governing its use One regulation specifically governing the use of text messaging in financial services firms engaged in stocks equities and securities trading is Regulatory Notice Supervision of Electronic Communications December issued to member firms by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA In Regulatory Notice FINRA noted that electronic communications e mail and electronic correspondence may be used interchangeably and can include such forms of electronic messaging as instant messaging and text messaging Industry has had to develop new technology to allow companies to archive their employees text messages br Security confidentiality reliability and speed of SMS are among the most important guarantees industries such as financial services energy and commodities trading health care and enterprises demand in their mission critical procedures One way to guarantee such a quality of text messaging lies in introducing SLAs Service Level Agreement which are common in IT contracts By providing measurable SLAs corporations can define reliability parameters and set up a high quality of their services Just one of many SMS applications that have proven highly popular and successful in the financial services industry is mobile receipts In January Mobile Marketing Association MMA published the Mobile Banking Overview for financial institutions in which it discussed the advantages and disadvantages of mobile channel platforms such as Short Message Services SMS Mobile Web Mobile Client Applications SMS with Mobile Web and Secure SMS br Mobile interaction services are an alternative way of using SMS in business communications with greater certainty Typical business to business applications are telematics and Machine to Machine in which two applications automatically communicate with each other Incident alerts are also common and staff communications are also another use for B B scenarios Businesses can use SMS for time critical alerts updates and reminders mobile campaigns content and entertainment applications Mobile interaction can also be used for consumer to business interactions such as media voting and competitions and consumer to consumer interaction for example with mobile social networking chatting and dating br Text messaging is widely used in business settings as well it is used in many civil service and non governmental organization workplaces The U S And Canadian civil service both adopted BlackBerry smartphones in the s br br br Group texts br Group texts involve more than two users They are often used when it is helpful to message many people at once such as inviting multiple people to an event or arranging groups They are also used in business for marketing and other customer notifications as well as intracompany communication br Group texts are often sent as MMS messages and therefore require an internet connection to send instead of using the sender s text messaging plan br br br Online SMS services br There are a growing number of websites that allow users to send free SMS messages online Some websites provide free SMS for promoting premium business packages br br br Worldwide use br br br Europe br br In Europe followed next behind Asia in terms of the popularity of the use of SMS That year an average of billion messages were sent each month Users in Spain sent a little more than fifty messages per month on average in In Italy Germany and the United Kingdom the figure was around SMS messages per month In each of these countries the cost of sending an SMS message varied from depending on the payment plan with many contractual plans including all or several texts for free In the United Kingdom text messages are charged between Curiously France did not take to SMS in the same way sending just under messages on average per user per month France has the same GSM technology as other European countries so the uptake is not hampered by technical restrictions br In the Republic of Ireland in billion messages were sent every quarter on average messages per person per month In the United Kingdom as of March over billion text messages were sent every week The Eurovision Song Contest organized the first pan European SMS voting in as a part of the voting system there was also a voting over traditional landline phone lines In the Eurovision Song Contest organized the biggest televoting ever with SMS and phone voting During roaming that is when a user connects to another network in different country from their own the prices may be higher but in July EU legislation went into effect limiting this price to br Mobile service providers in Finland offered contracts in which users can send text messages a month for In Finland which has very high mobile phone ownership rates some TV channels began SMS chat which involved sending short messages to a phone number and the messages would be shown on TV Chats are always moderated which prevents users from sending offensive material to the channel The craze evolved into quizzes and strategy games and then faster paced games designed for television and SMS control Games require users to register their nicknames and send short messages to control a character onscreen Messages usually cost to Euro apiece and games can require the player to send dozens of messages In December a Finnish TV channel MTV put a Santa Claus character on air reading aloud text messages sent in by viewers On March the first entirely interactive TV channel VIISI began operation in Finland However SBS Finland Oy took over the channel and turned it into a music channel named The Voice in November In the Prime Minister of Finland Matti Vanhanen made the news when he allegedly broke up with his girlfriend with a text message In the first book written solely in text messages Viimeiset viestit Last Messages was released by Finnish author Hannu Luntiala It is about an executive who travels through Europe and India br br br United States br In the United States text messaging is very popular as reported by CTIA in December the million US subscribers sent billion text messages per month for an average of messages per subscriber per month The Pew Research Center found in May that of U S adult cellphone users send and receive text messages CTIA reported in that trillion SMS and MMS were sent in the United States in showing continued popularity of the technology br In the U S SMS is often charged both at the sender and at the destination but unlike phone calls it cannot be rejected or dismissed The reasons for lower uptake than other countries are varied Many users have unlimited mobile to mobile minutes high monthly minute allotments or unlimited service Moreover push to talk services offer the instant connectivity of SMS and are typically unlimited The integration between competing providers and technologies necessary for cross network text messaging was not initially available Some providers originally charged extra for texting reducing its appeal In the third quarter of at least billion text messages were sent on AT T s network up almost from the preceding quarter br While texting is mainly popular among people from to years old it is also increasing among adults and business users The age that a child receives his her first cell phone has also decreased making text messaging a popular way of communicating The number of texts sent in the US has gone up over the years as the price has gone down to an average of per text sent and received To convince more customers to buy unlimited text messaging plans some major cellphone providers have increased the price to send and receive text messages from to per message This is over per megabyte Many providers offer unlimited plans which can result in a lower rate per text given sufficient volume br br br Japan br Japan was among the first countries to adopt short messages widely with pioneering non GSM services including J Phone s SkyMail and NTT Docomo s Short Mail Japanese adolescents first began text messaging because it was a cheaper form of communication than the other available forms Thus Japanese theorists created the selective interpersonal relationship theory claiming that mobile phones can change social networks among young people classified as to year olds They theorized this age group had extensive but low quality relationships with friends and mobile phone usage may facilitate improvement in the quality of their relationships They concluded this age group prefers selective interpersonal relationships in which they maintain particular partial but rich relations depending on the situation The same studies showed participants rated friendships in which they communicated face to face and through text messaging as being more intimate than those in which they communicated solely face to face This indicates participants make new relationships with face to face communication at an early stage but use text messaging to increase their contact later on As the relationships between participants grew more intimate the frequency of text messaging also increased However short messaging has been largely rendered obsolete by the prevalence of mobile Internet e mail which can be sent to and received from any e mail address mobile or otherwise That said while usually presented to the user simply as a uniform mail service and most users are unaware of the distinction the operators may still internally transmit the content as short messages especially if the destination is on the same network br br br China br Text messaging has historically been popular and cheap in China About billion messages were sent in Text message spam has also been a problem in China In billion spam messages were sent up from the previous year It is about messages per week per person In it was routine that the People s Republic of China government monitored text messages across the country for illegal content br Among Chinese migrant workers with little formal education it is common to refer to SMS manuals when text messaging These manuals are published as cheap smaller than pocket size booklets that offer diverse linguistic phrases to utilize as messages br br br Philippines br SMS was introduced to selected markets in the Philippines in In Philippine mobile service providers launched SMS more widely across the country with initial television marketing campaigns targeting hearing impaired users The service was initially free with subscriptions but Filipinos quickly exploited the feature to communicate for free instead of using voice calls which they would be charged for After telephone companies realized this trend they began charging for SMS The rate across networks is peso per SMS about US Even after users were charged for SMS it remained cheap about one tenth of the price of a voice call This low price led to about five million Filipinos owning a cell phone by Because of the highly social nature of Philippine culture and the affordability of SMS compared to voice calls SMS usage shot up Filipinos used texting not only for social messages but also for political purposes as it allowed the Filipinos to express their opinions on current events and political issues It became a powerful tool for Filipinos in promoting or denouncing issues and was a key factor during the EDSA II revolution which overthrew then President Joseph Estrada who was eventually found guilty of corruption According to statistics there were about million mobile service subscriptions roughly of the Filipino population with around billion SMS messages being sent daily Because of the large number of text messages being sent the Philippines became known as the text capital of the world during the late s until the early s br br br New Zealand br There are three mobile network companies operating in New Zealand with some sub brands and MVNOs br Spark NZ formerly Telecom NZ was the first telecommunication company in New Zealand In Spark was broken into two companies by regulation with Chorus Ltd taking the landline infrastructure and Spark NZ providing services including over their mobile network Vodafone NZ now One NZ acquired mobile network provider Bellsouth New Zealand in and had million customers as of July Vodafone launched the first Text messaging service in and has introduced innovative TXT services like SafeTXT and CallMe degrees Mobile Ltd launched in August br In around of the adult population had a mobile phone In general texting is more popular than making phone calls as it is viewed as less intrusive and therefore more polite br br br Sub Saharan Africa br In it was predicted that text messaging would become a key revenue driver for mobile network operators in Africa over the following couple of years Today text messaging is already slowly gaining influence in the African market One such person used text messaging to spread the word about HIV and AIDS In September a multi country campaign in Africa used text messaging to expose stock outs of essential medicines at public health facilities and put pressure on governments to address the issue br br br Social effects br The advent of text messaging made possible new forms of interaction that were not possible before A person could carry out a conversation with another user without the constraint of being expected to reply within a short amount of time and without needing to set time aside to engage in conversation With voice calling both participants need to be free at the same time Mobile phone users can maintain communication during situations in which a voice call is impractical impossible or unacceptable such as during a school class or work meeting Texting has provided a venue for participatory culture allowing viewers to vote in online and TV polls as well as receive information while they are on the move Texting can also bring people together and create a sense of community through Smart Mobs or Net War which create people power br Research in has also proven that text messaging is somehow making the social distances larger and could be ruining verbal communication skills for many people br br br Effect on language br br The small phone keypad and the rapidity of typical text message exchanges have caused a number of spelling abbreviations as in the phrase txt msg u an abbreviation for you HMU hit me up i e call me or use of camel case such as in ThisIsVeryLame To avoid the even more limited message lengths allowed when using Cyrillic or Greek letters speakers of languages written in those alphabets often use the Latin alphabet for their own language In certain languages utilizing diacritic marks such as Polish SMS technology created an entire new variant of written language characters normally written with diacritic marks e g in Polish are now being written without them as a e s z to enable using cell phones without Polish script or to save space in Unicode messages Historically this language developed out of shorthand used in bulletin board systems and later in Internet chat rooms where users would abbreviate some words to allow a response to be typed more quickly though the amount of time saved was often inconsequential However this became much more pronounced in SMS where mobile phone users either have a numeric keyboard with older cellphones or a small QWERTY keyboard for s era smartphones so more effort is required to type each character and there is sometimes a limit on the number of characters that may be sent In Mandarin Chinese numbers that sound similar to words are used in place of those words For example the numbers in Chinese w r l ng sound like the words for I love you w i n The sequence q s b sounds like the curse go to hell q s ba br Predictive text software which attempts to guess words Tegic s T as well as iTap or letters Eatoni s LetterWise reduces the labour of time consuming input This makes abbreviations not only less necessary but slower to type than regular words that are in the software s dictionary However it makes the messages longer often requiring the text message to be sent in multiple parts and therefore costing more to send The use of text messaging has changed the way that people talk and write essays some believing it to be harmful Children today are receiving cell phones at an age as young as eight years old more than per cent of children in second and third grade have their own mobile phones Because of this the texting language is integrated into the way that students think from an earlier age than ever before In November New Zealand Qualifications Authority approved the move that allowed students of secondary schools to use mobile phone text language in the end of the year exam papers Highly publicized reports beginning in of the use of text language in school assignments caused some to become concerned that the quality of written communication is on the decline and other reports claim that teachers and professors are beginning to have a hard time controlling the problem However the notion that text language is widespread or harmful is refuted by research from linguistic experts br An article in The New Yorker explores how text messaging has anglicized some of the world s languages The use of diacritic marks is dropped in languages such as French as well as symbols in Ethiopian languages In his book Txtng the Gr Db which translates as Texting the Great Debate David Crystal states that texters in all eleven languages use lol laughing out loud u brb be right back and gr great all English based shorthands The use of pictograms and logograms in texts are present in every language They shorten words by using symbols to represent the word or symbols whose name sounds like a syllable of the word such as in day or b This is commonly used in other languages as well Crystal gives some examples in several languages such as Italian sei six is used for sei you are Example dv dove sei where are you and French k cassette cassette tape There is also the use of numeral sequences substituting for several syllables of a word and creating whole phrases using numerals For example in French a c can be said as un de ces quatres see you around literally to one of these four days An example of using symbols in texting and borrowing from English is the use of Whenever it is used in texting its intended use is with the English pronunciation Crystal gives the example of the Welsh use of in F pronounced ataf meaning to me In character based languages such as Chinese and Japanese numbers are assigned syllables based on the shortened form of the pronunciation of the number sometimes the English pronunciation of the number In this way numbers alone can be used to communicate whole passages such as in Chinese b o bao n q ng qing n y sh ng y sh w i n can be literally translated as Hug hug you kiss you whole life whole life I love you English influences worldwide texting in variation but still in combination with the individual properties of languages br American popular culture is also recognized in shorthand For example Homer Simpson translates into Crystal also suggests that texting has led to more creativity in the English language giving people opportunities to create their own slang emoticons abbreviations acronyms etc The feeling of individualism and freedom makes texting more popular and a more efficient way to communicate Crystal has also been quoted in saying that In a logical world text messaging should not have survived But text messaging didn t just come out of nowhere It originally began as a messaging system that would send out emergency information But it gained immediate popularity with the public What followed is the SMS we see today which is a very quick and efficient way of sharing information from person to person Work by Richard Ling has shown that texting has a gendered dimension and it plays into the development of teen identity In addition we text to a very small number of other persons For most people half of their texts go to other people br Research by Rosen et al found that those young adults who used more language based textisms shortcuts such as LOL nite etc in daily writing produced worse formal writing than those young adults who used fewer linguistic textisms in daily writing However the exact opposite was true for informal writing This suggests that perhaps the act of using textisms to shorten communication words leads young adults to produce more informal writing which may then help them to be better informal writers Due to text messaging teens are writing more and some teachers see that this comfort with language can be harnessed to make better writers This new form of communication may be encouraging students to put their thoughts and feelings into words and this may be able to be used as a bridge to get them more interested in formal writing br Joan H Lee in her thesis What does txting do language The influences of exposure to messaging and print media on acceptability constraints she associates exposure to text messaging with more rigid acceptability constraints The thesis suggests that more exposure to the colloquial Generation Text language of text messaging contributes to being less accepting of words In contrast Lee found that students with more exposure to traditional print media such as books and magazines were more accepting of both real and fictitious words The thesis which garnered international media attention also presents a literature review of academic literature on the effects of text messaging on language Texting has also been shown to have had no effect or some positive effects on literacy According to Plester Wood and Joshi and their research done on the study of British year old children and their knowledge of text messages textisms are essentially forms of phonetic abbreviation that show that to produce and read such abbreviations arguably requires a level of phonological awareness and orthographic awareness in the child concerned br br br Texting while driving br br Texting while driving leads to increased distraction behind the wheel and can lead to an increased risk of an accident In Liberty Mutual Insurance Group conducted a survey with more than teens from over high schools nationwide The results showed that of students found texting to be very or extremely distracting A study by AAA found that of teens admitted to being distracted behind the wheel due to texting One example of distraction behind the wheel is the Chatsworth train collision which killed passengers The engineer had sent text messages while operating the train A experiment with Car and Driver editor Eddie Alterman that took place at a deserted airfield for safety reasons compared texting with drunk driving The experiment found that texting while driving was more dangerous than being drunk While being legally drunk added feet to Alterman s stopping distance while going mph km h reading an e mail on a phone added feet m and sending a text message added feet m br In the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute released the results of an month study that involved placing cameras inside the cabs of more than long haul trucks which recorded the drivers over a combined driving distance of three million miles The study concluded that when the drivers were texting their risk of crashing was times greater than when not texting br br br Texting while walking br Due to the proliferation of smart phone applications performed while walking texting while walking or wexting is the increasing practice of people being transfixed to their mobile device without looking in any direction but their personal screen while walking First coined reference in in New York from Rentrak s chief client officer when discussing time spent with media and various media usage metrics Text messaging among pedestrians leads to increased cognitive distraction and reduced situation awareness and may lead to increases in unsafe behaviour leading to injury and death Recent studies conducted on cell phone use while walking showed that cell phone users recall fewer objects when conversing walk slower have altered gait and are more unsafe when crossing a street Additionally some gait analyses showed that stance phase during overstepping motion longitudinal and lateral deviation increased during cell phone operation but step length and clearance did not a different analysis did find increased step clearance and reduced step length br It is unclear which processes may be affected by distraction which types of distraction may affect which cognitive processes and how individual differences may affect the influence of distraction Lamberg and Muratori believe that engaging in a dual task such as texting while walking may interfere with working memory and result in walking errors Their study demonstrated that participants engaged in text messaging were unable to maintain walking speed or retain accurate spatial information suggesting an inability to adequately divide their attention between two tasks According to them the addition of texting while walking with vision occluded increases the demands placed on the working memory system resulting in gait disruptions br Texting on a phone distracts participants even when the texting task used is a relatively simple one Stavrinos et al investigated the effect of other cognitive tasks such as engaging in conversations or cognitive tasks on a phone and found that participants actually have reduced visual awareness This finding was supported by Licence et al who conducted a similar study For example texting pedestrians may fail to notice unusual events in their environment such as a unicycling clown These findings suggest that tasks that require the allocation of cognitive resources can affect visual attention even when the task itself does not require the participants to avert their eyes from their environment The act of texting itself seems to impair pedestrians visual awareness It appears that the distraction produced by texting is a combination of both a cognitive and visual perceptual distraction A study conducted by Licence et al supported some of these findings particularly that those who text while walking significantly alter their gait However they also found that the gait pattern texters adopted was slower and more protective and consequently did not increase obstacle contact or tripping in a typical pedestrian context br There have also been technological approaches to increase the safety awareness of pedestrians that are unintentionally blind while using a smartphone e g using a Kinect or an ultrasound phone cover as a virtual white cane or using the built in camera to algorithmically analyze single respectively a stream of pictures for obstacles with Wang et al proposing to use machine learning to specifically detect incoming vehicles br br br Sexting br br Sexting is slang for the act of sending sexually explicit or suggestive content between mobile devices using SMS It contains either text images or video that is intended to be sexually arousing Sexting was reported as early as in The Sunday Telegraph Magazine constituting a trend in the creative use of SMS to excite another with alluring messages throughout the day br Although sexting often takes place consensually between two people it can also occur against the wishes of a person who is the subject of the content A number of instances have been reported in which the recipients of sexting have shared the content of the messages with others with less intimate intentions such as to impress their friends or embarrass their sender Celebrities such as Miley Cyrus Vanessa Hudgens and Adrienne Bailon have been victims of such abuses of sexting br A survey by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and CosmoGirl com suggested a trend of sexting and other seductive online content being readily shared between teens One in five teen girls surveyed per cent and per cent of teen girls aged years old say they have electronically sent or posted online nude or semi nude images of themselves One third per cent of teen boys and one quarter per cent of teen girls say they were shown private nude or semi nude images According to the survey sexually suggestive messages text e mail and instant messaging were even more common than images with per cent of teens having sent or posted such messages and half of the teens per cent having received them br A study that has received wide international media attention was conducted at the University of Utah Department of Psychology by Donald S Strassberg Ryan Kelly McKinnon Michael Susta ta and Jordan Rullo They surveyed teenagers ages and found that nearly per cent of the students said they had sent a sexually explicit image of themselves via cell phone and nearly twice as many said that they had received a sexually explicit picture Of those receiving such a picture over per cent indicated that they had forwarded it to others In addition of those who had sent a sexually explicit picture over a third had done so despite believing that there could be serious legal and other consequences if they got caught Students who had sent a picture by cell phone were more likely than others to find the activity acceptable The authors conclude These results argue for educational efforts such as cell phone safety assemblies awareness days integration into class curriculum and teacher training designed to raise awareness about the potential consequences of sexting among young people Sexting becomes a legal issue when teens under are involved because any nude photos they may send of themselves would put the recipients in possession of child pornography br br br In schools br br Text messaging has affected students academically by creating an easier way to cheat on exams In December a dozen students were caught cheating on an accounting exam through the use of text messages on their mobile phones In December Hitotsubashi University in Japan failed students for receiving emailed exam answers on their mobile phones The number of students caught using mobile phones to cheat on exams has increased significantly in recent years According to Okada most Japanese mobile phones can send and receive long text messages of between and characters with graphics video audio and Web links br In England school and college students were excluded from exams in for using mobile phones during exams Some teachers and professors claim that advanced texting features can lead to students cheating on exams Students in high school and college classrooms are using their mobile phones to send and receive texts during lectures at high rates Further published research has established that students who text during college lectures have impaired memories of the lecture material compared to students who do not For example in one study the number of irrelevant text messages sent and received during a lecture covering the topic of developmental psychology was related to students memory of the lecture br br br Bullying br br Spreading rumors and gossip by text message using text messages to bully individuals or forwarding texts that contain defamatory content is an issue of great concern for parents and schools Text bullying of this sort can cause distress and damage reputations In some cases individuals who are bullied online have committed suicide Harding and Rosenberg argue that the urge to forward text messages can be difficult to resist describing text messages as loaded weapons br Apple s messaging app Messages uses Apple s Internet based messaging service iMessage to send messages to other iMessage users and uses SMS as a fallback when no data connection is present or when messaging non iMessage users It sets the color of messages depending on which technology was used This has led to instances of iMessage users bullying people without iPhones br br br Influence on perceptions of the student br When a student sends an email that contains phonetic abbreviations and acronyms that are common in text messaging e g gr instead of great it can influence how that student is subsequently evaluated In a study by Lewandowski and Harrington participants read a student s email sent to a professor that either contained text messaging abbreviations gr How R U or parallel text in standard English great How are you and then provided impressions of the sender Students who used abbreviations in their email were perceived as having a less favorable personality and as putting forth less effort on an essay they submitted along with the email Specifically abbreviation users were seen as less intelligent responsible motivated studious dependable and hard working These findings suggest that the nature of a student s email communication can influence how others perceive the student and their work br However students have become aware of the reality that using these textisms and adaptations can negatively impact their professionalism Drouin and Davis surveyed American undergraduates in and found that three quarters of participants believed the use of textisms were not appropriate in formal messaging and writing A study performed by Grace et al asked undergraduate students to rate the appropriateness of using textisms in a given scenario on a scale of one to five five being entirely appropriate and one being not at all All but eleven of the students rated the use of textisms in exams and typed assignments as not at all appropriate showing that the students are aware of how they must adapt their written language and tone depending on the context Grace et al went further observing hundreds of academic papers from previous undergraduate students exams only to find that out of words a mere were textisms They owe this to the fact that the more accumulated experience a student has the more they are able to understand when the appropriate and inappropriate times to use such language is br br br Law and crime br Text messaging has been a subject of interest for police forces around the world One of the issues of concern to law enforcement agencies is the use of encrypted text messages In a British company developed a program called Fortress SMS which used bit AES encryption to protect SMS messages Police have also retrieved deleted text messages to aid them in solving crimes For example Swedish police retrieved deleted texts from a cult member who claimed she committed a double murder based on forwarded texts she received Police in Tilburg Netherlands started an SMS alert program in which they would send a message to ask citizens to be vigilant when a burglar was on the loose or a child was missing in their neighbourhood Several thieves have been caught and children have been found using the SMS Alerts The service has been expanding to other cities A Malaysian Australian company has released a multi layer SMS security program Boston police are now turning to text messaging to help stop crime The Boston Police Department asks citizens to send texts to make anonymous crime tips br Under some interpretations of sharia law husbands can divorce their wives by the pronouncement of talaq In a court in Malaysia upheld such a divorce pronouncement which was transmitted via SMS br The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in that under the state constitution police require a warrant before obtaining access to text messages without consent br br br Social unrest br Texting has been used on a number of occasions with the result of the gathering of large aggressive crowds SMS messaging drew a crowd to Cronulla Beach in Sydney resulting in the Cronulla riots Not only were text messages circulating in the Sydney area but in other states as well Daily Telegraph The volume of such text messages and e mails also increased in the wake of the riot The crowd of at stages became violent attacking certain ethnic groups Sutherland Shire Mayor directly blamed heavily circulated SMS messages for the unrest NSW police considered whether people could be charged over the texting Retaliatory attacks also used SMS br The Narre Warren Incident when a group of party goers attended a party at Narre Warren in Melbourne Australia and rioted in January also was a response of communication being spread by SMS and Myspace Following the incident the Police Commissioner wrote an open letter asking young people to be aware of the power of SMS and the Internet In Hong Kong government officials find that text messaging helps socially because they can send multiple texts to the community Officials say it is an easy way of contacting the community or individuals for meetings or events Texting was used to coordinate gatherings during the Iranian election protests br Between and the U S secretly created and funded a Twitter like service for Cubans called ZunZuneo initially based on mobile phone text message service and later with an internet interface The service was funded by the U S Agency for International Development through its Office of Transition Initiatives who utilized contractors and front companies in the Cayman Islands Spain and Ireland A longer term objective was to organize smart mobs that might renegotiate the balance of power between the state and society A database about the subscribers was created including gender age and political tendencies At its peak ZunZuneo had Cuban users but the service closed as financially unsustainable when U S funding was stopped br br br In politics br br Text messaging has affected the political world American campaigns find that text messaging is a much easier cheaper way of getting to the voters than the door to door approach In Mexico s then president elect Felipe Calder n launched millions of text messages in the days immediately preceding his narrow win over Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador In January Joseph Estrada was forced to resign from the post of president of the Philippines The popular campaign against him was widely reported to have been coordinated with SMS chain letters A massive texting campaign was credited with boosting youth turnout in Spain s parliamentary elections In Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and his Chief of Staff at the time became entangled in a sex scandal stemming from the exchange of over text messages that eventually led to his forced resignation the conviction of perjury and other charges br Text messaging has been used to turn down other political leaders During the U S Democratic and Republican National Conventions protesters used an SMS based organizing tool called TXTmob to get to opponents In the last day before the presidential elections in Romania a message against Adrian N stase was largely circulated thus breaking the laws that prohibited campaigning that day Text messaging has helped politics by promoting campaigns br On January President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines became the first head of state in history to lose power to a smart mob More than one million Manila residents assembled at the site of the People Power peaceful demonstrations that have toppled the Marcos regime These people have organized themselves and coordinated their actions through text messaging They were able to bring down a government without having to use any weapons or violence Through text messaging their plans and ideas were communicated to others and successfully implemented Also this move encouraged the military to withdraw their support from the regime and as a result the Estrada government fell People were able to converge and unite with the use of their cell phones The rapid assembly of the anti Estrada crowd was a hallmark of early smart mob technology and the millions of text messages exchanged by the demonstrators in was by all accounts a key to the crowds esprit de corps br br br Use in healthcare br br Text messaging is a rapidly growing trend in Healthcare A randomized controlled trial of text messaging intervention for diabetes in Bangladesh was one of the first robust trials to report improvement in diabetes management in a low and middle income country A recent systematic review and individual participants data meta analysis from participants reported that mobile phone text messaging could improve blood pressure and body mass index Another study in people with type diabetes showed that participants were willing to pay a modest amount to receive a diabetes text messaging program in addition to standard care One survey found that of physicians text other physicians about work similar to the overall percentage of the population that texts A study of reminder messages sent to children and adolescents with type diabetes mellitus showed favorable changes in adherence to treatment A risk is that these physicians could be violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Where messages could be saved to a phone indefinitely patient information could be subject to theft or loss and could be seen by other unauthorized persons The HIPAA privacy rule requires that any text message involving a medical decision must be available for the patient to access meaning that any texts that are not documented in an EMR system could be a HIPAA violation br br br Medical concerns br br The excessive use of the thumb for pressing keys on mobile devices has led to a high rate of a form of repetitive strain injury termed BlackBerry thumb although this refers to strain developed on older Blackberry devices which had a scroll wheel on the side of the phone An inflammation of the tendons in the thumb caused by constant text messaging is also called text messager s thumb or texting tenosynovitis Texting has also been linked as a secondary source in numerous traffic collisions in which police investigations of mobile phone records have found that many drivers have lost control of their cars while attempting to send or retrieve a text message Increasing cases of Internet addiction are now also being linked to text messaging as mobile phones are now more likely to have e mail and Web capabilities to complement the ability to text br br br Etiquette br Texting etiquette refers to what is considered appropriate texting behaviour These expectations may concern different areas such as the context in which a text was sent and received read who each participant was with when the participant sent or received read a text message or what constitutes impolite text messages At the website of The Emily Post Institute the topic of texting has spurred several articles with the do s and dont s regarding the new form of communication One example from the site is Keep your message brief No one wants to have an entire conversation with you by texting when you could just call him or her instead Another example is Don t use all Caps Typing a text message in all capital letters will appear as though you are shouting at the recipient and should be avoided br Expectations for etiquette may differ depending on various factors For example expectations for appropriate behaviour have been found to differ markedly between the U S and India Another example is generational differences In The M Factor How the Millennial Generation Is Rocking the Workplace Lynne Lancaster and David Stillman note that younger Americans often do not consider it rude to answer their cell or begin texting in the middle of a face to face conversation with someone else while older people less used to the behavior and the accompanying lack of eye contact or attention find this to be disruptive and ill mannered With regard to texting in the workplace Plantronics studied how we communicate at work and found that of US knowledge workers have increased the use of text messaging for work in the past five years The same study found that of knowledge workers felt text messaging was critical or very important to success and productivity at work br br br Typing

indicator for which patents have been filed since the s br br br Challenges br br br Spam br br In an increasing trend towards spamming mobile phone users through SMS prompted cellular service carriers to take steps against the practice before it became a widespread problem No major spamming incidents involving SMS had been reported as of March but the existence of mobile phone spam has been noted by industry watchdogs including Consumer Reports magazine and the Utility Consumers Action Network UCAN In UCAN brought a case against Sprint for spamming its customers and charging per text message The case was settled in with Sprint agreeing not to send customers Sprint advertisements via SMS SMS expert Acision formerly LogicaCMG Telecoms reported a new type of SMS malice at the end of noting the first instances of SMiShing a cousin to e mail phishing scams In SMiShing users receive SMS messages posing to be from a company enticing users to phone premium rate numbers or reply with personal information Similar concerns were reported by PhonepayPlus a consumer watchdog in the United Kingdom in br br br Pricing concerns br Concerns have been voiced over the excessive cost of off plan text messaging in the United States AT T Mobility along with most other service providers charges texters cents per message if they do not have a messaging plan or if they have exceeded their allotted number of texts Given that an SMS message is at most bytes in size this cost scales to a cost of per megabyte sent via text message This is in sharp contrast with the price of unlimited data plans offered by the same carriers which allow the transmission of hundreds of megabytes of data for monthly prices of about to in addition to a voice plan As a comparison a one minute phone call uses up the same amount of network capacity as text messages meaning that if the same cost per traffic formula were applied to phone calls cell phone calls would cost per minute With service providers gaining more customers and expanding their capacity their overhead costs should be decreasing not increasing In text messaging generated nearly billion dollars in revenue as reported by Gartner industry analysts three times as much as Hollywood box office sales in World figures showed that over a trillion text messages were sent in br Although major cellphone providers deny any collusion fees for out of package text messages have increased doubling from to cents in the United States between and alone On July Senate hearings were held to look into any breach of the Sherman Antitrust Act The same trend is visible in other countries though increasingly widespread flat rate plans for example in Germany do make text messaging easier text messages sent abroad still result in higher costs br br br Increasing competition br While text messaging is still a growing market traditional SMS is becoming increasingly challenged by alternative messaging services which are available on smartphones with data connections These services are much cheaper and offer more functionality like exchanging multimedia content e g photos videos or audio notes and group messaging Especially in western countries some of these services attract more and more users Prominent examples of these include Apple s iMessage exclusive to the Apple ecosystem and Google s RCS br In trillion SMS messages were sent globally compared to trillion for WhatsApp alone br br br Security concerns br Experts have advised business users not to use consumer SMS for confidential communication The contents of common SMS messages are known to the network operator s systems and personnel Therefore consumer SMS is not an appropriate technology for secure communications To address this issue many companies use an SMS gateway provider based on SS connectivity to route the messages The advantage of this international termination model is the ability to route data directly through SS which gives the provider visibility of the complete path of the SMS This means SMS messages can be sent directly to and from recipients without having to go through the SMS C of other mobile operators This approach reduces the number of mobile operators that handle the message however experts have advised not to consider it as an end to end secure communication as the content of the message is exposed to the SMS gateway provider br An alternative approach is to use end to end security software that runs on both the sending and receiving device where the original text message is transmitted in encrypted form as a consumer SMS By using key rotation the encrypted text messages stored under data retention laws at the network operator cannot be decrypted even if one of the devices is compromised A problem with this approach is that communicating devices needs to run compatible software Failure rates without backward notification can be high between carriers International texting can be unreliable depending on the country of origin destination and respective operators Differences in the character sets used for coding can cause a text message sent from one country to another to become unreadable br br br In popular culture br br br Records and competition br The Guinness Book of World Records has a world record for text messaging currently held by Sonja Kristiansen of Norway Kristiansen keyed in the official text message as established by Guinness in seconds The message is The razor toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world In

applications available for some mobile phones that allow Morse input for short messages br br br Tattle texting br Tattle texting can mean either of two different texting trends br br br Arena security br Many sports arenas now offer a number where patrons can text report security concerns like drunk or unruly fans or safety issues like spills These programs have been praised by patrons and security personnel as more effective than traditional methods For instance the patron doesn t need to leave his seat and miss the event in order to report something important Also disruptive fans can be reported with relative anonymity Text tattling also gives security personnel a useful tool to prioritize messages For instance a single complaint in one section about an unruly fan can be addressed when convenient while multiple complaints by several different patrons can be acted upon immediately br br br Smart cars br In this context tattle texting refers to an automatic text sent by the computer in an automobile because a preset condition was met The most common use for this is for parents to receive texts from the car their child is driving alerting them to speeding or other issues Employers can also use the service to monitor their corporate vehicles The technology is still new and currently only available on a few car models br Common conditions that can be chosen to send a text are br br Speeding With the use of GPS stored maps and speed limit information the onboard computer can determine if the driver is exceeding the current speed limit The device can store this information and or send it to another recipient br Range Parents employers can set a maximum range from a fixed location after which a tattle text is sent Not only can this keep children close to home
