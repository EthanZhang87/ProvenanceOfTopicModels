literature cooking weapons music history anime fitness politics and sports among others Registration is not available and users typically post anonymously As of chan receives more than million unique monthly visitors of which approximately half are from the United States br chan was created as an unofficial English language counterpart to the Japanese imageboard Futaba Channel also known as chan and its first boards were originally used for posting images and discussion related to anime The site has been described as a hub of Internet subculture its community being influential in the formation and popularization of prominent Internet memes such as lolcats Rickrolling rage comics wojaks Pepe the Frog as well as hacktivist and political movements such as Anonymous and the alt right chan has often been the subject of media attention as a source of controversies including the coordination of pranks and harassment against websites and Internet users and the posting of illegal and offensive content as a result of its lax censorship and moderation policies In The Guardian summarized the chan community as lunatic juvenile brilliant ridiculous and alarming br br br Background br br The majority of posting on chan takes place on imageboards on which users have the ability to share images and create threaded discussions As of August the site s homepage lists imageboards and one Flash animation board Most boards have their own set of rules and are dedicated to a specific topic including anime and manga video games music literature fitness politics and sports among others Uniquely the Random board also known as b enforces few rules br chan is the Internet s most trafficked imageboard according to the Los Angeles Times chan s Alexa rank was on March though it has been as high as It is provided to its users free of charge and consumes a large amount of bandwidth as a result its financing has often been problematic Poole has acknowledged that donations alone could not keep the site online and turned to advertising to help make ends meet However the explicit content hosted on chan has deterred businesses who do not want to be associated with the site s content In January Poole signed a new deal with an advertising company in February he was in debt and the site was continuing to lose money The chan servers were moved from Texas to California in August which upgraded the maximum bandwidth throughput of chan from Mbit s to Gbit s br Unlike most web forums chan does not have a registration system allowing users to post anonymously Posting is ephemeral as threads receiving recent replies are bumped to the top of their respective board and old threads are deleted as new ones are created Any nickname may be used when posting even one that has been previously adopted such as Anonymous or moot In place of registration chan has provided tripcodes as an optional form of authenticating a poster s identity As making a post without filling in the Name field causes posts to be attributed to Anonymous general understanding on chan holds that Anonymous is not a single person but a collective hive of users Moderators generally post without a name even when performing sysop actions A capcode may be used to attribute the post to Anonymous Mod although moderators often post without the capcode In a interview on Nico Nico Douga Poole explained that there are approximately volunteer moderators active on chan chan also has a junior moderation team called janitors who may delete posts or images and suggest that the normal moderation team ban a user but who cannot post with a capcode Revealing oneself as a janitor is grounds for immediate dismissal br chan has been the target of occasional denial of service attacks For instance on December chan and other websites went down due to such an attack following which Poole said on his blog We now join the ranks of MasterCard Visa PayPal etc and is an exclusive club br br br History br The site was launched as chan net on October by Christopher Poole a then year old student from New York City using the online handle moot Poole had been a regular participant on Something Awful s subforum Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse ADTRW where many users were familiar with the Japanese imageboard format and Futaba Channel chan net When creating chan Poole obtained Futaba Channel s open source code and translated the Japanese text into English using AltaVista s Babel Fish online translator After the site s creation Poole invited users from the ADTRW subforum many of whom were dissatisfied with the site s moderation to visit chan which he advertised as an English language counterpart to Futaba Channel and a place for Western fans to discuss anime and manga At its founding the site only hosted one board b Anime Random br Before the end of several new anime related boards were added including h Hentai c Anime Cute d Hentai Alternative w Wallpapers Anime y Yaoi and a Anime In the early days of the website Poole hosted meetings from to in various locations to promote it such as Otakon that popularized some of the first chan related memes br Additionally a lolicon board was created at l Lolikon but was disabled following the posting of genuine child pornography and ultimately deleted in October after threats of legal action In February GoDaddy suspended the chan net domain prompting Poole to move the site to its current domain at chan org On March Poole announced that he lacked the funds to pay the month s server bill but was able to continue operations after receiving a swarm of donations from users In June chan experienced six weeks of downtime due to PayPal suspending chan s donations service after receiving complaints about the site s content br Following chan s return several non anime related boards were introduced including k Weapons o Auto and v Video Games In nine new boards were created including the sports board at sp the fashion board at fa and the Japan General the name later changed to Otaku Culture board at jp By this point chan s culture had altered moving away from the early more childish humour as evident by the likes of Project Chanology trolling underwent a so called golden age that took aim at American corporate media br br In January Poole announced the deletion of the r k ROBOT and new News boards saying that new had become devoted to racist discussions and r k no longer served its original purpose of being a test implementation of xkcd s ROBOT script During the same year the soc board was created in an effort to reduce the number of socialization threads on b r k was restored on October along with hc Hardcore previously deleted pol a rebranding of new and the new diy board in addition to an apology by Poole where he recalls how he criticized the deletion of Encyclopedia Dramatica and realized that he had done the same br In chan had implemented reCAPTCHA in an effort to thwart spam arising from JavaScript worms By November chan made the transition to utilizing Cloudflare following a series of DDoS attacks The chan imageboards were rewritten in valid HTML CSS in May in an effort to improve client side performance On September chan introduced a chan pass that when purchased allows users to bypass typing a reCAPTCHA verification when posting and reporting posts on the chan image boards the money raised from the passes to go towards supporting the site br br On January Poole stepped down as the site s administrator citing stress from controversies such as Gamergate as the reason for his departure On September Poole announced that Hiroyuki Nishimura had purchased from him the ownership rights to chan without disclosing the terms of the acquisition Nishimura was the former administrator of channel between and the website forming the basis for anonymous posting culture which influenced later websites such as Futaba Channel and chan Nishimura lost channel s domain after it was seized by his registrar Jim Watkins due the latter s alleged financial difficulties Wired later reported that Japanese toy manufacturer Good Smile Company Japanese telecommunication Dwango and Nishimura s company Future Search Brazil may have helped facilitate Nishimura s purchase with anonymous sources telling the publication that Good Smile obtained partial ownership in the website as compensation br In October it was reported that the site was facing financial difficulties that could lead to its closure or radical changes In a post titled Winter is Coming Hiroyuki Nishimura explained We had tried to keep chan as is But I failed I am sincerely sorry citing server costs infrastructure costs and network fees br On November it was announced that the site would be split into two with the work safe boards moved to a new domain channel org while the NSFW boards would remain on the chan org domain In a series of posts on the topic Nishimura explained that the split was due to chan being blacklisted by most advertising companies and that the new channel domain would allow for the site to receive advertisements by mainstream ad providers All boards returned to the chan org domain in December for unknown reasons and channel org now redirects to chan org br In a interview with Vice Media several current or past moderators spoke about what they perceived as racist intent behind the site s management They alleged that a managing moderator named RapeApe was attempting to use the site as a recruitment tool for the alt right and that Nishimura was hands off leaving moderation of the site primarily to RapeApe Neither Nishimura nor RapeApe responded to these allegations Far right extremism has been reported by public authorities commentators and civil society groups as connected in part to chan an association that had arisen by According to chan s filings to the New York Attorney General s Office chan signed an agreement to pay RapeApe a month for their services in By May that fee had risen to a month The submitted documents also revealed RapeApe lamenting that chan was getting the shaft over the Buffalo terrorist attack and his attempt to persuade the advertising platform Bid Glass to reverse their exit from the website br br br Christopher Poole br Poole kept his real life identity hidden until it was revealed on July in The Wall Street Journal Prior to that he had used the alias moot br In April Poole was voted the world s most influential person of by an open Internet poll conducted by Time magazine The results were questioned even before the poll completed as automated voting programs and manual ballot stuffing were used to influence the vote chan s interference with the vote seemed increasingly likely when it was found that reading the first letter of the first candidates in the poll spelled out a phrase containing two chan memes mARBLECAKE ALSO THE GAME br On September Poole gave a talk on why chan has a reputation as a Meme Factory at the Paraflows Symposium in Vienna Austria which was part of the Paraflows festival themed Urban Hacking In this talk Poole mainly attributed this to the anonymous system and to the lack of data retention on the site The site has no memory br In April Poole gave evidence in the trial United States of America v David Kernell as a government witness As a witness he explained the terminology used on chan to the prosecutor ranging from OP to lurker He also explained to the court the nature of the data given to the FBI as part of the search warrant including how users can be uniquely identified from site audit logs br br br Notable boards br br br b br br The random board b follows the design of Futaba Channel s Nijiura Random board It was the first board created and has been described as chan s most popular board accounting for of site traffic in Gawker s Nick Douglas summarized b as a board where people try to shock entertain and coax free porn from each other b has a no rules policy except for bans on certain illegal content such as child pornography invasions of other websites posting floods of disruptive content and under viewing all of which are inherited from site wide rules The no invasions rule was added in late after b users spent most of that summer invading Habbo Hotel The no rules policy also applies to actions of administrators and moderators which means that users may be banned at any time for any reason including for no reason at all Due partially to its anonymous nature board moderation is not always successful indeed the site s anti child pornography rule is a subject of jokes on b Christopher Poole told The New York Times in a discussion on the moderation of b that the power lies in the community to dictate its own standards and that site staff simply provided a framework br The humor of b s many users who refer to themselves as b tards is often incomprehensible to newcomers and outsiders and is characterized by intricate inside jokes and dark comedy Users often refer to each other and much of the outside world as fags They are often referred to by outsiders as trolls who regularly act with the intention of doing it for the lulz a corruption of LOL used to denote amusement at another s expense A significant amount of media coverage is in response to b s culture which has characterised it as adolescent crude and spiteful with one publication writing that their bad behavior is encouraged by the site s total anonymity and the absence of an archive Douglas cited Encyclopedia Dramatica s definition of b as the asshole of the Internets sic Mattathias Schwartz of The New York Times likened b to a high school bathroom stall or an obscene telephone party line while Baltimore City Paper wrote that in the high school of the Internet b is the kid with a collection of butterfly knives and a locker full of porn Wired describes b as notorious br Each post is assigned a post number Certain post numbers are sought after with a large amount of posting taking place to GET them A GET occurs when a post s number ends in a special number such as or every millionth post A sign of chan s scaling according to Poole was when GETs lost meaning due to the high post rate resulting in a GET occurring every few weeks He estimated b s post rate in July to be posts per day br br br mlp br br mlp is chan s Pony board which is dedicated to the discussion of Hasbro s My Little Pony franchise particularly the animated television series My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic and its spin offs While discussion of the

related threads and images may only be posted on mlp br First proposed in early the Pony Preservation Project is a collaborative effort by mlp to build and curate pony datasets with the aim of creating applications in artificial intelligence The developer of the popular text to speech web application ai has worked closely with the Pony Preservation Project The Friendship Is Magic voices on ai were trained on a large dataset crowdsourced by the Pony Preservation Project audio and dialogue from the show and related media including all nine seasons of Friendship Is Magic the movie spinoffs leaks and various other content voiced by the same voice actors were parsed hand transcribed and processed to remove background noise by the contributors of the Pony Preservation Project According to the developer the collective efforts and constructive criticism from the Pony Preservation Project have been integral to the development of ai br br br mu br The music board mu is dedicated to the discussion of music artists albums genres instruments Described as chan s best kept secret and a surprisingly artistic side of chan mu is used by users to share their music interests with similar minds and discover great music they would never have found otherwise with many moments of insightful candor that can affirm or challenge their own musical tastes The board has gained notoriety for earnestly focusing upon and promoting challenging and otherwise obscure music Some common genres discussed on mu include shoegaze experimental hip hop witch house IDM midwest emo vaporwave and K pop There is a significant overlap between user bases of mu and music site Rate Your Music The board s culture has inspired many online music communities and meme pages on social media that emulate mu s posting style br Publications such as Pitchfork and Entertainment Weekly noted the board played a significant role in popularizing various music artists such as Death Grips Neutral Milk Hotel Car Seat Headrest and Have a Nice Life Prominent music critic Anthony Fantano began his career on mu and developed a significant following there Some artists like Zeal Ardor and Conrad Tao admitted to posting their music anonymously on mu to get honest feedback as well as find inspiration from the board In particular Zeal Ardor said their sound which mixes black metal with spirituals came from suggestions by two users Andrew W K did a Q A with the board s users in causing the servers to crash from the increased traffic Death Grips seeded various clues on mu in about their then upcoming albums The Money Store and No Love Deep Web A rendition of Royals by Lorde appeared on mu in before its official release although she denied ever writing on the board in Singer Lauren Mayberry shared on Twitter in a link to a thread on mu about her band s song Leave a Trace to showcase what online misogyny looks like An alleged unreleased Radiohead song titled Putting Ketchup in the Fridge and How Do You Sit Still was initially reported as genuine by NME and Spin until CNN revealed it was a hoax promoted by the board s users br The board has been acknowledged for sharing rare music recordings and unreleased materials as well as finding albums thought to be lost Notable examples include the works of Duster D E A T H M E T A L by Panchiko and All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling by Godspeed You Black Emperor This was described by NPR as resembling a secret club of preservationists obsessed with the articulation of a near dead language The board has attracted further attention

recurring dream from one of the board s users A role playing game based on Neutral Milk Hotel s In the Aeroplane Over the Sea designed with help from the board s users received coverage from Polygon

speech contributing The board quickly attracted posters with a political persuasion that later would be described with a new term the alt right Media sources have characterized pol as predominantly racist and sexist with many of its posts taking an explicitly neo Nazi bent The site s far reaching culture of vitriolic and discriminatory content is most closely associated with pol although only it features predominant Alt Right beliefs pol like other boards has been prominent in the dissemination of memes in cases featuring coordination to disperse Alt Right sentiments pol increasingly became synonymous with chan as a whole The Southern Poverty Law Center regards pol s rhetorical style as widely emulated by white supremacist websites such as The Daily Stormer the Stormer s editor Andrew Anglin concurred pol was where screenshots of Trayvon Martin s hacked social media accounts were initially posted The board s users have started antifeminist homophobic transphobic and anti Arab Twitter campaigns br Many pol users favored Donald Trump during his United States presidential campaign Both Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr appeared to acknowledge the support by tweeting pol
