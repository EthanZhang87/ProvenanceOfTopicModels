newspapers TV and radio broadcasting in many ways including quality reach frequency usability relevancy and permanence Social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system many sources to many receivers while traditional media operate under a monologic transmission model one source to many receivers For instance a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to a city br Social media has been criticized for a range of negative impacts on children and teenagers including exposure to inappropriate content exploitation by adults sleep problems attention problems feelings of exclusion and various mental health maladies Social media has also received criticism as worsening political polarization and undermining democracy br br br History br br br Early computing br The PLATO system was launched in at the University of Illinois and subsequently commercially marketed by Control Data Corporation It offered early forms of social media features with innovations such as Notes PLATO s message forum application TERM talk its instant messaging feature Talkomatic perhaps the first online chat room News Report a crowdsourced online newspaper and blog and Access Lists enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users for example only friends classmates or co workers br br ARPANET which came online in had by the late s enabled exchange of non government business ideas and communication as evidenced by the network etiquette or netiquette described in a handbook on computing at MIT s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ARPANET evolved into the Internet in the s Usenet conceived by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis in at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University was the first open social media app established in br br A precursor of the electronic bulletin board system BBS known as Community Memory appeared by Mainstream BBSs arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago which launched on February Before long most major US cities had more than one BBS running on TRS Apple II Atari IBM PC Commodore Sinclair and similar personal computers CompuServe Prodigy and AOL were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the s Between the mid s and the mid s BBSes numbered in the tens of thousands in North America alone Message forums were the signature BBS phenomenon throughout the s and early s br In Tim Berners Lee integrated HTML hypertext software with the Internet creating the World Wide Web This breakthrough led to an explosion of blogs list servers and email services Message forums migrated to the web and evolved into Internet forums supported by cheaper access as well as the ability to handle far more people simultaneously br These early text based systems expanded to include images and video in the st century aided by digital cameras and camera phones br br br Social media platforms br br The evolution of online services progressed from serving as channels for networked communication to becoming interactive platforms for networked social interaction with the advent of Web br Social media started in the mid s with the invention of platforms like GeoCities Classmates com and SixDegrees com While instant messaging and chat clients existed at the time SixDegrees was unique as it was the first online service designed for people to connect using their actual names instead of anonymously It boasted features like profiles friends lists and school affiliations making it the very first social networking site The platform s name was inspired by the six degrees of separation concept which suggests that every person on the planet is just six connections away from everyone else br In the early s social media platforms gained widespread popularity with the likes of Friendster and Myspace followed by Facebook YouTube and Twitter br Research from reported that globally users spent of their online time on social networks likely fueled by the availability of smartphones As of as many as billion people used social media some of the global population br br br Definition br A review identified four features unique to social media services br br Web Internet based applications br User generated content br User created self profiles br Social networks formed by connections between profiles such as followers groups and lists br In Merriam Webster defined social media as forms of electronic communication such as websites for social networking and microblogging through which users create online communities to share information ideas personal messages and other content such as videos br br br Services br Social media encompasses

br Some services offer more than one type of service br br br Mobile social media br Mobile social media refers to the use of social media on mobile devices such as phones and tablets It is distinguished by its ubiquity since users no longer have to be at a desk in order to participate on a computer Mobile services can further make use of the user s immediate location to offer information connections or services relevant to that location br According to Andreas Kaplan mobile social media activities fall among four types br br Space timers location and time sensitive Exchange of messages with relevance for a specific location at a specific point in time posting about a traffic jam br Space locators only location sensitive Posts messages with relevance for a specific location read later by others e g a restaurant review br Quick timers only time sensitive Transfer of traditional social media mobile apps to increase immediacy e g posting status updates br Slow timers neither location nor time sensitive Transfer of traditional social media applications to mobile devices e g watching a video br br br Elements and function br br br Virality br br Certain content has the potential to spread virally an analogy for the way viral infections spread contagiously from individual to individual One user spreads a post across their network which leads those users to follow suit A post from a relatively unknown user can reach vast numbers of people within hours Virality is not guaranteed few posts make the transition br Viral marketing campaigns are particularly attractive to businesses because they can achieve widespread advertising coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing campaigns Nonprofit organizations and activists may also attempt to spread content virally br Social media sites provide specific functionality to help users re share content such as X s and Facebook s like option br br br Bots br br Bots are automated programs that operate on the internet They automate many communication tasks This has led to the creation of an industry of bot providers br Chatbots and social bots are programmed to mimic human interactions such as liking commenting and following Bots have also been developed to facilitate social media marketing Bots have led the marketing industry into an analytical crisis as bots make it difficult to differentiate between human interactions and bot interactions Some bots violate platforms terms of use which can result in bans and campaigns to eliminate bots categorically Bots may even pose as real people to avoid prohibitions br Cyborgs either bot assisted humans or human assisted bots are used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes from spreading fake news to creating marketing buzz A common use claimed to be legitimate includes posting at a specific time A human writes a post content and the bot posts it a specific time In other cases cyborgs spread fake news Cyborgs may work as sock puppets where one human pretends to be someone else or operates multiple accounts each pretending to be a person br br br Patents br br A multitude of United States patents are related to social media growing rapidly As of over social media patent applications had been published in the United States Only slightly over patents had been issued br br br Platform convergence br br As an instance of technological convergence various social media platforms adapted functionality beyond their original scope increasingly overlapping with each other br Examples are the social hub site Facebook launching an integrated video platform in May and Instagram whose original scope was low resolution photo sharing introducing the ability to share quarter minute pixel videos late extended to a minute with increased resolution Instagram later implemented stories short videos self destructing after hours a concept popularized by Snapchat as well as IGTV for seekable videos Stories were then adopted by YouTube br X whose original scope was text based microblogging later adopted photo sharing then video sharing then a media studio for business users after YouTube s Creator Studio br The discussion platform Reddit added an integrated image hoster replacing the external image sharing platform Imgur and then an internal video hosting service followed by image galleries multiple images in a single post known from Imgur Imgur implemented video sharing br YouTube rolled out a Community feature for sharing text only posts and polls br br br Usage statistics br br According to Statista it is estimated that in around billion people were using social media globally This number is up from billion in br The following is a list of the most popular social networking services based on the number of active users as of January per Statista br br br Usage before the pandemic br A study suggested that individual differences may help explain who uses social media extraversion and openness have a positive relationship with social media while emotional stability has a negative sloping relationship with social media A study reported that people with a higher social comparison orientation appear to use social media more heavily than people with low social comparison orientation br Common Sense Media reported that children under age in the United States use social networking services although many social media sites require users to be or older In the firm conducted a survey of parents of children from birth to age and reported that of children at this age used social media sites such as Instagram Snapchat or now defunct Musical ly often or sometimes Their survey surveyed Americans ages and reported that about of children ages use social media In that survey teens aged were asked when they started using social media the median age was although said they started to use it before reaching br br br Usage during the pandemic br br br Usage by minors br Social media played a role in communication during the COVID pandemic In June a survey by Cartoon Network and the Cyberbullying Research Center surveyed Americans tweens ages and reported that the most popular application was YouTube as age increased tweens were more likely to have used social media apps and games Similarly Common Sense Media s survey of Americans ages reported that YouTube was the most popular used by of to year olds As children aged they increasingly utilized social media services and often used YouTube to consume content br br br Reasons for use by adults br While adults were using social media before the COVID pandemic more started using it to stay socially connected and to get pandemic updates Social media have become popularly use to seek for medical information and have fascinated the general public to collect information regarding corona virus pandemics in various perspectives During these days people are forced to stay at home and the social media have connected and supported awareness and pandemic updates Healthcare workers and systems became more aware of social media as a place people were getting health information During the COVID pandemic social media use has accelerated to the point of becoming a ubiquitous part of modern healthcare systems This also led to the spread of disinformation On December the CDC put out a Call to Action Managing the Infodemic Some healthcare organizations used hashtags as interventions and published articles on their Twitter data Promotion of the joint usage of PedsICU and COVID throughout the international pediatric critical care community in tweets relevant to the coronavirus disease pandemic and pediatric critical care However others in the medical community were concerned about social media addiction as it became an increasingly important context and therefore source of social validation and reinforcement and were unsure whether increased social media use was harmful br br br Timeline of social media br br br Use by organizations br br br Government br Governments may use social media to for example br br inform their opinions to public br interact with citizens br foster citizen participation br further open government br analyze monitor public opinion and activities br educate the public about risks and public health br br br Law enforcement br Social media has been used extensively in civil and criminal investigations It has also been used to search for missing persons Police departments often make use of official social media accounts to engage with the public publicize police activity and burnish law enforcement s image conversely video footage of citizen documented police brutality and other misconduct has sometimes been posted to social media br In the United States U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement identifies and track individuals via social media and has apprehended some people via social media based sting operations U S Customs and Border Protection also known as CPB and the United States Department of Homeland Security use social media data as influencing factors during the visa process and monitor individuals after they have entered the country CPB officers have also been documented performing searches of electronics and social media behavior at the border searching both citizens and non citizens without first obtaining a warrant br br br Reputation management br As social media gained momentum among the younger generations governments began using it to improve their image especially among the youth In January Egyptian authorities were reported to be using Instagram influencers as part of its media ambassadors program The program was designed to revamp Egypt s image and to counter the bad press Egypt had received because of the country s human rights record Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates participated in similar programs Similarly Dubai has extensively relied on social media and influencers to promote tourism However Dubai laws have kept these influencers within limits to not offend the authorities or to criticize the city politics or religion The content of these foreign influencers is controlled to make sure that nothing portrays Dubai in a negative light br br br Business br br Many businesses use social media for marketing branding advertising communication sales promotions informal employee learning organizational development competitive analysis recruiting relationship management loyalty programs and e Commerce Companies use social media monitoring tools to monitor track and analyze conversations to aid in their marketing sales and other programs Tools range from free basic applications to subscription based tools Social media offers information on industry trends Within the finance industry companies use social media as a tool for analyzing market sentiment These range from marketing financial products market trends and as a tool to identify insider trading To exploit these opportunities businesses need guidelines for use on each platform br Business use of social media is complicated by the fact that the business does not fully control its social media presence Instead it makes its case by participating in the conversation Business uses social media on a customer organizational level and an intra organizational level br Social media can encourage entrepreneurship and innovation by highlighting successes and by easing access to resources that might not otherwise be readily available known br br br Marketing br br Social media marketing can help promote a product or service and establish connections with customers Social media marketing can be divided into paid media earned media and owned media Using paid social media firms run advertising on a social media platform Earned social media appears when firms do something that impresses stakeholders and they spontaneously post content about it Owned social media is the platform markets itself by creating promoting content to its users br Primary uses are to create brand awareness engage customers by conversation e g customers provide feedback on the firm and providing access to customer service Social media s peer to peer communication shifts power from the organization to consumers since consumer content is widely visible and not controlled by the company br Social media personalities often referred to as influencers are internet celebrities who are sponsored by marketers to promote products and companies online Research reports that these endorsements attract the attention of users who have not settled on which products services to buy especially younger consumers The practice of harnessing influencers to market or promote a product or service to their following is commonly referred to as influencer marketing br In the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority ASA began advising celebrities to make it clear whether they had been paid to recommend a product or service by using the hashtag spon or ad when endorsing The US Federal Trade Commission issued similar guidelines br Social media platforms also enable targeting specific audiences with advertising Users of social media can share and comment on the advertisement turning passive consumers into active promoters and even producers Targeting requires extra effort by advertisers to understand how to reach the right users Companies can use humor such as shitposting to poke fun at competitors Advertising can even inspire fanart which can engage new audiences Hashtags such as ejuice and eliquid are one way to target interested users br User content can trigger peer effects increasing consumer interest even without influencer involvement A study focused on this communication reported that communication among peers can affect purchase intentions direct impact through encouraging conformity and an indirect impact by increasing product engagement This study claimed that peer communication about a product increased product engagement br br br Politics br br Social media have a range of uses in politics Politicians use social media to spread their messages and influence voters br Dounoucos et al reported that Twitter use by candidates was unprecedented during the US election The public increased its reliance on social media sites for political information In the European Union social media amplified political messages Foreign originated social media campaigns attempt to influence political opinion in another country br br br Activism br br Social media was influential in the Arab Spring in However debate persists about the extent to which social media facilitated this Activists have used social media to report the abuse of human rights in Bahrain They publicized the brutality of government authorities who they claimed were detaining torturing and threatening individuals Conversely Bahrain s government used social media to track and target activists The government stripped citizenship from over activists as punishment br Militant groups use social media as an organizing and recruiting tool Islamic State also known as ISIS used social media In AllEyesonISIS went viral on Arabic X br br br Propaganda br br br Recruiting br br br Science br Scientists use social media to share their scientific knowledge and research on platforms such as ResearchGate LinkedIn Facebook X and Academia edu The most common platforms are X and blogs The use of social media reportedly has improved the interaction between scientists reporters and the general public Over opinions were shared on X related to science between September and August Science related blogs respond to and motivate public interest in learning following and discussing science Posts can be written quickly and allow the reader to interact in real time with authors One study in the context of climate change reported that climate scientists and scientific institutions played a minimal role in online debate exceeded by nongovernmental organizations br br br Academia br Academicians use social media activity to assess academic publications to measure public sentiment identify influencer accounts or crowdsource ideas or solutions br br br School admissions br In some places students have been forced to surrender their social media passwords to school administrators Few laws protect student s social media privacy Organizations such as the ACLU call for more privacy protection They urge students who are pressured to give up their account information to resist br br Colleges and universities may access applicants internet services including social media profiles as part of their admissions process According to Kaplan Inc a corporation that provides higher education preparation in of admissions officers used Google to learn more about an applicant with checking Facebook Students whose social media pages include questionable material may be disqualified from admission processes One survey in July by the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers reported that percent of respondents said they had refused to admit an applicant based on social media content This includes percent of public institutions where the First Amendment applies The survey reported that percent of institutions acknowledged reviewing the personal social media accounts of applicants at least some of the time br br br Court cases br Social media comments and images have been used in court cases including employment law child custody child support and disability claims After an Apple employee criticized his employer on Facebook he was fired When the former employee sued Apple for unfair dismissal the court after examining the employee s Facebook posts reported in favor of Apple stating that the posts breached Apple s policies After a couple broke up the man posted song lyrics that talked about fantasies of killing the rapper s ex wife and made threats A court reported him guilty In a disability claims case a woman who fell at work claimed that she was permanently injured the employer used her social media posts to counter her claims br Courts do not always admit social media evidence in part because screenshots can be faked or tampered with Judges may consider emojis into account to assess statements made on social media in one Michigan case where a person alleged that another person had defamed them in an online comment the judge disagreed noting that an emoji after the comment that indicated that it was a joke In a case in Ontario against a police officer regarding alleged assault of a protester during the G summit the court rejected the Crown s application to use a digital photo of the protest that was anonymously posted online because it included no metadata verifying its provenance br br br Use by individuals br br br News source br br br Social tool br Social media are used to socialize with friends and family pursue romance and flirt but not all social needs can be fulfilled by social media For example a article reported that lonely individuals are more likely to use the Internet for emotional support than others A survey from Common Sense Media reported that of American teens ages thought that social media was extremely or very important for them to connect with their friends The same survey reported that of teens said social media was extremely or very important to conduct meaningful conversations with close friends and of teens said social media was extremely or very important to document and share their lives A Gallup poll reported that of adult social media users in the United States thought that social media was a very or moderately important way to keep in touch with people during the COVID pandemic br In Alone Together Sherry Turkle considered how people confuse social media usage with authentic communication She claimed that people act differently online and are less concerned about hurting others feelings Some online encounters can cause stress and anxiety due to the difficulty purging online posts fear of getting hacked or of universities and employers exploring social media pages Turkle speculated that many people prefer texting to face to face communication which can contribute to loneliness Surveys from reported evidence among teens in the United States and Mexico Some researchers reported that exchanges that involved direct communication and reciprocal messages correlated with less loneliness br In social media stalking or creeping refers to looking at someone s timeline status updates tweets and online bios to find information about them and their activities A sub category of creeping is creeping ex partners after a breakup br Catfishing creating a false identity allows bad actors to exploit the lonely br br br Invidious comparison br Self presentation theory proposes that people consciously manage their self image or identity related information in social contexts One aspect of social media is the time invested in customizing a personal profile Some users segment their audiences based on the image they want to present pseudonymity and use of multiple accounts on the same platform offer that opportunity br A study reported that teenage girls manipulate their self presentation on social media to appear beautiful as viewed by their peers Teenage girls attempt to earn regard and acceptance likes comments and shares When this does no go well self confidence and self satisfaction can decline A survey of American teens ages by Common Sense Media reported that said likes are at least somewhat important and at least somewhat agreed that they feel bad about themselves if nobody responds to their photos Some evidence suggests that perceived rejection may lead to emotional pain and some may resort to online bullying according to a study users reward circuits in their brains are more active when their photos are liked by more peers br A review concluded that social media can trigger a negative feedback loop of viewing and uploading photos self comparison disappointment and disordered body perception when social success is not achieved One study reported that Pinterest is directly associated with disordered dieting behavior br People portray themselves on social media in the most appealing way However upon seeing one person s curated persona other people may question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling One study reported that problematic social media use i e feeling addicted to social media was related to lower life satisfaction and self esteem Studies have reported that social media comparisons can have dire effects on physical and mental health In one study women reported that social media was the most influential source of their body image satisfaction while men reported them as the second biggest factor While monitoring the lives of celebrities long predates social media the ease and immediacy of direct comparisons of pictures and stories with one s own may increase their impact br A study reported that of women and of men compared themselves to others on social media br Efforts to combat such negative effects focused promoting body positivity In a related study women aged were reported posts that contained side by side images of women in the same clothes and setting but one image was enhanced for Instagram while the other was an unedited realistic version Women who participated in this experiment reported a decrease in body dissatisfaction br br br Health br br br Adolescents br Social media can offer a support system for adolescent health because it allows them to mobilize around health issues that they deem relevant For example in a clinical study among adolescent patients undergoing obesity treatment participants claimed that social media allowed them to access personalized weight loss content as well as social support among other adolescents with obesity br While social media can provide health information it typically has no mechanism for ensuring the quality of that information The National Eating Disorders Association reported a high correlation between weight loss content and disorderly eating among women who have been influenced by inaccurate content Health literacy offers skills to allow users to spot avoid such content Efforts by governments and public health organizations to advance health literacy reportedly achieved limited success br Social media such as pro anorexia sites reportedly increase risk of harm by reinforcing damaging health related behaviors through social media especially among adolescents br br br Pandemic br During the coronavirus pandemic inaccurate information from all sides spread widely via social media Topics subject to distortion included treatments avoiding infection vaccination and public policy Simultaneously governments and others influenced social media platforms to suppress both accurate and inaccurate information in support of public policy Heavier social media use was reportedly associated with more acceptance of conspiracy theories leading to worse mental health and less compliance with public health recommendations br br br Addiction br Social media platforms can serve as a breeding ground for addiction related behaviors with studies report that excessive use can lead to addiction like symptoms These symptoms include compulsive checking mood modification and withdrawal when not using social media which can result in decreased face to face social interactions and contribute to the deterioration of interpersonal relationships and a sense of loneliness br br br Journalism br Journalistic influence has grown less important with the rise of social media whereas social networking sites such as Facebook YouTube and Twitter provide an alternative supply of news sources Further many users offer their own narratives about events complicating the process of unearthing the truth An example of this is the response to the Trayvon Martin shooting Media coverage of the incident was minimal until social media users elevated it Only a month later online coverage attracted national coverage from mainstream media br br br Cyberbullying br br br Sleep disturbance br A study reported on a link between sleep disturbance and the use of social media It concluded that blue light from computer phone displays and the frequency rather than the duration of time spent predicted disturbed sleep termed obsessive checking The association between social media use and sleep disturbance has clinical ramifications for young adults A recent study reported that people in the highest quartile for weekly social media use experienced the most sleep disturbance The median number of minutes of social media use per day was Females were more likely to experience high levels of sleep disturbance Many teenagers suffer from sleep deprivation from long hours at night on their phones and this left them tired and unfocused in school A study reported that time spent on Facebook was negatively associated with GPA but the association with sleep disturbance was not established br br br Emotional effects br One studied effect of social media is Facebook depression which affects adolescents who spend too much time on social media This may lead to reclusiveness which can increase loneliness and low self esteem Social media curates content to encourage users to keep scrolling Studies report children s self esteem is positively affected by positive comments and negatively affected by negative or lack of comments This affected self perception A study of almost adolescent students reported that those who self reported addiction like symptoms of social media use were more likely to report low self esteem and high levels of depressive symptoms br A second emotional effect is social media burnout defined as ambivalence emotional exhaustion and depersonalization Ambivalence is confusion about the benefits from using social media Emotional exhaustion is stress from using social media Depersonalization is emotional detachment from social media The three burnout factors negatively influence the likelihood of continuing on social media br A third emotional effect is fear of missing out FOMO which is the pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent It is associated with increased scrutiny of friends on social media br Social media can also offer support as Twitter has done for the medical community X facilitated academic discussion among health professionals and students while providing a supportive community for these individuals by and allowing members to support each other through likes comments and posts Access to social media offered a way to keep older adults connected after the deaths of partners and geographical distance between friends and loved ones br br br Social impacts and regulation br Some commentators refer to social media as anti social media when describing its social impact br br br Disparity br br br Political polarization br Many critics point to studies showing social media algorithms elevate more partisan and inflammatory content Because of recommendation algorithms that filter and display news content that matches users political preferences one potential impact is an increase in political polarization due to selective exposure Political polarization is the divergence of political attitudes towards ideological extremes Selective exposure occurs when an individual favors information that supports their beliefs and avoids information that conflicts with them Aviv Ovadya argues that these algorithms incentivize the creation of divisive content in addition to promoting existing divisive content but could be designed to reduce polarization instead br Some popular ideas for how to combat selective exposure have had no or opposite impacts Some advocate for media literacy as a solution Others argue that less social media or more local journalism could help address political polarization br br br Stereotyping br br A study reported that social media increases the power of stereotypes Stereotypes can have both negative and positive connotations For example during the COVID pandemic youth were accused of responsibility for spreading the disease Elderly people get stereotyped as lacking knowledge of proper behavior on social media br br br Communication br Social media allows for mass cultural exchange and intercultural communication despite different ways of communicating in various cultures br Social media has affected the way youth communicate by introducing new forms of language Novel acronyms save time as illustrated by LOL which is the ubiquitous shortcut for laugh out loud br The hashtag was created to simplify searching for information and to allow users to highlight topics of interest in the hope of attracting the attention of others Hashtags can be used to advocate for a movement mark content for future use and allow other users to contribute to a discussion br For some young people social media and texting have largely replaced in person communications made worse by pandemic isolation delaying the development of conversation and other social skills br What is socially acceptable is now heavily based on social media The American Academy of Pediatrics reported that bullying the making of non inclusive friend groups and sexual experimentation have increased cyberbullying privacy issues and sending sexual images or messages Sexting and revenge porn became rampant particularly among minors with legal implications and resulting trauma risk However adolescents can learn basic social and technical skills online Social media can strengthen relationships just by keeping in touch making more friends and engaging in community activities br br br Content moderation br br br United States br Historically platforms were responsible for moderating the content that they presented They set rules for what was allowable decided which content to promote and which to ignore The US enacted the Communications Decency Act in Section of that act exempted internet platforms from legal liability for content authored by third parties br br No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider U S C c br br br European Union br The European Union initially took a similar approach However in the European Commission presented two legislative proposals The Digital Services Act DSA and the Digital Markets Act DMA Both proposals were enacted in July The DSA entered into force on February the DMA in March This legislation can be summarized in the following four objectives articulated by MEPs br br What is illegal offline must also be illegal online br Very large online platforms must therefore among other things br delete illegal content propaganda election interference hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse and better protect fundamental rights br redesign their systems to ensure a high level of privacy security and protection of minors by prohibiting advertising based on personal data designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the European Commission via a risk assessment and br not use sensitive personal data such as race gender and religion to target advertising br Violators could face a complete ban in Europe or fines of up to of global sales Such content moderation requires extensive investment by platform providers Enforcement resources may not be sufficient to ensure compliance br The DSA allows a country to require information to be deleted that is illegal only in that jurisdiction For example Hungary could require a video to be deleted that is in part critical of its government but the video would then be unavailable in other EU countries as well br br br Other regulatory approaches br Nobel Laureate Paul Romer advocated taxing negative externalities of social media platforms Similar to a carbon tax negative social effects could be compensated for by a financial levy on the platforms Assuming that the tax did not deter the actions that produced the externalities the revenue raised could be used to address them However consensus has yet to emerge on how to measure or mitigate the harms nor to craft a tax br Another proposal is to invoke competition law The idea is to restrict the platforms market power by controlling mergers ex ante and tightening the law This would be achieved through a supranational enforcement mechanism and the deterrent effect of high fines br br br Business models br The business model of most social media platforms is based on selling slots to advertisers Platforms provide access to data about each user which allows them to deliver adds that are individually relevant to them This strongly incents platforms to arrange their content so that users view as much content as possible increasing the number of ads that they see Platforms such as X add paid user subscriptions in part to reduce their dependence on advertising revenues br br br Criticism debate and controversy br The enormous reach and impact of social media has naturally led to a stream of criticism debate and controversy Criticisms include platform capabilities content moderation and reliability impact on concentration mental health content ownership and the meaning of interactions and poor cross platform interoperability decrease in face to face interactions cyberbullying sexual predation particularly of children and child pornography br In Andrew Keen wrote Out of this anarchy it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism the survival of the loudest and most opinionated Under these rules the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering br br br Trustworthiness and reliability br br Social media has become a regular source of news and information A Pew Research Center poll reported roughly of users regularly get news from social media despite the presence of fake news and misinformation Platforms typically do not take responsibility for content accuracy and many do not vet content at all although in some cases content the platform finds problematic is deleted or access to it is reduced Content distribution algorithms otherwise typically ignore substance responding instead to the contents virality br In researchers reported that fake news spread almost faster than truthful news on X Social media bots on social media increase the reach of both true and false content and if wielded by bad actors misinformation can reach many more users Some platforms attempt to discover and block bots with limited success Fake news seems to receive more user engagement possibly because it is relatively novel engaging users curiosity and increasing spread Fake news often propagates in the immediate aftermath of an event before conventional media are prepared to publish br br br Data harvesting and data mining br br br Critique of activism br br Malcolm Gladwell considers the role of social media in revolutions and protests to be overstated He concluded that while social media makes it easier for activists to express themselves that expression likely has no impact beyond social media What he called high risk activism involves strong relationships coordination commitment high risks and sacrifice Gladwell claimed that social media are built around weak ties and argues that social networks are effective at increasing participation by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires According to him Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice br Disputing Gladwell s theory a survey reported that people who are politically expressive on social media are more likely to participate in offline political activity br br br Content ownership br Social media content is generated by users However content ownership is defined by the Terms of Service to which users agree Platforms control access to the content and may make it available to third parties br br Although platform s terms differ generally they all give permission to utilize users copyrighted works at the platform s discretion br After its acquisition by Facebook in Instagram revealed it intended to use content in ads without seeking permission from or paying its users It then reversed these changes with then CEO Kevin Systrom promising to update the terms of service br br br Privacy br br Privacy rights advocates warn users about the collection of their personal data Information is captured without the user s knowing consent Data may be applied to law enforcement or other governmental purposes Information may be offered for third party use br Young people are prone to sharing personal information that can attract predators br While social media users claim to want to keep their data private their behavior does not reflect that concern as many users expose significant personal data on their profiles br In addition platforms collect data on user behaviors that are not part of their personal profiles This data is made available to third parties for purposes that include targeted advertising br A Pew Research Center survey reported that of Americans agree or strongly agree that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used Some of social media users said they were concerned about advertisers and businesses accessing the data they share on social media platforms and said the government should do more to regulate advertisers In UK legislators criticized Facebook for not
