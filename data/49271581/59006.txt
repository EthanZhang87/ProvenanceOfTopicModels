The symbol is known variously in English speaking regions as the number sign hash or pound sign The symbol has historically been used for a wide range of purposes including the designation of an ordinal number and as a ligatured abbreviation for pounds avoirdupois having been derived from the now rare br Since widespread usage of the symbol to introduce metadata tags on social media platforms has led to such tags being known as hashtags and from that the symbol itself is sometimes called a hashtag br The symbol is distinguished from similar symbols by its combination of level horizontal strokes and right tilting vertical strokes br br br History br br It is believed that the symbol traces its origins to the symbol an abbreviation of the Roman term libra pondo which translates as pound weight The abbreviation lb was printed as a dedicated ligature including a horizontal line across which indicated abbreviation Ultimately the symbol was reduced for clarity as an overlay of two horizontal strokes across two slash like strokes br The symbol is described as the number character in an treatise on bookkeeping and its double meaning is described in a bookkeeping text from The instruction manual of the Blickensderfer model typewriter c appears to refer to the symbol as the number mark Some early th century U S sources refer to it as the number sign although this could also refer to the numero sign A manual distinguishes between two uses of the sign number written before a figure and pounds written after a figure The use of the phrase pound sign to refer to this symbol is found from in U S usage The term hash sign is found in South African writings from the late s and from other non North American sources in the s br For mechanical devices the symbol appeared on the keyboard of the Remington Standard typewriter c It appeared in many of the early teleprinter codes and from there was copied to ASCII which made it available on computers and thus caused many more uses to be found for the character The symbol was introduced on the bottom right button of touch tone keypads in but that button was not extensively used until the advent of large scale voicemail PBX systems etc in the early s br One of the uses in computers was to label the following text as having a different interpretation such as a command or a comment from the rest of the text It was adopted for use within internet relay chat IRC networks circa to label groups and topics This usage inspired Chris Messina to propose a similar system to be used on Twitter to tag topics of interest on the microblogging network this became known as a hashtag Although used initially and most popularly on Twitter hashtag use has extended to other social media sites br br br Names br Number sign br br Number sign is the name chosen by the Unicode consortium Most common in Canada and the northeastern United States American telephone equipment companies which serve Canadian callers often have an option in their programming to denote Canadian English which in turn instructs the system to say number sign to callers instead of pound br Pound sign or pound br br In the United States the key on a phone is commonly referred to as the pound sign pound key or simply pound Dialing instructions to an extension such as for example can be read as pound seven seven This name is rarely used outside the United States where the term pound sign is understood to mean the currency symbol br Hash hash mark hashmark br br In the United Kingdom Australia and some other countries it is generally called a hash probably from hatch referring to cross hatching br Programmers also use this term for instance is hash bang or shebang br Hashtag br br Derived from the previous the word hashtag is often used when reading social media messages aloud indicating the start of a hashtag For instance the text foo is often read out loud as hashtag foo as opposed to hash foo This leads to the common belief that the symbol itself is called hashtag Twitter documentation refers to it as the hashtag symbol br Hex br br Hex is commonly used in Singapore and Malaysia as spoken by many recorded telephone directory

symbol on the telephone keypad Don MacPherson is said to have created the word by combining octo and the last name of Jim Thorpe an Olympic medalist Howard Eby and Lauren Asplund claim to have invented the word as a joke in combining octo with the syllable therp which because of the th digraph was hard to pronounce in different languages The Merriam Webster New Book of Word Histories has a long article that is consistent with Doug Kerr s essay which says octotherp was the original spelling and that the word arose in the s among telephone engineers as a joke Other hypotheses for the origin of the word include the last name of James Oglethorpe or using the Old English word for village thorp because the symbol looks like a village surrounded by eight fields The word was popularized within and outside Bell Labs The first appearance of octothorp in a US patent is in a filing This patent also refers to the six pointed asterisk used on telephone buttons as a sextile br Sharp br br Use of the name sharp is due to the symbol s resemblance to U F MUSIC SHARP SIGN The same derivation is seen in the name of the Microsoft programming languages C J and F Microsoft says that the name C is pronounced see sharp According to the ECMA C Language Specification the name of the language is written C LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C U followed by the NUMBER SIGN U and pronounced C Sharp br Square br br On telephones the International Telecommunication Union specification ITU T E states The symbol may be referred to as the square or the most commonly used equivalent term in other languages Formally this is not a number sign but rather another character U VIEWDATA SQUARE The real or virtual keypads on almost all modern telephones use the simple instead as does most documentation br Other

lb or lbs is used br is not a replacement for the pound sign but British typewriters and keyboards have a key where American keyboards have a key Many early computer and teleprinter codes such as BS the UK national variant of the ISO IEC character set substituted for to make the British versions thus it was common for the same binary code to display as on US equipment and on British equipment was not substituted to avoid confusing dollars and pounds in financial communications br br br Mathematics br In set theory S is one possible notation for the cardinality or size of the set S instead of
