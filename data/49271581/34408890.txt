They then claim that they can provide overseas purchasing services but sell counterfeit luxury goods at the same price as the authentic ones Other popular products selling on WeChat are facial masks The marketing mode is like that of Amway but most goods are unbranded products which come from illegal factories making excess hormones which could have serious effects on customers health However it is difficult for customers to defend their rights because a large number of sellers identities are uncertified Additionally the lack of any supervision mechanism in WeChat business also provides opportunities for criminals to continue this illegal behavior In early WeChat suspended more than a dozen NFT non fungible token public accounts to clean up crypto speculation and scalping The

voice mail messages to Hu Chinese authorities have further accused the Weixin app of threatening individual safety China Central Television CCTV a state run broadcaster featured a piece in which Weixin was described as an app that helped criminals due to its location reporting features CCTV gave an example of such accusations through reporting the murder of a single woman who after he attempted to rob her was murdered by a man she met on Weixin The location reporting feature according to reports was the reason for the man knowing the victim s whereabouts Authorities within China have linked Weixin to numerous crimes The city of Hangzhou for example reported over twenty crimes related to Weixin in the span of three months br br br XcodeGhost malware br br In Apple published a list of the top most popular apps infected with the XcodeGhost malware confirming earlier reports that version of WeChat for iOS was infected with it The malware originated in a counterfeit version of Xcode dubbed XcodeGhost Apple s software development tools and made its way into the compiled app through a modified framework Despite Apple s review process WeChat and other infected apps were approved and distributed through the App Store Even though the cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks claims that the malware was capable of prompting the user for their account credentials opening URLs and reading the device s clipboard Apple responded that the malware was not capable of doing anything malicious or transmitting any personally identifiable information beyond apps and general

history br br br Ban in India br In June the Government of India banned WeChat along with other Chinese apps citing data and privacy issues in response to a border clash between India and China

signed an executive order invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act seeking to ban WeChat in the U S in days due to its connections with the Chinese owned Tencent This was signed alongside a similar executive order targeting TikTok and its Chinese owned ByteDance br The Department of Commerce issued orders on September to enact the ban on WeChat and TikTok by the end of September citing national security and data privacy concerns The measures ban the transferring of funds or processing through WeChat in the U S and ban any company from offering hosting content delivery networks or internet transit to WeChat br Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Department of Commerce order on both TikTok and WeChat on September based on respective lawsuits filed by TikTok and US WeChat Users Alliance citing the merits of the plaintiffs First Amendment claims The Justice Department had previously asked Beeler to not block the order to ban the apps saying it would undermine the presidents ability to deal with threats to national security In her ruling Beeler said that while the government had established that Chinese government activities raised significant national security concerns it showed little evidence that the WeChat ban would address those concerns br On June U S President Joe Biden signed an executive order revoking the ban on WeChat and TikTok Instead he directed the commerce secretary to investigate foreign influence

popular Chinese social media platforms were criticised by both Yes and No supporters and by both Chinese and non Chinese Australians for its excessive amount of misleading content about the referendum as well as its excessive amount of posts that allegedly promote anti Indigenous racism Researchers from Monash University in Melbourne found that less than one in WeChat posts related to the referendum were supportive of the Yes case most of which were paid advertisements from the official Yes campaign The study also found that the vast majority of comments on Voice related WeChat posts were explicitly supportive of the No case br Chinese Australians are a very large minority group in Australia with many using WeChat as a social media platform While the usage of Chinese apps such as WeChat in Australia has long been controversial over its potential links to the Chinese government but it nevertheless is seen as a major social media platform in Australia directly competing with Western platforms among Chinese speakers in Australia As voting is compulsory for all Australian citizens over the age of social media advertising is crucial for election campaigns in Australia Therefore the significance of the number of No campaign material some of which even contained misinformation that most No supporters do not agree with had the potential to sway the votes of Chinese Australians towards the ultimately successful No case br br br Censorship br br br Global censorship br br Starting in reports arose that Chinese language searches even outside China were being keyword filtered and then blocked This occurred on incoming traffic to China from foreign countries but also exclusively between foreign parties the service had already censored its communications within China In the international example of blocking a message was displayed on users screens The message your message contains restricted words Please check it again These are the Chinese characters for a Guangzhou based paper called Southern Weekly or alternatively Southern Weekend The next day Tencent released a statement addressing the issue saying A small number of WeChat international users were not able to send certain messages due to a technical glitch this Thursday Immediate actions have been taken to rectify it We apologize for any inconvenience it has caused to our users We will continue to improve the product features and technological support to provide a better user experience WeChat eventually built two different platforms to avoid this problem one for the Chinese mainland Weixin and one for the rest of the world WeChat The problem existed because WeChat s servers were all located in China and thus subjected to its censorship rules br Following the overwhelming victory of pro democracy candidates in the Hong Kong local elections Weixin censored messages related to the election and disabled the accounts of posters in other countries such as U S and Canada Many of those targeted were of Chinese ancestry br In Weixin started censoring messages concerning the COVID pandemic br In December Weixin blocked a post by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison
