Ukrainians in countering Russian flanking maneuvers and supply shortages in the area Additionally relations between Russia and other nations are covered with multiple documents detailing efforts by Russian military intelligence agency GRU and paramilitary organization Wagner Group in promoting Russian ideals while downplaying American values Other documents reveal attempts by Wagner Group to acquire weapons in Turkey a NATO member One set of documents alleges that Mossad encouraged staff and citizens to participate in judicial reform protests br The leak spurred a diplomatic crisis between the United States and the Five Eyes An interagency effort composed of the Department of Defense the White House the Department of State and the U S intelligence community are assessing the leak Concurrently the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation have opened a criminal inquiry into the leaker U S officials have accused Russia of being behind the leak Ukraine and Russia have downplayed the leak with both countries saying that the documents contain distorted figures Specific claims in the leaks have been denied by some countries such as by South Korea and Egypt On April the FBI arrested Teixeira in connection with the leak br br br Background br In October the United States became aware of efforts by Russian president Vladimir Putin to quickly increase military spending in Russia by diverting funds from the country s response to the COVID pandemic Using satellite imagery intercepted communications and sources within Russia the U S believed that Putin intended to invade Ukraine Speaking to President Joe Biden the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley stated Russia would attempt a multidirectional shock and awe attack Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February the U S has provided the Ukrainian government with intelligence on Russia Representative Adam Smith the then chair of the House Armed Services Committee said that the U S provides some intelligence to Ukraine on MSNBC s Morning Joe but reserved that the U S was not providing the kind of real time targeting that the U S has provided in other conflicts White House press secretary Jen Psaki commented that the U S provided more significant intelligence than what Smith described Responding to Politico a spokesperson for Smith called the United States intelligence rapid br br br Document dissemination br The documents are believed to have been first posted in early March to a large audience in a Discord server for British Filipino YouTuber wow mao They gained wider attention after they were posted two days later on a Minecraft server in a discussion in which one user cited them in an argument with another br A Bellingcat investigation found that the documents had been posted in a Discord server for the YouTuber Oxide Several sources interviewed by Bellingcat stated that the documents were posted as far back as October and were posted by a server administrator known as OG in a channel about the Russian invasion of Ukraine Speaking to The Washington Post Oxide who currently serves in the United States Army in the Pacific Northwest told the publication that he had banned various users in his own Discord server a year prior including some for posting a meme video of a black man in a gay porn film dubbed the thug shaker The banned users then moved to the Thug Shaker Central server br According to The Washington Post OG regularly brought home documents from an unnamed military base Users of the server formed a bond with OG as he posted the documents believing him to be a trusted source with some knowing his full name and state An investigation by The New York Times following a digital evidence trail found that OG is likely Jack Teixeira born an airman in the nd Intelligence Wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard According to The New York Times details on the margins of the document photographs match those in Teixeira s childhood home Teixeira was promoted to airman first class in July and became a cyber transport systems journeyman stationed at Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod On other social media platforms Teixeira was also known as jackthedripper According to the court documents a social media user suspected of being Teixeira began releasing classified information on an unspecified social media platform in the form of paragraphs of text as early as December br On April an anonymous user on the pol imageboard on chan posted several images of the documents with that user s documents circulating via pro Russian Telegram channels One such channel Donbass Devushka republished these images The images posted to Donbass Devushka and to pol are identical except for one image where the number of Ukrainian casualties outweighs Russian ones suggesting that the image was altered possibly by Donbass Devushka The Wall Street Journal reported that Sarah Bils a former aviation electronics technician nd Class last stationed at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island is allegedly behind the Donbass Devushka social media accounts that posted at least four of the classified documents Malcontent News reported that an anti Russian misinformation open source intelligence movement North Atlantic Fella Organization identified Bils as one of the personas behind Donbass Devushka br The New York Times initially reported on the documents two days after they were posted on Telegram The documents continued to be spread on Twitter In response to a tweet about the leak Twitter CEO Elon Musk alluded to the Streisand effect and suggested that Twitter would not take down the documents Discord is cooperating with law enforcement in regard to the leak On April The New York Times reported that a user whose profile matched Teixeira had shared the documents to another Discord server beginning on February days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began photographs of the leaked documents were published by Distributed Denial of Secrets br br br Contents br The documents primarily in the form of pictures of charts and graphs concern intelligence that the United States holds on other nations including North Korea China and Iran and the Russian invasion of Ukraine The number of documents is estimated to be over pages The documents appeared online as photographs of documents atop an apparent hunting magazine with other objects such as zip lock bags and Gorilla Glue scattered throughout the photographs Senior U S officials have attested to their legitimacy believing that the documents are intelligence and operational briefs from the Joint Staff within the Pentagon The documents appear to be compiled from multiple sources including the National Security Agency NSA the Bureau of Intelligence and Research INR of the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency CIA in the lattermost case one section of the documents originates from a daily intelligence update br In releasing the documents the documents were first photographed and then uploaded online According to Javed Ali a former U S counter terrorism official the uploader of the documents may have taken steps to conceal their IP address and timestamps from the photographs in an effort to feign anonymity The classified material would have been limited to a sensitive compartmented information facility SCIF where electronic devices connected to the Internet are prohibited A senior U S official stated that hundreds potentially thousands of government officials may have obtained the documents br br br Russo Ukrainian War br br br Battle of Bakhmut br br One document dated late February detailed Russian flanking maneuvers near Bakhmut discussions by the Ukrainian military about how to respond and supply shortages in the area An intelligence assessment states that as of February Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut were nearly encircled a senior Ukrainian official noted that morale was low among Ukrainian soldiers Kyrylo Budanov Ukraine s director of military intelligence described the Ukrainian position as catastrophic and offered to deploy elite units to safeguard the single supply line and prevent encirclement Deployment of reinforcements including elite units ultimately prevented the encirclement but at a strategic cost depleting seasoned forces that may have been in reserve for the spring counter offensive br br br Casualty estimates br The documents also cover information on U S provided military resources Ukraine has access to purported Pentagon estimates on Russian and Ukrainian casualties and alleged information on Ukraine s planned counteroffensive Several documents also offer low confidence estimates for the number of casualties with the U S estimating to Russian casualties compared to to Ukrainian casualties One document also states that the number of soldiers killed in action in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is between and while those of the Russian Armed Forces is between and br The documents also allege that the Spetsnaz GRU has suffered significant casualties as a result of the unit s use in the war br br br Russian military planning br br In one top secret document plans by the Russian General Staff to counter NATO provided tanks were detailed One such plan involves paying Russian soldiers who destroy NATO tanks The documents also show U S awareness of Russian military planning such as plans to destroy a hangar containing drones near Odesa br br br Russia NATO aircraft encounters and near shootdown br According to one document a Russian fighter jet nearly shot down a British surveillance plane off of the coast of Crimea The incident referred to as a near shootdown of a Rivet Joint a moniker referring to a variant of Boeing RC s from the United Kingdom occurred in September The incident was disclosed in October by Ben Wallace the Secretary of State for Defence to the House of Commons Wallace specifically named two Sukhoi Su jets as flying recklessly with one of the jets firing a missile at the Rivet Joint Wallace believed the firing was a technical issue Under the North Atlantic Treaty such an attack could have provoked a larger response from NATO as a whole had the missile hit the plane The document labeled as classified for non U S citizens was among others detailing encounters that Russian fighter jets had with foreign aircraft including the Black Sea drone incident According to the document French and British aircraft flew crewed reconnaissance flights between the near shootdown and February Two U S defense officials later stated that the pilot of the Russian fighter jet misunderstood commands from a radar operator br br br Weapons use by Ukraine br The documents suggest that Ukraine s air defense against aircraft largely made up of the S and Buk missile systems will be depleted by May Several documents refer to Ukraine using weapons within Russia According to one document in late February Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested the use of unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs to strike within the Rostov Oblast Another document states that China could increase aid to Russia if Ukraine struck within Russia The documents also exposed LAPIS an advanced satellite system used by the Ukrainian military br Documents also outline a proposed Combat Power Build consisting of planned brigades supplied by the United States and allied partners br br br Weapons use by Russia br One document detail how Russia has attempted to disrupt Starlink systems provided by SpaceX to Ukraine br br br Western special forces br The documents included the list of countries which have small contingents of military special forces operating inside Ukraine the United Kingdom sent the largest number of soldiers at followed by Latvia France the United States and the Netherlands one The United States special forces were detailed to the U S embassy in Kyiv to provide security for VIPs and to assist with oversight of U S equipment and supplies being sent to Ukraine br br br Countries br br br Russia br A document details efforts by the GRU Russia s military intelligence agency to engage in information warfare in Africa that promoted Russian foreign policy while downplaying public opinion about the United States The Russian paramilitary organization Wagner Group is also mentioned One document states that Wagner Group emissaries met with authorities from Turkey in February suggesting that Wagner Group could obtain the weapons from an outpost in Mali The intelligence findings suggest that Wagner chief s Yevgeny Prigozhin s claims that the Russian Defense Ministry has been skimping on ammunition supplies to Wagner may have been grounded in fact Another document provides an estimate of the number of Wagner personnel in Mali noting that the large Wagner presence has raised security concerns in neighboring Ivory Coast br A Defense Intelligence Agency analysis discovered in the leak found that peace talks between the U S and Russia are unlikely even if Ukraine is able to mount unsustainable losses on Russian forces Previous documents show that U S intelligence does not believe Ukraine can yield significant gains with their counteroffensive br A document prepared by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Cyber Command and European Command analysed Russian online disinformation and propaganda operations of Fabrika a Russian disinformation network under direct purview of the Russian presidential administration as of late finding that their operations are becoming more effective with of their fake social media accounts evading detection by platforms though experts have questioned the significance of this finding after the document was made public noting that the impact of fake accounts may nonetheless be negligible if not picked up by other users Fabrika uses bots to manipulate search results and recommendations algorithms as well as actively targeting individuals with propaganda directly with email and phone contact information collected from databases Fabrika is attempting to demoralise Ukrainians and deepen rifts in Western countries br br br China br br Analysis of risks posed by China are mentioned throughout the documents Documents speak to inadequacies of Taiwan s air defenses U S intelligence assesses China would probably establish air superiority very rapidly in an attack on Taiwan One document overviews a test of the DF Dongfeng ballistic missile which possess a high probability of penetrating U S ballistic missile defense systems An assessment by U S intelligence community notes that China is likely developing cyber attack capabilities to deny exploit and hijack Western satellites A section of the documents details a potential deployment of British naval aircraft carriers in the Indo Pacific and differing visions of Indo Pacific Counter PRC policies between the Conservative and Labour parties Other information in the documents leak include Chinese investments in a Nicaraguan deep sea port Chinese complaints regarding the exclusion of Huawei in Jordanian G bidding a satellite rocket launch in March the commissioning of a new Yushen class landing helicopter dock Chinese Hikvision surveillance equipment in DoD supply chains and instructions for Chinese foreign affairs officials regarding the high altitude balloon incident One National Geospatial Intelligence Agency document shows satellite imagery of two WZ s that could provide China an advantage in a potential war against Taiwan br br br Egypt br br One document overviews conversation between Abdel Fattah el Sisi the president of Egypt and senior Egyptian military officials over the production and shipment of some rockets and references plans by Egypt to sell artillery and gunpowder to Russia Sisi attempted to keep the supply a secret to avoid problems with the West Workers were told that the rockets were for the Egyptian Army The document references a person known only as Salah al Din believed to be Mohamed Salah al Din the minister of state for military production Salah al Din reportedly told Sisi that he would order his people to work shift work if necessary to repay Russia for unknown help In addition Sisi considered selling ordinary stuff to China to produce more Sakr rocket launchers Egyptian officials rejected the allegation of rocket exports to Russia separately Russian officials also called it a hoax br br br Iran br The documents suggest that the U S has been able to surveil Iran In one document senior Iranian leaders are described discussing an upcoming visit by Rafael Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA and how to alter domestic news coverage The document also suggests the U S has been able to monitor the IAEA br br br Pakistan br In a memo titled Pakistan s Difficult Choices Pakistani Minister Hina Rabbani Khar argued that Pakistan can no longer try to maintain a middle ground between China and the United States It warned that the instinct to preserve Pakistan s partnership with the United States would ultimately sacrifice the full benefits of the country s real strategic partnership with China br br br Serbia br The documents state that Serbia supplied weapons to Ukraine for its defense against Russia or had agreed to do so despite Serbia refusing to sanction Russia economically br br br South Korea br The documents outline internal debates in South Korea regarding a request by the U S to provide Korean artillery shells to Ukraine about whether it would violate South Korea s policy on lethal aid if the U S then sent them to Ukraine These debates were obtained through signals intelligence conducted by the CIA One official suggested the possibility of selling artillery shells to Poland instead where it would then be sent to Ukraine South Korea s President Yoon Suk yeol described the leaked documents as utterly false compromising national interest The South Korean government announced that in a phone call between U S Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his counterpart in South Korea both countries agreed that large portions of the South Korea related documents were fabricated br br br Israel br The documents show how the U S sought to pressure Israel into providing lethal aid Israel has previously denied Ukraine weaponry including its Iron Dome air defense system Out of four options pressed by the U S Israel was most likely to engage in the Turkish model providing weaponry to Ukraine through third parties while remaining cordial with Russia br One set of documents states that the Mossad the national intelligence agency of Israel encouraged staff and citizens to participate in judicial reform protests that flared up in January following a series of changes supported by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu According to the documents director David Barnea supported junior employees participating in the protests under the guise of anonymity The Israeli government issued a statement denying the claims and Israeli political commentators noted that the document appears to confuse permission with encouragement and the actions of current and former Mossad employees br br br Taiwan br Intelligence assessment documents question Taiwan s ability to withstand a potential PRC invasion noting that PRC would swiftly establish air superiority in a potential conflict and that it would likely to be far more effective in establishing air superiority in comparison to Russia s push for air superiority during its invasion of Ukraine The assessments furthermore note that only half of Taiwan s aircraft would be combat ready that the Taiwanese military leadership questions the effectiveness of its anti missile air defences and that Taiwan would be slow to move its airforce fleet to shelters leaving it exposed to destruction by missile strikes The documents further note that PRC use of civilian ships for military purposes is making it difficult for US intelligence to predict a potential PRC invasion of Taiwan br br br Turkey br According to Reuters Wagner personnel intended to purchase weapons and equipment from Turkey to use them in Mali and Ukraine Leaked documents also say that the President of Mali Assimi Go ta confirmed that Mali could acquire weapons from Turkey on Wagner s behalf br br br Canada br Several documents allege that Russian cybercriminal group Zarya acting under the direction of the Federal Security Service compromised the IP address of an unnamed Canadian gas company and were capable of increasing valve pressure disabling alarms and shutting down pipelines br br br Haiti br The documents state that the Wagner Group is seeking to expand its operations into Haiti offering to combat violent gangs on behalf of the Haitian government br br br United Arab Emirates br The documents include information about American military ally United Arab Emirates UAE ties with Russia and the proposed creation of a regional weapons repair facility in the UAE for Abu Dhabi s inventory of Russian weapons Russian weaponry operated by the UAE includes Pantsir air defense systems Kornet portable anti tank missiles Igla portable surface to air missiles and BMP infantry fighting vehicles br Leaked Russian intelligence surveilled by the U S indicated that Russian spies were boasting about an alleged intelligence alliance between Moscow and Abu Dhabi against the U S and U K This claim supported only from the Russian side was denied by Abu Dhabi as categorically false br br br Organizations br br br Gulf Cartel br br Following the Matamoros kidnappings U S intelligence agencies began increasing their surveillance of the Gulf Cartel br br br U S espionage targets br According to the leaked documents U S intelligence spied on U N Secretary General Ant nio Guterres because it believed Guterres was too soft on Russia The leaks also revealed other U S espionage activities including against allies such as Jordan s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Turkey Ivory Coast and Colombia One document states that the U S has been spying on Zelenskyy br While the common practice of reciprocal spying among allied states is known among and countenanced by government officials public revelations of such activities nonetheless present a political and diplomatic nuisance for governments involved br br br Sources and methods br In addition to the intelligence findings themselves the leaked documents also reveal the sources and methods of intelligence gathering for example revealing that the CIA is using signals intelligence to spy on discussions inside the Russian Defense Ministry as well as to eavesdrop on the South Korean and Israeli governments and individuals associated with the Wagner Group The leak further reveals which Russian agencies have been penetrated by U S intelligence The leak imperils future intelligence gathering efforts as targets take countermeasures and patch up exposed vulnerabilities and puts human sources at risk br br br Ongoing investigations br The Department of Defense are assessing the leak along with the White House the State Department and other intelligence agencies The Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI has opened a criminal inquiry into the leaker According to Brandon Van Grack who led the Department of Justice investigation into Edward Snowden the Department of Justice and FBI are reviewing who may have posted the documents Van Grack also stated that the investigation into the leak may impair the FBI investigation into Donald Trump s handling of government documents and the special counsel investigation into classified documents discovered at the Penn Biden Center and Biden s home br On April the FBI searched the home of Jack Teixeira s mother An arrest was made shortly thereafter in North Dighton Massachusetts According to an affidavit Discord gave the FBI Teixeira s home address through billing information he provided The United States Air Force announced a separate investigation on April and removed the nd Intelligence Wing from its intelligence assignments br br br Reactions br br br United States br br The documents leak began a diplomatic crisis between the U S and the Five Eyes with officials in the United Kingdom Belgium Germany the United Arab Emirates and Ukraine questioning the U S as to how the documents surfaced online U S officials told allies that the Biden administration was investigating the leak Wendy Sherman the Deputy Secretary of State has been tapped to lead the diplomatic response to the leak U S Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin stated that We will continue to investigate and turn over every rock until we find the source of this and the extent of it br On the night of Teixeira s arrest Fox News host Tucker Carlson falsely told viewers that the disclosure of fourteen American special forces members in Ukraine showed that the U S is a direct combatant in a war against Russia As we speak American soldiers are fighting Russian soldiers Republican House member Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted that Teixeira told the truth about troops being on the ground in Ukraine The special forces were not engaged in combat but rather detailed to the U S embassy in Kyiv to provide security for VIPs and to assist with oversight of U S equipment and supplies being sent to Ukraine Greene s response was criticized by Republican senator Lindsey Graham br According to a senior U S official the Biden administration is looking into expanding its monitoring of social media sites as a result of the leak According to Emma Best the Department of Defense asked Distributed Denial of Secrets to remove the Pentagon document leaks but DDoSecrets basically just ignored them br br br Ukraine br Ukrainian presidential advisor and peace negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said that the leak contained a very large amount of fictitious information which appeared to be standard elements of operational games by Russian intelligence and nothing more Ukrainian defense intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov said in recent decades the Russian special services most successful operations have been taking place in Photoshop we see false distorted figures on losses on both sides with part of the information collected from open sources On the same day Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy released a statement about a meeting with military staff in part focused on measures to prevent the leakage of information br Quoted by The New York Times Ukrainian Lieutenant Colonel Yuriy Bereza said We can no longer determine where is the truth and where is the lie We are at that stage of the war when the information war is sometimes even more important than the direct physical clashes at the front br br br Russia br Russian military analyst Yuri Kotenok claimed the slides might have been planted by the U S to mislead Russia and downplay the strength and readiness of Ukrainian brigades before an offensive Kyle Walter of British firm Logically which researches disinformation says most voices on Russian speaking Telegram were calling the leak a Western false flag Conversely Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the leaks were quite interesting though also denied specific claims in the leak such as alleged proposal for Egyptian rocket exportation to Russia br br br South Korea br br South Korean president Yoon Suk yeol defended the country s relationship with U S and downplayed the leak while opposition lawmakers from the Democratic Party of Korea expressed disdain Lee Jae myung the leader of the Democratic Party said that the leaks undermine the South Korea U S alliance Kim Tae hyo a deputy national security advisor to Yoon denied the veracity of conversations detailed in the documents br br br Analysis br A researcher of information operations Thomas Rid said The fact that unedited and edited doctored versions of some files are available online makes me skeptical that this is a professional Russian intelligence operation because the falsification of casualties and other details only makes it easier to detect the facts and thus defeats the purpose According to Rid and CNN if the details were both stolen by Russia and useful to Russia they would not have publicized both the doctored and original versions since it would weaken their impact br The documents leak has been compared to the United States diplomatic cables leak and the global surveillance disclosures In comparison to these leaks the documents leak contains relatively recent information on the Russian invasion of Ukraine that could be used against Ukraine presenting a far more drastic leak br br br See also br br
