id: 32492747
Cyberbullying cyberharassment or online bullying is a form of bullying or harassment using electronic means It has become increasingly common especially among teenagers and adolescents due to young people s increased use of social media Related issues include online harassment and trolling In according to cyberbullying statistics from the i Safe Foundation over half of adolescents and teens had been bullied online and about the same number had engaged in cyberbullying Both the bully and the victim are negatively affected and the intensity duration and frequency of bullying are three aspects that increase the negative effects on both of them br br br Tactics br Harmful bullying behavior can include posting rumors threats sexual remarks a victims personal information or hate speech Bullying or harassment can be identified by repeated behavior and an intent to harm Tactics can also include creating or posting on fake profiles to create anonymity to spread harmful messages br br br Overview br Cyberbullying is in many cases an extension of already existing traditional bullying Students who are bullied via the Internet have in most cases also been bullied in other more traditional ways before e g physically or verbally There are few students who are bullied exclusively over the Internet these cyber victims are often physically stronger students which causes bullies to prefer online confrontations over face to face contact at school br Awareness in the United States has risen in the s due in part to high profile cases Several US states and other countries have passed laws to combat cyberbullying Some are designed to specifically target teen cyberbullying while others extend from the scope of physical harassment In cases of adult cyberharassment these reports are usually filed beginning with local police The laws differ by area or state br Research has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimisation Specific statistics on the negative effects of cyberbullying differ by country and other demographics Some researchers point out there could be some way to use modern computer techniques to determine and stopping cyberbullying br Other research has suggested an uptick in cyberbullying during the COVID pandemic when many youth and adults were quarantined at home and as a consequence online more often than before the pandemic For example a study of adults published in the Journal of Social Psychology identified statistically significant increases in pro cyberbullying attitudes as well as in cyberbullying offending behavior However another study involving over Canadian youth in grades did not find higher rates of cyberbullying involvement The authors speculated that this might be a result of closer monitoring and involvement of online activities by parents while their children were at home br Internet trolling is a common form of bullying that takes place in an online community such as online gaming or social media in order to elicit a reaction or disruption or simply just for someone s own personal amusement Cyberstalking is another form of bullying or harassment that uses electronic communications to stalk a victim this may pose a credible threat to the victim br Not all negative interaction online or on social media can be attributed to cyberbullying Research suggests that there are also interactions online that result in peer pressure which can have a negative positive or neutral impact on those involved br br br Definitions br A frequently used definition of cyberbullying is an aggressive intentional act or behavior that is carried out by a group or an individual using electronic forms of contact repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself It is to be distinguished from normal conflicts between people of comparable power or status that often also occur online br There are many variations of the definition such as the National Crime Prevention Council s more specific definition the process of using the Internet cell phones or other devices to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person Cyberbullying is often similar to traditional bullying with some notable distinctions Victims of cyberbullying may not know the identity of their bully or why the bully is targeting them based on the online nature of the interaction The harassment can have wide reaching effects on the victim as the content used to harass the victim can be spread and shared easily among many people and often remains accessible long after the initial incident br The terms cyberharassment and cyberbullying are sometimes used synonymously though some people use the latter to refer specifically to harassment among minors or in a school setting br br br Cyberstalking br br Cyberstalking is a form of online harassment in which the perpetrator uses electronic communications to stalk a victim This is considered more dangerous than other forms of cyberbullying because it generally involves a credible threat to the victim s safety Cyberstalkers may send repeated messages intended to threaten or harass and they may encourage others to do the same either explicitly or by impersonating their victim and asking others to contact them br This can be a combination of most of the other methods in order to stalk someone using electronic means This can include finding the victims location harassing them with spam or using sextortion An example of this situation occurring is when Paris Deshaunte Evitt a year old from Tulsa cyberstalked one of his former partners A news article on it states Between October and continuing until October Evitt used email Facebook and text messages to control and threaten the victim However his abuse of the victim had started years before Between and Evitt was convicted on different occasions for physically abusing the victim including strangulation assault and interfering with reporting Evitt was also on state supervision at the time of the current offenses The unidentified victim explained that Evitt had destroyed her sense of security and became emotional when she discussed Evitt s statement that he would rather see her dead than happy She also stated the longer he is away from my children and I the more time we have to try and heal and move on with our lives if that is even possible br br br Trolling br br Internet trolls intentionally try to provoke or offend others in order to elicit a reaction Trolls and cyberbullies do not always have the same goals while some trolls engage in cyberbullying others may be engaged in comparatively harmless mischief A troll may be disruptive either for their own amusement or because they are genuinely a combative person Trolling can include insults false news or terrorist threats br br br Hate raids br On Twitch and other livestreaming services hate raids are situations where a stream is raided by many viewers who flood the chat with harassment and other hateful messages This prevents the streamer from executing their stream These viewers are typically automated bots making it difficult to moderate and block br br br Spam br Spamming is the act of creating multiple accounts and sending messages to a target en masse A common situation where spam can occur is after a breakup If one partner is obsessive they may send their ex messages on multiple platforms This often happens despite being blocked by the recipient The article What Can Police Do About Harassing Texts states Keep in mind that harassment of any kind is illegal and includes in person over the phone via text messages through social media or any other method Some laws are in place about cyberbullying that are designed to protect the public from this happening br br br Impersonation br Impersonation is the act of pretending be another person If the offender pretends to be the victim they may say or do things to hurt the victim s reputation This can include hacking into a Twitter account and spreading disinformation One famous example is when Sony Music s Twitter account was hacked and posted the following statement Britney Spears is dead by accident we will tell you more soon RIPBRITNEY Spears was in fact alive and well br br br Doxxing br Doxxing is the act of disclosing a victim s personal data such as their home address phone number and full name Doxxing can happen when fans in fandoms with large fanbases often go too far when protecting their idols and enter the realm of cyberbullying Extreme fans of the K pop music genre sometimes dox fans of rival music groups This specifically was shown in an incident where fans of the group Blackpink doxxed the owner of a Twice fan account sending him to a hospital This is allegedly because a Twice member disrespected a Blackpink member br br br Sexual harassment br Online sexual harassment is considered a form of cyberbullying Sextortion a form of sexual harassment is the act of coercing a person into sharing intimate images before threatening to release them unless money is paid It is a specific type of blackmail The line between sexual harassment and cyberbullying is blurred br Some people will blackmail their classmates for nudes threatening to release embarrassing information They also use revenge porn and release nudes to get payback This was the case when a year old student of W F West High School in Chehalis exploited more than victims many of which were his classmates He owned over photos and videos of victims br br br Methods used br Research has identified basic guidelines to help recognize and deal with what is regarded as abuse of electronic communications br br Cyberbullying involves repeated behavior with intent to harm br Cyberbullying is perpetrated through harassment cyberstalking denigration sending or posting cruel rumors and falsehoods to damage reputation and friendships impersonation and exclusion intentionally and cruelly excluding someone from an online group br Cyberbullying can be as simple as continuing to send emails or text messages harassing someone who has said they want no further contact with the sender It may also include public actions such as repeated threats sexual remarks pejorative labels i e hate speech or defamatory false accusations ganging up on a victim by making the person the subject of ridicule in online forums hacking into or vandalizing sites about a person and posting false statements as fact aimed a discrediting or humiliating a targeted person Cyberbullying could be limited to posting rumors about a person on the internet with the intention of bringing about hatred in others minds or convincing others to dislike or participate in online denigration of a target It may go to the extent of personally identifying victims of crime and publishing materials defaming or humiliating them br Cyberbullies may disclose victims personal data e g real name home address or workplace schools on websites or forums called doxing or may use impersonation creating fake accounts comments or sites posing as their target for the purpose of publishing material in their name that defames discredits or ridicules them This can leave the cyberbully anonymous which can make it difficult for them to be caught or punished for their behavior although not all cyberbullies maintain their anonymity Users of semi anonymous chat websites are at high risk for cyberbullying as it is also easy in this outlet for a cyberbully to remain anonymous Text or instant messages and emails between friends can also constitute cyberbullying if what is said is hurtful br br The recent rise of smartphones and mobile apps have yielded a more accessible form of cyberbullying It is expected that cyberbullying via these platforms will occur more often than through more stationary internet platforms because of constant access to the internet In addition the combination of cameras and Internet access and the instant availability of these modern smartphone technologies yield specific types of cyberbullying not found in other platforms It is likely that those cyberbullied via mobile devices will experience a wider range of cyberbullying methods than those who are exclusively bullied elsewhere br Some teens argue that some events categorized as cyberbullying are simply drama Danah Boyd writes teens regularly used that word drama to describe various forms of interpersonal conflict that ranged from insignificant joking around to serious jealousy driven relational aggression Whereas adults might have labeled many of these practices as bullying teens saw them as drama br br br In social media br Cyberbullying can take place on social media sites such as Facebook Myspace and Twitter By of young people between the ages of and were online In fact youth spend more time with media than any single other activity besides sleeping The last decade has witnessed a surge of cyberbullying which is categorized as bullying that occurs through the use of electronic communication technologies such as e mail instant messaging social media online gaming or through digital messages or images sent to a cellular phone br There are many risks attached to social media sites and cyberbullying is one of the larger risks One million children were harassed threatened or subjected to other forms of cyberbullying on Facebook during the past year while percent of social media using teens who have witnessed online cruelty say they have ignored mean behavior on social media and percent have done so frequently Ninety five percent of social media using teens who have witnessed cruel behavior on social networking sites say they have seen others ignoring the mean behavior and percent have witnessed this frequently Terms like Facebook depression have been coined specifically in regard to the result of extended social media use with cyberbullying playing a large part in this br br Cyberbullying has become more common nowadays because of all the technology that children have access to The most common apps that teenagers use to cyberbully are Instagram Twitter and Snapchat Cyberbullying has become harder to stop because parents and teachers are unaware of when and where it is happening A study found that of teens and of adolescents were cyberbullied while at school This was linked to the reason students had access to their online devices such as cell phones or computers Teens will say awful things to one another online and what they do not realize is that once it is said and published online it will not go away Home used to be a safe place for teens but now a child is still within reach of becoming a victim of cyberbullying whether it is through YouTube Ask fm or a text message Wherever you face it is easy to come across Cyberbullying making it almost impossible to escape br According to a Pew Research study eight out of ten teens who use social media now share more information about themselves than they have in the past This includes their location images and contact information In order to protect children it is important that personal information such as age birthday school church phone number etc be kept confidential br Cyberbullying can also take place through the use of websites belonging to certain groups to effectively request the targeting of another individual or group An example of this is the bullying of climate scientists and activists br br br In gaming br br Of those who reported having experienced online harassment in a Pew Research poll said the most recent incident had occurred in an online game A study from National Sun Yat sen University observed that children who enjoyed violent video games were significantly more likely to both experience and perpetrate cyberbullying br Another study that discusses the direct correlation between exposure to violent video games and cyber bullying also took into account personal factors such as duration of playing online games alcohol consumption in the last months parents drunk in the last months anger hostility ADHD and a sense of belonging as potential contributing factors of cyberbullying br Gaming was a more common venue for men in which to experience harassment whereas women s harassment tended to occur more via social media Most respondents considered gaming culture to be equally welcoming to both genders though thought it favored men Sexual harassment in gaming generally involves slurs directed towards women sex role stereotyping and overaggressive language Keza MacDonald writes in The Guardian that sexism exists in gaming culture but is not mainstream within it U S President Barack Obama made reference to the harassment of women gamers during his remarks in honor of Women s History Month br Competitive gaming scenes have been less welcoming of women than has broader gaming culture In an internet streamed fighting game competition one female gamer forfeited a match after the coach of her team Aris Bakhtanians stated The sexual harassment is part of the culture If you remove that from the fighting game community it s not the fighting game community The comments were widely condemned by gamers with comments in support of sexual harassment drowned out by a vocal majority of people expressing outrage disappointment and sympathy The incident built momentum for action to counter sexual harassment in gaming br Some game developers have been subjected to harassment and death threats by players upset by changes to a game or by a developer s online policies Harassment also occurs in reaction to critics such as Jack Thompson or Anita Sarkeesian whom some fans see as threats to the medium Various people have been harassed in connection with the Gamergate controversy Harassment related to gaming is not of a notably different severity or tenor compared to online harassment motivated by other subcultures or advocacy issues Other developers have been harassed simply due to misogyny or anti LGBTQ stances A notable case was the death of Near the developer of Higan a console emulator who took their own life after becoming the subject to ridicule from members of the online Kiwi Farms board following their announcement of being nonbinary br Sabotage among rival crowdfunding campaigns is a recurring problem for projects related to gaming br Some instances of swatting in games such as Call of Duty and League of Legends have resulted in law enforcement SWAT units called on individuals homes as a prank On December Wichita Kansas police officers killed Andrew Finch at his Kansas home in a reported swatting prank br br br In search engines br Information cascades happen when users start passing along information they assume to be true but cannot know to be true based on information on what other users are doing This can be accelerated by search engines ranking technologies and their tendency to return results relevant to a user s previous interests This type of information spreading is hard to stop Information cascades over social media and the Internet may also be harmless and may contain truthful information br Bullies use Google bombs a term applicable to any search engine to increase the prominence of favored posts sorted by the most popular searches done by linking to those posts from as many other web pages as possible Examples include the campaign for the neologism santorum organized by the LGBT lobby Google bombs can manipulate the Internet s search engines regardless of how authentic the pages are but there is a way to counteract this type of manipulation as well br br br In dating apps br Dating app users who are victims of cyberbullying encounter a range of harmful behaviors including catfishing the uninvited sharing of personal images and offensive remarks These activities not only violate personal boundaries but also have a detrimental impact on the victims mental health br Research by the Pew Research Center highlights how common this issue is finding that almost of female users between the ages of and have received unsolicited sexual messages or photographs on dating apps Moreover it was found that of American users of dating apps have been the victim of online abuse Dating app users are more likely to experience hate speech and cyberbullying because of this rate which is almost twice as high as the whole American population In addition to sexual harassment other forms of cyberbullying and hate speech are among the most frequent forms of harassment that users of these sites report experiencing br The fundamental safety and trust that underlie online dating sites functionality are compromised by these upsetting encounters Victims may experience significant effects including elevated stress and anxiety levels and in certain cases chronic psychological trauma br br br Online shaming br br br Famous cyberbullying cases br br There are many famous cases of cyberbullying online eg Daisy Coleman br Although most people may not realize it some of these internet memes actually show cyberbullying in action br br br Star Wars Kid br Uploaded in the star of the video Ghyslain Raza a th grader at the time is shown messing around and waving around a golf ball retriever as if it is a real Jedi lightsaber He was helping his friend parody the movie Star Wars The video was uploaded to YouTube several months later by Raza s classmates without his knowledge or permission The video blew up and because one of the first viral internet memes The video accumulated million views br Despite trying to protect his privacy Raza was mocked both online and in real life He was body shamed doxxed and told to commit suicide among other things Students at school leaped onto tables to mock him and his video was parodied on multiple shows including South Park Raza had to move schools multiple times and became homeschooled He was harassed for years over a video he did not upload Today he is working on a documentary talking about his internet fame and the harassment that came along with it He wants to focus on internet privacy and consent br br br Ethical cyberbullying br Controversially some internet users use cyberbullying for ethical means Some reasons include justice for victims activism and persuading scaring politicians Committing moral actions for immoral causes is commonly seen in the realm of activism br br br Predator catchers br Some internet users pose as children online in order to catch online predators child sex trafficking rings and pedophiles One such user is Roo Powell who poses as a year old girl online in order to catch sex offenders targeting children She is the star of the show Undercover Underage which documents her experiences exposing pedophiles and working with law enforcement She is the founder of the nonprofit organization SOSA Safe from Online Sex Abuse Powell educates children on the dangers of online predators and talks to them about how to practice online safety br br br Law enforcement br A majority of states have laws that explicitly include electronic forms of communication within stalking or harassment laws Most law enforcement agencies have cyber crime units and Internet stalking is often treated with more seriousness than reports of physical stalking Help and resources can be searched by state or area br br br Schools br The safety of online privacy issues in schools is increasingly becoming a focus of state legislative action There was an increase in cyberbullying enacted legislation between and Initiatives and curriculum requirements also exist in the UK the Ofsted eSafety guidance and Australia Overarching Learning Outcome br In a group of teenagers in a design class New Haven Connecticut developed an application to help fight bullying Back Off Bully BOB This is an anonymous resource for computer smart phone or iPad designed so when someone witnesses or is the victim of bullying they can immediately report the incident The app asks questions about time location and how the bullying is happening as well as provides positive action and empowerment regarding the incident The reported information goes to a database where it may be studied by administrators Common threads are spotted so others can intervene and break the bully s pattern Back Off Bully is being considered as standard operating procedure at schools across Connecticut while recent studies carried out among high school teachers have concluded that prevention programs have proved ineffective to date br Teachers can also be cyberbullied by pupils as well as by parents and other school staff br br br Protection br There are laws that only address online harassment of children or focus on child predators as well as laws that protect adult cyberstalking victims or victims of any age Currently there are cyberstalking and related laws on the books While some sites specialize in laws that protect victims age and under Working to Halt Online Abuse is a help resource containing a list of current and pending cyberstalking related United States federal and state laws It also lists those states that do not yet have laws and related laws from other countries The Global Cyber Law Database GCLD aims to become the most comprehensive and authoritative source of cyber laws for all countries br Several states including Florida California and Missouri have passed laws against cyberbullying California prohibits the use of an electronic device to cause someone to fear for their life In Florida the Jeffrey Johnson Stand Up for All Students Act prohibits any type of bullying including cyberbullying In Missouri anyone who violently threatens someone over social media can be convicted with a Class A misdemeanor but if the victim is seventeen years or younger they can be convicted with a Class D felony br br br Demographics br Two studies from found that of body shaming tweets are sent by women who also account for of misogynistic tweets br br br Age br Children report negative online behaviors occurring from the second grade According to research boys initiate negative online activity earlier than girls However by middle school girls are more likely to engage in cyberbullying than boys Whether the bully is male or female the purpose of childhood bullying is to intentionally embarrass harass intimidate or make threats online br Studies on the psycho social effects of cyberspace have begun to monitor the effects cyberbullying may have on the victims Consequences of cyberbullying are multi faceted and affect both online and offline behavior Research on adolescents reported that changes in the victims behavior as a result of cyberbullying could potentially be positive Victims created a cognitive pattern of bullies which consequently helped them to recognize aggressive people br However the Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace abstract reports critical impacts in almost all of the respondents taking the form of lower self esteem loneliness disillusionment and distrust of people The more extreme effects included self harm Children have killed each other and committed suicide after cyberbullying incidents Some cases of digital self harm have been reported in which an individual engages in cyberbullying against themselves or purposefully and knowingly exposes themselves to cyberbullying br br br Adults br Cyberstalking may be an extension of physical stalking and may have criminal consequences A target s understanding of why cyberstalking is happening is helpful to remedy and take protective action Among factors that motivate stalkers are envy pathological obsession professional or sexual unemployment or failure with own job or life or the desire to intimidate and cause others to feel inferior The stalker may be delusional and believe they know the target The stalker wants to instill fear in a person to justify their status or may believe they can get away with these actions due to online anonymity br The US federal cyberstalking law is designed to prosecute people for using electronic means to repeatedly harass or threaten someone online There are resources dedicated to helping adult victims deal with cyberbullies legally and effectively One of the steps recommended is to record everything and contact police In Mexico Olimpia Coral Melo promoted the creation of a law against digital harassment that took her name the Olimpia Law br br br Gender br Research conducted to try to determine differences in cyberbullying patterns comparing male to female and ages of each are relatively inconclusive There are some factors that lean towards males being more involved in cyberbullying behaviors due to males tending to have more aggressive behaviors than females This is not proven but speculated based on literature reviews of research indicating that significant data is self reported Comparatively the review of articles indicates that age differences have some indicators of cyberbullying increasing age indicates increasing bullying behaviors Gender differences have mixed results but one finding indicated that younger females or and older males tend to engage in cyber bullying behaviors br Cyberbullies mostly have at least one common trait Cyberbullies generally get angry and discouraged easily and usually have strong personalities They connect with others belligerently and do not care for the feelings of their victims Both males and females engage in cyberbullying Females are involved in cyberbullying just as much as males and females are sometimes even found more involved in cyberbullying than males are The reason behind this is because of the way they respond men will usually respond with physical retaliation while women will use indirect forms such as gossiping As cyberbullying is a more indirect form women are more likely to be involved br Also women tend to have less face to face confrontations than men and since cyberbullying occurs online this allows women to have a greater chance to be attacked According to a Pew Research study on online harassment of Americans have been harassed because of their political views Such harassment affects men and women differently men are approximately twice as likely as women to have experienced online harassment because of their political views However women politicians are disproportionately more likely to be sexually harassed online Women lawmakers are three times more likely than their male counterparts to receive sexually abusive comments including threats of rape beatings death or abduction br br br Research br br br Australia br The nationwide Australian Covert Bullying Prevalence Survey Cross et al assessed cyberbullying experiences among students The results indicated that rates of cyberbullying increased with age with of students in Year reporting cyberbullying compared to in year nine Cross et al reported that rates of bullying and harassing others were lower but also increased with age Only of Year students reported cyberbullying others compared to of Year students br br br China br In mainland China cyberbullying has yet to receive adequate scholarly attention A study investigating the risk factors of cyberbullying sampled high school students from central China Data showed that had participated in bullying and had been bullied online br A study on cyberbullying in Hong Kong chose out of students from elementary school to high school who were classified as potential aggressors related to cyberbullying out of students declared they barely participated in cyber attacks It is common among high school students out of students to participate in social media platforms admitted to changing a nickname for others to humiliation to making fun of someone and to spreading rumors The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups interviewed teenagers of whom indicated having experienced cyberbullying This included insults abuse and the publishing of personal private pictures on social media without permission br br br European Union br In a study published in across EU member states studied an average of children years old had been bullied and only of them confessed to having been a bully However in an earlier publication by Hasenbrink et al reporting on the results from a meta analysis from European Union countries the authors estimated via median results that approximately of European young people had been bullied harassed stalked via the internet and mobile phones Cyberharassment rates for young people across the EU member states ranged from to br br br Finland br Sourander et al conducted a population based cross sectional study that took place in Finland The authors of this study took the self reports of Finish adolescents between the ages of and about cyberbullying and cybervictimization during the previous six months It was found that amongst the total sample were victims only were cyberbullies only and were cyberbully victims br The authors of this study were able to conclude that cyberbullying as well as cybervictimization is associated not only with psychiatric issues but with psychosomatic issues as well Many adolescents in the study reported headaches or difficulty sleeping The authors believe that their results indicate a greater need for new ideas on how to prevent cyberbullying and what to do when it occurs It is clearly a worldwide problem that needs to be taken seriously br br br Ireland br The Health Behaviour in School aged Children HBSC pilot survey was carried out in eight post primary schools across Ireland including students aged were boys and were girls Participation in this survey was voluntary for students and consent had to be obtained from parents students and the school itself This survey was anonymous and confidential and it took minutes to complete It asked questions on traditional forms of bullying as well as cyberbullying risk behaviors and self reported health and life satisfaction br of the students said that they had never been bullied had been victims of traditional forms of bullying had been victims of cyberbullying and the remaining had been victims of both traditional forms of bullying and cyberbullying Boys mostly said they were victims of traditional forms of bullying and girls mostly were victims of both traditional forms of bullying and cyberbullying of the students in this survey said that they had been cyberbullied showing that cyberbullying is on the rise br Arrow DIT claims that of year olds in Ireland have been bullied online or offline compared to in Europe Although online bullying in Ireland stands at according to Arrow DIT this is lower than the European average which stands at and half that of the UK where reported being cyberbullied Traditional forms of bullying in Ireland occur more often than in Europe br A study by Dublin City University DCU s National Anti Bullying Research and Resource Centre ABC found that almost of post primary teachers were victims of cyberbullying and knew of a colleague who had experienced it in the previous months of the bullying was by pupils mainly on social media with the rest perpetrated by parents and other school staff Various effects on bullied teachers included increased stress and anxiety negative impacts on their working environment and a reluctance to report the issue and seek help from management br br br Japan br According to recent research in Japan percent compared with a country average of percent of youth between the ages of and have been victims of online bullying The number shows that online bullying is a serious concern in Japan Teenagers who spend more than hours a week on the Internet are more likely to become the targets of online bullying though only percent of the survey participants understood what cyberbullying is However they do know the severity of the issue percent of the surveyed students worried about being targeted as victims of cyberbullying br Since teenagers find themselves congregating socially on the internet via social media they become easy targets for cyberbullying Cyberbullying may occur via email text chat rooms and social media websites Some cyberbullies set up websites or blogs to post the target s images publicize their personal information gossip about the target express why they hate the target request people to agree with the bully s view and send links to the target to make sure they are watching the activity br Much cyberbullying is an act of relational aggression which involves alienating the victim from peers through gossip or ostracism This kind of attack can be easily launched via texting or other online activities One year old Japanese student was targeted by classmates who posted his photo online insulted him constantly and asked him to die Because of the constant harassment he did attempt suicide twice Even when he quit school the attacks did not stop br Cyberbullying can cause serious psychological impact to the victims They often feel anxious nervous tired and depressed Other examples of negative psychological trauma include losing confidence as a result of being socially isolated from their schoolmates or friends Psychological problems can also show up in the form of headaches skin problems abdominal pain sleep problems bed wetting and crying It may also lead victims to commit suicide to end the bullying br br br United States br br br br A survey by the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire found that of the young people who completed the survey had experienced some form of harassment including threats and negative rumors and had suffered distressing harassment br br br br The I Safe org survey of students between grades and found br br of children had been bullied online One in four had experienced it more than once br had been threatened online Nearly one in five had experienced it more than once br had received mean or threatening e mails or other messages br admitted that someone had said hurtful things to them online More than four out of ten said this had happened more than once br had not told their parents or an adult about something hurtful that had happened to them online br br br br The Youth Internet Safety Survey conducted by the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire in found that of the young people in the survey had experienced some form of harassment The survey was a nationally representative telephone survey of youth years old One third reported feeling distressed by the incident with distress being more likely for younger respondents and those who were the victims of aggressive harassment including being telephoned sent gifts or visited at home by the harasser Compared to youth not harassed online victims are more likely to have social problems On the other hand youth who harass others are more likely to have problems with rule breaking and aggression br Hinduja and Patchin completed a study in the summer of of approximately Internet using adolescents and found that over one third of youth reported being victimized online and over of respondents admitted to cyberbullying others While most of the instances of cyberbullying involved relatively minor behavior were disrespected were called names over were physically threatened and about were scared for their safety Notably fewer than of victims told an adult about the incident Additional research by Hinduja and Patchin in found that youth who report being victims of cyberbullying also experience stress or strain that is related to offline problem behaviors such as running away from home cheating on a test skipping school or using alcohol or marijuana The authors acknowledge that both of these studies provide only preliminary information about the nature and consequences of online bullying due to the methodological challenges associated with an online survey br According to a survey by the National Children s Home charity and Tesco Mobile of youth between the ages of and of respondents revealed that they had been bullied via electronic means Almost three quarters stated that they knew the bully while stated that the offender was a stranger of responders indicated that another person had taken a picture and or video of them via a cellular phone camera consequently making them feel uncomfortable embarrassed or threatened Many youths are not comfortable telling an authority figure about their cyberbullying victimization for fear their access to technology will be taken from them while and told a parent or teacher respectively did not tell anyone and told a friend br br br br According to the Harris Interactive Cyberbullying Research Report commissioned by the National Crime Prevention Council cyberbullying is a problem that affects almost half of all American teens br br br br br Studies published in in the Journal of Adolescent Health indicated young people reporting being victims of electronic aggression in a range of to br In Debbie Heimowitz a Stanford University master s student created Adina s Deck a film based on Stanford accredited research She worked in focus groups for ten weeks in three schools to learn about the problem of cyberbullying in northern California The findings determined that over of students had been cyberbullied and were victims of cyberbullying The film is now being used in classrooms nationwide as it was designed around learning goals pertaining to problems that students had understanding the topic The middle school of Megan Meier is reportedly using the film as a solution to the crisis in their town br br br br In researchers Sameer Hinduja Florida Atlantic University and Justin Patchin University of Wisconsin Eau Claire published a book on cyberbullying that summarized the current state of cyberbullying research Bullying Beyond the Schoolyard Preventing and Responding to Cyberbullying Their research documented that cyberbullying instances had been increasing over the preceding several years They also reported findings from a then recent study of cyberbullying In a random sample of approximately middle school students from a large school district in the southern United States about of respondents reported being cyberbullied in the previous days while over reported having been cyberbullied at least once in their lifetime While these rates are slightly lower than some of the findings from their previous research Hinduja and Patchin pointed out that the earlier studies were predominantly conducted among older adolescents and Internet samples that is older youth use the Internet more frequently and are more likely to experience cyberbullying than younger children br br br br br According to the National Crime Victimization Survey conducted by the U S Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics School Crime Supplement SCS of students age admitted to having experienced cyberbullying during that school year with a coefficient of variation between and br br br br In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey the Center for Surveillance Epidemiology and Laboratory Services of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published results of its survey as part of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System YRBSS in June indicating the percentage of school children being bullied through e mail chat rooms instant messaging websites or texting electronically bullied during the course of br br br br In Mehari Farrell and Le published a study that focused on the literature on cyberbullying among adolescents They found that researchers have generally assumed that cyberbullying is distinct from aggression perpetrated in person Mehari et al suggest that the media through which aggression is perpetrated may be best conceptualized as a new classification of aggression rather than considering cyberbullying as a distinct counterpart to existing forms of aggression They suggest that future research on cyberbullying be considered within the context of theoretical and empirical knowledge of aggression in adolescence br Mary Howlett Brandon s doctoral dissertation analyzed the National Crime Victimization Survey Student Crime Supplement to focus on the cyberbullying victimization of Black and White students in specific conditions br br br br WalletHub s s Best Worst States at Controlling Bullying report measured the relative levels of bullying in states According to the report North Dakota Illinois Louisiana Rhode Island and Washington D C have the most attempted suicides by high school students The five states with highest percentage of students being bullied on campus are Missouri Michigan Idaho North Dakota and Montana br

cyberbullying has been introduced in a number of U S states including New York Missouri Rhode Island and Maryland At least states have passed laws against digital harassment Dardenne Prairie of

state legislation with task forces expected to have cyberbullying laws drafted and implemented In June Rep Linda Sanchez D Calif and Rep Kenny Hulshof R Mo proposed a federal law that would criminalize acts of cyberbullying br Lawmakers are seeking to address cyberbullying with new legislation because there is currently no specific law on the books that deals with it A fairly new federal cyberstalking law might address such acts according to Parry Aftab but no one has been prosecuted under it yet The proposed federal law would make it illegal to use electronic means to coerce intimidate harass or cause other substantial emotional distress br In August the California state legislature passed one of the first laws in the country to deal directly with cyberbullying Assembly Bill gives school administrators the authority to discipline students for bullying offline or online This law took effect on January br A law in New York s Albany County that criminalized cyberbullying was struck down as unconstitutional by the New York Court of Appeals in People v Marquan M br A recent ruling first seen in the UK determined that it is possible for an Internet service provider ISP to be liable for the content of the sites it hosts setting a precedent that any ISP should treat a notice of complaint seriously and investigate it immediately br U S C c criminalizes the making of threats via the Internet br While some states have laws that require schools to mediate cyberbullying conflicts several states have been sued on First Amendment grounds for doing so By examining the decisions of three such lawsuits heard in lower courts Alvin J Primack and Kevin A Johnson argued that current First Amendment doctrine particularly the case of Morse v Frederick may offer interpretive resources for justifying administrative reach to some online digital speech They concluded w ithout clearer standards school administrators are likely to feel constrained and err on the side of inaction br br br United Kingdom br In early February ministers of the UK parliament planned to add to their proposed Online Safety Bill several criminal offences against those who send death threats online or deliberately share dangerous disinformation about fake Covid cures Other new offences such as revenge porn posts advertising people smuggling and messages encouraging people to commit suicide would fall under the responsibilities of online platforms like Facebook and Twitter to tackle br br br Philippines br br The Cybercrime Prevention Act of defines cyberlibel as a punishable offence under Section of the Revised Penal Code of br br br European Union br Since the s the United Kingdom and other European countries have been working to solve workplace bullying since there is no legislation regulating cyberbullying The pervasive nature of technology has made the act of bullying online much easier A hour internet connection gives bullies a neverending opportunity to find and bully victims Employers in the European Union have more legal responsibility to their employees than do those in other countries Since employers do not have the ability to fire or hire an employee at will like in the United States employers in Europe are held to a high standard in how their employees are treated br In the European Union developed the Framework Agreement on Harassment and Violence at Work a law that prevents bullying occurring in the workplace and holds employers accountable for providing fair working conditions The law defines the responsibilities of an employer such as protecting their employees from bullies in a work environment and the psychological pain a victim faces from bullies during business hours Lawyers pursuing cyberbullying cases use the Ordinance on Victimization at Work law since there are not any laws specifically condemning cyberbullying br In Sweden was the first European Union country to have a law against cyberbullying The Ordinance on Victimization at Work protected victims from recurrent reprehensible or distinctly negative actions which are directed which are directed against individual employees in an offensive manner and can result in those employees being placed outside the workplace community br In France passed the Social Modernization Law which added consequences to the French Labor Code for cyberbullying such as holding employers accountable for their involvement in harassment The legislation defines moral harassment as repeated acts leading to a deterioration of the working conditions and that are likely to harm the dignity the physical or psychological heath of the victim or his professional career br The United Kingdom does not have anti bullying legislation However it does have the Protection From Harassment Act an anti stalking law U K courts have used this legislation in bullying cases br br The United States and some other countries have more extensive legislation on cyberbullying than the European Union Cyberbullying incidents on social media are widespread and have increased drastically in number However the process of getting a claim against a bully is not an easy one because of the victim s need to provide sufficient evidence to prove the existence of bullying br As of mid countries in the European Union like the United Kingdom are in the process of creating laws specially related to cyberbullying Since the process takes time the government is supporting school programs to promote internet safety with the help of teachers and parents This will allow the government to take the time it needs to create the cyberbullying laws while helping safeguard students from cyberbullying as much as possible br br br Research on preventive legislation br br Researchers suggest that programs be put in place for prevention of cyberbullying These programs would be incorporated into school curricula and would include online safety and instruction on how to use the Internet properly This could teach the victim proper methods of potentially avoiding the cyberbully such as blocking messages or increasing the security of their computer br Even in a perfect world no crime can be stopped fully That is why it is suggested that within this prevention method effective coping strategies should be introduced and adopted People can adopt coping strategies to combat future cyberbullying Coping strategies may include social support groups composed of victims of cyberbullying which could allow students to share their stories and remove the feeling of being alone br Teachers should be involved in all prevention educational models as they are essentially the police of the classroom Most cyberbullying often goes unreported as the victim feels nothing can be done to help in their current situation However if given the proper tools with preventive measures and more power in the classroom teachers can be of assistance if the parent teacher and victim can work together solutions may be found br There have been many legislative attempts to facilitate the control of bullying and cyberbullying Some existing legislation is incorrectly thought to be tied to bullying and cyberbullying including terms such as libel and slander The problem is that the existing legislation does not directly apply to bullying nor define it as its own criminal behavior Anti cyberbullying advocates have even expressed concern about the broad scope of some of the bills attempted to be passed br In the United States attempts have been made to pass legislation against cyberbullying Few states attempted to pass broad sanctions in an effort to prohibit cyberbullying Problems include how to define cyberbullying and cyberstalking and if charges are pressed whether this violates the bully s freedom of speech B Walther said that Illinois is the only state to criminalize electronic communication s sent for the purpose of harassing another person when the activity takes place outside a public school setting This was criticized for infringement on freedom of speech br Preventing a child from being cyberbullied is hard but now they are working to form programs and laws to help stop the issue from getting worse than it already is They have created movies such as Cyberbully by Charles Biname and The Duff by Ari Sandel for teenagers to watch and see how cyberbullying can affect an individual Children that are victims of this problem feel they can not go to an adult for help because they may feel embarrassed by the situation Bullying online will not only hurt the teenager emotionally but there is also a risk of the child hurting themselves physically as well in suicide was the tenth leading cause of death among persons in the United States br Being able to tell if a child is being hurt from this issue can be tough but there are certain things that a child will do that should give a red flag that they are being bullied A cyberbully could have said nasty words to that child and the victim could be looking for compliments If the victim is always online wondering when the bully will strike next that could also be a sign Being an active parent in their children s lives will make a difference on whether their child is experiencing online bullying or not Also bringing police involved in the case will be a problem solver too br br br Harmful effects br Research has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization Victims may have lower self esteem increased suicidal ideation and a variety of emotional responses including being scared frustrated angry and depressed Cyberbullying may be more harmful than traditional bullying because there is no escaping it One of the most damaging effects is that a victim begins to avoid friends and activities which is often the very intention of the bully br Cyberbullying campaigns are sometimes so damaging that victims have committed suicide There are at least four examples in the United States in which cyberbullying has been linked to the suicide of a teenager The suicide of Megan Meier is an example that led to the conviction of the adult perpetrator of the attacks Holly Grogan committed suicide by jumping off a foot bridge near Gloucester in the UK It was reported that a number of her schoolmates had posted a number of hateful messages on her Facebook page br According to Lucie Russell director of campaigns policy and participation at youth mental health charity Young Minds young people who suffer from mental disorders are vulnerable to cyberbullying as they are sometimes unable to shrug it off br br When someone says nasty things healthy people can filter that out they re able to put a block between that and their self esteem But mentally unwell people don t have the strength and the self esteem to do that to separate it and so it gets compiled with everything else To them it becomes the absolute truth there s no filter there s no block That person will take that on take it as fact br Social media has allowed bullies to disconnect from the impact they may be having on others br br br Intimidation emotional damage and suicide br According to the Cyberbullying Research Center there have been several high profile cases involving teenagers taking their own lives in part because of being harassed and mistreated over the Internet a phenomenon we have termed cyberbullicide suicide indirectly or directly influenced by experiences with online aggression br Cyberbullying is an intense form of psychological abuse whose victims are more than twice as likely to suffer from mental disorders compared to traditional bullying br The reluctance youth have in telling an authority figure about instances of cyberbullying has led to fatal outcomes At least three children between the ages of and have committed suicide due to depression brought on by cyberbullying according to reports by USA Today and the Baltimore Examiner These include the suicide of Ryan Halligan and the suicide of Megan Meier the latter of which resulted in United States v Lori Drew Teen suicides tied to cyberbullying have recently become more prevalent Rebecca Ann Sedwick committed suicide after being terrorized through mobile applications such as Ask fm Kik Messenger and Voxer br br br On youth and teenagers br The effects of cyberbullying vary but research illustrates that cyberbullying adversely affects youth to a higher degree than adolescents and adults Youth are more likely to suffer since they are still growing mentally and physically Jennifer N Caudle a certified family physician says Kids that are bullied are likely to experience anxiety depression loneliness unhappiness and poor sleep br br Most of the time cyberbullying goes unnoticed the younger generation hides their bullying from anyone that can help to prevent the bullying from occurring and from getting worse Between and of adolescents are victims of cyberbullying worldwide The youth slowly change their behaviors and actions so they become more withdrawn and quiet but this may go unnoticed since the change is subtle Metin Deniz believes cyberbullying will become a serious problem in the future with an increase in the Internet and mobile phone usage among young people br If preventive actions are not taken against cyberbullying younger children in addition to teenagers will feel more lonely and depressed along with having significant changes in their eating and sleeping patterns as well as loss of interest in their normal activities These changes will affect their growth and development into adulthood Younger children and teenagers are less likely to display suicidal behaviors and thoughts but are still at risk depending on other factors such as mental health status home care and relationships with others The risk of suicide increases by to when victims do not have any support from anyone in their life and cyberbullying amplifies the situation br Young people seem particularly vulnerable to the effects of cyberbullying through anonymous social media perhaps because adolescents are attracted to these platforms as a means of seeking validation from their peers Abuse on these platforms such as ASKfm Yik Yak and Sarahah can be particularly keenly felt by young people leading to issues of loss of confidence There have been a number of suicides related to bullying on these platforms in the US and Britain br br br Suppression of speech br By at least some doctors have been targets of online harassment from anti vaccine activists responding to their social media posts including hundreds of negative false reviews on doctor ratings sites This made some of the doctors more reluctant to share information about vaccines but others formed groups to spread factual information about vaccine safety on social media in response br br br Awareness br br br Campaigns br br br International br The
