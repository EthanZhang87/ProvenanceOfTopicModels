In computing a theme is a preset package containing graphical appearance and functionality details A theme usually comprises a set of shapes and colors for the graphical control elements the window decoration and the window Themes are used to customize the look and feel of a piece of computer software or of an operating system br Also known as a skin or visual style in Windows XP it is a custom graphical appearance preset package achieved by the use of a graphical user interface GUI that can be applied to specific computer software operating system and websites to suit the purpose topic or tastes of different users As such a skin can completely change the look and feel and navigation interface of a piece of application software or operating system br Software that is capable of having a skin applied is referred to as being skinnable and the process of writing or applying such a skin is known as skinning Applying a skin changes a piece of software s look and feel some skins merely make the program more aesthetically pleasing but others can rearrange elements of the interface potentially making the program easier to use br br br Use br Themes are often used to change the look and feel of a wide range of things at once which makes them much less granular than allowing the user to set each option individually For example users might want the window borders from a particular theme but installing it would also alter the desktop background br One method for dealing with this is to allow the user to select which parts of the theme they want to load for example in Windows users could load the background and screensaver from a theme but leave the icons and sounds untouched br br br Video gaming br In video games the term skin is similarly used to refer to an in game character or cosmetic options for a player s character and other in game items which can range from different color schemes to more elaborate designs and costumes Skins are often awarded as unlockable content for completing specific in game goals or milestones Skins can sometimes include historical incarnations of the player character such as Insomniac Games Spider Man which includes unlockable skins based on Spider Man s past comic book and film appearances as well as crossovers with other video games such as Final Fantasy XIII offering a costume based on Ezio Auditore from the Assassin s Creed franchise and Super Smash Bros Ultimate offering costume items based on other video game characters for its customizable Mii Fighter characters Fortnite Battle Royale has similarly featured extensive uses of licensed properties as the basis for skins also including non gaming properties such as comic book characters the National Football League and musicians br Skins are sometimes distributed as part of downloadable content and as pre order incentives for newly released games In the s skins were increasingly deemed a virtual good as part of monetization strategies especially within free to play games and those otherwise treated as a service Via microtransactions commonly known as loot boxes a player can earn a random selection of in game items which may include skins and other cosmetic items of varying rarity While often defended as being similar in practice to booster packs for collectible card games researchers have deemed loot boxes to be psychologically akin to gambling and their inclusion in full priced games have faced criticism from players for being an anti consumer practice They have largely been supplanted by battle passes which are collections of in game challenges and goals that unlock reward tiers over a short or long term period br Via the Steam platform Counter Strike Global Offensive and Team Fortress also allow players to trade these items which has led to communities devoted to bartering them for real world money as well as gambling br br br Themed systems br br br Operating systems br Microsoft Windows br Microsoft Windows first supported themes in Windows as a separate application package called Microsoft Plus for Windows Themes were later supported in Windows and was built in there These operating systems as well as its successor Windows Me came with themes that customized desktop backgrounds icons user interface colors Windows sounds and mouse cursors Windows XP expanded Windows theming support by adding visual styles and allowing each theme to specify one This feature was carried over to Windows Vista which added Windows Aero but was removed with Windows Third party apps such as WindowBlinds TuneUp Utilities and Desktop Architect enhance theme capabilities Support for custom themes can also be added by patching system files which is not endorsed by Microsoft br Linux br Linux operating systems may support themes depending on their window managers and desktop environments IceWM uses themes to customize its taskbar window borders and time format Window Maker can store colors for icons menus and window borders in a theme but this is independent of the wallpaper settings GNOME and KDE use two independent sets of themes one to alter the appearance of user interface elements such as buttons scroll bars or list elements and another theme to customize the appearance of windows such as window borders and title bars br macOS br macOS does not natively support themes Third party apps such as Kaleidoscope and ShapeShifter may add this br Android br Although Android does not support themes the forked CyanogenMod and its successor LineageOS have native theme support The CM theme engine is in turn used on many other forked Android ROMs such as Paranoid Android br br br Apps br Firefox and Google Chrome either support or supported a form of theme Firefox and its sibling Thunderbird supports themes either through lightweight themes formerly Personas or complete themes While lightweight themes are simply background images for toolbar Firefox toolbars complete themes have more power to modify Firefox s appearance Google Chrome version or later allows themes to alter the appearance of the browser Internet Explorer and its immediate successor allowed the background picture of their toolbars to be customized br The most popular skins are for instant messaging clients media center and media player software such as Trillian and Winamp due to the association with fun that such programs try to encourage br br br Standard interface br Some platforms support changing the standard interface including most using the X Window System For those that do not programs can add the functionality like WindowBlinds for Microsoft Windows and ShapeShifter for macOS br br br Websites br Many websites are skinnable particularly those that provide social capabilities Some sites provide skins that make primarily cosmetic changes while some such as H G offer skins that make major changes to page layout As with standalone software interfaces this is facilitated by the underlying technology of the website XML and XSLT for instance facilitate major changes of layout while CSS can easily produce different visual styles br br br See also br Aqua user interface br Computer
