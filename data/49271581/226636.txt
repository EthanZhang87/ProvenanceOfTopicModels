SIMPLE the Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions is an instant messaging IM and presence protocol suite based on Session Initiation Protocol SIP managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force br br br Purpose br SIMPLE applies SIP to the problems of br br registering for presence information and receiving notifications when such events occur for example when a user logs in or comes back from lunch br sending short messages analogous to SMS or two way paging br managing a session of real time messages between two or more participants br Implementations of the SIMPLE based protocols can be found in SIP Softphones and also in SIP Hardphones br br br Technical description br br br Presence br The SIMPLE presence specifications can be broken up into br br The core protocol machinery This provides the actual SIP extensions for subscriptions notifications and publications RFC defines the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods SUBSCRIBE allows users to subscribe to an event on a server the server responds with NOTIFY whenever the event occurs RFC defines how to make use of SUBSCRIBE NOTIFY for presence Two models are defined an end to end model in which each User Agent handles presence subscriptions itself and a centralized model The latter introduces the concept of a presence server all subscriptions are handled by this server The message PUBLISH RFC allows User Agents to inform the presence server about their subscription states br Presence documents The presence information is coded in XML documents that are carried in the bodies of the respective SIP messages RFC and RFC describe this procedure RFC RPID RFC RFC CPID and various drafts describe contents and formats of the presence documents br Privacy policy and provisioning If the centralized model is used the User Agents need a way to define who may subscribe to which amount of their presence information RFC and RFC define a framework for authorization policies controlling access to application specific data The XCAP RFC carried by HTTP allows User Agents to communicate their presence rules to a XCAP server which rules the information exposed by the presence server RFC and RFC define a subscription event watcher info User Agents may subscribe to this event to be informed who is subscribing to their presence information br br br IM br SIP defines two modes of instant messaging br br The Page Mode makes use of the SIP method MESSAGE as defined in RFC This mode establishes no sessions br The Session Mode The Message Session Relay Protocol RFC RFC is a text based protocol for exchanging arbitrarily sized content between users at any time An MSRP session is set up by exchanging certain information such as an MSRP URI within SIP and SDP signalling br br br See also br Message Session Relay Protocol MSRP br Presence and Instant Messaging PRIM br br br br br br External links br SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions simple WG IETF Datatracker br Rich Presence A New User Communications Experience Technology White Paper
