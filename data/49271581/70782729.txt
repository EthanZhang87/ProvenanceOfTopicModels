the Buffalo police commissioner they uncovered information that if he escaped the supermarket he had plans to continue his attack The county s district attorney said he had evidence that Gendron was motivated by racial animosity According to law enforcement sources who spoke to The Buffalo News they were investigating Gendron s alleged contact with a number of people online including a retired federal agent and whether these individuals had thirty minutes of advance notice of the attack yet did not notify the authorities br A separate investigation into the conduct of a operator during the shooting began on May An assistant manager at the Tops store reportedly called and spoke to the dispatcher in a whisper in order to avoid detection by Gendron The employee was then reportedly shouted at by the dispatcher who wondered aloud why the woman was whispering and then allegedly hung up on her The Office of the Erie County Executive announced the dispatcher was placed on administrative leave and was then fired after a disciplinary hearing br br br Perpetrator br Payton S Gendron born June is a white male and was years old at the time of the shooting He had traveled three and a half hours to the supermarket from his hometown of Conklin New York about miles km away Gendron graduated from the Susquehanna Valley High School and was previously enrolled at SUNY Broome Community College in Binghamton for an engineering science program His parents are civil engineers and according to his neighbors Gendron has previously stated an intention to become one as well Former classmates of Gendron who were interviewed by The New York Times claimed that Gendron was quiet had rarely attended in person classes and exhibited a range of idiosyncratic behaviors including wearing a hazmat suit to class br The police said that Gendron had been in Buffalo in early March and was also there the day before the shooting and that he had carried out reconnaissance at the Tops supermarket According to police he had researched previous hate motivated attacks and shootings According to a childhood friend of Gendron s Gendron came to the friend s house the day before the shooting and left five boxes of ammunition at the house Supposedly Gendron told the friend he needed to leave the ammunition because Gendron needed to rearrange his own house and that Gendron would need to retrieve the ammunition later br br br Investigation of previous threat br In June Gendron had been investigated for threatening other students at his high school by the police in Broome County A teacher had asked him about his plans after the school year to which Gendron responded I want to murder and commit suicide He was referred to a hospital for mental health evaluation and counseling but was released after being held for a day and a half br Gendron told police that he was merely joking however Gendron later wrote online that this was actually a well executed bluff He was not charged in connection with the incident since according to investigators he had not made a specific enough threat to warrant further action The New York State Police did not seek an order from a state court to remove guns from Gendron s possession The mental health evaluation was not an involuntary commitment which would have prohibited him from buying guns under federal law br br br Weapons br Gendron cleared the background check by filling in Form as is typically required under U S federal law During the purchase of the Bushmaster XM AR style rifle used in the shooting the seller said that Gendron passed the background check and that the seller did not remember Gendron Gendron cleared another check while purchasing a shotgun at a store in the neighboring town of Great Bend Pennsylvania located miles km away from his Conklin house saying that he would use it for target practice this shotgun was later recovered by police from Gendron s automobile Since New York prohibits the purchase and or possession of ammunition magazines capable of holding more than rounds of ammunition Gendron traveled to Pennsylvania from his home in New York to purchase a round ammunition magazine Before the shooting Gendron wrote that he had purchased a rifle and illegally modified it in order to enable it to hold round magazines Gendron also wrote that he selected an AR style rifle for its effectiveness and that he specifically selected the Bushmaster XM for its notoriety br On one of his rifles Gendron had reportedly written the word nigger along with references to reparations Gendron s gun also reportedly was covered with references to white supremacist mass murderers Dylann Roof Robert Bowers Brenton Tarrant and John Earnest the acronym SYGAOWN Stop Your Genocide Against Our White Nations far right slang Buck status broken the year a reference to the manifesto of Anders Behring Breivik and a depiction of the Archangel Michael s Cross of the fascist Romanian Iron Guard A law enforcement source told The Daily Beast that Gendron had also written on his rifle the names of one or more victims of the Waukesha Christmas parade attack On the weapons in his car which had not been used during the shooting he reportedly had written White Lives Matter and according to CNN what appears to be the name of a victim of a crime committed by a black suspect br br br Manifesto br Prior to the shooting Gendron supposedly wrote and released online a page manifesto that primarily references the topic of mass immigration The manifesto was originally posted on Google Docs on the evening of May two days before the attack and according to file data it has not been modified since Federal law enforcement sources told CNN that they were reviewing the document along with Gendron s page online diary The manifesto contains biographical information of the author identical to that of Gendron such as the author sharing Gendron s birth date br The author describes himself as someone who initially identified as being on the authoritarian left before he developed American neo Nazi antisemitic eco fascist ethno nationalist populist and white supremacist views He claims to have adopted these ideological stances after he visited the discussion board pol on chan an imageboard as well as the website The Daily Stormer beginning in May on which he saw infographics shitposts and memes around the beginning of the COVID pandemic in the United States The manifesto primarily promotes the white nationalist and far right Great Replacement conspiracy theory of Renaud Camus which claims that elites are promoting immigration and decreasing white birth rates in an attempt to subject whites to a genocide The manifesto also says that Jews and societal elites are responsible for transgender inclusivity and non white immigration that Black people disproportionately kill white people and that non whites will overwhelm and wipe out the white race br The manifesto s author also expressed support for far right mass shooters Dylann Roof Anders Behring Breivik and Brenton Tarrant About of the document is plagiarized from other sources especially Tarrant s manifesto As much as of the text based ideological sections were plagiarized in this manner this was measured by excluding the sections which consisted of Internet meme images other pictures taken from online and logistical discussion about the equipment for the attack br The planning for the attack commenced in January Buffalo was targeted because it was the city closest to the author s home that had the most Black residents He then proceeded to select the ZIP code area within Buffalo with the highest percentage of Black residents The manifesto includes extensive details about preparations for the supermarket attack itself and a plan to following the initial shooting travel to a majority Black neighborhood in Buffalo to conduct further attacks It characterizes the attack as having been intended to terrorize all nonwhite non Christian people and get them to leave the country br br br Activity on chat logs br Gendron is also reported to have had an account on the chat platform Discord with the same username as the Twitch user who livestreamed the attack Thousands of chat logs were retrieved from the account s postings in a private chatroom which were written in the form of an online diary and range from November to May The logs include photos of Gendron and the author claimed to be Gendron Police said that they believed the messages are genuine The chat logs reference a speeding ticket that is consistent with one received by Gendron The logs also include to do list items seemingly indicating that the author was preparing for the attack The chat logs indicated that the attack was originally planned to occur on March so that the author could commemorate the anniversary of the Christchurch mosque shootings However the attack was delayed due to the author developing a case of COVID The logs contained indications from as early as November that the author planned to livestream a mass shooting targeting Black people He claimed authorship of a post on chan from November that said a brenton tarrant event sic will happen again soon br The online diary also had sketches of the layout of the inside of the Tops supermarket The diary mentions visits to the supermarket on March During these visits the author notes being challenged by the security guard which the author described a close call He also noted the numbers of Black people and White people in the supermarket during his visits The author considered attacking various locations including a Walmart in Rochester New York and institutions with predominantly Black attendees such as churches malls and elementary schools He also considered attacking synagogues but decided against it because March would not fall on a Saturday the Jewish sabbath thus synagogues were not likely to have many attendees at the author s desired time to attack He wrote that he used data available through Google to determine when the busiest times in the supermarket would be br The author of the online diary described himself as being socially isolated He said I would like to say I had quite a normal childhood but that is not the case He also said It s not that I actually dislike other people it s just that they make me feel so uncomfortable I ve probably spent actual years of my life just being online And to be honest I regret it I didn t go to friend s houses often or go to any parties or whatever Every day after school I would just go home and play games and watch YouTube mostly by my self sic In another entry he added If I could go back maybe I d tell myself to get the fuck off chan and get an actual life At one point in the chat logs the author describes killing and mutilating a cat The chat logs include occasional suicidal ideation and self doubt from the author br In a post from December the author describes staying in the emergency room of a hospital for hours on May as a result of stating his intention to commit murder suicide in an online assignment for his economics class He described the hospital stay as a very negative experience from which he gained encouragement to take action In other entries he posted photos of modifications he made to his rifle so that it could be equipped with round magazines while acknowledging that this was illegal in New York He also posted details about obtaining other equipment for a planned attack such as body armor and a helmet br About minutes before the shooting began invitations to the chatroom that hosted the online diary logs were sent to a small group of other Discord users After that point at least fifteen other users joined the chatroom and would have been able to view the chat logs According to a Discord spokesperson they found no indication that any other users were aware of the diary before that time The logs author also sent others online messages containing links to the Twitch livestream which he would later use to show the attack According to the message attached to the invite Discord users could also view a livestream through the Discord chatroom as opposed to the Twitch livestream The chatroom was disabled when Discord learned about its alleged relationship to the shooting br Other than the online diary chat logs related to the attack were also retrieved from a second chatroom on Discord where members primarily discussed weapons as a dedicated topic There the user reported to have been Gendron sought advice regarding equipment such as body armor Prior to the shooting the livestream footage quickly leaked to multiple other social media sites including Facebook Twitter

transferred to Livingston County Jail in Geneseo New York br br br Federal br As of the date of his state sentencing Gendron was still facing federal charges In December Gendron s lawyer indicated that he would be willing to plead guilty to the federal charges to avoid the death penalty On January the Department of Justice said that it would seek the death penalty making this the first death penalty case under Garland who had in the past expressed his opposition to capital punishment In explaining their reasons to seek the death penalty the prosecutors stated that Gendron s decision to select the supermarket showed he planned to maximize the number of Black victims his beliefs in white supremacy and the substantial planning and premeditation behind the crime were among the factors they considered in seeking capital punishment for Gendron Gendron s trial is set to begin on September br br br Reactions br br br National br President Joe Biden offered his prayers for the victims and their families he called the shooting a racially motivated hate crime an act of domestic terrorism and went on to call white supremacy a poison running through our body politic The Erie County

service was used to broadcast the shooting It said that the account that posted the livestream had been indefinitely suspended and that any attempts to re stream the footage would be monitored and prohibited Gendron s livestream was removed less than two minutes after the violence started according to a spokesperson it was unclear if he was still actively firing at the time The livestream was recorded by at least one individual and posted to the site Streamable where it had acquired more than million views by May The spread of the video on other sites has led to discussions about social media sites liability responses to similar content and free speech on the sites br br br Fox News as a potential inspiration br br American publications widely condemned the conspiracy theories including the notion of a white genocide supposedly occurring in the U S advocated by the assailant The Daily Beast journalist Andy Craig has argued that beliefs centered around the claim that there is a deliberate plot to commit to genocide against white Americans using non white immigration as its supposed primary means created a noxious brew of ideas that animated the killer recommending that all supporters of freedom of speech as an ideal condemn such extremist thinking Gendron s claim of a Great Replacement has drawn increased scrutiny of Republican political and media figures who have made statements embracing or echoing the conspiracy most prominently Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson National Review a conservative news magazine criticized this scrutiny of Carlson with columnist Dan McLaughlin saying He never mentioned Tucker Carlson and he expressed his hatred for Fox News in the manifesto In response Carlson said that the suspect s manifesto was not recognizably left wing or right wing it s not really political at all The document is crazy However Kate Maltby writing for The Jewish Chronicle drew attention to language Gendron used in his reported manifesto attacking diversity which is similar to wording Carlson employed in one of his broadcasts House Republican Conference chair Elise Stefanik the third highest ranking Republican in the U S House also had attention drawn to her hardline views in the conspiracy theory that the Democratic Party is trying to replace or overwhelm Republican voters with immigrants using an open door immigration policy in order to win elections br Footage from the Buffalo shooting was reportedly included on a violence glorifying website created by the Colorado Springs shooting s suspect br br br Legislative br The proposed Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act which would have established domestic terrorism offices in the DOJ and FBI focused on neo Nazis and white supremacy passed the House on May but failed in the Senate on May Republicans argued that the measure duplicated already existing efforts by American law enforcement while also risking targeting individuals unfairly as political extremists Democrats noted the tough polarization in Congress while arguing that the Republicans failed to compromise on pragmatic changes to fight gun deaths br On June the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary held hearings to examine the Metastasizing Domestic Terrorism Threat After the Buffalo Attack The Committee heard testimony from the son of rampage victim Ruth Whitfield former commissioner of the Buffalo Fire Department Garnell Whitfield Jr who asked the committee to imagine the faces of your mothers as you look at the face of my mother Mrs Ruth Whitfield and ask yourself is there nothing we can do Is there nothing that you personally are willing to do to stop the cancer of white supremacy and the domestic terrorism it inspires br In response to this attack as well as the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde Texas that occurred days afterwards the New York State Legislature passed laws banning semi automatic sales to most people under as well as certain types of body armor br br br Local br New York Governor Kathy Hochul traveled to Buffalo to assist with the response Governor Hochul said we ll be aggressive in our pursuit of anyone who subscribes to the ideals professed by other white supremacists and how there s a feeding frenzy on social media platforms where hate festers more hate Hochul called for stronger federal gun violence prevention legislation saying What has made this so lethal and so devastating for this community was the high capacity magazine that would have had to have been purchased elsewhere that s not legal in the state of New York br The attorney for one of the victims families Benjamin Crump has argued that public policy changes need to take place to fight political extremist activism as a result of the shooting He remarked We have to direct our attention to these internet sites that inspire these young people that are radicalizing them to be hate mongers to be people who hate people because the color of their skin br The New York State Education Department announced that it was cancelling the U S Government and History Regents Exam because it contained a question that the department determined might be upsetting to students in the
