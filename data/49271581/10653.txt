A fantasy sport also known less commonly as rotisserie or roto is a game often played using the Internet where participants assemble imaginary or virtual teams composed of proxies of real players of a professional sport These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those players in actual games This performance is converted into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected by each fantasy team s manager These point systems can be simple enough to be manually calculated by a league commissioner who coordinates and manages the overall league or points can be compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of the professional sport In fantasy sports as in real sports team owners draft trade and cut drop players br br br History br br br Early simulations br The history of fantasy games can be traced to the th century The tabletop game Sebring Parlor Base Ball introduced in allowed participants to simulate games by propelling a coin into slots on a wooden board Later games featured outcomes determined by dice rolls or spinners In Clifford Van Beek designed the board game National Pastime which contained customized baseball cards of Major League Baseball MLB players After rolling a pair of dice participants would consult the card of the MLB player at bat to determine an outcome which could range from a single double triple or home run to a strikeout putout walk or error Players with better statistics in the previous season were more likely to receive favorable outcomes this allowed National Pastime to become one of the first games to try to simulate the performances of real life MLB players br An example of such games was APBA which was first released in and also contained cards of MLB players with in game outcomes correlated to their stats from past seasons Participants could compose fantasy teams from the cards and play against each other or recreate previous seasons using the statistics on the cards Individual player cards and dice roll simulations were also emulated in the Strat O Matic game which was first released in Daniel Okrent who would later be credited with developing modern fantasy baseball was an avid Strat O Matic player telling Sports Illustrated in that if there hadn t been Strat O Matic I still think I would have come up with rotisserie but unquestionably it helped br In another early form of fantasy baseball was coded for the IBM computer by John Burgeson then working for IBM A user would select a team from a limited roster of retired players to play against a team randomly chosen by the computer The computer would then use random number generation and player statistics to simulate a game s outcome and print a play by play description of it br While some of these fantasy games produced outcomes based on the performances of real athletes they were not designed to be played out over the course of a season nor did they take current statistics into account relying instead on those from previous years br br br The first leagues br In the s Oakland California businessman and future limited partner in the Oakland Raiders Wilfred Bill Winkenbach developed a fantasy golf game in which participants would select a roster of professional golfers and compare their scores at the end of a given tournament with the lowest combined total of strokes winning He also created a baseball game in which players drafted hitters and pitchers comparing their real life statistics against each other These early experiments however failed to spread to the general public br In sociologist William A Gamson developed the Baseball Seminar league in which participants would draft rosters of active MLB players and compare results at the end of the season based on the players final batting averages earned run averages runs batted in and win totals Gamson would go on to play the game as a professor at the University of Michigan where another competitor was Bob Sklar One of Sklar s students was Daniel Okrent According to Alan Schwarz s The Numbers Game Baseball s Lifelong Fascination with Statistics Sklar told Okrent about the Baseball Seminar league br Two years later in a New York City hotel room during a Raiders cross country trip Winkenbach along with Raiders public relations employee Bill Tunnel and Oakland Tribune reporter Scotty Stirling developed the rules that would eventually be the basis of modern fantasy football The inaugural league was called the Greater Oakland Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League GOPPPL and the first draft took place at Winkenbach s home in Oakland in August One of the league s original members Andy Mousalimas owned a sports bar in Oakland called the King s X where the first public fantasy football league was founded in The idea spread by word of mouth when the patrons of other Bay Area bars visited the King s X for trivia contests br br br Rotisserie League Baseball br Modern fantasy baseball was developed and popularized in the s by a group of journalists who created Rotisserie League Baseball in The league was named after the New York City restaurant La Rotisserie Fran aise where its founders met for lunch and first played the game Magazine writer editor Daniel Okrent is credited with introducing the rotisserie league concept to the group and inventing the scoring system Players in the Rotisserie League drafted teams of active MLB players and tracked their statistics during the season to compile their scores Like the Baseball Seminar league rather than using statistics for seasons whose outcomes were already known to simulate in game outcomes team owners would have to make predictions about the statistics that MLB players would accumulate during the upcoming season br Rotisserie baseball nicknamed roto proved to be popular despite the difficulties of compiling statistics by hand which was an early drawback to participation Okrent credits the idea s rapid spread to the fact that the initial league was created by sports journalists telling Vanity Fair in that most of us in the league were in the media and we got a lot of press coverage that first season The second season there were rotisserie leagues in every Major League press box According to Okrent rotisserie baseball afforded sportswriters the opportunity to write about baseball related material during the Major League Baseball strike saying the writers who were covering baseball had nothing to write about so they began writing about the teams they had assembled in their own leagues And that was what popularized it and spread it around very very widely br br br Growth and early participants br Before the advent of the Internet fantasy sports grew through print publications such as magazines and newspapers In Fantasy Football Index the first national magazine dedicated to fantasy football was launched by Ian Allan and Bruce Taylor Fantasy Sports Magazine debuted in as the first regular publication covering more than one fantasy sport br In a pair of nationwide fantasy games Dugout Derby and Pigskin Playoff were launched in a variety of newspapers across the United States including the Arizona Republic the Hartford Courant the Los Angeles Times and the Miami Herald Players chose their teams by calling a toll free phone number and entering four digit codes for each of their player selections The games served as an early version of today s daily fantasy sports by rewarding each week s highest scoring participants with prizes br In the magazine Fantasy Football Weekly was launched Also that year USA Today added a weekly fantasy baseball columnist John Hunt Hunt started a league among sports personalities called the League of Alternate Baseball Reality which first included Peter Gammons Keith Olbermann and Bill James among others br br br Internet expansion br The growth of the Internet during the s brought a broad demographic shift in fantasy sports participation because it enabled fantasy sports participants to instantaneously download tabulated statistics rather than having to search for box scores of individual games in newspapers and keep track of cumulative statistics on paper br In ESPN launched its first entirely Internet based fantasy baseball game with other major sports and entertainment companies following suit in the ensuing years In October of that year a fantasy hockey website was released by Molson Breweries as part of the company s I am Online marketing strategy centered around its I am Canadian advertising campaign The site focused on music entertainment and hockey in general in addition to fantasy competitions It allowed users to register accounts and participate in fantasy leagues of nine teams The site included updates of National Hockey League NHL statistics and provided content from the Hockey Hall of Fame br CBS Sports began offering fantasy football leagues in the same year that the fantasy news website now known as RotoWire was launched In July Yahoo began offering its fantasy football product for free a decision that gave the site an advantage over its competitors The creators of Fantasy Football Weekly launched Fanball com later that year While some sites abandoned a paid model in the wake of Yahoo s decision some smaller sites such as RotoWire began offering paid products as they started losing business to larger competitors CBS which had transitioned to a free model for its league commissioner services switched back to a paid model before the MLB season br A trade group for the industry the Fantasy Sports Trade Association was formed in Now known as the Fantasy Sports Gaming Association FSGA the organization estimates that in there were million fantasy sports players in the United States and Canada br During the first decade of the s fantasy sports started to become a mainstream hobby In the National Football League NFL found that while the average male surveyed on its website spent hours a week watching the league on television fantasy players surveyed said they watched hours of NFL football per week This is the first time we ve been able to demonstrate specifically that fantasy play drives TV viewing said Chris Russo the NFL s senior vice president at the time As a result of the survey s findings the league made fantasy offerings more prominent on its website and produced television ads for fantasy football featuring active players Prior to these developments fantasy sports were largely viewed negatively by major sports leagues with Russo later recalling that there were concerns about whether it would be right for the fans or could it be construed as gambling However leagues began to embrace fantasy sports as their value towards increasing fans consumption of sports became more evident br br br Daily fantasy sports br br Daily fantasy sports are accelerated versions of the traditional fantasy format in which contests are conducted over shorter periods than a full season often lasting one week or even a single day Daily fantasy games are typically subject to an entry fee a portion of which funds a prize pool that is distributed among the game s winner or winners br In June Fantasy Sports Live one of the first daily fantasy sites was launched In November NBC launched a daily fantasy site called SnapDraft and FanDuel was founded in as a spin off of a Scottish prediction market company DraftKings was founded in br Following venture capital investments from various firms including from professional sports leagues such as MLB and the National Basketball Association NBA DraftKings and FanDuel launched an aggressive marketing campaign prior to the NFL season At its peak the two companies collectively ran an ad on national television in the United States once every seconds In addition to receiving direct investments from sports leagues the two companies have reached sponsorship deals with several leagues and teams In November DraftKings entered into a multi year sponsorship deal with the NHL In April after the NFL began to allow daily fantasy providers to sign multi year team sponsorship deals FanDuel reached deals with sixteen teams for placements on team oriented digital properties radio broadcasts and within their stadiums DraftKings has also received investments from Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft who own the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots respectively br The legality of daily fantasy sports has been questioned with critics arguing that they more closely resemble proposition wagering on athlete performance than a traditional fantasy sports game However following the United States Supreme Court decision in Murphy v National Collegiate Athletic Association which allowed states to legalize sports betting questions surrounding the legality of daily fantasy sports as well as fantasy sports in general within the United States have largely been settled br As of May while US states

Sports Net aires Fantasy Football Hour on a weekly basis during the NFL season hosted by Katy Winge and features industry experts Brad Evans and Nate Lundy br br br Legal issues in the United States br Fantasy sports are generally considered to be a form of gambling though they are far less strictly regulated than other forms of sports betting Unlike traditional sports betting fantasy sports are generally viewed as games of skill rather than games of chance thus exempting them from gambling bans and regulations in many jurisdictions br br br Federal law related to fantasy gaming br The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of UIGEA was enacted as part of the American Values Agenda of and was added as an amendment to the unrelated SAFE Port Act The UIGEA generally prohibits funds transfers to businesses engaged in unlawful internet wagering However the UIGEA does not itself define unlawful internet wagering and expressly refrains from altering the legality of any underlying conduct other than funds transfers br While the act does not alter the legality of any particular activity permitted or prohibited under other laws it does contain some express exemptions to its funds transfer prohibitions One of these exemptions from the UIGEA prohibitions is for fantasy sports that meet certain criteria Specifically fantasy sports that are based on teams of real multiple athletes from multiple real world teams that have prizes established before the event starts that use the skill of participants to determine the outcome are exempted from the definition of a bet or wager that is the basis for requiring banks to identify and block funds transfers According to Congressman Jim Leach an author of the UIGEA exemptions particularly one for fantasy sports were included to relieve the burden of enforcement on banks and the UIGEA does not make fantasy sports legal br Because the UIGEA exempted fantasy sports from its definition of a bet or wager there is a misconception that fantasy sports were made legal by the UIGEA However the UIGEA is not a criminal gambling statute and it specifically does not alter any criminal gambling laws and thus does not make fantasy sports legal Federal criminal gambling statutes are found in Title of U S Code such as the Federal Wire Act U S Code which prohibits interstate sports wagering and the Illegal Gambling Business Act U S Code which prohibits the interstate conduct of wagering activity prohibited under state law By contrast the UIGEA is found in Title with other anti money laundering and financial crimes statutes br br br State laws related to fantasy gaming br Whether state laws can regulate fantasy sports conducted across state lines depends on whether fantasy sports are a form of sports wagering under federal law This is because the Federal Wire Act prohibits the conduct of sports wagering in interstate or foreign commerce With regard to intrastate sports wagering in the United States Supreme Court in Murphy v National Collegiate Athletic Association struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act which had prohibited states from authorizing any wagering lottery betting sweepstakes or other wagering scheme that is based directly or indirectly on games in which professional or amateur athletes participate or on the performance of any athletes in such games br Where states have not expressly authorized fantasy sports contests usually general gambling laws prohibit lotteries or wagering if three elements are present an entry fee known as consideration a prize a reward in legal terms and chance Whether fantasy sports are legal under these laws hinges on the definition of chance that the state applies For some states if skill dominates the outcome of the event then the contest is legal and passes what is called the dominant factor test Other states with a stricter definition of chance called any chance test have made fantasy football illegal br Several states have clarified that paid fantasy sports contests are games of skill and exempt from gambling laws beginning with Maryland in br One exception is the state of Nevada which has an exemption in PASPA to allow for sports betting The Nevada attorney general issued an opinion that found Daily Fantasy Sports to be a form of sports wagering similar to the current wagering offered by Nevada Sports Books The opinions states that Daily Fantasy Sports are not illegal in Nevada however a sports pool license is required to conduct the activity in Nevada br Several Attorneys General have also issued opinions that Daily Fantasy Sports are a form of sports wagering A Florida state attorney general s opinion in called into doubt the legality of fantasy football contests but companies have operated in the state without any legal action Since then nine other AGs have issued options statements or formal opinions that equate DFS with gambling br However several other Attorneys General have issued opinions that DFS are legal games of skill In August in Kansas due to uncertainty with the state s Racing and Gaming Commission position the state s attorney general issued an opinion that daily fantasy sports was a skill game and thus permitted under state law Kansas Gov Sam Brownback signed legislation a month later authorizing fantasy gaming The Attorneys General of West Virginia and Rhode Island have also issued opinions that clarified the legality of DFS and paid fantasy sports br As of January online fantasy sports are legal in of the US states The only state with a ban on online fantasy sports that is codified in statute is Montana As of January daily fantasy sports are legal in US states with of those states explicitly passing legislation legalizing the practice br br br Legal cases related to use of player statistics br There have been other legal cases involving fantasy sports and the use of professional athletes statistics for purposes of scoring br br br STATS Inc vs NBA br In STATS Inc a major statistical provider to fantasy sports companies won a court case along with Motorola on appeal against the NBA in which the NBA was trying to stop STATS from distributing in game score information via a special wireless device created by Motorola The victory played a large part in defending other cases where sports leagues have tried to suppress live in game information from their events being distributed by other outlets The victory also accelerated the demand for real time statistics amid the growth of the fantasy sports industry br br br CDM vs MLBAM br The development of fantasy sports produced tension between fantasy sports companies and professional leagues and players associations over the rights to player profiles and statistics The players associations of the major sports leagues believed that fantasy games using player names were subject to licensing due to the right of publicity of the players involved Since the player names were being used as a group the players had assigned their publicity rights to the players association who then signed licensing deals During the s and s many companies signed licensing deals with the player associations but some companies did not The issue came to a head with the lawsuit of Major League Baseball Advanced Media MLBAM MLB s Internet company vs St Louis based CBC Distribution and Marketing Inc the parent company of CDM Sports When CBC was denied a new licensing agreement with MLBAM they had acquired the rights from the baseball players association for its fantasy baseball game CBC filed suit br CBC argued that intellectual property laws and so called right of publicity laws don t apply to the statistics used in fantasy sports The FSTA filed an amicus curiae in support of CBC also arguing that if MLBAM won the lawsuit it would have a dramatic impact on the industry which was largely ignored by the major sports leagues for years while a number of smaller entrepreneurs grew it into a multibillion dollar industry and a ruling could allow the MLBAM to have a monopoly over the industry br This will be a defining moment in the fantasy sports industry said Charlie Wiegert executive vice president of CBC The other leagues are all watching this case If MLB prevailed it just would have been a matter of time before they followed up Their player unions are just waiting for the opportunity br CBC won the lawsuit as US District Court Judge Mary Ann Medler ruled that statistics are part of the public domain and can be used at no cost by fantasy companies The names and playing records of major league baseball players as used in CBC s fantasy games are not copyrightable Medler wrote Therefore federal copyright law does not pre empt the players claimed right of publicity br The th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision in October It would be strange law that a person would not have a First Amendment right to use information that is available to everyone a three judge panel said in its ruling The Supreme Court upheld the circuit court s decision by declining to hear the case in June In CBS Interactive won a lawsuit against the NFL Players Association over whether CBS had a First Amendment right to use players names and playing records in its fantasy sports offerings without paying licensing fees br
