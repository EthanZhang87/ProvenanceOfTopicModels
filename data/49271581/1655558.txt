may be vulnerable to a brute force attack You should change your Gawker password and on any other sites on which you ve used the same passwords Gawker was found to be using DES based crypt password hashes with bits of salt Security researchers found that password cracking software John the Ripper was able to quickly crack over of the passwords from those records with crackable password hashes Followers of Twitter accounts set up with the same email and password were spammed with advertisements The Gnosis group notes that with the source code to the Gawker content management system they obtained it will be easier to develop new exploits br br br redesign and traffic loss br As part of a planned overhaul of all Gawker Media sites on February some Gawker sites underwent a major design change as part of the larger roll out Most notable was the absence of formerly present Twitter and StumbleUpon sharing buttons Nick Denton explained that Facebook had been by far the biggest contributor to the site s traffic and that the other buttons cluttered the interface This decision lasted three weeks after which the buttons were reinstated and more added br On February the redesign was rolled out to the remainder of the Gawker sites The launch was troubled due to server issues Kotaku com and io com failed to load displaying links but no main content and opening different posts in different tabs did not work either The new look emphasised images and de emphasised the reverse chronological ordering of posts that was typical of blogs The biggest change was the two panel layout consisting of one big story and a list of headlines on the right This was seen as an effort to increase the engagement of site visitors by making the user experience more like that of television The site redesign also allowed for users to create their own discussion pages on Gawker s Kinja Many commenters largely disliked the new design which was in part attributed to lack of familiarity br Rex Sorgatz designer of Mediaite and CMO of Vyou issued a bet that the redesigns would fail to bring in traffic and Nick Denton took him up on it The measure was the number of page views by October recorded on Quantcast Page views after the redesign declined significantly Gawker s sites had an decrease in overall traffic immediately after the change and a decrease over two weeks with many users either leaving the site or viewing international versions of the site which hadn t switched to the new layout On February faced with declining traffic Gawker sites allowed for visitors to choose between the new design and the old design for viewing the sites Sorgatz was eventually determined to be the winner of the bet as at the end of September Gawker had only million monthly views not the million it had had prior to the redesign However on October site traffic returned to its pre redesign numbers and as of February site traffic had increased by million over the previous year according to Quantcast As of March commenting on any Gawker site required signing in with a Twitter Facebook or Google account br br br Leaked Quentin Tarantino script br In January Quentin Tarantino filed a copyright lawsuit against Gawker Media for distribution of his page script for The Hateful Eight He claimed to have given the script to six trusted colleagues including Bruce Dern Tim Roth and Michael Madsen Due to the spreading of his script Tarantino told the media that he would not continue with the movie Gawker Media has made a business of predatory journalism violating people s rights to make

permission Gawker Media crossed the journalistic line by promoting itself to the public as the first source to read the entire Screenplay illegally br br br Collective action br On June unpaid interns brought a Fair Labor Standards Act action against Gawker Media and founder Nick Denton As plaintiffs the interns claimed that their work at sites io com Kotaku com Lifehacker com and Gawker TV was central to Gawker s business model as an Internet publisher and that Gawker s failure to pay them minimum wage for their work therefore violated the FLSA and state labor laws Although some interns had been paid the court granted conditional certification of the collective action br In October a federal judge ruled that notices could be sent to unpaid interns throughout the company who could potentially want to join the lawsuit A federal judge later found that the claims of interns who joined the suit as plaintiffs were outside the statute of limitations br On March a federal judge ruled
