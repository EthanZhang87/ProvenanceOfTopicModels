Windows in August it replaced the failed version with subsequent support for PlayStation macOS PlayStation and Xbox Series X S Final Fantasy XIV is set in the fantasy region of Eorzea five years after the devastating Seventh Umbral Calamity which ended the original version In the Calamity the elder primal Bahamut escaped from his prison an ancient space station called Dalamud unleashing an apocalypse across Eorzea Through temporal magic the player character of the original version escaped reappearing at the start of A Realm Reborn As Eorzea cements its recovery the player must fend off a reignited invasion from the Garlean Empire br The original Final Fantasy XIV was a commercial and critical failure Then Square Enix President Yoichi Wada announced that a new team led by Yoshida would assume control and address the game s flaws The new team both continued to develop and improve the original version and secretly worked on a completely new replacement This new game codenamed Version used a new engine improved server infrastructure and revamped gameplay interface and story The original version shut down in November followed by an alpha test for Version br The relaunched game released to largely positive reception critics praised its solid mechanics and progression and commended Yoshida for an unexpected recovery After a poor fiscal year Square Enix attributed the return to profitability partly to the game s strong sales and subscriber base By October it had gained over million registered players and become the most profitable Final Fantasy game to date Final Fantasy XIV has received regular updates since release including four major expansion packs Heavensward Stormblood Shadowbringers and Endwalker A fifth expansion pack Dawntrail was released in July br br br Gameplay br Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG featuring a persistent world where players can interact with each other and the environment Players create and customize their characters for use in the game including name race gender facial features and starting class Unlike in the original release players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class Disciples of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable Players must also select a game server for each character While all supported languages are available on every server data centers are located in specific regions i e North America Europe Japan and Oceania to reduce latency between client and server and players are advised to choose a server in their region Regardless of server or language players can use a large library of automatically translated game terms and general phrases allowing players who speak different languages to communicate br br br Interface br br PC and home console versions use a unified user interface and control scheme Any combination of a keyboard mouse and game controller may be used for console players wireless or USB keyboard and mouse are required for the former On PC and macOS the game defaults to drag and drop windows while on the console versions of XIV the default interface resembles the PlayStation s XrossMediaBar This bar is used to access all menus maps logs and configuration options The head up display for both versions includes a message log party status menu mini map and action bar The UI offers extensive customization options br Actions and battle commands differ between PC macOS and console versions The PC and macOS versions supports both point and click and keyboard input for commands or macros Macro commands are customizable sequences of actions that allow players to execute desired abilities at a specific time The home console versions instead map the action bar and macros to the Cross Hotbar sets of four icons arranged in a cross shape These are the grouped and accessed through a combination of the shoulder buttons and the directional pad or the face buttons Using each shoulder button to cycle through the cross sets players have quick access to commands This interface is also available to PC and macOS players who use controllers br br br Character progression br Players improve their characters by gaining experience points EXP and acquiring stronger equipment After gaining enough XP the character will level up improving their statistics enhancing the character s performance and often learning new actions Primary sources of experience points in Final Fantasy XIV include completing quests exploring instanced dungeons participating in Full Active Time Events FATEs and slaying monsters in the world Quests including the main scenario questline are generally short specific tasks given to the player by non player characters which reward items and EXP Completing main scenario quests progresses the overarching plot of the game Some quests are repeatable either daily quests repeatable each day or Levequests which consume leve allowances that the player slowly accrues over time Dungeons often require multiple players to form a party to enter but the Duty Support system enables the player to play certain dungeons alone supported by computer controlled party members Some dungeons are for lower leveled players to gain EXP quickly while others are for experienced players to collect rare items equipment and currency The Duty Roulette system randomly assigns the player to an accessible dungeon and once per day awards additional bonus EXP scaled to character level on completion FATEs permit large groups of players whether or not they are in a party to participate in a shared task in the world These location specific events include battles with notorious monsters defending locations escorting non player characters culling wildlife and assaulting enemy fortresses among other types Finally each enemy the player kills provides EXP with further EXP available from the Hunting Log for killing a fixed amount of specific creatures At maximum level character progression focuses entirely on acquiring stronger equipment raising the character s item level This equipment can be gained through a variety of sources including endgame dungeons crafting raids primal battles and elite mark hunts br In addition to these player versus environment PvE challenges various forms of player versus player PvP combat exist in Final Fantasy XIV The Feast was an arena featuring structured four versus four battles where a player could register with up to three teammates to challenge another four person team This mode was removed in patch when it was replaced with Crystalline Conflict which consists of two teams of five competing to seize control of and push a crystal which starts at the middle of the arena to each team s goal point The second type Frontlines is a large battleground in which players form teams of up to characters Teams are delineated by players allegiance to one of three Grand Companies and the team which reaches the target number of points first wins the match Multiple modes are available each with differing locations and rulesets Within the game Frontlines is presented as an organized set of military exercises between the three nations with the ulterior goal of jockeying for dominance of regions rich in magical artifacts The third type Rival Wings is a battle arena mode where players manipulate minion waves and pilot mechs to destroy enemy objectives br br br Battles and party system br Players fight enemies using a combination of physical attacks weapon skills and magical attacks these battles form the basis of party play in Final Fantasy XIV Most battle content in the game requires parties of a specific size including four players for dungeons and eight players for boss battles The Duty Finder is an automated matching feature that sorts players into parties for selected content across different servers The Party Finder is a bulletin board where players may recruit players from any server on their data center for any kind of content including dungeons raid battles FATE parties and more Members of a party fill traditional MMORPG roles like tank healer and damage dealer Tanks draw the enemy s attention away from other party members who generally have weaker defense healers use restorative abilities and support the party with damage and enhancing abilities and damage dealers focus on attacking the enemy Teamwork and strategy are required to defeat the strongest enemies Limit Breaks are special abilities that can only be performed if members of the party excel at their roles br Free Companies are player run guilds organized bands of adventurers under the auspices of one of the three Grand Companies of Eorzea Free Company members may gain access to a shared company chest a private chat channel and Company Actions which are hour buffs to certain aspects of gameplay such as increased EXP gain or reduced gear damage Free Company members may also pool their resources to purchase a house in one of the residential districts In addition to decorating the house players may use the grounds to grow unique items through the gardening system train their chocobo companion embark on airship expeditions and purchase a private room for personal use Linkshells are another form of in game networking whereas players may only belong in one Free Company they may join multiple linkshells which act as private chat channels for interested sub groups br br br Armoury and job system br Under the Armoury System a character s equipped weapon determines the character class and players may change their class at will by changing weapons Classes are divided into four disciplines Disciples of War masters of physical combat Disciples of Magic practitioners of the magical arts Disciples of the Hand crafters and handymen who synthesize and repair items and Disciples of the Land gatherers who collect resources from the environment The Job System builds upon the Armoury System for Disciples of War and Magic It allows access to powerful skills magic weapons and armor exclusive to the job corresponding to that class These jobs many based on classic Final Fantasy character jobs are more suited to party based combat br br br Game economy br The virtual economy of Final Fantasy XIV is largely player driven The exchange of items is facilitated by retainers non playable characters who assist in selling items on the Market Board gather items through ventures and provide additional item storage A small transaction fee for all sales serves as a gold sink to regulate the inflation of prices in the economy Players of any class may contribute to the supply of the economy Disciples of the Land acquire raw materials from gathering points throughout the game world Disciples of the Hand craft the materials into useful items and equipment and Disciples of War and Magic are able to procure rare materials through completion of dungeons and Treasure Maps Players are also able to contribute by extracting materia from well used equipment which can then be used to improve the statistics of other equipment br The mechanics of crafting and gathering have changed between the original release and A Realm Reborn Most of these changes are geared toward reducing the randomness and guesswork involved in these processes For Disciples of the Hand all recipes of the appropriate level are unlocked by default in the Crafting Log Crafting abilities have been rebalanced to allow successful high quality synthesis without requiring multiple mastered Disciplines of the Hand For Disciples of the Land players are allowed to select which item they would like to attempt to collect at a gathering point whereas before the results of gathering attempts were randomized The Gathering Log also displays the names and locations of items that can be gathered in the world br br br Plot br br br Setting br br Final Fantasy XIV is set on Hydaelyn a fictional world of diverse environments across multiple continents focused on the

codename Rapture between late and early and was officially announced in This version was directed by Nobuaki Komoto and produced by Hiromichi Tanaka who was also serving as the producer of Final Fantasy XI and employed the Crystal Tools engine which had previously been used for Final Fantasy XIII Following a bug laden abbreviated beta test period the game was released in September to near universal negative reception After two extensions to the initial free trial period then Square Enix President Yoichi Wada issued a formal apology to players and fans in December and announced a dramatic overhaul in the development team most prominently the removal of Tanaka from the project and the demotion of Komoto from Director to Lead Designer Monthly fees for the game were suspended until further notice and the previously planned PlayStation version was canceled After the change in development team Naoki Yoshida who had worked as planning chief of Dragon Quest X was brought in to supervise the project as both producer and director br In attempting to improve Final Fantasy XIV Yoshida quickly discovered a number of key tasks First and foremost he had to restore trust in the player base while bringing the game up to a playable quality To address this Yoshida began writing Letters from the Producer which would discuss design direction upcoming changes player feedback and increase transparency in the development process However outdated and cumbersome programming choices in the source code prevented the more radical modifications necessary to enhance the game Thus planning for a brand new game built from scratch started in January and development began in earnest by April with work on a new game engine and server structure Meanwhile the team s efforts to improve the original release first came to fruition with patch in July which included major changes to the battle system implementation of auto attack and instanced dungeons removal of the controversial fatigue system and the introduction of the Grand Company storyline which would supersede the original main scenario questline Subsequent patches would further refine the gameplay as well as set the stage for the Seventh Umbral Era events br On the anniversary of the game s release Wada claimed that the initial launch of Final Fantasy XIV had greatly damaged the Final Fantasy brand Thus Wada and Yoshida announced the brand new version of Final Fantasy XIV in October code named Version which had been in development since January along with a tentative roadmap for future progress for both PC and PlayStation Current players would be provided copies of the new PC client at launch free of charge and their character data and progress would be transferred as well Along with the roadmap they announced that monthly fees would be instated in order to offset the cost of redevelopment Billing for the game began in January To encourage users to continue playing while paying subscription fees Yoshida revealed the Legacy Campaign which rewarded players who paid for at least three months of service with permanently reduced monthly payments an exclusive in game chocobo mount and their names featured in the credits of Version br At Electronic Entertainment Expo Square Enix debuted Agni s Philosophy a tech demo for their new Luminous Studio game engine Though members of the Final Fantasy XIV development team worked on Luminous Yoshida admitted that both Luminous and Crystal Tools were optimized for offline games and could not handle an online environment with hundreds of on screen character models Though Version uses a completely different engine he called the Luminous engine and the engine siblings due to similarities in their structure That July Square Enix revealed that Version s official title would be Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn As development for A Realm Reborn ramped up Yoshida made the decision to shut down the servers for the original release on November This date served as the grand finale for the old game culminating in a cinematic trailer for A Realm Reborn called End of an Era br In a project postmortem at Game Developers Conference Yoshida reflected on the herculean task of maintaining and updating an MMORPG while simultaneously developing a new one over the course of just two years and eight months He identified three main reasons why the original launch failed an over emphasis on graphical quality a lack of modern MMORPG expertise in the development team and a mentality that all problems could be fixed in future patches These evolved from the team s prior experience on Final Fantasy XI the previous MMORPG in the Final Fantasy series As the series has been renowned for its state of the art graphics the original development team gained an unhealthy obsession with maximizing graphical quality at the expense of server performance which was unsustainable for an online game with tens of thousands of high definition assets In designing Final Fantasy XI the team spent a year playing EverQuest the most successful MMORPG of the early s However they lacked experience with modern games in the genre the original Final Fantasy XIV team was instructed merely to make something different from Final Fantasy XI Yoshida admonished that the team should go play World of Warcraft for a year for inspiration instead br A prevailing design philosophy for A Realm Reborn was to simultaneously appeal to hardcore MMORPG players while reaching out to new players and Final Fantasy fans who had never experienced the genre before As a consequence Yoshida held optimizing gameplay for controllers as a top priority To streamline development he made about fundamental design decisions which eliminated time lost to getting approvals with a focus on implementing standard features of the genre first The new workflow pipeline was tested using updates to the original game and applied to development of A Realm Reborn The continuing operations of the original release provided a valuable testing ground for new features that would be carried into the relaunch Another focus was to appeal to busy players without a lot of free time which led to creating the Duty Finder system The base game and patch cycle were also designed to make it easy for lapsed players to return to Throughout this process Yoshida emphasized that communication with players and restoring their trust was key even admitting that sales were secondary compared to redeeming the reputation of the series Live streaming conversations between the development team and fans such as the Letters from the Producer LIVE events became a major element of Yoshida s player outreach strategy br br br Testing and release br br The alpha test for A Realm Reborn began shortly after the original release s finale and ended in late December During this period Wada admitted that the development of A Realm Reborn was a cause of delay for many Square Enix titles at the time Yoshida published an updated roadmap for the beta test through launch indicating four phases of beta beginning in mid February He claimed that the team is adamant the game not be released until it is ready and that launching too early would be like at the level of destroying the company In May Square Enix announced the release date for the game along with details about pre order bonuses and the collector s edition which includes an art book a bonus disc with a recap of the original release story a soundtrack sampler and several cosmetic in game items In June the company revealed a PlayStation version was in development and due for release in Early access began on August with players able to play continuously through to the August launch Players throughout this period noted continued server issues Due to an overwhelmingly positive response the servers could not handle the number of concurrent players prompting Square Enix to temporarily suspend digital sales of the game In light of these issues Yoshida issued an apology to fans for the game s rocky launch and reassured them that fixes were in progress and new servers would be created A week after launch the game received a ten hour maintenance and fresh patches and all players were compensated with a week of free play time br A Steam version of the client was released on February A beta for the PlayStation version of Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn debuted on the same day as the Japanese release of the console February the same year Owners of the PlayStation client were able upgrade to the digital PlayStation client for free A free trial of the game first became available for PC on July with PlayStation and versions following in December It initially limited prospective players to content under level but this was expanded to level in August allowing free access to all of A Realm Reborn and Heavensward with no time restrictions The Chinese version published and administrated by Shanda Games premiered on August featuring content through patch It features separate servers from the other language versions of the game and a pay per hour micropayment billing system The Korean version distributed by Actoz Soft launched in South Korea on August with content from patch This version carries a flexible subscription model with increments as low as hours similar to the Chinese release up to days much like the traditional monthly payment plan With the release of later patches versions and expansion packs the A Realm Reborn subtitle has been dropped with the remade game being referred to simply as Final Fantasy XIV Fans now refer to the story arc encompassing up to the last patch as or A Realm Reborn to differentiate it from the later expansions br Coinciding with the launch of the first expansion pack the macOS client was released on June The port was handled by TransGaming On July Square Enix suspended sales of the macOS version because of widespread reports of poor technical performance and offered refunds to those who purchased it Yoshida observed that the performance issues could be attributed to difficulties in transposing the game from Microsoft s proprietary DirectX graphical rendering libraries to OpenGL as well as a clerical error resulting in publishing the wrong minimum system requirements both compounded by the hectic work schedule demanded by the release of an expansion pack After new rounds of testing and optimization sales of the macOS version resumed on February In November Phil Spencer told the press that Microsoft was working with Square Enix to bring the game to Xbox One No official announcement was made however with director Naoki Yoshida stating in an October interview that discussions are positive but still ongoing and that the team is waiting for the right time to provide an update Around the same time Yoshida also confirmed to GameSpot that talks with Nintendo were ongoing in order to also bring the game to Nintendo Switch remarking that the addition of Xbox and Switch as supported platforms for the game would increase its overall footprint despite its already active userbase and that so as long as the regulations with the counterpart hardware companies we can actually pass that then the possibility the chance is quite high of Final Fantasy XIV coming to Xbox and Nintendo systems A port of the game for Xbox Series X S was jointly announced by Yoshida and Spencer in July during that year s North American Fan Festival in Las Vegas alongside the unveiling of the Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail expansion The Xbox version will support faster load times cross play and cross progression with the PlayStation and PC versions while the Series X version will be presented at native K resolution An open beta for the Xbox version took place as part of patch x The Xbox Series X S version of the game officially launched on March br br br Patches and expansions br The development team schedules the release of a major update approximately every three months Each of these free content patches includes a continuation of the main scenario as well as new raids features trials and dungeons Minor patches that come in between major updates focus on quality of life changes and are sometimes used to introduce completely new side content In addition to regular free updates the game features full expansion packs that add new zones races jobs and premiere a new content cycle Since the release of these expansions the original subtitle of A Realm Reborn has come to refer to the portion of the game available at launch rather than the entirety of Final Fantasy XIV Patch of the Shadowbringers expansion also modifies and streamlines the A Realm Reborn main scenario questline and patches and of the Endwalker expansion included further changes to the A Realm Reborn and Heavensward questlines With patch x in spring Final Fantasy XIV is set to launch in beta for Xbox Series X and S with a full launch ready for the upcoming Dawntrail expansion in summer br br br Music br br Masayoshi Soken contributed to the majority of the game s version of traditional Final Fantasy music as well as themes original to the game The enormous track list includes remixed versions of songs such as the Final Fantasy theme originally composed by long time Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu as well as remixes of day and night themes original to Final Fantasy XIV For the reboot A Realm Reborn Soken was tasked with composing and compiling numerous original and remixed songs in addition to his duties as sound director The remaining tracks were reused pieces from the original game s soundtrack which was principally composed by Nobuo Uematsu with assistance from Soken Tsuyoshi Sekito and Naoshi Mizuta Yoshida directed Soken to give us something straightforward that anyone could identify as Final Fantasy with an easy to understand expressive orchestral sound Because of the abbreviated development schedule Soken focused primarily on creating the soundtrack while his team worked on the various sound effects for the game world The team was given less than a year on sound production though according to Soken it felt like enough work for two full games in that time Most of the tracks had specific guidelines or came from the development team s requests though Soken was allowed to do what he liked for Titan s battle theme although the initial lyrics had to be changed for having too much profanity Soken sang the vocal work for some tracks such as the battle theme for Leviathan Soken also arranged pieces from earlier Final Fantasy games for use in special in game events In Final Fantasy its music acts as a carrier of nostalgic emotions allowing the music to bring its nostalgic emotional carrier into new relationships and environments and create a deeper connection with the game br Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn Original Soundtrack is a collection of music from the game including both the launch and tracks from Patch A Realm Awoken It was released on March on Blu ray Disc and features tracks with accompanying gameplay videos The first print run came with a special Wind up Bahamut in game pet Emily McMillan of Video Game Music Online called the soundtrack a truly fantastic score and said that it was superior to the music of the original version of the game She felt that it was an excellent merging of the traditional Final Fantasy musical style with a modern orchestral score Mike Salbato of RPGFan also praised the album saying that it was his favorite album of and that he can t recommend A Realm Reborn s soundtrack highly enough Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn Original Soundtrack debuted at position on the Japanese Oricon album charts for its release week and remained in the charts for eight weeks br In addition to album feedback critics of the game praised the score in their reviews Kotaku s Mike Fahey stated that the music was wonderful complex and satisfying He often paused to remove the ambient and interface sound effects so as to hear it better GamesRadar s Adam Harshberger called it a standout even amongst Final Fantasy s storied heritage and Digital Spy s Mark Langshaw called it a sonic feast that pays appropriate homage to the long running RPG series The soundtrack won Video Game Music Online s Annual Game Music Awards in the Eastern category In Guinness World Records awarded Final Fantasy XIV for having the most original pieces of music in a video game at nearly br br br Reception br br In contrast to the original version Final Fantasy XIV has earned a generally positive reception and robust sales numbers Prior to release both the game s press and fans were surprised by its quality and level of polish IGN s Charles Onyett cited many specific improvements over aspects of the initial game and recognized that it seems like Square s doing the right things to fix the many mistakes made with Final Fantasy XIV s original design Following an impressive showing at Gamescom it won Destructoid s Gamescom Community Choice Award The editorial staff observed the considerable changes made to the engine HUD and combat system transforming it into a far cry from the game that disappointed so many However GameSpot s Jonathan Toyad was less confident about the game praising the changes but commenting that many features would seem overly familiar to players of modern MMORPGs br The overwhelming sentiment expressed by multiple reviewers was that the remade game executed admirably on traditional MMORPG features and succeeded at addressing the failures of the original version For Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot this steadfast implementation of genre fundamentals was his greatest criticism that it does not leap over the shoulders of the games that have come before However he was quick to praise the quality of the game s writing a feature highlighted by a number of other critics USgamer s Pete Davison was particularly enamored with the story and commended the responsiveness of non player characters to the player s actions as an effective method of worldbuilding Many reviewers enjoyed the ability to play as multiple classes on a single character a feature retained from the original release Davison remarked that the differing mechanics of each class made them feel unique in their gameplay styles br The console versions of the game
