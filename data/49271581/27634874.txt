FaceTime supports any iOS device with a forward facing camera and any Mac computer equipped with a FaceTime Camera FaceTime Audio an audio only version is available on any iOS device that supports iOS or newer and any Mac with a forward facing camera running OS X and later br FaceTime is included for free in iOS and macOS from Mac OS X Lion onwards Since the release of iOS iPadOS and macOS Monterey non Apple systems can be used to participate in FaceTime calls using a web client br br br History br Apple bought the FaceTime name from FaceTime Communications which changed its name to Actiance in January On June Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced FaceTime in conjunction with the iPhone in a keynote speech at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Support for the fourth generation iPod Touch the first model of iPod Touch equipped with cameras was announced in conjunction with the device s release on September On March FaceTime support was announced for the newly introduced iPad which had forward and rear facing cameras br On February FaceTime left beta and was listed in the Mac App Store for US Apple claims that it intended to provide the application free of charge however a provision of the Sarbanes Oxley Act bars companies from providing an unadvertised new feature of an already sold product without enduring onerous accounting measures The US beta is no longer available for download from Apple FaceTime is included for free in macOS from Mac OS X Lion onwards and iOS br AT T allowed customers to use FaceTime as long as they were tiered but blocked the application from working for customers with unlimited data plans They were brought before the Federal Communications Commission FCC for net neutrality violations br In May it was found that FaceTime would work seamlessly over G on all iPhone iPad and iPod Touch models that supported it Even though FaceTime worked only over G at that time it now supports G LTE calls on networks all over the world and availability is limited to operators GSM plans br In Apple added group video and audio support to FaceTime which can support up to people in iOS and macOS Mojave br The th generation iPad Pro which was introduced in May features Center Stage which allows the camera to follow a user when they are on a FaceTime call and was also expanded to other third party video conferencing applications Center Stage is a feature of all iPads released since and is also available on Macs using the Apple Studio Display or a paired iPhone with an Apple A chip or newer using Continuity Camera a feature that allows Macs to use iPhones as a camera that was introduced in iOS and macOS Ventura br On June during Apple s WWDC Keynote it was announced that FaceTime will be made available for Android and Windows users via the web A new feature called SharePlay was announced for FaceTime on iOS iPadOS and macOS Monterey at the same event It will let users on iPhone iPad and Mac share music video or their screen with people on the call Apple stated that the feature uses an API that can be enabled on any media service and SharePlay is slated to support Apple Music the Apple TV app including Apple TV Disney Hulu HBO Max Paramount TikTok Twitch and several other media sources at launch br FaceTime was added to Apple TV K nd generation and newer models with the release of tvOS in FaceTime requires a paired iPhone or iPad with iOS iPadOS and supports Center Stage and Split View with an A device or newer br br br Implementation br br br FaceTime works by establishing a connection between two supported devices Most Apple devices such as iPhones iPads and Macs introduced after support FaceTime FaceTime is currently incompatible with non Apple devices or any other video calling services Mac models introduced in have high definition video FaceTime which devices use automatically when both ends have a FaceTime HD camera br At launch unlike Mac OS X s iChat FaceTime did not support group conferencing The application allowed a one on one video chat only two people could talk at once If a second user called and the user answered the video chat with the previous user would end and a new video session began with the second caller In iPhone if a phone call was pending and the user attempts to answer the video call ends and the phone call began with the next user Support for group video conferencing was added with the release of iOS allowing up to people to participate in a video call simultaneously br Incoming notifications on iOS devices are shown during a FaceTime call but if they are opened the video will be temporarily paused until the user is back in the FaceTime app br On the iPhone a user can activate FaceTime during a phone call by pressing the FaceTime button or initiating FaceTime from their call history or the Contacts application iOS and newer also provide a separate FaceTime app as there always has been on Apple s non telephony devices iPad iPod Touch and Mac br Until the release of iOS FaceTime required a WiFi connection to work From iOS onwards FaceTime for the iPhone and iPad has supported FaceTime calls over cellular networks G or LTE provided the carrier enabled it which by mid virtually all carriers worldwide have allowed FaceTime Audio uses about three megabytes of data for every five minutes of conversation with FaceTime Video uses significantly more Cellular talk time minutes are not used after switching from a voice call to a FaceTime call br FaceTime calls can be placed from supported devices to any phone number or email address that is registered to the FaceTime service A single email address can be registered to multiple devices and a call placed to that address rings all devices simultaneously br br br Standards br The FaceTime protocol is based on numerous open industry standards but is not interoperable with non Apple products FaceTime s lack of interoperability makes customers dependent on Apple and unable to switch away from Apple products br Upon the launch of the iPhone Jobs stated that Apple would immediately start working with standards bodies to make the FaceTime protocol an open industry standard While the protocols are open standards Apple s FaceTime service requires a client side certificate br FaceTime calls are protected by end to end encryption so that only the sender and receiver can access them Apple cannot decrypt this data br Standards used include br br H and AAC ELD video and audio codecs respectively br SIP IETF signaling protocol for VoIP br STUN TURN and ICE IETF technologies for traversing firewalls and NAT br RTP and SRTP IETF standards for delivering real time and encrypted media streams for VoIP br Compared to most SIP implementations Facetime adds techniques that enhance performance at the cost of breaking interoperability port multiplexing SDP minimization and SDP compression br br br FaceTime Audio br A new audio only version of FaceTime named FaceTime Audio was announced during the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC keynote speech on June and released with iOS on September As an audio only version of FaceTime it effectively makes the protocol into a voice over Internet Protocol VoIP that competes with other mainstream providers in the field including Skype Microsoft br Based on the same AAC LD audio protocol the service provides high quality audio The iOS betas limited FaceTime Audio to calls placed on a Wi Fi network the same original limitation of the video version of FaceTime but the final release has removed that restriction to allow it to work over G and LTE data connections as is the case with most carriers and plans about FaceTime with video Like the video version FaceTime Audio is currently only available between Apple devices on iOS and later FaceTime streaming over cellular data is unavailable for the iPhone and the iPad br br br Walkie Talkie br Walkie Talkie is a limited FaceTime Audio based communication feature made available on September for Apple Watch devices running watchOS or later The application allows users to have two person calls similar to using a real walkie talkie as conversations are push to talk and only one end of the conversation can speak at a time Walkie Talkie is intended for short and quick messages between two people rather than long conversations which are better suited for traditional phone or video calls Users can set their availability for walkie talkie through the control panel or in the app itself which allows friends to start a call at any time br In July Apple temporarily disabled the Walkie Talkie feature from all Apple Watches after a vulnerability was discovered that allowed a user to listen to another person s iPhone without consent br br br Limited availability br br br By country br As of June FaceTime was not enabled on devices bought in the United Arab Emirates possibly due to regulations in this country that restrict IP based communications FaceTime is made available for iPhones in the United Arab Emirates upon updating iOS In addition iPhone and iPad Cellular models devices bought in mainland China have FaceTime Audio Group FaceTime and the ability to create and join FaceTime links via the FaceTime app disabled while FaceTime Video is available Devices bought outside these countries support both video and audio versions of FaceTime Although Egypt Jordan Qatar and Kuwait originally disabled FaceTime on the iPhone they later re enabled the feature through a carrier update for existing phone owners and made it pre enabled on any newly purchased iPhone In March FaceTime was made available for iPhones in Saudi Arabia upon updating to iOS and in August FaceTime was made available for iPhones in Pakistan upon updating to iOS br br br By iOS version br As of April FaceTime ceased working on earlier versions of iOS that had previously supported it iOS and later due to the client side certificate used to authenticate a genuine Apple device with FaceTime servers amongst other uses expiring on that date Apple chose not to release an update to this certificate for all devices for which a newer major iOS version with a new valid certificate was available Apple did release a minor update to the certificate only for all OS X versions which could run FaceTime and also for the th generation iPod Touch the only iOS device which could run FaceTime but could not run the then latest iOS The result of this policy was that almost all iOS users had to update the iOS version on their devices if they wished to continue using FaceTime br br br Controversy br br br Group FaceTime bug br On January a bug was discovered in the FaceTime app that allowed users to eavesdrop on other users without their knowledge through an exploit It was later discovered the video feed could be enabled without the other users acceptance Apple said in a statement that it would release a fix for the exploit shortly disabling Group FaceTime for the time being The bug was named FacePalm by security researchers and affects iOS devices running FaceTime on iOS or Mac computers running macOS Mojave On February Apple fixed the FaceTime vulnerabilities in iOS and a Supplemental Update for macOS Mojave br Although the bug gained international attention on January the bug was found much earlier by Arizona high school student Grant Thompson He and his mother tried for more than a week to warn Apple about the problem through Facebook and Twitter after discovering the bug on January without receiving answers br br br br br br External links br Official website at the Wayback Machine archived October
