prior years at Microsoft developing Windows including the Windows port of Doom Wanting to move onto a new venture using their shared wealth Newell and Harrington founded Valve L L C in Kirkland Washington about five miles from the Microsoft campus in Redmond on August Newell s wedding day In a break from industry style of the time Newell did not want a company name that suggested testosterone gorged muscles and the extreme of anything Alternative names considered by Newell and Harrington include Hollow Box Fruitfly Ensemble and Rhino Scar br Valve s first game was Half Life a first person shooter FPS with elements of horror The development was aided by access to the Quake engine by id Software Valve modified this engine into their GoldSrc engine After struggling to find a publisher Valve eventually signed with Sierra On Line Half Life was released in November and was a critical and commercial success With its realism scripted sequences and seamless narrative it had a lasting influence according to IGN in the history of the FPS genre breaks down pretty cleanly into pre Half Life and post Half Life eras br Valve enlisted Gearbox Software to develop three expansions

Valve released the software development kit SDK for the GoldSrc engine facilitating numerous user created mods They acquired the developers of one popular mod Counter Strike to create a standalone Counter Strike game Happy with Valve s success Harrington left in br br br Source Steam and Half Life br In Valve moved to Bellevue Washington and reincorporated as Valve Corporation In the office

months after the release of the first Half Life using its new in house engine Source With advanced physics systems and an increased focus on story and characters it received critical acclaim upon its release in By it had sold million copies In Valve launched Steam a digital storefront and delivery platform Steam initially offered only Valve games and was mandatory to install Half Life but became a publisher of third party games As Valve became its own publisher via Steam it transitioned to a flat organization outside of executive management Valve does not have bosses and the company uses an open allocation system allowing employees to move between departments at will br After having taken years to develop Half Life Valve moved to episodic development planning to release shorter games more frequently Half Life Episode One the first in a planned trilogy of episodic Half Life sequels was released in Episode Two followed in alongside the multiplayer game Team Fortress and the puzzle game Portal developed from the student project Narbacular Drop br In January Valve announced the acquisition of Turtle Rock Studios which was renamed Valve South Turtle Rock developed Left Dead and

revenue to be in the high hundreds of millions of dollars As of Valve had an estimated worth of to billion and employed people according to Newell this made it more profitable per employee than Google or Apple Most of Valve s revenue comes from Steam which controlled to of the market for downloaded PC games in br br br Transition to services br br In Valve hired IceFrog the developer of Defense of the Ancients a Warcraft III mod IceFrog led the development of a sequel not associated with the Warcraft elements Dota released in Alongside Dota in Valve started The International an annual esports tournament for Dota with a prize pool supported by Valve and funds from microtransactions from battle passes purchased by players Valve released Portal in April As with the original Portal Valve employed a Digipen student team to help develop it the team behind Tag The Power of Paint implemented the new gel gameplay br In December Valve acquired Star Filled Studios a two person studio to open a San Francisco office Valve ended the operation in August when they decided it had little benefit At the D I C E Summit Newell announced that he and the film director J J Abrams were collaborating to produce a Half Life or Portal film as well as a possible game br In the s Valve released fewer games and invested in hardware development Newell intended to make Valve more like Nintendo which develops games in tandem with hardware allowing them to create innovative games such as Super Mario Valve initially focused on augmented reality but in Newell laid off many staff to focus on virtual reality VR In Valve released the Steam Machine a line of gaming computers which sold poorly br Media commentators speculated that Valve s transition to service provider with Steam which generated an estimated billion in had driven it away from game development Valve canceled games including numerous Half Life projects including Episode Three Left Dead a Soulslike game and a voxel based game A R T I Additional VR projects included SimTrek developed by members of the Kerbal Space Program development team and a new VR device Vader that was determined to be too costly for consumers According to the designer Robin Walker the abundance of projects that failed to gain traction with no shared vision damaged morale Many players grew frustrated in anticipation of a new Half Life game br br br Source virtual reality and Half Life Alyx present br Valve announced the Source engine in March and ported Dota to it that September That year Valve collaborated with the electronics company HTC to develop the HTC Vive a VR headset released in Valve experimented with VR games and in released The Lab a collection of VR minigames br Valve recognized that many players wanted a more ambitious VR AAA game and began exploring the development of a major VR game They developed several prototypes with three further VR projects under development by Finding that the portal systems of their puzzle series Portal were disorienting in VR they settled on Half Life Walker said that Half Life had been a terrifyingly daunting prospect and the team saw VR as a way to return to the series br Full development of a VR Half Life game started around late with the largest team in Valve s history Valve acquired the D audio software developer Impulsonic in January In April Valve acquired the independent developer Campo Santo known for the adventure game Firewatch Campo Santo planned to develop its own games under Valve though they initially helped develop Half Life Alyx br In November Valve released Artifact a digital collectible card game based on Dota with design by Richard Garfield the creator of Magic The Gathering Artifact had unusual pay for mechanics to acquire new cards and did not draw a large playerbase losing of players months after release In April Valve abandoned efforts to reboot the project saying they had not found enough interested players to justify development In June Valve released its second generation VR hardware the Valve Index They also released Dota Underlords into early access an auto battler based on a Dota community created mode Dota Auto Chess br In March Valve released Half Life Alyx a VR game It received acclaim and was described as VR s first killer app Newell said in January that the success of Alyx created desire within the company to develop more games and that several were under development Valve collaborated with Netflix for Dota Dragon s Blood an animated television series based on Dota which premiered in March In February Valve released the Steam Deck a portable game system that runs on SteamOS In March Valve announced Counter Strike It is expected to feature major technical improvements br br br Structure br br Initially Valve used a hierarchical structure more typical of other development firms driven by the nature of physical game releases through publishers that required tasks to be completed by deadlines However as Valve became its own publisher via Steam it found the hierarchal structure was hindering progress br After completing Half Life Valve transitioned to a flat organization outside of executive management Valve does not have bosses and uses an open allocation system Valve s marketing manager Doug Lombardi said Nobody writes a design doc and hands it to somebody and says you go build this It s the teams that are coming up with the ideas and pushing in the directions that they want to take the product This approach allows employees to work on whatever interests them but requires them to take ownership of their product and mistakes they may make according to Newell Newell recognized that this structure works well for some but that there are plenty of great developers for whom this is a terrible place to work br Although Valve has no bosses some employees hold more influence due to seniority or relationships De facto project leads became centralized conduits for organization and sharing information and decisions are made collectively Valve uses an Overwatch process to gather feedback from senior members which teams may use or ignore br The success of Steam means that Valve is not dependent on the success of its games The lack of organization structure has led to project cancellations as it can be difficult to convince other employees to work on them In Valve acknowledged that this made it difficult to gather momentum and had slowed their output during the s Their VR projects and Half Life Alyx became a turning point setting short term studio wide goals to focus the company According to Walker We sort of had to collectively admit we were wrong on the premise that you will be happiest if you work on something you personally want to work on the most br In January People Make Games released a report on Valve s corporate structure and culture based on interviews with several current and former employees They found that Valve s flat structure and stack ranking compensation system created a poor release record and a lack of employee diversity br As part of Wolfire Games lawsuit over Steam policies case documents revealed details related to Valve s employee structure Starting with employees in the company grew to around employees around and remained around this number through Up through the employees were categorized in three areas adminstration game development and Steam development in a new hardware development category was added br br br Valve time br br Valve time is an industry term used jokingly with game releases from Valve used to acknowledge the difference between the promised date for released content stated by Valve and to the actual release date Valve Time includes delays but also includes some content that was released earlier than expected Valve itself has fully acknowledged the term including tracking known discrepancies between ideal and actual releases on their public development wiki and using it in announcements about such delays Valve ascribes delays to their mentality of team driven initiatives over corporate deadlines br br br Playtesting br Valve playtests its games extensively starting from the beginning of development and iterates based on the results Its website states We believe that all game designers are in a sense experimental psychologists The Valve writer Chet Faliszek said he initially blamed testers when they failed to engage with designs as expected but changed his mind when multiple testers had the same problem By the third or fourth time all of a sudden you re realizing I m an idiot This is pretty obvious this doesn t work It s not their fault it s our fault He gave an example from the development of Left Dead wherein a texture change caused every tester to miss a ladder and become stuck br Walker said playtesting helped Valve maximize the experience for players For example when something incredibly cool occurs by chance during a playtest the developers attempt to have it occur for every player Newell contrasted this approach to that of Warren Spector whose open ended games are designed to be replayed with different outcomes You spend all of this time to build stuff that most players will never ever ever see If only one per cent of your customers see this cool thing that takes five per cent of your development budget that s not a good use of resources br br br Technology br br br Products br br br Games br br Valve is the main developer and publisher of the single player Half Life and Portal games and the multiplayer games Counter Strike Team Fortress Dota Day of Defeat and Artifact Valve also published the multiplayer game Left Dead and developed and published Left Dead Unreleased and canceled Valve games include the fantasy role playing game Prospero and numerous Half Life projects including Episode Three Valve worked with Arkane Studios on The Crossing which was canceled in May br br br Steam br br Valve announced Steam its digital distribution service at the Game Developers Conference It was launched in September and was first used to deliver patches and other updates to Valve s online games br On August Valve announced revisions to the Steam Subscriber Agreement SSA to prohibit class action lawsuits by users against the service provider By July there were over games available on Steam with over million registered accounts by January br Alongside these changes to the SSA the company also declared publicly the incorporation of Valve S a r l a subsidiary based in Luxembourg Valve set up a physical office in Luxembourg Kirchberg According to Valve s project manager Mike Dunkle the location was chosen for eCommerce capabilities and infrastructure talent acquisition tax advantages and central geographic location most major partners are accessible within driving distance br Valve S a r l was used to sell games to UK users to avoid paying the full value added tax VAT The tax loophole was expected to close on January In December the French consumer group UFC Que Choisir initiated a lawsuit against Valve for several of their Steam policies that conflict or run afoul of French law One of the reasons was for using the tax loophole Valve S a r l ceased business on January with the main company taking over EU sales again In August Valve announced that Steam had reached over million monthly and million daily active users on the platform br br br Steam Machine br br Newell has been critical of the direction that Microsoft has taken with making Windows a closed architecture similar to Apple s products and has stated that he believes that the changes made in Windows are a catastrophe for everyone in the personal computer space Newell identified the open source Linux platform as an ideal platform for Steam and said the only thing holding back its adoption is the lack of games br In Valve announced that they were working on a console PC hybrid for the living room dubbed by media as the Steam Box A precursor to such a unit is SteamOS a freely available Linux based operating system that builds upon the Steam client functionality that includes media services live streaming across home networks game sharing within families and parental controls SteamOS was officially announced in September as the first of several announcements related to the Steam Machine platform as well as their unique game controller In May Valve announced that the company s own SteamOS powered Steam Machine would be delayed until due to problems with the game controller In Alienware ZOTAC and CyberPowerPC launched their versions of the Steam Machine By June fewer than half a million had been sold While the Steam Machine line has been effectively canceled Valve continued to manufacture and sell Steam Controllers until late November and publishes both mobile apps and software for the Steam Link allowing in home streaming br br br Valve Index and virtual reality br At the Game Developers Conference in March Valve and Taiwanese electronics company HTC unveiled SteamVR and the HTC Vive a virtual reality platform and a virtual reality headset The platform would be distinguished by its Lighthouse motion tracking system where sensors on the headset and its included motion controllers read the position of two base station devices mounted in the play area This would allow for room scale VR experiences where the player would not be required to remain in a stationary position in front of a camera and would be able to freely walk around the space br In November Microsoft added beta support for the SteamVR service for Windows Mixed Reality headsets In June Valve released their own VR headset known as the Valve Index positioned as a higher end device with wider field of view and higher refresh rate They were accompanied by updated motion controllers which are strapped against the user s palms and have sensors for detecting input pressure and individual fingers br br br Steam Deck br br Announced in July the Steam Deck is a hybrid game console similar to the Nintendo Switch It is primarily a handheld device that supports playing of Steam games but through a separate dock unit the console can output to an external monitor and use external power networking and USB accessories connected to the dock The hardware is based on customized AMD Zen and RDNA chipsets Units started shipping in February br br br Other projects br br br PowerPlay br PowerPlay was a technological initiative headed by Valve and Cisco Systems to decrease the latency for online games announced in January It was described as a set of protocols and deployment standards at the router level to improve performance It was claimed that a player with ms ping was able to play against another player on a LAN connection with no noticeable disadvantage Initially the protocol was to be released with PowerPlay focusing on quality of service QoS and later a revision PowerPlay that would focus on functionality Cisco and Valve intended to deliver a single dial up service in Q in the United States with a day free trial with a bundled copy of Team Fortress modified to support PowerPlay br The standard was to involve purchasing PowerPlay approved Cisco hardware and infrastructure that had adequate bandwidth and QoS standards that prioritize PowerPlay gaming packets at all others expense Newell conceded that Internet service providers ISPs would bear the brunt of this expense The ISPs are going to need to spend a fair amount of money to be compliant with PowerPlay But how they get that back is up to them Some will have a tiered service and some will just try to recoup their investment through reduced customer churn and customer acquisition Despite never deploying the dial up plan featuring PowerPlay Valve announced in January that the standard had indeed been finalized months after its announcement PowerPlay was abandoned br br br Pipeline br In July Valve announced Pipeline an intern project consisting of ten high school students working together to learn how to create video game content Pipeline serves to discuss and answer questions that teenagers often ask about the video game industry and see if it is possible to train a group of teenagers with minimal work experience to work for a company like Valve The latter purpose breaks Valve s tradition of employing experienced developers as the company is not good at teaching people straight out of school br br br Legal disputes br br br Valve Corporation v Vivendi Universal Games br Between and Valve was involved in a complex legal dispute with its publisher Vivendi Universal Games under Vivendi s brand Sierra Entertainment Valve had entered into a publishing agreement with Sierra to release Half Life and subsequent games in with the contract giving Sierra some intellectual property IP rights to Valve s games After Valve began development of Half Life it agreed a new contract with Sierra in removing these rights from Sierra and giving Valve some rights for digital distribution Internally Valve started work on Steam as a means to digitally distribute these games and first revealed this project at the March Game Developers Conference br By August Valve had found that Sierra was distributing copies of their games to Internet cafes against the terms of their contracts and filed a lawsuit against Sierra and Vivendi In addition to claims of copyright infringement Valve asserted that Sierra breached contract by withholding royalties and delaying the release of Counter Strike Condition Zero until after the holiday season Vivendi and Sierra countersued stating that Valve had misrepresented their position in the revised contract since they had been working on Steam at that point as a means to circumvent the publishing agreement Vivendi sought intellectual property rights to Half Life and a ruling preventing Valve from using Steam to distribute Half Life br On November Judge Thomas Samuel Zilly of the U S District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled in favor of Valve The ruling stated that Vivendi Universal and its affiliates including Sierra were not authorized to distribute Valve games either directly or indirectly through cyber caf s to end users for pay to play activities pursuant to the parties publishing agreement In addition Judge Zilly ruled that Valve could recover copyright damages for infringements without regard to the publishing agreement s limitation of liability clause Valve posted on the Steam website that the companies had come to a settlement in court on April Electronic Arts announced on July that they would partner with Valve in a multi year deal to distribute their games replacing Vivendi Universal As a result of the trial the arbitrator also awarded Valve br br br Valve Corporation v Activision Blizzard br In April Valve sued Activision Blizzard which acquired Sierra Entertainment after a merger with its parent company Vivendi Universal Games Activision had allegedly refused to honor the Valve v Vivendi arbitration agreement Activision had only paid Valve of the award refusing to pay the remaining claiming it had overpaid that sum in the past years br br br Dota intellectual property ownership br Defense of the Ancients DotA was a landmark mod first released in that created the basis of the genre of multiplayer online battle arena MOBA It was originally developed by Kyle Sommer who goes by the alias Eul within Blizzard Entertainment s Warcraft III Reign of Chaos via its world editor and spawned several similar efforts notably DotA Allstars While there had been several that contributed to DotA Allstars the project was managed primarily by Steve Guinsoo Feak and later by IceFrog IceFrog was eventually hired by Valve in with the rights to the DotA intellectual property being sold to Valve the following year Eul was also hired into Valve by Valve then subsequently filed trademarks towards a sequel to DotA titled Dota DotA Allstars LLC a group of former contributors to the DotA Allstars project filed an opposing trademark in August to contest Valve s claim it owned the property rights br DotA Allstars LLC was eventually acquired by Blizzard to start development of Blizzard All Stars Blizzard took over the trademark challenge The United States Patent Trademark Office initially ruled in Valve s favor By this point Riot Games had hired Guinsoo to help develop their own MOBA League of Legends As with IceFrog Feak transferred his rights to the Dota property to Riot who in turn sold those to Blizzard Blizzard filed a lawsuit against Valve to challenge Valve s ownership pitting the rights assigned through IceFrog to Guinsoo at odds The case Blizzard Entertainment v Valve Corporation was settled out of court in May Valve retained the right to use Dota commercially while Blizzard reserved the right for fans to use Dota non commercially Blizzard changed the names of its own projects to remove the Dota term and renamed Blizzard All Stars as Heroes of the Storm Valve s Dota was released in br In mobile developers Lilith and uCool released their games Dota Legends and Heroes Charge respectively Both were influenced by Dota and the sequels In Valve and Blizzard took joint action against these companies citing copyright issues related to the Dota names uCool argued that the Dota games were a collective work and could not be copyrighted by anyone in particular but the presiding judge Charles R Breyer felt that due to the trio s actions as maintainers of the Dota mods they had a rightful copyright claim to this Separately Lilith and uCool argued that Eul had in a forum post from September assigned an open source copyright license to Dota which would make Valve and Blizzard s copyright claims void The case was later heard by a jury br br br ACCC v Valve Corporation br The Australian Competition Consumer Commission ACCC announced it was taking action against Valve in On March Valve was found guilty of breaching Australian consumer law because br br Valve claimed consumers were not entitled to a refund for digitally downloaded games purchased from Valve via the Steam website or Steam Client in any circumstances br Valve had excluded statutory guarantees and or warranties that goods would be of acceptable quality and br Valve had restricted or modified statutory guarantees and or warranties of acceptable quality br During the prosecution of this case Valve implemented a refund policy for Steam purchases but the case still reviewed Valve s actions prior to the onset of the lawsuit The court overseeing the case sided with the ACCC in assigning a A million about US million fine against Valve in December as well as requiring Valve to inform Australian consumers of their rights when purchasing games from Steam Valve appealed the court s determination that it engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct and made false or misleading representations about consumer guarantees as well as seeking to appeal the fine but the Australian higher courts rejected the appeals in December In January Valve filed for a special leave of the court s decision appealing to the High Court of Australia The High Court dismissed this claim in April asserting that Valve still was liable under Australian law since it sold products directly to its citizens br br br UFC Que Choisir v Valve Corporation br Consumer rights group UFC Que Choisir based in France filed a lawsuit against Valve in December claiming users should be able to resell their software The High Court of Paris ruled in favor of UFC Que Choisir in September stating that Valve must allow the resale of Steam games Valve stated it will appeal the decision br br br Skins gambling br br Valve was named as a defendant in two lawsuits in June and July related to third party gambling sites that use the Steamworks API to allow betting with the virtual currency of cosmetic weapon replacement textures better known as skins from Counter Strike Global Offensive which through these sites can be converted from or to real world money Both suits assert Valve aiding in underaged gambling Valve subsequently stated it has no commercial ties with these sites and that it would demand these sites cease their use of the Steamworks API as they violate the authorized use policies In October the Washington State Gambling Commission required Valve to stop the use of virtual skins for gambling on Steam stating they would face legal repercussions if they failed to co operate On October Valve sent a letter to the Washington State Gambling Commission stating that they had no business relationship with such gambling sites asserting that they come into existence operate and go out of existence without their knowledge and consent adding that they were not aware of any such law that Steam or any of their games were violating br br br Anti competitive practices br In February the European Commission began investigating Valve and five other publishers Bandai Namco Entertainment Capcom Focus Home Interactive Koch Media and ZeniMax Media for anti competitive practices specifically the use of geo blocking through the Steam storefront and Steam product keys to prevent access to software to citizens of certain countries Such practices would be against the Digital Single Market initiative by the European Union While the other five companies named are in stages of settling with the EU as of August Valve has stated it plans to fight the charges asserting that geo blocking affects less than of its games and that it had turned off such geo blocking within the EU in br In January five gamers filed a proposed class action antitrust lawsuit in California against Valve alleging that the company abuses the Steam platform s market power by requiring game developers and publishers to enter into a most favored nation agreement with Valve restricting their ability to sell games for less on other platforms and thereby preventing price competition br In May Wolfire Games filed a proposed class action antitrust lawsuit against Valve alleging that the company exerts monopoly power over the PC gaming market and uses its gatekeeper role to wield extreme power over publishers of PC Desktop Games and to extract an extraordinarily high cut from nearly every sale that passes through its store Although a motion by Valve to dismiss the original lawsuit was granted in November Wolfire was allowed to file a revised complaint and in May US District Court Judge John C Coughenour ruled that that lawsuit could proceed finding that Wolfire s allegations were sufficient to plausibly allege unlawful conduct br In June Vicki Shotbolt a children s digital rights activist filed a lawsuit with the Competition Appeal Tribunal in the UK that accuses Valve of rigging the market for PC games alleging that Valve used its market dominance to overcharge million people in the UK and seeking damages of to per affected customer or million in total br br br Discrimination lawsuit br In a former employee filed a suit against Valve alleging poor working conditions and harassment The jury ruled in favor of Valve in br br br br br br External links br br Official website
