other players The game encourages players to work together to complete quests enter dungeons and engage in player versus player PvP combat however the game can also be played solo without interacting with others The game primarily focuses on character progression in which players earn experience points to level up their character to make them more powerful and buy and sell items using in game currency to acquire better equipment among other game systems br World of Warcraft was a major critical and commercial success upon its original release in and quickly became the most popular MMORPG of all time reaching a peak of million subscribers in The game had over one hundred million registered accounts by and by had grossed over billion in revenue making it one of the highest grossing video game franchises of all time The game has been cited by gaming journalists as the greatest MMORPG of all time and one of the greatest video games of all time and has also been noted for its long lifespan continuing to receive developer support and expansion packs over years since its initial release In a vanilla version of the game titled World of Warcraft Classic was launched allowing players to experience the base game before any of its expansions launched with versions of Classic for future expansions being released subsequently with minor changes In Blizzard and NetEase cancelled an unannounced World of Warcraft mobile spin off game In July artists designers engineers producers and quality assurance testers voted to unionize with CWA br br br Gameplay br br br Starting a character or play session br As with other MMORPGs players control a character avatar within a game world in third or first person view exploring the landscape fighting various monsters completing quests and interacting with non player characters NPCs or other players Also similar to other MMORPGs World of Warcraft requires the player to pay for a subscription by using a credit or debit card using prepaid Blizzard game cards or using a WoW Token purchased in game Players without a subscription may use a trial account that lets the player character reach up to level but has many features locked br To enter the game the player must select a server referred to in game as a realm Each realm acts as an individual copy of the game world and falls into one of two categories Available realm types are br br Normal a regular type realm where the gameplay is mostly focused on defeating monsters and completing quests with player versus player fights and any roleplay are optional br RP roleplay which works the same way as a Normal realm but focuses on players roleplaying in character br Before the introduction of World of Warcraft s seventh expansion Battle for Azeroth both Normal and RP servers were each divided into two separate categories PvE servers and PvP servers This has since been removed after the implementation of the War Mode option which allows any player of level and higher on any server to determine whether they want to actively participate in PvP combat or not by enabling War Mode in two of the game s capital cities br Realms are also categorized by language with in game support in the language available br Players can make new characters on all realms within the region and it is also possible to move already established characters between realms for a fee br br br Races and factions br br To create a new character in keeping with the storyline of previous Warcraft games players must choose between the opposing factions of the Alliance or the Horde Pandaren which were added in Mists of Pandaria do not commit to a faction until after the starting zone is completed Characters from the opposing factions can perform rudimentary communication most often just emotes but only members of the same faction can speak mail group and join guilds The player selects the new character s race such as orcs or trolls for the Horde or humans or dwarves for the Alliance Players must select the class for the character with choices such as mages warriors and priests available Most classes are limited to particular races br br br Ongoing gameplay br As characters become more developed they gain various talents and skills requiring the player to further define the abilities of that character Characters can choose two primary professions that can focus on producing items such as tailoring blacksmithing or jewelcrafting or on gathering from resource nodes such as skinning or mining Characters can learn all three secondary skills archeology cooking and fishing Characters may form and join guilds allowing characters within the guild access to the guild s chat channel the guild name and optionally allowing other features including a guild tabard guild bank guild repairs and dues br Much of World of Warcraft play involves the completion of quests These quests are usually available from NPCs Quests usually reward the player with some combination of experience points items and in game money Quests allow characters to gain access to new skills and abilities as well as the ability to explore new areas It is through quests that much of the game s story is told both through the quest s text and through scripted NPC actions Quests are linked by a common theme with each consecutive quest triggered by the completion of the previous forming a quest chain Quests commonly involve killing a number of creatures gathering a certain number of resources finding a difficult to locate object speaking to various NPCs visiting specific locations interacting with objects in the world or delivering an item from one place to another to acquire experience and treasures br While a character can be played on its own players can group with others to tackle more challenging content Most end game challenges are designed in such a way that they can only be overcome while in a group In this way character classes are used in specific roles within a group World of Warcraft uses a rested bonus system increasing the rate that a character can gain experience points after the player has spent time away from the game When a character dies it becomes a ghost or wisp for Night Elf characters at a nearby graveyard Characters can be resurrected by other characters that have the ability or can self resurrect by moving from the graveyard to the place where they died If a character is past level ten and they resurrect at a graveyard the items equipped by the character degrade requiring in game money and a specialist NPC to repair them Items that have degraded heavily become unusable until they are repaired If the location of the character s body is unreachable they can use a special spirit healer NPC to resurrect at the graveyard When the spirit healer revives a character items equipped by the character at that time are further degraded and the character is significantly weakened by what is in game called resurrection sickness for up to ten minutes depending on the character s level This resurrection sickness does not occur and item degradation is less severe if the character revives by locating its body or is resurrected by another player through spells or special items br World of Warcraft contains a variety of mechanisms for player versus player PvP play Players on player versus environment PvE servers can opt to toggle War Mode themselves making themselves attackable to players of the opposite faction Depending on the mode of the realm PvP combat between members of opposing factions is possible at almost any time or location in the game world the only exception being the starting zones where the PvP flag must be enabled by the player wishing to fight against players of the opposite faction PvE called normal or RP servers by contrast allow a player to choose whether or not to engage in combat against other players On both server types there are special areas of the world where free for all combat is permitted Battlegrounds for example are similar to dungeons only a set number of characters can enter a single battleground but additional copies of the battleground can be made to accommodate additional players Each battleground has a set objective such as capturing a flag or defeating an opposing general that must be completed to win the battleground Competing in battlegrounds rewards the character with tokens and honor points that can be used to buy armor weapons and other general items that can aid a player in many areas of the game Winning a battleground awards more honor and tokens than losing In addition players also earn honor when they or nearby teammates kill players in a battleground br br br Setting br World of Warcraft is set in the same universe as the Warcraft series of real time strategy games and has a similar art direction World of Warcraft contains elements from fantasy steampunk and science fiction including gryphons dragons elves steam powered automata zombies werewolves other horror monsters time travel spaceships and alien worlds br World of Warcraft takes place in a D representation of the Warcraft universe that players can interact with through their characters The game world initially consisted of the two continents in Azeroth Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms Four separate expansions later added to the game s playable area the realms of Outland and Draenor and the continents of Northrend and Pandaria As a player explores new locations different routes and means of transportation become available Players can access flight masters in newly discovered locations to fly to previously discovered locations in other parts of the world Players can also use boats zeppelins or portals to move from one continent to another Although the game world remains relatively similar from day to day seasonal events reflecting real world events such as Halloween Hallow s End Christmas Winter Veil Children s Week Easter Noblegarden and Midsummer have been represented in the game world Locations also have variable weather including among other things rain snow and dust storms br A number of facilities are available for characters while in towns and cities In each major city characters can access a bank to deposit items such as treasures or crafted items Each character has access to personal bank storage with the option to purchase additional storage space using in game gold Additionally guild banks are available for use by members of a guild with restrictions being set by the guild leader Auction houses are available for players to buy and sell items to others in a similar way to online auction sites such as eBay Players can use mailboxes which can be found in almost every town Mailboxes are used to collect items won at auction and to send messages items and in game money to other characters br Some of the challenges in World of Warcraft require players to group together to complete them These usually take place in dungeons also known as instances that a group of characters can enter together The term instance comes from each group or party having a separate copy or instance of the dungeon complete with their own enemies to defeat and their own treasure or rewards This allows a group to explore areas and complete quests without others interfering Dungeons are spread over the game world and are designed for characters of varying progression A typical dungeon will allow up to five characters to enter as part of a group Some dungeons require more players to group together and form a raid of up to forty players to face some of the most difficult challenges As well as dungeon based raid challenges several creatures exist in the normal game environment that are designed for raids to attack br br br Subscription br World of Warcraft requires a subscription to allow continued play with options to pay in one month three month or six month blocks and time cards of varying lengths available from retailers or purchasing a WoW Token using in game currency Expansion packs are available online and from retailers As the game client is the same regardless of the version of World of Warcraft the user owns the option to purchase expansions online was added as it allows for a quick upgrade World of Warcraft is also available as a free Starter Edition which is free to play for an unlimited amount of time Starter Edition characters are unable to gain experience after reaching level and there are other restrictions in effect for Starter Edition accounts including the inability to trade use mail use Auction House use public chat channels join guilds or amass more than ten gold br In January accounts that have lapsed subscriptions which previously would not let a player log in work like a restricted Starter Edition account with the one difference that sub level characters will be able to join a guild if any other characters on the account are still in that guild br In April an alternate way to cover the subscription was introduced A player may spend real money in North America and differing amounts in other regions on a WoW Token which is sold on the auction house for the in game currency gold that initially could only be used to add days of playtime At the launch of the feature in North America a token sold for gold and hours later sold for gold therefore the gold amount changes depending on what players are willing to spend Subsequently the amount that a North American token sells for remained at above gold and the other Battle net regions were well above that value Once a player buys a token on the auction house it is account bound and cannot be resold As of February the WoW Token can also be exchanged for in Battle net balance that can be used as credit for purchases in most of Blizzard s games as well as in Destiny br br br Parental controls br The company offers parental controls that allow various limits to be set on playing time It is possible to set a daily limit a weekly limit or to specify an allowed playing schedule In order to control these settings it is necessary to log in with different credentials than are used just to enter the game It is also possible to receive statistics on the time spent playing Apart from controlling children adults sometimes use parental controls on themselves The company supports this kind of protection as otherwise the potential players or their supervisors may choose to uninstall or block the game permanently br br br Plot br br Intent on settling in Durotar Thrall s Horde expanded its ranks by inviting the undead Forsaken to join orcs tauren and trolls Meanwhile dwarves gnomes and the ancient night elves pledged their loyalties to the Alliance guided by the human kingdom of Stormwind After Stormwind s king Varian Wrynn mysteriously disappeared Highlord Bolvar Fordragon served as Regent but his service was affected by the mind control of the black dragon Onyxia who ruled in disguise as a human noblewoman As heroes investigated Onyxia s manipulations the ancient elemental lord Ragnaros resurfaced to endanger both the Horde and Alliance The heroes of the Horde and Alliance defeated Onyxia and sent Ragnaros back to the Elemental Plane br br br Assault on Blackwing Lair br Deep within Blackrock Mountain the black dragon Nefarian conducted twisted experiments with the blood of other dragonflights Intent on seizing the entire area for his own he recruited the remaining Dark Horde a rogue army that embraced the demonic bloodlust of the old Horde These corrupt orcs trolls and other races battled against Ragnaros and the Dark Iron dwarves for control of the mountain Nefarian created the twisted chromatic dragons and a legion of other aberrations in his bid to form an army powerful enough to control Azeroth and continue the legacy of his infamous father Deathwing the Destroyer Nefarian was vanquished by the heroes from the Horde and the Alliance br br br Rise of the Blood God br Years ago in the ruined temple of Atal Hakkar loyal priests of the Blood God Hakkar the Soulflayer attempted to summon the wrathful deity s avatar into the world But his followers the Atal ai priesthood discovered that the Soulflayer could only be summoned within the Gurubashi tribe s ancient capital Zul Gurub Newly reborn in this jungle fortress Hakkar took control of the Gurubashi tribe and mortal champions of the trolls mighty animal gods The Soulflayer s dark influence was halted when the Zandalari tribe recruited heroes and invaded Zul Gurub br br br The Gates of Ahn Qiraj br The great desert fortress of Ahn Qiraj long sealed behind the Scarab Wall was home to the insectoid qiraji a savage race that had once mounted an assault to devastate the continent of Kalimdor But something far more sinister lurked behind Ahn Qiraj s walls the Old God C Thun an ancient entity whose pervasive evil had suffused Azeroth since time immemorial As C Thun incited the qiraji to frenzy both the Alliance and Horde prepared for a massive war effort A mixed force of Alliance and Horde soldiers dubbed the Might of Kalimdor opened the gates of Ahn Qiraj under the command of the orc Varok Saurfang The heroes laid siege to the ruins and temples of Ahn Qiraj and vanquished C Thun br br br Shadow of the Necropolis br In the Lich King s haste to spread the plague of undeath over Azeroth he gifted one of his greatest servants the lich Kel Thuzad with the flying citadel of Naxxramas as a base of operations for the Scourge Consistent attacks from the Scarlet Crusade and Argent Dawn factions weakened the defenses of the floating fortress enabling an incursion from the heroes that led to Kel Thuzad s defeat However a traitor among the ranks of the knightly order of the Argent Dawn ran away with Kel Thuzad s cursed remains and fled to Northrend where the fallen lich could be reanimated br br br Development br World of Warcraft was first announced by Blizzard at the ECTS trade show in September Released in development of the game took roughly years including extensive testing The D graphics in World of Warcraft use elements of the proprietary graphics engine originally used in Warcraft III The game was designed to be an open environment where players are allowed to do what they please Quests are optional and were designed to help guide players allow character development and to spread characters across different zones to try to avoid what developers called player collision The game interface allows players to customize appearance and controls and to install add ons and other modifications br World of Warcraft runs natively on both Mac and Windows platforms Boxed copies of the game use a hybrid CD to install the game eliminating the need for separate Mac and Windows retail products The game allows all users to play together regardless of their operating system Although there is no official version for any other platform support for World of Warcraft is present in Windows API implementations Wine and CrossOver allowing the game to be played under Linux and FreeBSD While a native Linux client is neither released nor announced by Blizzard in January IT journalist Michael Larabel indicated in a Phoronix article that an internal Linux client might exist but is not released due to the non standardization of the Linux distro ecosystem br br br Regional variations br In the United States Canada and Europe Blizzard distributes World of Warcraft via retail software packages The software package includes days of gameplay for no additional cost To continue playing after the initial days additional play time must be purchased using a credit card or prepaid game card The minimum gameplay duration that a player can purchase is days using a credit card or using a prepaid game card A player also has the option of purchasing three or six months of gameplay at once for a discount In Australia the United States and many European countries video game stores commonly stock the trial version of World of Warcraft in DVD form which includes the game and levels of gameplay after which the player would have to upgrade to a retail account by supplying a valid credit card or purchasing a game card as well as a retail copy of the game br In Brazil World of Warcraft was released on December via BattleNet The first three expansions are currently available fully translated including voice acting into Brazilian Portuguese br In South Korea there is no software package or CD key requirement to activate the account However to play the game players must purchase time credits online There are two kinds of time credits available one where the player is billed based on the actual number of minutes that will be available and one where the player can play the game for a number of days In the former time can be purchased in multiples of hours or hours and in the latter time can be purchased in multiples of days month or months As software packages are not required expansion pack contents are available to all players on launch day br In China because a large number of players do not own the computer on which they play games e g if they play in Internet caf s the CD keys required to create an account can be purchased independently of the software package To play the game players must also purchase prepaid game cards that can be played for hours and minutes A monthly fee model is not available to players of this region The Chinese government and NetEase the licensee for World of Warcraft in China have imposed a modification on Chinese versions of the game which places flesh on bare boned skeletons and transforms dead character corpses into tidy graves These changes were imposed by the Chinese government in an attempt to promote a healthy and harmonious online game environment in World of Warcraft The Chinese government delayed the release of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion due to what it deemed objectionable content NetEase took over licensing of World of Warcraft from The in June following the expiration of The s contract and were able to secure a launch for Wrath of the Lich King on August nearly two years after its Western release Due to a contract dispute these servers were shut down on January In April NetEase announced that World of Warcraft services would be returning to China in the Summer of later leading to a livestream on June in which Blizzard team members outlined the release of the Wrath of the Lich King for World of Warcraft Classic and The War Within expansion for World of Warcraft for Chinese players br br br Post release content br The World of Warcraft launcher referred to in press releases and the menu bar as the Blizzard Launcher is a program designed to act as a starting point for World of Warcraft players It provides a way to launch World of Warcraft and starts the Blizzard updater It was first included with the version patch The patch allowed for an option to bypass the use of the launcher Features of the launcher include news and updates for World of Warcraft players access to World of Warcraft s support website access to the test version of World of Warcraft when it is available to test upcoming patches updates to Warden and updates to the updater itself The patch redesigned the launcher and added the ability to change the game settings from the launcher itself The launcher update from patch also allows people to play the game while non crucial pieces of the game are downloaded This requires a high speed broadband internet connection br Patch added native support for Intel powered Macs making World of Warcraft a universal application As a result of this the minimum supported Mac OS X version has been changed to World of Warcraft version and later will not launch on older versions of Mac OS X PowerPC architecture Macs are no longer supported since version br When new content is added to the game official system requirements may change In version the requirements for Windows were increased from requiring MB to MB of RAM Official Windows technical support was dropped but the game continued to run there until version Before Mists of Pandaria in World of Warcraft officially dropped support for Windows followed by Windows XP and Vista in October as well as all bit support br Starting with players could try out an experimental bit version of the client which required manual downloading and copying files into the installation folder Since the bit client is automatically installed and used by default br Since World IPv Day the client and most of the servers support IPv br br br Expansions br br Nine expansions have been released The Burning Crusade released in January Wrath of the Lich King released in November Cataclysm released in December Mists of Pandaria released in September Warlords of Draenor released in November Legion released in August Battle for Azeroth released in August Shadowlands released in November and Dragonflight released in November Players are not required to purchase expansions in order to continue playing

entered beta on June Warlords of Draenor was released on November On August Blizzard announced the sixth expansion Legion at Gamescom In November the Legion s alpha testing started and in April the beta test started the Legion expansion was released on August The seventh expansion Battle for Azeroth was released worldwide on August and depending on location in The eighth expansion Shadowlands was announced on November and released on November The ninth expansion Dragonflight was announced on April and was released on November At BlizzCon Blizzard announced the Worldsoul Saga a story arc that would span the course of three expansions The War Within Midnight and The Last Titan set to begin in br Blizzard routinely applies older expansions to all accounts as new expansions are released On June The Burning Crusade expansion was automatically applied to all previous Warcraft accounts at no cost On September the same thing was done with the Wrath of the Lich King expansion and on October the Cataclysm expansion was also applied On October Mists of Pandaria was applied to all accounts following the release of Warlords of Draenor On May Warlords of Draenor was applied to all accounts to coincide with the release of the Warcraft movie that gives a day trial of the game br All The Burning Crusade Wrath of the Lich King Cataclysm Mists of Pandaria and Warlords of Draenor content is now effectively part of the original game with all new World of Warcraft accounts automatically including these expansions upon creation As of the release of the Dragonflight expansion in all expansions up to Shadowlands are included in the base game br br br Music br Almost all of the music in World of Warcraft is orchestral with a wide variety of classical and folk instruments in harmony often playing widely transformative non repetitive melodies While the player is in game music is usually playing from a set of tracks composed to match the mood of the type of environment your character is in such as mountain forest plains jungle et cetera while some individual zones and cities such as Elwynn Forest and Thunder Bluff are given their own set of tracks Some environments play different music depending on the time of day you are in them br The soundtrack for the original release of World of Warcraft was composed and arranged by Jason Hayes Tracy W Bush Derek Duke and Glenn Stafford and conducted by E mear Noone Most of the music from the game and the cinematic trailers was released in the official album on November together with the collector s edition of the game It is sold separately on one CD in the MP format More music was composed for each of the game s expansions which were also given their own album releases br On January Alfred Publishing produced a sheet music series for vocalists pianists strings and other instruments World of Warcraft Sheet Music Anthology in solo and accompaniment formats with CD These works include four pages of collectible artwork and vary by number of songs included br In a remix of the song from the game Hymn of the Firstborn Son was nominated for Best Game Music Cover Remix at the th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards br br br Reception br br World of Warcraft received very positive reviews upon release following a period of high anticipation before launch Although the game follows a similar model to and was noted for using many familiar concepts from the role playing genre the new approaches to reducing pauses between game encounters were well liked A common example was the approach to character death In some previous MMORPGs a player would suffer a high penalty for character death in World of Warcraft a player is able to recover and start playing quickly Combat was another area where downtime or pauses between play was reduced By allowing all character types to recover from damage taken players can return to combat quickly Reviewers felt that these changes in pacing would make the genre more accessible to casual players those who play for short periods of time while still having deep gameplay that would attract players of all levels of interest The concept of a rested bonus or increasing the rate at which a player s character gains experience was also welcomed as a way for players to quickly catch up with their friends in progression br Questing was described as an integral part of the game often being used to continue a storyline or lead the player through the game The high number of quests in each location was popular as well as the rewards for completing them It was felt that the range of quests removed the need for a player to grind or carry out repetitive tasks to advance their character Quests also require players to explore every section of the game world potentially causing problems for social gamers or roleplayers seeking somewhere quiet Quests that required the player to collect items from the corpses of creatures they had killed were also unpopular the low drop rate or chance of finding the items makes them feel repetitive as a high number of creatures need to be killed to complete the quest A large number of new players in a particular area meant that there were often no creatures to kill or that players would have to wait and take turns to kill a particular creature to complete a quest Some critics mentioned that the lack of quests that required players to group up made the game feel as if it were designed for solo play Others complained that some dungeon or instanced group quests were not friendly to new players and could take several hours to complete Upon release a small number of quests had software bugs that made them impossible to complete br Characters were felt to be implemented well with each class appearing viable and interesting having unique and different mechanisms and each of the races having a distinct look and feel Character development was also liked with the talent mechanism offering choice to players and profession options being praised Character customization options were felt to be low but the detail of character models was praised br The appearance of the game world was praised by critics Most popular was that a player could run from one end of the continent to the other without having to pause at a loading screen while part of the game is retrieved from storage The environment was described as breathtaking Players found it difficult to become lost and each area in the game world had a distinct look that blended from one to the next Critics described the environment as a careful blend of cartoon fantasy art and realism The game was found to run smoothly on a range of computer systems although some described it as basic and mentioned that the bloom light rendering effect can blur things One reviewer described the ability to fly over long stretches of scenery as very atmospheric The user interface was liked being described as simple with tooltips helping to get the player started br The game s audio was well received particularly the background music By assigning music to different areas of the game world reviewers felt that the fantasy style added to the player s immersion and that the replay value was increased The sounds and voices used by characters and NPCs as well as the overall sound effects were felt to add a personality to the game br br br Accolades br World of Warcraft won several awards from critics upon release including Editor s Choice awards In addition it won several annual awards from the media being described as the best game in the role playing and MMORPG genres The graphics and audio were also praised in the annual awards with the cartoonish style and overall sound makeup being noted The game was also awarded Best Mac OS X Entertainment Product at the Apple Design Awards Computer Games Magazine named World of Warcraft the best computer game of and the magazine s Steve Bauman described his feeling that Blizzard has analyzed every element of every existing game pulled out the best ones and then lovingly lavished an absurd amount of attention to their implementation It also won the magazine s Best Art Direction Best Original Music and Best Interface awards br World of Warcraft was recognized at the Spike TV Video Game Awards where it won Best PC Game Best Multiplayer Game Best RPG and Most Addictive Game During the th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards the Academy of Interactive Arts Sciences awarded World of Warcraft with Massively Multiplayer Persistent World Game of the Year as well as nominations for Computer Game of the Year and Game of the Year In World of Warcraft was honoured along with Neverwinter Nights and EverQuest at the th Annual Technology Engineering Emmy Awards for advancing the art form of MMORPG games GameSpot named it the best massively multiplayer game of and nominated it for the publication s Best Graphics Artistic award In Game Informer ranked World of Warcraft th on their list of The Top Games of All Time In the game placed rd on USgamer s The Best Games Since list In The Strong National Museum of Play inducted World of Warcraft to its World Video Game Hall of Fame br br br Commercial performance br World of Warcraft was the best selling PC game of and In the United States it sold million copies million by August It was the country s third best selling computer game between January and August On January World of Warcraft had more than million subscribers worldwide with more than million subscribers in Europe more than million in North America and about million in Asia At its peak in October the game had million subscribers As of November the game has over million active subscribers On January Blizzard announced that million accounts have been created for the game On May it was announced that there were million active subscriptions At the end of June subscriptions dropped down to million lowest since By the end of September subscribers were at million br Less than two months after beginning operation of World of Warcraft in China on September NetEase was ordered to immediately stop charging players and to cease accepting registrations A press estimate indicated that if World of Warcraft were shut down in China the loss of subscribers would have caused Activision Blizzard s earnings to fall from cents per share to cents per share In April World of Warcraft was estimated to hold percent of the MMORPG subscription market The game has grossed billion in revenue making it one of the highest grossing video games of all time along with Space Invaders Pac Man and Street Fighter II In early Blizzard started its own series of tournaments for World of Warcraft and StarCraft II known as the Battle net World Championship Series br br br Security concerns br In September reports emerged of spoof World of Warcraft game advice websites that contained malware Vulnerable computers would be infected through their web browsers downloading a program that would then relay back account information Blizzard s account support teams experienced high demand during this episode stating that many users had been affected Claims were also made that telephone support was closed for isolated periods due to the volume of calls and resulting queues In April attacks evolved to take advantage of further exploits involving animated cursors with multiple websites being used Security researcher group Symantec released a report stating that a compromised World of Warcraft account was worth US on the black market compared to US to US for a compromised computer correct as of March In February phishing emails were distributed requesting that users validate their account information using a fake version of the World of Warcraft account management pages In June Blizzard announced the Blizzard Authenticator available as a hardware security token or mobile application that provides two factor security The token generates a one time password based code that the player supplies when logging on The password used in addition to the user s own password is only valid for a couple of minutes thus providing extra security against keylogging malware br Blizzard makes use of a system known as Warden on the Windows version of the game to detect third party programs such as botting software allowing World of Warcraft to be played unattended There has been some controversy as to the legality of Warden Warden uses techniques similar to anti virus software to analyze other running software on the players PCs as well as the file system However unlike most anti virus software it sends a portion of this information back to Blizzard which caused privacy advocates to accuse it of being spyware One example of the information Warden collects is the title of every window open on the system while WoW is running On the other hand many gamers responded positively to the development stating that they supported the technology if it resulted in fewer cases of cheating Blizzard s use of Warden was stated in the Terms of Agreement TOA br The Warden s existence was acknowledged in March during the opening legal proceedings against MDY Industries The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Arizona and also listed Michael Donnelly as a defendant Donnelly was included in the suit as the creator of MMO Glider software that can automatically play many tasks in the game Blizzard claimed the software is an infringement of its copyright and software license agreement stating that Glider use severely harms the WoW gaming experience for other players by altering the balance of play disrupting the social and immersive aspects of the game and undermining the in game economy Donnelly claims to have sold copies of the software br br br Real ID br br On July Blizzard Entertainment announced that on its forums for all games users accounts would display the real names tied to their accounts Blizzard announced the change following an agreement with Facebook to allow Facebook to connect persons who choose to become friends to share their real identity Real ID as Blizzard calls the feature The integration of the feature into the forums on the Blizzard Entertainment site raised concerns amongst fans of the many game series Blizzard has created over the years br In response to the concerns Blizzard released an updated statement on July announcing that the Real ID integration with the official forums was being canceled br br br Community and study of player interaction br br In addition to playing the game itself and conversing on discussion forums provided by Blizzard World of Warcraft players often participate in the virtual community in creative ways including fan artwork and comic strip style storytelling br Blizzard garnered criticism for its decision in January to ban guilds from advertising sexual orientation preferences The incident occurred after several players were cited for harassment after advocating a group that was a gay straight alliance Blizzard later reversed the decision to issue warnings to players promoting LGBT friendly guilds br On October World of Warcraft reached a subscriber base of over million players Since May the number of players playing had decreased by from million to million Blizzard s CEO Mike Morhaime said that the reason was probably due to a drop off in the Eastern markets In senior producer John Lagrave told Eurogamer that the drop in subscriptions may have also been attributed to the recent release of BioWare s Star Wars The Old Republic br br br Sale of virtual goods in the real world br br As with other MMORPGs companies have emerged offering to sell virtual gold and associated services The practice of amassing gold and in game items for financial profit is frequently referred to as gold farming br After Blizzard started offering free trial gameplay accounts players noticed an increase in spam from bots advertising these services One study shows that this problem is particularly prevalent on the European realms with gold being over times more expensive to buy on US realms than their European counterparts br In patch Blizzard responded to this by adding additional anti spam mechanics including whisper throttling and the report spam function Additionally trial accounts are prevented from speaking in the public chat channels although they may speak to players within range or whisper to other players that have first whispered to them participating in in game trades and using the Auction House and the mail feature among other limitations br In May Blizzard filed a complaint against in Game Dollar LLC trading as peons hire in U S federal court In February the parties filed a consent decree in which in Game Dollar agreed to refrain from using any World of Warcraft chat or communication to advertise any business or sell any services relating to World of Warcraft In June World of Warcraft player Antonio Hernandez filed a class action lawsuit against IGE for interfering with the intended use of the game br As characters progress in World of Warcraft and take on some of the toughest challenges many of the rewards received are bound to that character and cannot be traded generating a market for the trading of accounts with well equipped characters The highest noted World of Warcraft account trade was for US in early September The high price was due to the character possessing items that at the time were owned by only a handful out of the millions of active players due to the difficulty in acquiring them However Blizzard banned the account five days after the purchase br The practice of buying or selling gold in World of Warcraft has generated significant controversy On February

of the first events to affect entire servers Patch saw the opening of Zul Gurub the game s first player raid dungeon where players faced off against a tribe of trolls Upon engaging the final boss players were stricken by a debuff called Corrupted Blood which would periodically sap their life The disease was passed on to other players simply by being near infected players Originally this malady

completely infected major cities because of their high player concentrations Low level players were killed in seconds by the high damage disease Eventually Blizzard fixed the issue so that the plague could not exist outside of Zul Gurub br The Corrupted Blood plague so closely resembled the outbreak of real world epidemics that scientists are currently looking at the ways MMORPGs or other

researchers to more accurately predict how diseases and outbreaks spread amongst a population br br br Legacy br World of Warcraft redefined the MMORPG genre Its innovations were not necessarily original in isolation but together they created a model for the genre as a theme park rather than a simulation Its environment had tonal variety with serious lore and full characters but the intention to entertain The game used quest completion for experience progression making gameplay into a shopping list and encouraging mobility rather than dominating a location Its use of instanced dungeons let players progress together without running into others such that different areas of the game had different purposes separating places for group challenges mass challenges and leveling World of Warcraft
