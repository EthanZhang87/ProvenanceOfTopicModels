The United States Capitol often called the Capitol or the Capitol Building is the seat of the United States Congress the legislative branch of the federal government It is located on Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington D C Although no longer at the geographic center of the national capital the U S Capitol forms the origin point for the street numbering system of the district as well as its four quadrants Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches the Capitol is built in a neoclassical style and has a white exterior br Central sections of the present building were completed in These were partly destroyed in the Burning of Washington then were fully restored within five years The building was enlarged in the s by extending the wings for the chambers for the bicameral legislature the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing The massive dome was completed around just after the American Civil War br Both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as fronts although only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries while the west front is now used for presidential inauguration ceremonies The building and grounds are overseen by the Architect of the Capitol who also oversees the surrounding Capitol Complex br br br History br br br th century br br Prior to establishing the nation s capital in Washington D C the United States Congress and its predecessors met at Independence Hall and Congress Hall in Philadelphia Federal Hall in New York City and five additional locations York Pennsylvania Lancaster Pennsylvania the Maryland State House in Annapolis Maryland and Nassau Hall in Princeton New Jersey and Trenton New Jersey In September the First Continental Congress brought together delegates from the colonies in Philadelphia followed by the Second Continental Congress which met from May to March br After adopting the Articles of Confederation in York Pennsylvania the Congress of the Confederation was formed and convened in Philadelphia from March until June when a mob of angry soldiers converged upon Independence Hall demanding payment for their service during the American Revolutionary War Congress requested that John Dickinson the Governor of Pennsylvania call up the militia to defend Congress from attacks by the protesters In what became known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of Dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from Philadelphia As a result Congress was forced to flee to Princeton New Jersey on June and met in Annapolis Maryland and Trenton New Jersey before ending up in New York City br The U S Congress was established upon ratification of the U S Constitution and formally began on March New York City remained home to Congress until July when the Residence Act was passed to pave the way for a permanent capital The decision of where to locate the capital was contentious but Alexander Hamilton helped broker a compromise in which the federal government would take on war debt incurred during the American Revolutionary War in exchange for support from northern states for locating the capital along the Potomac River As part of the legislation Philadelphia was chosen as a temporary capital for ten years until December until the nation s capital in Washington D C would be ready br Pierre L Enfant was charged with creating the city plan for the new capital city and the major public buildings The Congress House would be built on Jenkins Hill now known as Capitol Hill which L Enfant described as a pedestal awaiting a monument L Enfant connected Congress House with the President s House via Pennsylvania Avenue with a width set at feet identical to the narrowest points of the Champs lys es in Paris Westwards was a foot wide m garden lined grand avenue containing a public walk later known as the National Mall that would travel for about mile km along the east west line br The term Capitol from Latin Capitolium originally denoted the Capitoline Hill in Rome and the Temple of Jupiter that stood on its summit The Roman Capitol was sometimes misconceived of as a meeting place for senators and this led the term to be applied to legislative buildings the first such building was the Williamsburg Capitol in Virginia Thomas Jefferson had sat here as a member of the House of Burgesses and it was he who applied the name Capitol to what on L Enfant s plan had been called the Congress House Capitol has since become a general term for government buildings especially in the United States It is often confused with capital one however denotes a building or complex of buildings while the other denotes a city br In early after Pierre L Enfant was dismissed from the federal city project Jefferson proposed a design competition to solicit designs for the Capitol and the President s House and set a four month deadline The prize for the competition was and a lot in the Federal City At least ten individuals submitted designs for the Capitol however the drawings were regarded as crude and amateurish reflecting the level of architectural skill present in the United States at the time br The most promising of the submissions was by Stephen Hallet a trained French architect who was a draftsman to Pierre L Enfant on the city plan However Hallet s designs were overly fancy with too much French influence and were deemed too costly br However the design did incorporate the concept for a great circular room and dome which had originated with L Enfant John Trumbull was given a tour of Jenkins Hill by L Enfant himself and confirmed this in his autobiography years later br br On January a late entry by amateur architect William Thornton was submitted and was met with praise for its Grandeur Simplicity and Beauty by Washington along with praise from Jefferson Thornton was inspired by the east front of the Louvre as well as the Paris Pantheon for the center portion of the design Thornton s design was officially approved in a letter dated April from Washington and Thornton served as the first Architect of the Capitol and later first Superintendent of the U S Patent and Trademark Office In an effort to console Hallet the commissioners appointed him to review Thornton s plans develop cost estimates and serve as superintendent of construction Hallet proceeded to pick apart and make drastic changes to Thornton s design which he saw as costly to build and problematic br In July Jefferson convened a five member commission bringing Hallet and Thornton together along with James Hoban winning architect of the President s Palace to address problems with and revise Thornton s plan Hallet suggested changes to the floor plan which could be fitted within the exterior design by Thornton The revised plan was accepted except that Secretary Jefferson and President Washington insisted on an open recess in the center of the East front which was part of Thornton s original plan br The original design by Thornton was later modified by the British American architects Benjamin Henry Latrobe Sr and then Charles Bulfinch The current cast iron dome and the House s new southern extension and Senate new northern wing were designed by Thomas Ustick Walter and August Schoenborn a German immigrant in the s and were completed under the supervision of Edward Clark br L Enfant secured the lease of quarries at Wigginton Island and along Aquia Creek in Virginia for use in the foundations and outer walls of the Capitol in November Surveying was under way soon after the Jefferson conference plan for the Capitol was accepted On September President Washington along with eight other Freemasons dressed in masonic regalia laid the cornerstone which was made by silversmith Caleb Bentley br Construction proceeded with Hallet working under supervision of James Hoban who was also busy working on construction of the President s House also later known as the Executive Mansion Despite the wishes of Jefferson and the President Hallet went ahead anyway and modified Thornton s design for the East Front and created a square central court that projected from the center with flanking wings which would house the legislative bodies Hallet was dismissed by Secretary Jefferson on November George Hadfield was hired on October as Superintendent of Construction but resigned three years later in May because of his dissatisfaction with Thornton s plan and quality of work done thus far br br br th century br br The Senate north wing was completed in The Senate and House shared quarters in the north wing until a temporary wooden pavilion was erected on the future site of the House wing which served for a few years for the Representatives to meet in until the House of Representatives south wing was finally completed in with a covered wooden temporary walkway connecting the two wings with the Congressional chambers where the future center section with rotunda and dome would eventually be However the House of Representatives moved early into their House wing in Though the Senate wing building was incomplete the Capitol held its first session of the U S Congress with both chambers in session on November The National Legislature was moved to Washington prematurely at the urging of President John Adams in hopes of securing enough Southern votes in the Electoral College to be re elected for a second term as president br For several decades beginning when the federal government moved to Washington in the fall of the Capitol building was used for Sunday religious services as well as for governmental functions The first services were conducted in the hall of the House in the north wing of the building In the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing called the Oven which it vacated in returning to the north wing for three years Then from to they were held in the then House Chamber now called Statuary Hall When held in the House chamber the Speaker s podium was used as the preacher s pulpit According to the U S Library of Congress exhibit Religion and the Founding of the American Republic br br It is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of Thomas Jefferson and of James Madison the state became the church Within a year of his inauguration Jefferson began attending church services in the chamber of the House of Representatives Madison followed Jefferson s example although unlike Jefferson who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol Madison came in a coach and four Worship services in the House a practice that continued until after the Civil War were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared Catholic priests began officiating in As early as January a female evangelist Dorothy Ripley delivered a camp meeting style exhortation in the House to Jefferson Vice President Aaron Burr and a crowded audience br Not long after the completion of both wings the Capitol was partially burned by the British on August during the War of br George Bomford and Joseph Gardner Swift both military engineers were called upon to help rebuild the Capitol Reconstruction began in and included redesigned chambers for both Senate and House wings now sides which were completed by During the reconstruction Congress met in the Old Brick Capitol a temporary structure financed by local investors Construction continued through to with the addition of the center section with front steps and columned portico and an interior Rotunda rising above the first low dome of the Capitol Latrobe is principally connected with the original construction and many innovative interior features his successor Bulfinch also played a major role such as design of the first low dome covered in copper br By it became clear that the Capitol could not accommodate the growing number of legislators arriving from newly admitted states A new design competition was held and President Millard Fillmore appointed Philadelphia architect Thomas U Walter to carry out the expansion Two new wings were added a new chamber for the House of Representatives on the south side and a new chamber for the Senate on the north br When the Capitol was expanded in the s some of the construction labor was carried out by slaves who cut the logs laid the stones and baked the bricks The original plan was to use workers brought in from Europe However there was a poor response to recruitment efforts African Americans some free and some enslaved along with Scottish stonemasons comprised most of the workforce br br br Capitol dome br br The expansion more than doubled the length of the United States Capitol it dwarfed the original timber framed copper sheeted low dome of designed by Charles Bulfinch which was no longer in proportion with the increased size of the building In the decision was made to tear it down and replace it with the wedding cake style cast iron dome that stands today Also designed by Thomas U Walter the new dome would stand three times the height of the original dome and feet m in diameter yet had to be supported on the existing masonry piers br Like Mansart s dome at Les Invalides in Paris which he had visited in Walter s dome is double with a large oculus in the inner dome through which is seen The Apotheosis of Washington painted on a shell suspended from the supporting ribs which also support the visible exterior structure and the tholos that supports the Statue of Freedom a colossal statue that was raised to the top of the dome in The statue invokes the goddesses Minerva or Athena The cast iron for the dome weighs pounds kg The dome s cast iron frame was supplied and constructed by the iron foundry Janes Fowler Kirtland Co The thirty six Corinthian columns that surround the base of the dome were provided by the Baltimore ironworks of Poole Hunt br br br expansion br br When the Capitol s new dome was finally completed its massive visual weight in turn overpowered the proportions of the columns of the East Portico built in br br br th century br In the East Front of the Capitol building was rebuilt following a design of the architects Carr re and Hastings who designed the Russell Senate and Cannon House office buildings earlier that year br In the next major expansion to the Capitol started with a foot m extension of the East Portico In two years into the project the dome underwent a restoration A marble duplicate of the sandstone East Front was built feet m from the old Front In a connecting extension repurposed what had been an outside wall as an inside wall In the process the original sandstone Corinthian columns were removed and replaced with marble It was not until that landscape designer Russell Page created a suitable setting for them in a large meadow at the U S National Arboretum in northeast Washington as the National Capitol Columns where they were combined with a reflecting pool into an ensemble that reminds some visitors of the ruins of Persepolis in Persia br Besides the columns two hundred tons of the original stone were removed in several hundred block which were first stored on site at the Capitol and then stored in an unused yard at the Capitol Power Plant until The same year the power plant was renovated and expanded in accordance with legislation passed in and the stones fell to the Commission on the Extension of the United States Capitol As this body was long defunct responsibility for the material passed to the House and Senate office building commissions These commissions then arranged for the National Park Service to store the debris at the back of a NPS maintenance yard in Rock Creek Park br With the permission of the Speaker of the House the United States Capitol Historical Society has periodically mined the blocks for sandstone since The stone removed is used to make commemorative bookends which are still sold to support the Capitol Historical Society By more than nearly adjusted had been raised through such sales Unpursued uses for the stones proposed by the Capitol Historical Society have included their sale as cornerstones in new housing developments br On December the Capitol was declared a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service The building was ranked in a survey conducted for the American Institute of Architects America s Favorite Architecture list br The Capitol draws heavily from other notable buildings especially churches and landmarks in Europe including the dome of St Peter s Basilica in the Vatican and St Paul s Cathedral in London On the roofs of the Senate and House Chambers are flagpoles that fly the U S flag when either is in session On September to commemorate the Capitol s bicentennial the Masonic ritual cornerstone laying with George Washington was reenacted U S Senator Strom Thurmond was one of the Freemason politicians who took part in the ceremony br br br st century br br On June ground was broken for the Capitol Visitor Center which opened on December From through the East Front of the Capitol site of most presidential inaugurations until Ronald Reagan began a new tradition in was the site of construction for this massive underground complex designed to facilitate a more orderly entrance for visitors to the Capitol Prior to the center being built visitors to the Capitol had to line up in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building or the Russell Senate Office Building The new underground facility provides a grand entrance hall a visitors theater room for exhibits and dining and restroom facilities in addition to space for building necessities such as a service tunnel br A large scale Capitol dome restoration project the first extensive such work since began in with completion scheduled before the presidential inauguration As of million in work around the skirt of the dome had been completed but other deterioration including at least cracks in the brittle iron that have led to rusting and seepage inside needed to be addressed Before the August recess the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to spend million to repair the exterior of the dome The House wanted to spend less on government operations but in late it was announced that renovations would take place over two years starting in spring br In extensive scaffolding was erected enclosing and obscuring the dome All exterior scaffolding was removed by mid September br With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet a bid tendering process was approved in for a contract to install the multidirectional radio communication network for Wi Fi and mobile phone within the Capitol Building and annexes followed by the new Capitol Visitor Center The winning bidder was an Israeli company called Foxcom which has since changed its name and been acquired by Corning Incorporated br br br Interior br br The Capitol building is marked by its central dome above a rotunda in the central section of the structure which also includes the older original smaller center flanked by the two original designed occupied smaller two wings inner north and inner south containing the two original smaller meeting chambers for the Senate and the House of Representatives between and late s and then flanked by two further extended newer wings one also for each chamber of the larger more populous Congress the new north wing is the Senate chamber and the new south wing is the House of Representatives chamber Above these newer chambers are galleries where visitors can watch the Senate and House of Representatives It is an example of neoclassical architecture br Tunnels and internal subways connect the Capitol building with the Congressional office buildings in the Capitol Complex All rooms in the Capitol are designated as either S for Senate or H for House depending on whether they are in the Senate or House wing of the Capitol br br br Art br br Since the Capitol has featured some the most prominent art in the United States including Italian and Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi whose murals are located in the hallways of the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol The murals known as the Brumidi Corridors reflect great moments and people in United States history Among the original works are those depicting Benjamin Franklin John Fitch Robert Fulton and events such as the Cession of Louisiana Also decorating the walls are animals insects and natural flora indigenous to the United States Brumidi s design left many spaces open so future events in United States history could be added Among those added are the Spirit of St Louis the Moon landing and the Space Shuttle Challenger crew br Brumidi also worked within the Rotunda He painted The Apotheosis of Washington beneath the top of the dome and also the Frieze of American History The Apotheosis of Washington was completed in months and painted by Brumidi while suspended nearly feet m in the air It is said to be the first attempt by the United States to deify a founding father Washington is depicted surrounded by maidens in an inner ring with many Greek and Roman gods and goddesses below him in a second ring The frieze is located around the inside of the base of the dome and is a chronological pictorial history of the United States from the landing of Christopher Columbus to the Wright Brothers s flight in Kitty Hawk North Carolina The frieze was started in and was not completed until The frieze was therefore painted by four different artists Brumidi Filippo Costaggini Charles Ayer Whipple and Allyn Cox The final scenes depicted in the fresco had not yet occurred when Brumidi began his Frieze of the United States History br Within the Rotunda there are eight large paintings about the development of the United States as a nation On the east side are four paintings depicting major events in the discovery of America On the west are four paintings depicting the founding of the United States The east side paintings include The Baptism of Pocahontas by John Gadsby Chapman The Embarkation of the Pilgrims by Robert Walter Weir The Discovery of the Mississippi by William Henry Powell and The Landing of Columbus by John Vanderlyn The paintings on the west side are by John Trumbull Declaration of Independence Surrender of General Burgoyne Surrender of Lord Cornwallis and General George Washington Resigning His Commission Trumbull was a contemporary of the United States founding fathers and a participant in the American Revolutionary War he painted a self portrait into Surrender of Lord Cornwallis br First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln an painting by Francis Bicknell Carpenter hangs over the west staircase in the Senate wing br The Capitol also houses the National Statuary Hall Collection comprising two statues donated by each of the fifty states to honor persons notable in their histories One of the most notable statues in the National Statuary Hall is a bronze statue of King Kamehameha donated by the state of Hawaii upon its accession to the union in The statue s extraordinary weight of pounds kg raised concerns that it might come crashing through the floor so it was moved to Emancipation Hall of the new Capitol Visitor Center The th and last statue for the collection that of Po pay from the state of New Mexico was added on September It was the first statue moved into the Emancipation Hall br br br Crypt br br On the ground floor is an area known as the Crypt It was intended to be the burial place of George Washington with a ringed balustrade at the center of the Rotunda above looking down to his tomb However under the stipulations of his last will Washington was buried at Mount Vernon The Crypt houses exhibits on the history of the Capitol A compass star inlaid in the floor marks the point at which Washington D C is divided into its four quadrants and is the basis for how addresses in Washington D C are designated NE NW SE or SW br Gutzon Borglum s massive Abraham Lincoln Bust is housed in the crypt The sculptor had a fascination with large scale art and themes of heroic nationalism and carved the piece from a six ton block of marble Borglum carved the bust in it was donated to the Congress by Eugene Meyer Jr and accepted by the Joint Committee on the Library the same year The pedestal was specially designed by the sculptor and installed in The bust and pedestal were on display in the Rotunda until when after a rearrangement of all the sculptures in the Rotunda they were placed in the Crypt Borglum was a patriot and believed the monuments we have built are not our own he looked to create art that was American drawn from American sources memorializing American achievement according to a interview article Borglum s depiction of Lincoln was so accurate that Robert Todd Lincoln the president s son praised the bust as the most extraordinarily good portrait of my father I have ever seen Supposedly according to legend the marble head remains unfinished missing the left ear to symbolize Lincoln s unfinished life br br br Features br A statue of John C Calhoun is located at one end of the room near the Old Supreme Court Chamber On the right leg of the statue a mark from a bullet fired during the shooting incident is clearly visible The bullet also left a mark on the cape located on the back right side of the statue br Twelve presidents have lain in state in the Rotunda for public viewing most recently George H W Bush The tomb meant for Washington stored the catafalque which is used to support coffins lying in state or honor in the Capitol The catafalque now on display in the Exhibition Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center was used for President Lincoln br The Hall of Columns is located on the House side of the Capitol home to twenty eight fluted columns and statues from the National Statuary Hall Collection In the basement of the Capitol building in a utility room are two marble bathtubs which are all that remain of the once elaborate Senate baths These baths were a spa like facility designed for members of Congress and their guests before many buildings in the city had modern plumbing The facilities included several bathtubs a barbershop and a massage parlor br A steep metal staircase totaling steps leads from the basement to an outdoor walkway on top of the Capitol s dome The number of steps represents each day of the year Also in the basement the weekly Jummah prayer is held on Fridays by Muslim staffers br br br Height br br Contrary to a popular myth building height laws have never referred to the height of the Capitol building which rises to feet m Indeed the Capitol is only the fourth tallest structure in Washington br br br House Chamber br The House of Representatives Chamber has permanent seats Unlike senators representatives do not have assigned seats The chamber is large enough to accommodate members of all three branches of the federal government and invited guests for joint sessions of Congress such as the State of the Union speech and other events br The Chamber is adorned with relief portraits of famous lawmakers and lawgivers throughout Western and Near Eastern history The United States national motto In God We Trust is written over the tribune below the clock and above the United States flag Of the twenty three relief portraits only Moses is sculpted from a full front view and is located across from the dais where the Speaker of the House ceremonially sits br In order clockwise around the chamber br br There is a quote by statesman Daniel Webster etched in the marble of the chamber as stated Let us develop the resources of our land call forth its powers build up its institutions promote all its great interests and see whether we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered br br br Senate Chamber br br The current Senate Chamber opened in and is adorned with white marble

across the street br br br Floor plans br br br Exterior br br br Landscaping br br The Capitol Grounds cover approximately acres km with the grounds proper consisting mostly of lawns walkways streets drives and planting areas Several monumental sculptures used to be located on the east facade and lawn of the Capitol including The Rescue and George Washington The current grounds were designed by noted American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted who planned the expansion and landscaping performed from to In as one of his first recommendations Olmsted proposed the construction of the marble terraces on the north west and south sides of the building creating an enveloping base This addressed issues with the placement of the original structure it had been built too far westwards on the crest of the hill and gave the appearance as if the building might slide into the marshy terrain below br Olmsted also designed the Summerhouse the open air brick building that sits just north of the Capitol Three arches open into the hexagonal structure which encloses a fountain and twenty two brick chairs A fourth wall holds a small window which looks onto an artificial grotto Built between and the Summerhouse was intended to answer complaints that visitors to the Capitol had no place to sit and no place to obtain water for their horses and themselves Modern drinking fountains have since replaced Olmsted s fountain for the latter purpose Olmsted intended to build a second matching Summerhouse on the southern side of the Capitol but congressional objections led to the project s cancellation br br br Flag br Up to four U S flags can be seen flying over the Capitol Two flagpoles are located at the base of the dome on the East and West sides These flagpoles have flown the flag day and night since World War I The other two flagpoles are above the North Senate and South House of Representatives wings of the building and fly only when the chamber below is in session The flag above the House of Representatives is raised and lowered by House pages The flag above the United States Senate is raised and lowered by Senate Doorkeepers To raise the flag Doorkeepers access the roof of the Capitol from the Senate Sergeant at Arms s office Several auxiliary flagpoles to the west of the dome and not visible from the ground are used to meet congressional requests for flags flown over the Capitol Constituents pay for U S flags flown over the Capitol to commemorate a variety of events such as the death of a veteran family member br br br Major events br br The Capitol and the grounds of Capitol Hill have played host to major events including presidential inaugurations which are held every four years During an inauguration the front of the Capitol is outfitted with a platform and a grand staircase Annual events at the Capitol include Independence Day celebrations and the National Memorial Day Concert br The general public has paid respect to a number of individuals lying in state at the Capitol including numerous former presidents senators and other officials Other Americans lying in honor include Officers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson the two officers killed in the shooting incident Chestnut was the first African American ever to lie in honor in the Capitol The public also paid respect to Rosa Parks an icon of the civil rights movement at

Flight one of the four planes that were hijacked in the September attacks The plane crashed near Shanksville Pennsylvania after passengers tried to regain control of the plane from the hijackers br Since the September attacks the roads and grounds around the Capitol have undergone dramatic changes The United States Capitol Police have also installed checkpoints to inspect vehicles at specific locations around Capitol Hill and have closed a section of one street indefinitely The level of screening employed varies On the main east west thoroughfares of Constitution and Independence Avenues barricades are implanted in the roads that can be raised in the event of an emergency Trucks larger than pickups are interdicted by the Capitol Police and are instructed to use other routes On the checkpoints at the shorter cross streets the barriers are typically kept in a permanent emergency position and only vehicles with special permits are allowed to pass All Capitol visitors are screened by a magnetometer and all items that visitors may bring inside the building are screened by an x ray device In both chambers gas masks are located underneath the chairs in each chamber for members to use in case of emergency Structures ranging from scores of Jersey barriers to hundreds of ornamental bollards have been erected to obstruct the path of any vehicles that might stray from the designated roadways br After the January United States Capitol attack security increased again Additional security fences were installed around the perimeter and National Guard troops were deployed to bolster security br br br List of security incidents br br On January what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol As President Andrew Jackson was leaving the Capitol out of the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R Davis Richard Lawrence an unemployed and deranged housepainter from England either burst from a crowd or stepped out from hiding behind a column and aimed a pistol at Jackson which misfired Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol which also misfired It has since been postulated that the moisture from the humid weather of the day contributed to the double misfiring Lawrence was then restrained with legend saying that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane prompting his aides to restrain him Others present including Davy Crockett restrained and disarmed Lawrence br On April then House Speaker John White was involved in a physical confrontation on the House floor with Democratic Congressman George O Rathbun of New York White was delivering a speech in defense of Senator Henry Clay the Whig nominee for president in that year s presidential
