Eclipse is an integrated development environment IDE used in computer programming It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug in system for customizing the environment It is the second most popular IDE for Java development and until was the most popular Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications but it may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages via plug ins including Ada ABAP C C C Clojure COBOL D Erlang Fortran Groovy Haskell HLASM JavaScript Julia Lasso Lua NATURAL Perl PHP PL I Prolog Python R Rexx Ruby including Ruby on Rails framework Rust Scala and Scheme It can also be used to develop documents with LaTeX via a TeXlipse plug in and packages for the software Mathematica Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools JDT for Java and Scala Eclipse CDT for C C and Eclipse PDT for PHP among others br The initial codebase originated from IBM VisualAge The Eclipse software development kit SDK which includes the Java development tools is meant for Java developers Users can extend its abilities by installing plug ins written for the Eclipse Platform such as development toolkits for other programming languages and can write and contribute their own plug ins Since Eclipse released in plug ins are installed and managed as bundles using Equinox an implementation of OSGi br The Eclipse SDK is free and open source software released under the terms of the Eclipse Public License although it is incompatible with the GNU General Public License It was one of the first IDEs to run under GNU Classpath and it runs without problems under IcedTea br br br History br Eclipse was inspired by the Smalltalk based VisualAge family of integrated development environment IDE products Although fairly successful a major drawback of the VisualAge products was that developed code was not in a component based software engineering model Instead all code for a project was held in a compressed database using SCID techniques somewhat like a zip file but in dat Individual classes could not be easily accessed certainly not outside the tool A team primarily at the IBM Cary NC lab developed the new product as a Java based replacement br In November a consortium was formed with a board of stewards to further the development of Eclipse as open source software It is estimated that IBM had already invested nearly million by that time The original members were Borland IBM Merant QNX Software Systems Rational Software Red Hat SuSE TogetherSoft and WebGain The number of stewards increased to over by the end of In January the Eclipse Foundation was created br Eclipse released on June selected the OSGi Service Platform specifications as the runtime architecture br The Association for Computing Machinery recognized Eclipse with the ACM Software System Award on April br br br Licensing br The Eclipse Public License EPL is the fundamental license under which Eclipse projects are released Some projects require dual licensing for which the Eclipse Distribution License EDL is available although use of this license must be applied for and is considered on a case by case basis br Eclipse was originally released under the Common Public License but was later re licensed under the Eclipse Public License The Free Software Foundation has said that both licenses are free software licenses but are incompatible with the GNU General Public License GPL br br br Name br According to Lee Nackman Chief Technology Officer of IBM s Rational division originating in at that time the name Eclipse dating from at least was not a wordplay on Sun Microsystems as the product s primary competition at the time of naming was Microsoft Visual Studio which Eclipse was to eclipse br Different versions of Eclipse have been given different science related names The versions named after Callisto Europa and Ganymede which are moons of Jupiter were followed by a version named after Galileo the discoverer of those moons These were followed by two sun themed names Helios of Greek mythology and Indigo one of the seven colors of a rainbow which is produced by the sun The version after that Juno has a triple meaning a Roman mythological figure an asteroid and a spacecraft to Jupiter Kepler Luna and Mars continued the astronomy theme and then Neon and Oxygen constituted a theme of chemical elements Photon represented a return to sun themed names br As of the alphabetic scheme was abandoned in order to better align with the new Simultaneous Release strategy Releases are named in the format YYYY MM to reflect the quarterly releases starting with version named br br br Releases br Since the Foundation has coordinated an annual Simultaneous Release Each release includes the Eclipse Platform and several other Eclipse projects br From through each Simultaneous Release had occurred on the th Wednesday of June In the project switched to quarterly week YYYY MM releases without intermediate service releases br br br Architecture br Eclipse uses plug ins to provide all the functionality within and on top of the run time system Its run time system is based on Equinox an implementation of the OSGi core framework specification br In addition to allowing the Eclipse Platform to be extended using other programming languages such as C and Python the plug in framework allows the Eclipse Platform to work with typesetting languages like LaTeX and networking applications such as telnet and database management systems The plug in architecture supports writing any desired extension to the environment such as for configuration management Java and CVS support is provided in the Eclipse SDK with support for other version control systems provided by third party plug ins br With the exception of a small run time kernel everything in Eclipse is a plug in Thus every plug in developed integrates with Eclipse in the same way as other plug ins in this respect all features are created equal Eclipse provides plug ins for a wide variety of features some of which are from third parties using both free and commercial models Examples of plug ins include for Unified Modeling Language UML for Sequence and other UML diagrams a plug in for DB Explorer and many more br The Eclipse SDK includes the Eclipse Java development tools JDT offering an IDE with a built in Java incremental compiler and a full model of the Java source files This allows for advanced refactoring techniques and code analysis The IDE also makes use of a workspace in this case a set of metadata over a flat filespace allowing external file modifications as long as the corresponding workspace resource is refreshed afterward br Eclipse implements the graphical control elements of the Java toolkit called Standard Widget Toolkit SWT whereas most Java applications use the Java standard Abstract Window Toolkit AWT Swing or JavaFX Eclipse s user interface also uses an intermediate graphical user interface layer called JFace which simplifies the construction of applications based on SWT Eclipse was made to run on Wayland during a Google Summer of Code GSoC Project in br As of language packs being developed by the Babel Project provide translations into over natural languages br br br Rich client platform br Eclipse provides the rich client platform RCP for developing general purpose applications br The following components constitute the rich client platform br br Equinox OSGi a standard bundling framework br Core platform boot Eclipse run plug ins br Standard Widget Toolkit SWT a portable widget toolkit br JFace viewer classes to bring model view controller programming to SWT file buffers text handling text editors br Eclipse Workbench views editors perspectives wizards br Examples of rich client applications based on Eclipse are br br IBM Notes and br Attachmate Novell NetIQ Designer for Identity Manager br Apache Directory Studio br Remote Component Environment br DBeaver a SQL client software br Portfolio Performance br UDig a GIS software br AnyLogic a multimethod simulation modeling tool br br br Server platform br Eclipse supports development for Tomcat GlassFish and many other servers and is often capable of installing the required server for development directly from the IDE It supports remote debugging allowing a user to watch variables and step through the code of an application that is running on the attached server br br br Web Tools Platform br The Eclipse Web Tools Platform WTP project is an extension of the Eclipse platform with tools for developing Web and Java EE applications It includes source and graphical editors for a variety of languages wizards and built in applications to simplify development and tools and APIs to support deploying running and testing apps br br br Modeling platform br The Modeling project contains all the official projects of the Eclipse Foundation focusing on model based development technologies All are compatible with the Eclipse Modeling Framework created by IBM Those projects are separated in several categories Model Transformation Model Development Tools Concrete Syntax Development Abstract Syntax Development Technology and Research and Amalgam br Model Transformation projects uses Eclipse Modeling Framework EMF based models as an input and produce either a model or text as an output Model to model transformation projects includes ATLAS Transformation Language ATL an open source transformation language and toolkit used to transform a given model or to generate a new model from a given EMF model Model to text transformation projects contains Acceleo an implementation of MOFM T a standard model to text language from the Object Management Group OMG The Acceleo code generator can generate any textual language Java PHP Python etc from EMF based models defined with any metamodel Unified Modeling Language UML Systems Modeling Language SysML etc It is open source br Model Development Tools projects are implementations of various modeling standards used in the industry and their toolkits Among those projects can be found implementations of several standards br br Unified Modeling Language UML br Systems modeling language SysML br Object Constraint Language OCL br Business Process Model and Notation BPMN br Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules SBVR br XML Schema XSD br National Electronic Distributors Association NEDA br Model to Model Transformations MMT br The Concrete Syntax Development project contains the Graphical Modeling Framework an Eclipse based framework dedicated to the graphical representation of EMF based models br The Abstract Syntax Development project hosts the Eclipse Modeling Framework core of most of the modeling project of the Eclipse Foundation and the framework available for EMF like Connected Data Objects CDO EMF query or EMF validation br Technology and Research projects are prototypes of Modeling project this project is used to host all the modeling projects of the Eclipse Foundation during their incubation phase br Amalgam provides the packaging and integration between all the available modeling tools for the Eclipse package dedicated to modeling tools br br br Application lifecycle management br Application lifecycle management ALM and task management in Eclipse need an optional component called Mylyn an open source implementation of the task focused interface It provides an API for tools embedding the task focused interface For software developers it helps a developer work efficiently with many different tasks such as bugs problem reports or new features Tasks are integrated into Mylyn For all tasks that have been integrated Mylyn monitors user activity and tries to identify information relevant to the task at hand It uses this task context to focus the Eclipse UI on the related information Mylyn can integrate with repositories such as Bugzilla Trac Redmine Mantis JIRA Unfuddle and GitHub It focuses on improving productivity by reducing searching scrolling and navigation By making task context explicit Mylyn is also meant to facilitate multitasking planning reusing past efforts and sharing expertise br The project name comes from myelin an electrically insulating layer that surrounds neurons axons The original name of this project Mylar replicated a trademark of a boPET film company so the Eclipse Foundation changed the project name br br br Features br Eclipse IDE features include text editor with syntax coloring coding assistance code completion code refactoring code analysis with Quick fix suggestions along with code debugging br Along with native support for OSGi JPMS support has been added as of Java br br br Extensions br Eclipse supports a rich selection of extensions adding support for Python via PyDev Android development via Google s ADT superseded by Android Studio since JavaFX via e fx clipse JavaScript jQuery and many others at the Eclipse Marketplace Valable is a Vala plug in for Eclipse br In addition to the built in Java compiler warnings additional plug ins are available for linting to improve code quality and consistency such as SpotBugs and Sonar br Support for build tools such as Ant Maven Make and CMake includes the capability to replace Eclipse native project file format with Maven pom xml directly br br br Alternative distributions br Several alternative distributions exist in the Eclipse project br br br PHP Development Tools br br The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor PHP Development Tools project provides a framework for the Eclipse platform The project encompasses all development components including code completion develop PHP and facilitate extensibility It leverages the existing Eclipse Web Tools Platform WTP and Dynamic Languages Toolkit DLTK br br br Android Development Tools br Android Development Tools ADT was superseded in by the Eclipse foundation s own plugin called Andmore Development Tools for Android after Google discontinued development of their plug in for the Eclipse IDE that is designed to provide an integrated environment in which to build Android applications ADT Andmore extends the abilities of Eclipse to let developers set up new Android projects create an application UI add packages based on the Android Framework API debug their applications using the Android SDK tools and export signed or unsigned apk files in order to distribute their applications It is freely available to download Google s ADT was the official IDE for Android until but was replaced by Eclipse s Andmore and the official Android Studio As of the project appears to be moribund with no activity since br br br See also br br Comparison of integrated
