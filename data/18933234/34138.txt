Extensible Markup Language XML is a markup language and file format for storing transmitting and reconstructing arbitrary data It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human readable and machine readable The World Wide Web Consortium s XML Specification of and several other related specifications all of them free open standards define XML br The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity generality and usability across the Internet It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages Although the design of XML focuses on documents the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services br Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML based languages while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces APIs to aid the processing of XML data br br br Overview br The main purpose of XML is serialization i e storing transmitting and reconstructing arbitrary data For two disparate systems to exchange information they need to agree upon a file format XML standardizes this process It is therefore analogous to a lingua franca for representing information br As a markup language XML labels categorizes and structurally organizes information XML tags represent the data structure and contain metadata What s within the tags is data encoded in the way the XML standard specifies An additional XML schema XSD defines the necessary metadata for interpreting and validating XML This is also referred to as the canonical schema An XML document that adheres to basic XML rules is well formed one that adheres to its schema is valid br IETF RFC which supersedes the older RFC provides rules for the construction of media types for use in XML message It defines three media types application xml text xml is an alias application xml external parsed entity text xml external parsed entity is an alias and application xml dtd They are used for transmitting raw XML files without exposing their internal semantics RFC further recommends that XML based languages be given media types ending in xml for example image svg xml for SVG br Further guidelines for the use of XML in a networked context appear in RFC also known as IETF BCP a document covering many aspects of designing and deploying an XML based language br br br Applications br XML has come into common use for the interchange of data over the Internet Hundreds of document formats using XML syntax have been developed including RSS Atom Office Open XML OpenDocument SVG COLLADA and XHTML XML also provides the base language for communication protocols such as SOAP and XMPP It is one of the message exchange formats used in the Asynchronous JavaScript and XML AJAX programming technique br Many industry data standards such as Health Level OpenTravel Alliance FpML MISMO and National Information Exchange Model are based on XML and the rich features of the XML schema specification In publishing Darwin Information Typing Architecture is an XML industry data standard XML is used extensively to underpin various publishing formats br One of the applications of XML is in the transfer of Operational meteorology OPMET information based on IWXXM standards br br br Key terminology br The material in this section is based on the XML Specification This is not an exhaustive list of all the constructs that appear in XML it provides an introduction to the key constructs most often encountered in day to day use br br Character br An XML document is a string of characters Every legal Unicode character except Null may appear in an XML document while some are discouraged br Processor and application br The processor analyzes the markup and passes structured information to an application The specification places requirements on what an XML processor must do and not do but the application is outside its scope The processor as the specification calls it is often referred to colloquially as an XML parser br Markup and content br The characters making up an XML document are divided into markup and content which may be distinguished by the application of simple syntactic rules Generally strings that constitute markup either begin with the character and end with a or they begin with the character and end with a Strings of characters that are not markup are content However in a CDATA section the delimiters CDATA and are classified as markup while the text between them is classified as content In addition whitespace before and after the outermost element is classified as markup br Tag br A tag is a markup construct that begins with and ends with There are three types of tag br start tag such as section br end tag such as section br empty element tag such as line break br Element br An element is a logical document component that either begins with a start tag and ends with a matching end tag or consists only of an empty element tag The characters between the start tag and end tag if any are the element s content and may contain markup including other elements which are called child elements An example is greeting Hello world greeting Another is line break br Attribute br An attribute is a markup construct consisting of a name value pair that exists within a start tag or empty element tag An example is img src madonna jpg alt Madonna where the names of the attributes are src and alt and their values are madonna jpg and Madonna respectively Another example is step number Connect A to B step where the name of the attribute is number and its value is An XML attribute can only have a single value and each attribute can appear at most once on each element In the common situation where a list of multiple values is desired this must be done by encoding the list into a well formed XML attribute with some format beyond what XML defines itself Usually this is either a comma or semi colon delimited list or if the individual values are known not to contain spaces a space delimited list can be used div class inner greeting box Welcome div where the attribute class has both the value inner greeting box and also indicates the two CSS class names inner and greeting box br XML declaration br XML documents may begin with an XML declaration that describes some information about themselves An example is xml version encoding UTF br br br Characters and escaping br XML documents consist entirely of characters from the Unicode repertoire Except for a small number of specifically excluded control characters any character defined by Unicode may appear within the content of an XML document br XML includes facilities for identifying the encoding of the Unicode characters that make up the document and for expressing characters that for one reason or another cannot be used directly br br br Valid characters br br Unicode code points in the following ranges are valid in XML documents br br U Horizontal Tab U A Line Feed U D Carriage Return these are the only C controls accepted in XML br U U D FF U E U FFFD this excludes some noncharacters in the BMP all surrogates U FFFE and U FFFF are forbidden br U U FFFF this includes all code points in supplementary planes including noncharacters br XML extends the set of allowed characters to include all the above plus the remaining characters in the range U U F At the same time however it restricts the use of C and C control characters other than U Horizontal Tab U A Line Feed U D Carriage Return and U Next Line by requiring them to be written in escaped form for example U must be written as x or its equivalent In the case of C characters this restriction is a backwards incompatibility it was introduced to allow common encoding errors to be detected br The code point U Null is the only character that is not permitted in any XML document br br br Encoding detection br The Unicode character set can be encoded into bytes for storage or transmission in a variety of different ways called encodings Unicode itself defines encodings that cover the entire repertoire well known ones include UTF which the XML standard recommends using without a BOM and UTF There are many other text encodings that predate Unicode such as ASCII and various ISO IEC their character repertoires are in every case subsets of the Unicode character set br XML allows the use of any of the Unicode defined encodings and any other encodings whose characters also appear in Unicode XML also provides a mechanism whereby an XML processor can reliably without any prior knowledge determine which encoding is being used Encodings other than UTF and UTF are not necessarily recognized by every XML parser and in some cases not even UTF even though the standard mandates it to also be recognized br br br Escaping br XML provides escape facilities for including characters that are problematic to include directly For example br br The characters and are key syntax markers and may never appear in content outside a CDATA section It is allowed but not recommended to use in XML entity values br Some character encodings support only a subset of Unicode For example it is legal to encode an XML document in ASCII but ASCII lacks code points for Unicode characters such as br It might not be possible to type the character on the author s machine br Some characters have glyphs that cannot be visually distinguished from other characters such as the nonbreaking space xa and the space x and the Cyrillic capital letter A x and the Latin capital letter A x A br There are five predefined entities br br lt represents br gt represents br amp represents br apos represents br quot represents br All permitted Unicode characters may be represented with a numeric character reference Consider the Chinese character whose numeric code in Unicode is hexadecimal E D or decimal A user whose keyboard offers no method for entering this character could still insert it in an XML document encoded either as or x e d Similarly the string I J rg could be encoded for inclusion in an XML document as I lt J xF rg br is not permitted because the null character is one of the control characters excluded from XML even when using a numeric character reference An alternative encoding mechanism such as Base is needed to represent such characters br br br Comments br Comments may appear anywhere in a document outside other markup Comments cannot appear before the XML declaration Comments begin with and end with For compatibility with SGML the string double hyphen is not allowed inside comments this means comments cannot be nested The ampersand has no special significance within comments so entity and character references are not recognized as such and there is no way to represent characters outside the character set of the document encoding br An example of a valid comment br no need to escape code such in comments br br br International use br br XML Fifth Edition and XML support the direct use of almost any Unicode character in element names attributes comments character data and processing instructions other than the ones that have special symbolic meaning in XML itself such as the less than sign The following is a well formed XML document including Chinese Armenian and Cyrillic characters br br br Syntactical correctness and error handling br br The XML specification defines an XML document as a well formed text meaning that it satisfies a list of syntax rules provided in the specification Some key points in the fairly lengthy list include br br The document contains only properly encoded legal Unicode characters br None of the special syntax characters such as and appear except when performing their markup delineation roles br The start tag end tag and empty element tag that delimit elements are correctly nested with none missing and none overlapping br Tag names are case sensitive the start tag and end tag must match exactly br Tag names cannot contain any of the characters nor a space character and cannot begin with or a numeric digit br A single root element contains all the other elements br The definition of an XML document excludes texts that contain violations of well formedness rules they are simply not XML An XML processor that encounters such a violation is required to report such errors and to cease normal processing This policy occasionally referred to as draconian error handling stands in notable contrast to the behavior of programs that process HTML which are designed to produce a reasonable result even in the presence of severe markup errors XML s policy in this area has been criticized as a violation of Postel s law Be conservative in what you send be liberal in what you accept br The XML specification defines a valid XML document as a well formed XML document which also conforms to the rules of a Document Type Definition DTD br br br Schemas and validation br In addition to being well formed an XML document may be valid This means that it contains a reference to a Document Type Definition DTD and that its elements and attributes are declared in that DTD and follow the grammatical rules for them that the DTD specifies br XML processors are classified as validating or non validating depending on whether or not they check XML documents for validity A processor that discovers a validity error must be able to report it but may continue normal processing br A DTD is an example of a schema or grammar Since the initial publication of XML there has been substantial work in the area of schema languages for XML Such schema languages typically constrain the set of elements that may be used in a document which attributes may be applied to them the order in which they may appear and the allowable parent child relationships br br br Document type definition br br The oldest schema language for XML is the document type definition DTD inherited from SGML br DTDs have the following benefits br br DTD support is ubiquitous due to its inclusion in the XML standard br DTDs are terse compared to element based schema languages and consequently present more information in a single screen br DTDs allow the declaration of standard public entity sets for publishing characters br DTDs define a document type rather than the types used by a namespace thus grouping all constraints for a document in a single collection br DTDs have the following limitations br br They have no explicit support for newer features of XML most importantly namespaces br They lack expressiveness XML DTDs are simpler than SGML DTDs and there are certain structures that cannot be expressed with regular grammars DTDs only support rudimentary datatypes br They lack readability DTD designers typically make heavy use of parameter entities which behave essentially as textual macros which make it easier to define complex grammars but at the expense of clarity br They use a syntax based on regular expression syntax inherited from SGML to describe the schema Typical XML APIs such as SAX do not attempt to offer applications a structured representation of the syntax so it is less accessible to programmers than an element based syntax may be br Two peculiar features that distinguish DTDs from other schema types are the syntactic support for embedding a DTD within XML documents and for defining entities which are arbitrary fragments of text or markup that the XML processor inserts in the DTD itself and in the XML document wherever they are referenced like character escapes br DTD technology is still used in many applications because of its ubiquity br br br Schema br br A newer schema language described by the W C as the successor of DTDs is XML Schema often referred to by the initialism for XML Schema instances XSD XML Schema Definition XSDs are far more powerful than DTDs in describing XML languages They use a rich datatyping system and allow for more detailed constraints on an XML document s logical structure XSDs also use an XML based format which makes it possible to use ordinary XML tools to help process them br xs schema element that defines a schema br br br RELAX NG br br RELAX NG Regular Language for XML Next Generation was initially specified by OASIS and is now a standard Part Regular grammar based validation of ISO IEC DSDL RELAX NG schemas may be written in either an XML based syntax or a more compact non XML syntax the two syntaxes are isomorphic and James Clark s conversion tool Trang can convert between them without loss of information RELAX NG has a simpler definition and validation framework than XML Schema making it easier to use and implement It also has the ability to use datatype framework plug ins a RELAX NG schema author for example can require values in an XML document to conform to definitions in XML Schema Datatypes br br br Schematron br Schematron is a language for making assertions about the presence or absence of patterns in an XML document It typically uses XPath expressions Schematron is now a standard Part Rule based validation of ISO IEC DSDL br br br DSDL and other schema languages br DSDL Document Schema Definition Languages is a multi part ISO IEC standard ISO IEC that brings together a comprehensive set of small schema languages each targeted at specific problems DSDL includes RELAX NG full and compact syntax Schematron assertion language and languages for defining datatypes character repertoire constraints renaming and entity expansion and namespace based routing of document fragments to different validators DSDL schema languages do not have the vendor support of XML Schemas yet and are to some extent a grassroots reaction of industrial publishers to the lack of utility of XML Schemas for publishing br Some schema languages not only describe the structure of a particular XML format but also offer limited facilities to influence processing of individual XML files that conform to this format DTDs and XSDs both have this ability they can for instance provide the infoset augmentation facility and attribute defaults RELAX NG and Schematron intentionally do not provide these br br br Related specifications br A cluster of specifications closely related to XML have been developed starting soon after the initial publication of XML It is frequently the case that the term XML is used to refer to XML together with one or more of these other technologies that have come to be seen as part of the XML core br br XML namespaces enable the same document to contain XML elements and attributes taken from different vocabularies without any naming collisions occurring Although XML Namespaces are not part of the XML specification itself virtually all XML software also supports XML Namespaces br XML Base defines the xml base attribute which may be used to set the base for resolution of relative URI references within the scope of a single XML element br XML Information Set or XML Infoset is an abstract data model for XML documents in terms of information items The infoset is commonly used in the specifications of XML languages for convenience in describing constraints on the XML constructs those languages allow br XSL Extensible Stylesheet Language is a family of languages used to transform and render XML documents split into three parts br XSLT XSL Transformations an XML language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents or other formats such as HTML plain text or XSL FO XSLT is very tightly coupled with XPath which it uses to address components of the input XML document mainly elements and attributes br XSL FO XSL Formatting Objects an XML language for rendering XML documents often used to generate PDFs br XPath XML Path Language a non XML language for addressing the components elements attributes and so on of an XML document XPath is widely used in other core XML specifications and in programming libraries for accessing XML encoded data br XQuery XML Query is an XML query language strongly rooted in XPath and XML Schema It provides methods to access manipulate and return XML and is mainly conceived as a query language for XML databases br XML Signature defines syntax and processing rules for creating digital signatures on XML content br XML Encryption defines syntax and processing rules for encrypting XML content br XML model Part Schema Association of ISO IEC DSDL defines a means of associating any xml document with any of the schema types mentioned above br Some other specifications conceived as part of the XML Core have failed to find wide adoption including XInclude XLink and XPointer br br br Programming interfaces br The design goals of XML include It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents Despite this the XML specification contains almost no information about how programmers might go about doing such processing The XML Infoset specification provides a vocabulary to refer to the constructs within an XML document but does not provide any guidance on how to access this information A variety of APIs for accessing XML have been developed and used and some have been standardized br Existing APIs for XML processing tend to fall into these categories br br Stream oriented APIs accessible from a programming language for example SAX and StAX br Tree traversal APIs accessible from a programming language for example DOM br XML data binding which provides an automated translation between an XML document and programming language objects br Declarative transformation languages such as XSLT and XQuery br Syntax extensions to general purpose programming languages for example LINQ and Scala br Stream oriented facilities require less memory and for certain tasks based on a linear traversal of an XML document are faster and simpler than other alternatives Tree traversal and data binding APIs typically require the use of much more memory but are often found more convenient for use by programmers some include declarative retrieval of document components via the use of XPath expressions br XSLT is designed for declarative description of XML document transformations and has been widely implemented both in server side packages and Web browsers XQuery overlaps XSLT in its functionality but is designed more for searching of large XML databases br br br Simple API for XML br br Simple API for XML SAX is a lexical event driven API in which a document is read serially and its contents are reported as callbacks to various methods on a handler object of the user s design SAX is fast and efficient to implement but difficult to use for extracting information at random from the XML since it tends to burden the application author with keeping track of what part of the document is being processed It is better suited to situations in which certain types of information are always handled the same way no matter where they occur in the document br br br Pull parsing br Pull parsing treats the document as a series of items read in sequence using the iterator design pattern This allows for writing of recursive descent parsers in which the structure of the code performing the parsing mirrors the structure of the XML being parsed and intermediate parsed results can be used and accessed as local variables within the functions performing the parsing or passed down as function parameters into lower level functions or returned as function return values to higher level functions Examples of pull parsers include Data Edit Xml in Perl StAX in the Java programming language XMLPullParser in Smalltalk XMLReader in PHP ElementTree iterparse in Python SmartXML in Red System Xml XmlReader in the NET Framework and the DOM traversal API NodeIterator and TreeWalker br A pull parser creates an iterator that sequentially visits the various elements attributes and data in an XML document Code that uses this iterator can test the current item to tell for example whether it is a start tag or end tag or text and inspect its attributes local name namespace values of XML attributes value of text etc and can also move the iterator to the next item The code can thus extract information from the document as it traverses it The recursive descent approach tends to lend itself to keeping data as typed local variables in the code doing the parsing while SAX for instance typically requires a parser to manually maintain intermediate data within a stack of elements that are parent elements of the element being parsed Pull parsing code can be more straightforward to understand and maintain than SAX parsing code br br br Document Object Model br br Document Object Model DOM is an API that allows for navigation of the entire document as if it were a tree of node objects representing the document s contents A DOM document can be created by a parser or can be generated manually by users with limitations Data types in DOM nodes are abstract implementations provide their own programming language specific bindings DOM implementations tend to be memory intensive as they generally require the entire document to be loaded into memory and constructed as a tree of objects before access is allowed br br br Data binding br XML data binding is a technique for simplifying development of applications that need to work with XML documents It involves mapping the XML document to a hierarchy of strongly typed objects rather than using the generic objects created by a DOM parser The resulting code is often easier to read and maintain and it can help to identify problems at compile time rather than run time XML data binding is particularly well suited for applications where the document structure is known and fixed at the time the application is written By creating a strongly typed representation of the XML data developers can take advantage of modern integrated development environments IDEs that provide features like auto complete code refactoring and code highlighting This can make it easier to write correct and efficient code and reduce the risk of errors and bugs Example data binding systems include the Java Architecture for XML Binding JAXB XML Serialization in NET Framework and XML serialization in gSOAP br br br XML as data type br XML has appeared as a first class data type in other languages The ECMAScript for XML E X extension to the ECMAScript JavaScript language explicitly defines two specific objects XML and XMLList for JavaScript which support XML document nodes and XML node lists as distinct objects and use a dot notation specifying parent child relationships E X is supported by the Mozilla browsers though now deprecated and Adobe Actionscript but has not been widely adopted Similar notations are used in Microsoft s LINQ implementation for Microsoft NET and above and in Scala which uses the Java VM The open source xmlsh application which provides a Linux like shell with special features for XML manipulation similarly treats XML as a data type using the notation The Resource Description Framework defines a data type rdf XMLLiteral to hold wrapped canonical XML Facebook has produced extensions to the PHP and JavaScript languages that add XML to the core syntax in a similar fashion to E X namely XHP and JSX respectively br br br History br XML is an application profile of SGML ISO br The versatility of SGML for dynamic information display was understood by early digital media publishers in the late s prior to the rise of the Internet By the mid s some practitioners of SGML had gained experience with the then new World Wide Web and believed that SGML offered solutions to some of the problems the Web was likely to face as it grew Dan Connolly added SGML to the list of W C s activities when he joined the staff in work began in mid when Sun Microsystems engineer Jon Bosak developed a charter and recruited collaborators Bosak was well connected in the small community of people who had experience both in SGML and the Web br XML was compiled by a working group of eleven members supported by a roughly member Interest Group Technical debate took place on the Interest Group mailing list and issues were resolved by consensus or when that failed majority vote of the Working Group A record of design decisions and their rationales was compiled by Michael Sperberg McQueen on December James Clark served as Technical Lead of the Working Group notably contributing the empty element empty syntax and the name XML Other names that had been put forward for consideration included MAGMA Minimal Architecture for Generalized Markup Applications SLIM Structured Language for Internet Markup and MGML Minimal Generalized Markup Language The co editors of the specification were originally Tim Bray and Michael Sperberg McQueen Halfway through the project Bray accepted a consulting engagement with Netscape provoking vociferous protests from Microsoft Bray was temporarily asked to resign the editorship This led to intense dispute in the Working Group eventually solved by the appointment of Microsoft s Jean Paoli as a third co editor br The XML Working Group communicated primarily through email and weekly teleconferences The major design decisions were reached in a short burst of intense work between August and November when the first Working Draft of an XML specification was published Further design work continued through and XML became a W C Recommendation on February br br br Sources br XML is a profile of an ISO standard SGML and most of XML comes from SGML unchanged From SGML comes the separation of logical and physical structures elements and entities the availability of grammar based validation DTDs the separation of data and metadata elements and attributes mixed content the separation of processing from representation processing instructions and the default angle bracket syntax The SGML declaration was removed thus XML has a fixed delimiter set and adopts Unicode as the document character set br Other sources of technology for XML were the TEI Text Encoding Initiative which defined a profile of SGML for use as a transfer syntax and HTML The ERCS Extended Reference Concrete Syntax project of the SPREAD Standardization Project Regarding East Asian Documents project of the ISO related China Japan Korea Document Processing expert group was the basis of XML s naming rules SPREAD also introduced hexadecimal numeric character references and the concept of references to make available all Unicode characters To support ERCS XML and HTML better the SGML standard IS was revised in and with WebSGML Adaptations br Ideas that developed during discussion that are novel in XML included the algorithm for encoding detection and the encoding header the processing instruction target the xml space attribute and the new close delimiter for empty element tags The notion of well formedness as opposed to validity which enables parsing without a schema was first formalized in XML although it had been implemented successfully in the Electronic Book Technology Dynatext software the software from the University of Waterloo New Oxford English Dictionary Project the RISP LISP SGML text processor at Uniscope Tokyo the US Army Missile Command IADS hypertext system Mentor Graphics Context Interleaf and Xerox Publishing System br br br Versions br br br and br The first XML was initially defined in It has undergone minor revisions since then without being given a new version number and is currently in its fifth edition as published on November It is widely implemented and still recommended for general use br The second XML was initially published on February the same day as XML Third Edition and is currently in its second edition as published on August It contains features some contentious that are intended to make XML easier to use in certain cases The main changes are to enable the use of line ending characters used on EBCDIC platforms and the use of scripts and characters absent from Unicode XML is not very widely implemented and is recommended for use only by those who need its particular features br Prior to its fifth edition release XML differed from XML in having stricter requirements for characters available for use in element and attribute names and unique identifiers in the first four editions of XML the characters were exclusively enumerated using a specific version of the Unicode standard Unicode to Unicode The fifth edition substitutes the mechanism of XML which is more future proof but reduces redundancy The approach taken in the fifth edition of XML and in all editions of XML is that only certain characters are forbidden in names and everything else is allowed to accommodate suitable name characters in future Unicode versions In the fifth edition XML names may contain characters in the Balinese Cham or Phoenician scripts among many others added to Unicode since Unicode br Almost any Unicode code point can be used in the character data and attribute values of an XML document even if the character corresponding to the code point is not defined in the current version of Unicode In character data and attribute values XML allows the use of more control characters than XML but for robustness most of the control characters introduced in XML must be expressed as numeric character references and x F through x F which had been allowed in XML are in XML even required to be expressed as numeric character references Among the supported control characters in XML are two line break codes that must be treated as whitespace characters which are the only control codes that can be written directly br br br br There has been discussion of an XML although no organization has announced plans for work on such a project XML SW SW for skunkworks which one of the original developers of XML has written contains some proposals for what an XML might look like including elimination of DTDs from syntax as well as integration of XML namespaces XML Base and XML Information Set into the base standard br br br MicroXML br In James Clark technical lead of the XML Working Group and John Cowan editor of the XML specification formed the MicroXML Community Group within the W C and published a specification for a significantly reduced subset of XML br br br Binary XML br The World Wide Web Consortium also has an XML Binary Characterization Working Group doing preliminary research into use cases and properties for a binary encoding of XML Information Set The working group is not chartered to produce any official standards Since XML is by definition text based ITU T and ISO are using the name Fast Infoset for their own binary format ITU T Rec X and ISO IEC to avoid confusion br br br Criticism br XML and its extensions have regularly been criticized for verbosity complexity and redundancy br Mapping the basic tree model of XML to type systems of programming languages or databases can be difficult especially when XML is used for exchanging highly structured data between applications which was not its primary design goal However XML data binding systems allow applications to access XML data directly from objects representing a data structure of the data in the programming language used which ensures type safety rather than using the DOM or SAX to retrieve data from a direct representation of the XML itself This is accomplished by automatically creating a mapping between elements of the XML schema XSD of the document and members of a class to be represented in memory br Other criticisms attempt to refute the claim that XML is a self describing language though the XML specification itself makes no such claim br JSON YAML and S Expressions are frequently proposed as simpler alternatives see Comparison of data serialization formats that focus on representing highly structured data rather than documents which may contain both highly structured and relatively unstructured content However W C standardized XML schema specifications offer a broader range of structured XSD data types compared to simpler serialization formats and offer modularity and reuse through XML namespaces br br br See also br AIDX br List of XML markup languages br List of types of XML schemas br Extensible programming
