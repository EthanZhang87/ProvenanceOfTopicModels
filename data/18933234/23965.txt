The PDP Programmed Data Processor is the first computer in Digital Equipment Corporation s PDP series and was first produced in It is famous for being the most important computer in the creation of hacker culture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Bolt Beranek and Newman and elsewhere The PDP is the original hardware for playing history s first game on a minicomputer Steve Russell s Spacewar br br br Description br br The PDP uses an bit word size and has words as standard main memory equivalent in bit size to eight bit bytes but in character size to bytes since the system actually divides an bit word into three six bit characters upgradable to words The magnetic core memory s cycle time is microseconds corresponding roughly to a clock speed of kilohertz consequently most arithmetic instructions take microseconds operations per second because they use two memory cycles the first to fetch the instruction the second to fetch or store the data word Signed numbers are represented in ones complement The PDP has computing power roughly equivalent to a pocket organizer and a little less memory br br The PDP uses transistors and diodes It is built mostly of DEC series System Building Blocks using micro alloy and micro alloy diffused transistors with a rated switching speed of MHz The System Building Blocks are packaged into several inch racks The racks are themselves packaged into a single large mainframe case with a hexagonal control panel containing switches and lights mounted to lie at table top height at one end of the mainframe Above the control panel is the system s standard input output solution a punched tape reader and writer br The PDP weighs about kg lb br br br History br The design of the PDP is based on the pioneering TX and TX computers designed and built at MIT Lincoln Laboratory Benjamin Gurley was the lead engineer on the project After showing a prototype at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference in December DEC delivered the first PDP to Bolt Beranek and Newman BBN in November and it was formally accepted in early In September DEC donated the PDP to MIT where it was placed in the room next to its ancestor the TX computer which was by then on indefinite loan from Lincoln Laboratory br In this setting the PDP quickly replaced the TX as the favorite machine among the budding hacker culture and served as the platform for a long list of computing innovations This list includes one of the earliest digital video games Spacewar the first text editor the first word processor the first interactive debugger the first credible computer chess program one of the very earliest time sharing systems BBN Time Sharing System and some of the earliest computerized music At the Computer History Museum TX alumni reunion in Gordon Bell said DEC s products developed directly from the TX the successor to the TX which had been developed at what Bell thought was a bargain price at the time about US million At the same meeting Jack Dennis said Ben Gurley s design for the PDP was influenced by his work on the TX display br br The PDP sold in basic form for US equivalent to US in BBN s system was quickly followed by orders from Lawrence Livermore and Atomic Energy of Canada AECL and eventually PDP s were delivered until production ended in All of these machines were still being actively used in and several were eventually saved MIT s example was donated to The Computer Museum Boston and from there ended up at the Computer History Museum CHM A late version of Spacewar on paper tape was still tucked into the case PDP was found in a barn in Wichita Kansas in apparently formerly owned by one of the many aviation companies in the area and rescued for the Digital Historical Collection also eventually ending up at the CHM AECL s computer was sent to Science North but was later scrapped br The launch of the PDP marked a radical shift in the philosophy of computer design it is the first commercial computer that focuses on interaction with the user rather than just the efficient use of computer cycles br The first ever reference to malicious hacking is telephone hackers in MIT s student newspaper The Tech of hackers tying up the lines with Harvard configuring the PDP to make free calls war dialing and accumulating large phone bills br br br Peripherals br br The PDP uses fanfold punched paper tape as its primary storage medium Unlike punched card decks which could be sorted and re ordered paper tape is tedious to physically edit This inspired the creation of text editing programs such as Expensive Typewriter and TECO Because it is equipped with online and offline printers that were based on IBM electric typewriter mechanisms it is capable of what in s terminology would be called letter quality printing and therefore inspired TJ arguably the first word processor br The console typewriter is the product of a company named Soroban Engineering It uses an IBM Model B Electric typewriter mechanism modified by the addition of switches to detect keypresses and solenoids to activate the typebars It uses a traditional typebar mechanism not the golfball IBM Selectric typewriter mechanism which was not introduced until the next year Lettercase is selected by raising and lowering the massive type basket The Soroban is equipped with a two color inked ribbon red and black and the interface allows color selection Programs commonly use color coding to distinguish user input from machine responses The Soroban mechanism is unreliable and prone to jamming particularly when shifting case or changing ribbon color br Offline devices are typically Friden Flexowriters that have been specially built to operate with the FIO DEC character coding used by the PDP Like the console typewriter these are built around a typing mechanism that is mechanically the same as an IBM Electric typewriter However Flexowriters are highly reliable and were often used for long unattended printing sessions Flexowriters have electromechanical paper tape punches and readers which operate synchronously with the typewriter mechanism Typing rates are about ten characters per second A typical PDP operating procedure is to output text to punched paper tape using the PDP s high speed character per second Teletype model BRPE punch then to hand carry the tape to a Flexowriter for offline printing br In later years DECtape drives were added to some PDP systems as a more convenient method of backing up programs and data and to enable early time sharing This latter application usually requires a secondary storage medium for swapping programs and data in and out of core memory without requiring manual intervention For this purpose DECtapes are far superior to paper tapes in terms of reliability durability and speed Early hard disks were expensive and notoriously unreliable if available and working they are used primarily for speed of swapping and not for permanent file storage br br br Graphics display br The Type Precision CRT display is a point plotting display device capable of addressing by addressable locations at a rate of points per second A special Display One Point On CRT instruction is used to build up images which have to be refreshed many times per second The CRT which was originally developed for use in radar is inches cm in diameter and uses a long persistence P phosphor A light pen can be used with the Type to pick points on the display An optional character generator and hardware for line and curve generation are available br br br Computer music br MIT hackers also used the PDP for playing music in four part harmony using some special hardware four flip flops directly controlled by the processor the audio signal is filtered with simple RC filters Music was prepared via Peter Samson s Harmony Compiler a sophisticated text based program with some features specifically oriented toward the efficient coding of baroque music Several hours of music were prepared for it including Bach fugues all of Mozart s Eine kleine Nachtmusik the Ode to Joy movement concluding Beethoven s Symphony No Christmas carols and numerous popular songs br br br Current status br br Only three PDP computers are still known to exist and all three are in the collection of the Computer History Museum CHM One is the prototype formerly used at MIT and the other two are production PDP C machines One of the latter serial number the last PDP made has been restored to working order is on exhibit and is demonstrated on two Saturdays every month The demonstrations include br br the game Spacewar br graphics demonstrations such as Snowflake br playing music br Software simulations of the PDP exist in SIMH and MESS hardware recreation through FPGA exists for the MiSTer project as well and binary image of paper tapes of the software exist in the bitsavers org archives br br br See also br History of computers br History of computer
