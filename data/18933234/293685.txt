GNUnet is a software framework for decentralized peer to peer networking and an official GNU package The framework offers link encryption peer discovery resource allocation communication over many transports such as TCP UDP HTTP HTTPS WLAN and Bluetooth and various basic peer to peer algorithms for routing multicast and network size estimation br GNUnet s basic network topology is that of a mesh network GNUnet includes a distributed hash table DHT which is a randomized variant of Kademlia that can still efficiently route in small world networks GNUnet offers a F F topology option for restricting connections to only the users trusted friends The users friends own friends and so on can then indirectly exchange files with the users computer never using its IP address directly br GNUnet uses Uniform resource identifiers not approved by IANA although an application has been made GNUnet URIs consist of two major parts the module and the module specific identifier A GNUnet URI is of form gnunet module identifier where module is the module name and identifier is a module specific string br The primary codebase is written in C but there are bindings in other languages to produce an API for developing extensions in those languages GNUnet is part of the GNU Project It has gained interest in the hacker community after the PRISM revelations br GNUnet consists of several subsystems of which essential ones are Transport and Core subsystems Transport subsystem provides insecure link layer communications while Core provides peer discovery and encryption On top of the core subsystem various applications are built br GNUnet includes various P P applications in the main distribution of the framework including filesharing chat and VPN additionally a few external projects such as secushare are also extending the GNUnet infrastructure br GNUnet is unrelated to the older Gnutella P P protocol Gnutella is not an official GNU project while GNUnet is br br br Transport br Originally GNUnet used UDP for underlying transport Now GNUnet transport subsystem provides multiple options such as TCP and SMTP br The communication port officially registered at IANA is tcp udp br br br Trust system br GNUnet provides trust system based on an excess based economic model The idea of employing an economic system is taken from the MojoNation network br GNUnet network has no trusted entities so it is impossible to maintain a global reputation Instead each peer maintains its own trust for each of its local links br When resources such as bandwidth and CPU time are in excess the peer provides them to all requesting neighbors without reducing trust or otherwise charging them When a node is under stress it drops requests from its neighbor nodes having lower internal trust value However when the peer has less resources than enough to fulfill everyone s requests it denies requests of those neighbors that it trusts less and charges others by reducing their trust br br br File sharing br The primary application at this point is anonymous censorship resistant file sharing allowing users to anonymously publish or retrieve information of all kinds The GNUnet protocol which provides anonymity is called GAP GNUnet anonymity protocol GNUnet FS can additionally make use of GNU libextractor to automatically annotate shared files with metadata br br br File encoding br Files shared with GNUnet are ECRS An Encoding for Censorship Resistant Sharing coded br All content is represented as GBlocks Each GBlock contains bytes There are several types of GBlocks each of them serves a particular purpose Any GBlock br br br br B br br br displaystyle B br br is uniquely identified by its RIPEMD hash br br br br H br br B br br br br displaystyle H B br br br DBlocks store actual file contents and nothing else File is split at byte boundaries and resulting chunks are stored in DBlocks DBlocks are linked together into Merkle tree by means of IBlocks that store DBlock identifiers br Blocks are encrypted with a symmetric key derived from br br br br H br br B br br br br displaystyle H B br br when they are stored in the network br br br Queries and replies br GNUnet Anonymity Protocol consists of queries and replies Depending on load of the forwarding node messages are forwarded to zero or more nodes br Queries are used to search for content and request data blocks br Query contains resource identifier reply address priority and TTL Time to Live br Resource identifier of datum br br br br Q br br br displaystyle Q br br is a triple hash

displaystyle Q br br br Reply address is the major difference compared to Freenet protocol While in Freenet reply always propagates back using the same path as the query in GNUnet the path may be shorter Peer receiving a query may drop it forward it without rewriting reply address or indirect it by replacing reply address with its own address By indirecting queries peer provides cover traffic for its own queries while by forwarding them peer avoids being a link in reply propagation and preserves its bandwidth This feature allows the user to trade anonymity for efficiency User can specify an anonymity level for each publish search and download operation An anonymity level of zero can be used to select non anonymous file sharing GNUnet s DHT infrastructure is only used if non anonymous file sharing is specified The anonymity level determines how much cover traffic a peer must have to hide the user s own actions br Priority specifies how much of its trust user wants to spend in case of a resource shortage br TTL is used to prevent queries from staying in the network for too long br br br File sharing URIs br The fs module identifier consists of either chk sks ksk or loc followed by a slash and a category specific value Most URIs contain hashes which are encoded in base hex br br chk identifies files typically gnunet fs chk file hash query hash file size in bytes br File hash is the hash of the plaintext file which allows decrypting it once it is downloaded Query hash is the hash of topmost GBlock which allows downloading the whole tree of GBlocks that contain encrypted file File size is required to determine the shape of the tree br sks identifies files within namespaces typically gnunet fs sks NAMESPACE IDENTIFIER br ksk identifies search queries typically gnunet fs ksk KEYWORD KEYWORD br loc identifies a datum on a specific machine typically gnunet fs loc PEER QUERY TYPE KEY SIZE br br br Examples br A type of GNUnet filesharing URI pointing to a specific

GNUnet includes an implementation of the GNU Name System GNS a decentralized and censorship resistant replacement for DNS In GNS each user manages their own zones and can delegate subdomains to zones managed by other users Lookups of records defined by other users are performed using GNUnet s DHT GNS has been standardized in RFC The GANA registry manages the alt top level domain in GNS br br br Protocol translation br GNUnet can tunnel IP traffic over the peer to peer network If necessary GNUnet can perform IPv IPv protocol translation in the process GNUnet provides a DNS Application level gateway to proxy DNS requests and map addresses to the desired address family as necessary This way GNUnet offers a possible technology to facilitate IPv transition Furthermore in combination with GNS GNUnet s protocol translation system can be used to access hidden services IP based services that run locally at some peer in the network and which can only be accessed by resolving a GNS name br br br Social API br Gabor X Toth published in early September a thesis to present the design of a social messaging service for the GNUnet peer to peer framework that offers scalability extensibility and end to end encrypted communication The scalability property is achieved through multicast message delivery while extensibility is made possible by using PSYC Protocol for SYnchronous Conferencing which provides an extensible RPC Remote Procedure Call syntax that can evolve over time without having to upgrade the software on all nodes in the network Another key feature provided by the PSYC layer are stateful multicast channels which are used to store e g user profiles End to end encrypted communication is provided by the mesh service of GNUnet upon which the multicast channels are built Pseudonymous users and social places in the system have cryptographical identities identified by their public key these are mapped to human memorable names using GNS GNU Name System where each pseudonym has a zone pointing to its places br That is the required building block for turning the GNUnet framework into a fully peer to peer social networking platform br br br Chat br A chat has been implemented in the CADET module for which a GTK interface for GNOME exists specifically designed for the emerging Linux phones such as the Librem or the PinePhone br br br See also br br
