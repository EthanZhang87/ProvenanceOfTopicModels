KornShell ksh is a Unix shell which was developed by David Korn at Bell Labs in the early s and announced at USENIX on July The initial development was based on Bourne shell source code Other early contributors were Bell Labs developers Mike Veach and Pat Sullivan who wrote the Emacs and vi style line editing modes code respectively KornShell is backward compatible with the Bourne shell and includes many features of the C shell inspired by the requests of Bell Labs users br br br Features br KornShell complies with POSIX Shell and Utilities Command Interpreter IEEE Std Major differences between KornShell and the traditional Bourne shell include br br job control command aliasing and command history designed after the corresponding C shell features job control was added to the Bourne Shell in br a choice of three command line editing styles based on vi Emacs and Gosling Emacs br associative arrays and built in floating point arithmetic operations only available in the ksh version of KornShell br dynamic search for functions br mathematical functions br process substitution and process redirection br C language like expressions br enhanced expression oriented for and while loops br dynamic extensibility of dynamically loaded built in commands since ksh br reference variables br hierarchically nested variables br variables can have member functions associated with them br object oriented programming since ksh t br variables can be objects with member sub variables and member methods br object methods are called with the object variable name followed after a dot character by the method name br special object methods are called on object initialization or assignment object abandonment unset br composition and aggregation is available as well as a form of inheritance br br br History br br KornShell was originally proprietary software In the source code was released under a license particular to AT T but since the ksh q release in early it has been licensed under the Eclipse Public License KornShell is available as part of the AT T Software Technology AST Open Source Software Collection As KornShell was initially only available through a proprietary license from AT T a number of free and open source alternatives were created These include pdksh mksh Bash and Z shell br The functionality of the original KornShell ksh was used as a basis for the standard POSIX Shell and Utilities Command Interpreter IEEE Std br Some vendors still ship their own versions of the older ksh variant sometimes with extensions ksh is maintained on GitHub br As Desktop KornShell dtksh ksh is distributed as part of the Common Desktop Environment This version also provides shell level mappings for Motif widgets It was intended as a competitor to Tcl Tk br The original KornShell ksh became the default shell on AIX in version with ksh being available separately br UnixWare includes both ksh and ksh The default Korn shell is ksh which is supplied as usr bin ksh and the older version is available as usr bin ksh UnixWare also includes dtksh when CDE is installed br The ksh distribution underwent a less stable fate after the authors left AT T around at stable version ksh u The primary authors continued working on a ksh v beta branch until around That work was eventually taken up primarily by Red Hat in due to customer requests and resulted in the eventual initial release of ksh in the fall of That initial release although fixing several prior stability issues introduced some minor breakage and compatibility issues In March AT T decided to roll back the community changes stash them in a branch and restart from ksh u as the changes were too broad and too ksh focused for the company to absorb into a project in maintenance mode Bugfix development continues on the ksh u m branch based on the last stable AT T release ksh u ksh was released as a major release for several reasons such as removal of EBCDIC support dropping support for binary plugins written for ksh u and removal of some broken math functions but has never been maintained or supported by AT T not even on its initial release date br br br Primary contributions to the main software branch br For the purposes of the lists below the main software branch of KSH is defined as the original program dating from July up and through the release of KSH in late br Continuing development of follow on versions branches of KSH have split into different groups starting in and are not elaborated on below br br br Primary individual contributors br The

Besides the primary major contributing corporations listed above some companies have contributed free resources to the development of KSH These are listed below alphabetically ordered br br Coverity br GitHub br Travis CI br br br Variants br There are several forks and clones of KornShell br br dtksh a fork of ksh included as part of CDE br tksh a fork of ksh that provides access to the Tk widget toolkit br oksh a port of OpenBSD s variant of KornShell intended to be maximally portable across operating systems It was used as the default shell in DeLi Linux br loksh a Linux port of OpenBSD s variant of KornShell with minimal changes br mksh a free implementation of the KornShell language forked from OpenBSD pdksh It was originally developed for MirOS BSD and is licensed under permissive though not public domain terms specifically the MirOS Licence In addition to its usage on BSD this variant has replaced pdksh on Debian and is the default shell on Android br SKsh an AmigaOS variant that provides several Amiga specific features such as ARexx interoperability In this tradition MorphOS uses pdksh in its SDK br MKS Inc s MKS Korn shell a proprietary implementation of the KornShell language from Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX SFU up to version according to David Korn the MKS Korn shell was not fully compatible with KornShell in In SFU version Microsoft replaced the MKS Korn shell with a new POSIX compliant shell as part of Interix br KornShell is included in UWIN a Unix compatibility package by David Korn br bin sh in Doug Gwyn s US Army BRL System V on BSD package included Ron Natalie s version of the SVR bin sh that had both job control and command line editing This was a contemporary of the original ksh at a time when it had not escaped AT T This was subsequently the bin sh that shipped with all the CMU Mach derived systems br br br See also br br Comparison of computer shells br List of Unix commands br test Unix br br br br br br
