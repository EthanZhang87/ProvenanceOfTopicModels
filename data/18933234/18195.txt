LaTeX LAH tek or LAY tek often stylized as LaTeX is a software system for typesetting documents LaTeX markup describes the content and layout of the document as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG word processors like Microsoft Word LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document to stylise text throughout a document such as bold and italics and to add citations and cross references A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MiKTeX is used to produce an output file such as PDF or DVI suitable for printing or digital distribution br LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents and technical note taking in many fields owing partially to its support for complex mathematical notation It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials such as Arabic and Greek LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output and is itself written in the TeX macro language br LaTeX can be used as a standalone document preparation system or as an intermediate format In the latter role for example it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating DocBook and other XML based formats for PDF The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing including numbering and cross referencing of tables and figures chapter and section headings graphics page layout indexing and bibliographies br Like TeX LaTeX started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists but even from early in its development it has also been taken up by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non Latin scripts such as Arabic Devanagari and Chinese br LaTeX is intended to provide a high level descriptive markup language to utilize TeX more easily TeX handles the document layout while LaTeX handles the content side for document processing LaTeX comprises a collection of TeX macros and a program to process LaTeX documents and because the plain TeX formatting commands are elementary it provides authors with ready made commands for formatting and layout requirements such as chapter headings footnotes cross references and bibliographies br LaTeX was originally written in the early s by Leslie Lamport at SRI International The current version is LaTeX e stylised as LaTeX first released in but incrementally updated starting in This update policy replaced earlier plans for a separate release of LaTeX LaTeX which had been in development since LaTeX is free software and is distributed under the LaTeX Project Public License LPPL br br br History br LaTeX was created in the early s by Leslie Lamport when he was working at Stanford Research Institute SRI He needed to write TeX macros for his own use and thought that with a little extra effort he could make a general package usable by others Peter Gordon an editor at Addison Wesley convinced him to write a LaTeX user s manual for publication Lamport was initially skeptical that anyone would pay money for it it came out in and sold hundreds of thousands of copies Meanwhile Lamport released versions of his LaTeX macros in and On August at a TeX Users Group TUG meeting at Stanford Lamport agreed to turn over maintenance and development of LaTeX to Frank Mittelbach Frank Mittelbach along with Chris Rowley and Rainer Sch pf formed the LaTeX team in they released LaTeX e the current standard version LaTeX has since been cancelled with features intended for that version being back ported to LaTeX e since br br br Typesetting system br LaTeX attempts to follow the design philosophy of separating presentation from content so that authors can focus on the content of what they are writing without attending simultaneously to its visual appearance In preparing a LaTeX document the author specifies the logical structure using simple familiar concepts such as chapter section table figure etc and lets the LaTeX system handle the formatting and layout of these structures As a result it encourages the separation of the layout from the content while still allowing manual typesetting adjustments whenever needed This concept is similar to the mechanism by which many word processors allow styles to be defined globally for an entire document or the use of Cascading Style Sheets in styling HyperText Markup Language HTML documents br The LaTeX system is a markup language that handles typesetting and rendering and can be arbitrarily extended by using the underlying macro language to develop custom macros such as new environments and commands Such macros are often collected into packages which could then be made available to address some specific typesetting needs such as the formatting of complex mathematical expressions or graphics e g the use of the align environment provided by the amsmath package to produce aligned equations br To create a document in LaTeX a user first creates a file such as document tex typically using a text editor The user then gives their document tex file as input to the TeX program with the LaTeX macros loaded which prompts TeX to write out a file suitable for onscreen viewing or printing This write format preview cycle is one of the chief ways in which working with LaTeX differs from the What You See Is What You Get WYSIWYG style of document editing It is similar to the code compile execute cycle known to computer programmers Today many LaTeX aware editing programs make this cycle a simple matter through the pressing of a single key while showing the output preview on the screen beside the input window Some online LaTeX editors even automatically refresh the preview while other online tools provide incremental editing in place mixed in with the preview in a streamlined single window br br br Example br The example below shows the input to LaTeX and the corresponding output from the system br br br Pronouncing and writing LaTeX br br The characters T E and X in the name come from the Greek capital letters tau epsilon and chi as the name of TeX derives from the Ancient Greek skill art technique for this reason TeX s creator Donald Knuth promotes its pronunciation as tekh that is with a voiceless velar fricative as in Modern Greek similar to the ch in loch Lamport remarks that TeX is usually pronounced tech making lah tech lah tech and lay tech the logical choices but language is not always logical so lay tecks is also possible br The name is printed in running text with a typographical logo LaTeX br In media where the logo cannot be precisely reproduced in running text the word is typically given the unique capitalization LaTeX Alternatively the TeX LaTeX and XeTeX logos can also be rendered via pure CSS and XHTML for use in graphical web browsers by following the specifications of the internal LaTeX macro br br br Related software br As a macro package LaTeX provides a set of macros for TeX to interpret There are many other macro packages for TeX including Plain TeX GNU Texinfo AMSTeX and ConTeXt br When TeX compiles a document it follows from the user s point of view the following processing sequence Macros TeX Driver Output Different implementations of each of these steps are typically available in TeX distributions Traditional TeX will output a DVI file which is usually converted to a PostScript file H n Th Th nh and others have written a new implementation of TeX called pdfTeX which also outputs to PDF and takes advantage of features available in that format The XeTeX engine developed by Jonathan Kew on the other hand merges modern font technologies and Unicode with TeX LuaTeX is an extended version of pdfTeX using Lua as an embedded scripting language br There are also many editors for LaTeX some of which are offline source code based while others are online partial WYSIWYG based For more see Comparison of TeX editors br br br Compatibility and converters br LaTeX documents tex can be opened with any text editor They consist of plain text and contain no hidden formatting codes or binary information TeX documents can also be shared by rendering the LaTeX file to Rich Text Format RTF XML or class cls files This can be done using the free software programs LaTeX RTF or TeX ht LaTeX can also and commonly is rendered to PDF files using the LaTeX extension pdfLaTeX LaTeX files containing Unicode text can be processed into PDFs with the inputenc package or by the TeX extensions XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX br br HeVeA is a converter written in OCaml that converts LaTeX documents to HTML This way documents such as scientific papers primarily typeset for printing can be placed on the World Wide Web for online viewing It is licensed under the Q Public License br LaTeX HTML is a converter written in Perl that converts LaTeX documents to HTML It is licensed under the GNU General Public License GPL v The latest updates are available from Comprehensive TeX Archive Network CTAN br LaTeXML is a converter written in Perl that converts LaTeX documents into a variety of XML based formats including HTML with MathML ePub ebooks JATS and TEI It was developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology by US Federal Government employees and is therefore in the public domain It is available for free br Pandoc is a universal document converter able to transform LaTeX as well as other formats into many different file formats including HTML ePub RTF Microsoft Word docx and even text with MediaWiki markup as used in Wikipedia It is licensed under GPL v br LaTeX has become the de facto standard to typeset mathematical expression in scientific documents Hence there are several conversion tools focusing on mathematical LaTeX expressions such as converters to MathML or Computer Algebra System br br MathJax is a JavaScript library for converting LaTeX to MathML picture formats including SVG and PNG or HTML for embedding within a webpage br The Wikimedia Foundation uses MathJax to build Mathoid a web service that uses Node js to render math that is used in Wikipedia br KaTeX is a JavaScript library for converting LaTeX to HTML and MathML It is developed by Khan Academy and is among the fastest LaTeX to HTML converters br br br Licensing br LaTeX is typically distributed along with plain TeX under a free software license the LaTeX Project Public License LPPL The LPPL is not compatible with the GNU General Public License as it requires that modified files must be clearly differentiable from their originals usually by changing the filename this was done to ensure that files that depend on other files will produce the expected behavior and avoid dependency hell The LPPL is Debian Free Software Guidelines DFSG compliant as of version As free software LaTeX is available on most operating systems which include Unix Solaris HP UX AIX BSD FreeBSD macOS NetBSD OpenBSD Linux Red Hat Debian Arch Gentoo Windows DOS RISC OS AmigaOS and Plan br br br Versions br br LaTeX e is the current version of LaTeX since it replaced LaTeX in As of LaTeX which started in the early s is under a long term development project Planned features include improved syntax separation of content from styling hyperlink support a new user interface access to arbitrary fonts and a new documentation Some LaTeX features are available in LaTeX e using packages and by many features have been enabled in LaTeX e by default for a gradual transition br There are many commercial implementations of the entire TeX system System vendors may add extra features like added typefaces and telephone support LyX is a free software WYSIWYM visual document processor that uses LaTeX for a back end TeXmacs is a free WYSIWYG editor with similar functionalities as LaTeX but with
