title: Editor war
id: 10268
The editor war is the rivalry between users of the Emacs and vi now usually Vim or more recently Neovim text editors The rivalry has become an enduring part of hacker culture and the free software community br The Emacs versus vi debate was one of the original holy wars conducted on Usenet groups with many flame wars fought between those insisting that their editor of choice is the paragon of editing perfection and insulting the other since at least Related battles have been fought over operating systems programming languages version control systems and even source code indent style br br br Evolution br br Many small editors that were based on or derived from vi in the past were successful This was because it was crucial to preserve the memory that was at the time relatively sparsely available As computers have become more powerful many vi clones Vim in particular have grown in size and code complexity These vi variants of today as with the old lightweight Emacs variants tend to have many of the perceived benefits and drawbacks of the opposing side For example Vim without any extensions requires about ten times the disk space required by vi and recent versions of Vim can have more extensions and run slower than Emacs In The Art of Unix Programming Eric S Raymond called Vim s supposed light weight when compared with Emacs a shared myth Moreover with the large amounts of RAM in modern computers both Emacs and vi are lightweight compared to large integrated development environments such as Eclipse which tend to draw derision from Emacs and vi users alike br Tim O Reilly said in that O Reilly Media s tutorial on vi sells twice as many copies as that on Emacs but noted that Emacs came with a free manual Many programmers use either Emacs and vi or their various offshoots including Linus Torvalds who uses MicroEMACS Also in vi creator Bill Joy said that vi was written for a world that doesn t exist anymore and stated that Emacs was written on much more capable machines with faster displays so they could have funny commands with the screen shimmering and all that and meanwhile I m sitting at home in sort of World War II surplus housing at Berkeley with a modem and a terminal that can just barely get the cursor off the bottom line br In addition to Emacs and vi workalikes pico and its free and open source clone nano and other text editors such as ne often have their own third party advocates in the editor wars though not to the extent of Emacs and vi br As of both Emacs and vi can lay claim to being among the longest lived application programs of all time as well as being the two most commonly used text editors on Linux and Unix Many operating systems especially Linux and BSD derivatives bundle multiple text editors with the operating system to cater to user demand For example a default installation of macOS contains ed pico nano before MacOS Ventura TextEdit and Vim Frequently at some point in the discussion someone will point out that ed is the standard text editor br br br Humor br br The Church of Emacs formed by Emacs and the GNU Project s creator Richard Stallman is a parody religion While it refers to vi as the editor of the beast vi vi vi being in Roman numerals it does not oppose the use of vi rather it calls proprietary software anathema Using a free version of vi is not a sin but a penance The Church of Emacs has its own newsgroup alt religion emacs that has posts purporting to support this belief system br Stallman has referred to himself as St IGNU cius a saint in the Church of Emacs br Supporters of vi have created an opposing Cult of vi argued by the more hard line Emacs users to be an attempt to ape their betters br Regarding vi s modal nature a common point of frustration for new users some Emacs users joke that vi has two modes beep repeatedly and break everything vi users enjoy joking that Emacs s key sequences induce carpal tunnel syndrome or mentioning one of many satirical expansions of the acronym EMACS such as Escape Meta Alt Control Shift a jab at Emacs s reliance on modifier keys or Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping in a time when that was a great amount of memory or EMACS Makes Any Computer Slow a recursive acronym like those Stallman uses or Eventually Munches All Computer Storage in reference to Emacs s high system resource requirements GNU EMACS has been expanded to Generally Not Used Except by Middle Aged Computer Scientists referencing its most ardent fans and its declining usage among younger programmers compared to more graphically oriented editors such as Atom BBEdit Sublime Text TextMate and Visual Studio Code br As a poke at Emacs creeping featurism vi advocates have been known to describe Emacs as a great operating system lacking only a decent editor Emacs advocates have been known to respond that the editor is actually very good but the operating system could use improvement referring to Emacs famous lack of concurrency which has now been added br A game among UNIX users either to test the depth of an Emacs user s understanding of the editor or to poke fun at the complexity of Emacs involved predicting what would happen if a user held down a modifier key such as Ctrl or Alt and typed their own name This game humor originated with users of the older TECO editor which was the implementation basis via macros of the original Emacs br Due to how one exits vi q among others hackers joke about a proposed method of creating a pseudorandom character sequence by having a user unfamiliar with vi seated in front of an open editor and asking them to exit the program br The Google search engine also joined in on the joke by having searches for vi resulting in the question Did you mean emacs prompted at the top of the page and searches for emacs resulting in Did you mean vi br In the web series A Murder at the End of the World there is a scene referencing the editor wars where a character asks a woman if she uses
