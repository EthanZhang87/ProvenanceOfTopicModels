began his programming career writing proprietary software between and In noting that the Jargon File had not been maintained since about he adopted it but not without criticism Paul Dourish maintains an archived original version of the Jargon File because he says Raymond s updates essentially destroyed what held it together br In Raymond took over development of the open source email software popclient renaming it to Fetchmail Soon after this experience in he wrote the essay The Cathedral and the Bazaar detailing his thoughts on open source software development and why it should be done as openly as possible the bazaar approach The essay was based in part on his experience in developing Fetchmail He first presented his thesis at the annual Linux Kongress on May He later expanded the essay into a book The Cathedral and the Bazaar Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary in The essay has been widely cited The internal white paper by Frank Hecker that led to the release of the Mozilla then Netscape source code in cited The Cathedral and the Bazaar as independent validation of ideas proposed by Eric Hahn and Jamie Zawinski Hahn would later describe the book as clearly influential br From the late s onward due in part to the popularity of his essay Raymond became a prominent voice in the open source movement He co founded the Open Source Initiative OSI in taking on the self appointed role of ambassador of open source to the press business and public He remains active in OSI but stepped down as president of the initiative in February In early March he was removed from two Open Source Initiative mailing lists due to posts that violated the OSI s Code of Conduct br In Raymond received and published a Microsoft document expressing worry about the quality of rival open source software He named this document together with others subsequently leaked The Halloween Documents br In he created Configuration Menu Language CML a source code configuration system while originally intended for the Linux operating system it was rejected by kernel developers Raymond attributed this rejection to kernel list politics but Linus Torvalds said in a mailing list post that as a matter of policy the development team preferred more incremental changes Raymond s book The Art of Unix Programming discusses user tools for programming and other tasks br Some versions of NetHack still include Raymond s guide He has also contributed code and content to the free software video game The Battle for Wesnoth br Raymond is the main developer of NTPsec a secure hardened replacement for the Unix utility NTP br Raymond has written numerous open source tools including cvs fast export a tool for exporting CVS repositories to Git fast import streams and reposurgeon a tool for exporting SVN repositories br br br Views on open source br br Raymond coined an aphorism he dubbed Linus s law inspired by Linus Torvalds Given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow It first appeared in his book The Cathedral and the Bazaar br Raymond has refused to speculate on whether the bazaar development model could be applied to works such as books and music saying that he does not want to weaken the winning argument for open sourcing software by tying it to a potential loser br Raymond has had a number of public disputes with other figures in the free software movement As head of the Open Source Initiative he argued that advocates should focus on the potential for better products The very seductive moral and ethical rhetoric of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation fails he said not because his principles are wrong but because that kind of language simply does not persuade anybody br In a essay he defended programmers right to issue work under proprietary licenses I think that if a programmer wants to write a program and sell it it s neither my business nor anyone else s but his customer s what the terms of sale are In the same essay he said that the logic of the system puts developers into dysfunctional roles with bad code the result br br br Political beliefs and activism br Raymond is a member of the Libertarian Party and a gun rights advocate He has endorsed the open source firearms organization Defense Distributed calling them friends of freedom and writing I approve of any development that makes it more difficult for governments and criminals to monopolize the use of force As D printers become less expensive and more ubiquitous this could be a major step in the right direction br In Raymond accused the Ada Initiative and other women in tech groups of attempting to entrap male open source leaders and accuse them of rape saying Try to avoid even being alone ever because there is a chance that a women in tech advocacy group is going to try to collect your scalp br Raymond has claimed that Gays experimented with unfettered promiscuity in the s and got AIDS as a consequence and that Police who react to a random black male behaving suspiciously who might be in the critical age range as though he is an near imminent lethal threat are being rational not racist A progressive campaign The Great Slate was successful in raising funds for candidates in part by asking for contributions from tech workers in return for not posting similar quotes by Raymond Matasano Security employee and Great Slate fundraiser Thomas Ptacek said I ve been torturing Twitter with lurid Eric S Raymond quotes for years Every time I do people beg me to stop It is estimated that as of March over has been raised in this
