GNU Image Manipulation Program commonly known by its acronym GIMP GHIMP is a free and open source raster graphics editor used for image manipulation retouching and image editing free form drawing transcoding between different image file formats and more specialized tasks It is extensible by means of plugins and scriptable It is not designed to be used for drawing though some artists and creators have used it in this way br GIMP is released under the GPL or later license and is available for Linux macOS and Microsoft Windows br br br History br In Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis began developing GIMP originally named General Image Manipulation Program as a semester long project at the University of California Berkeley for the eXperimental Computing Facility The acronym was coined first with the letter G being added to IMP as a reference to the gimp in the scene from the film Pulp Fiction br was the initial public release of GIMP The editor was quickly adopted and a community of contributors formed The community began developing tutorials and artwork and sharing better work flows and techniques br In the following year Kimball and Mattis met with Richard Stallman of the GNU Project while he visited UC Berkeley and asked if they could change General in the application s name to GNU the name of the operating system created by Stallman and Stallman approved The application subsequently formed part of the GNU software collection br The first release supported Unix systems such as Linux SGI IRIX and HP UX Since then GIMP has been ported to other operating systems including Microsoft Windows GIMP and macOS br A GUI toolkit called GTK at the time known as the GIMP ToolKit was developed to facilitate the development of GIMP The development of the GIMP ToolKit has been attributed to Peter Mattis becoming disenchanted with the Motif toolkit GIMP originally used Motif was used up until GIMP br br In recent versions since the GIMP build the removal of the Lanczos image scaling algorithm which had been used by GIMP and other image editing programs for many years in favor of pushing forward the new NoHalo and LoHalo algorithms developed by Nicolas Robidoux caused some controversy among GIMP users with some users standing by the change but others expressing their dissatisfaction about it due to mixed quality results in some image scaling scenarios leading some users to keep using the older version of GIMP simply because it s the last build with Lanczos support and a few users giving up on using the application altogether as a result To this day several users hope to see a future version of GIMP with the Lanczos algorithm added back as an option for image resampling br br br Mascot br br GIMP s mascot is called Wilber and was created in GIMP by Tuomas Kuosmanen known as tigert on September Wilber received additional accessories from other GIMP developers which can be found in the Wilber Construction Kit included in the GIMP source code as docs Wilber Construction Kit xcf gz br br br Development br GIMP is primarily developed by volunteers as a free and open source software project associated with both the GNU and GNOME projects Development takes place in a public git source code repository on public mailing lists and in public chat channels on the GIMPNET IRC network br New features are held in public separate source code branches and merged into the main or development branch when the GIMP team is sure they won t damage existing functions Sometimes this means that features that appear complete do not get merged or take months or years before they become available in GIMP br GIMP itself is released as source code After a source code release installers and packages are made for different operating systems by parties who might not be in contact with the maintainers of GIMP br The version number used in GIMP is expressed in a major minor micro format with each number carrying a specific meaning the first major number is incremented only for major developments and is currently The second minor number is incremented with each release of new features with odd numbers reserved for in progress development versions and even numbers assigned to stable releases the third micro number is incremented before and after each release resulting in even numbers for releases and odd numbers for development snapshots with any bug fixes subsequently applied and released for a stable version br Previously GIMP applied for several positions in the Google Summer of Code GSoC From to there have been nine GSoC projects that have been listed as successful although not all successful projects have been merged into GIMP immediately The healing brush and perspective clone tools and Ruby bindings were created as part of the GSoC and can be used in version of GIMP although there were three other projects that were completed and are later available in a stable version of GIMP those projects being Vector Layers end in and master and a JPEG plug in mid in and master Several of the GSoC projects were completed in but have been merged into a stable GIMP release later in to for Version xx and x Some of them needed some more code work for the master tree br Second public Development Version was with many deep improvements after initial Public Version Third Public Development version is Version One of the new features is removing the GB size limit of XCF file Increase of possible threads to is also an important point for modern parallel execution in actual AMD Ryzen and Intel Xeon processors Version included many bug fixes and improvements in gradients and clips Improvements in performance and optimization beyond bug hunting were the development targets for MacOS Beta is available with Version br The next stable version in the roadmap is with a GTK port Series is the development Series to Jehan Pages the lead developer and maintainer of GIMP stated that GIMP s release is tentative for May and plans to announce the release at the next Libre Graphics Meeting conference br GIMP developers meet during the annual Libre Graphics Meeting Interaction designers from OpenUsability have also contributed to GIMP br br br Versions br br br GIMP x br br br GIMP x br br br GIMP x br br br GIMP x br br br Distribution br The current version of GIMP works with numerous operating systems including Linux macOS and Windows Many Linux distributions such as Fedora Linux and Debian include GIMP as a part of their desktop operating systems br GIMP began to host its own downloads after discontinuing use of SourceForge in The website later repossessed GIMP s dormant account and hosted advertising laden versions of GIMP for Windows br In GIMP was published on the Microsoft Store for Windows br br br Professional reviews br Lifewire reviewed GIMP favorably in March writing that f or those who have never experienced Photoshop GIMP is simply a very powerful image manipulation program and i f you re willing to invest some time learning it it can be a very good graphics tool br GIMP s fitness for use in professional environments is regularly reviewed it is often compared to and suggested as a possible replacement for Adobe Photoshop br GIMP was used to create nearly all of the art in Lucas the Game an independent video game by developer Timothy Courtney Courtney started development of Lucas the Game in early and the video game was published in July for PC and Mac Courtney explains GIMP is a powerful tool fully capable of large professional projects such as video games br The single window mode introduced in GIMP was reviewed in by Ryan Paul of Ars Technica who noted that it made the user experience feel more streamlined and less cluttered Michael Burns writing for Macworld in described the single window interface of GIMP as a big improvement br In his review of GIMP for ExtremeTech in October David Cardinal noted that GIMP s reputation of being hard to use and lacking features has changed dramatically over the last couple years and that it was no longer a crippled alternative to Photoshop He described GIMP s scripting as one of its strengths but also remarked that some of Photoshop s features such as Text D commands Adjustment Layers and History are either less powerful or missing in GIMP Cardinal favorably described the UFRaw converter for raw images used with GIMP noting that it still requires some patience to figure out how to use those more advanced capabilities Cardinal stated that GIMP is easy enough to try despite not having as well developed documentation and help system as those for Photoshop concluding that it has become a worthy alternative to Photoshop for anyone on a budget who doesn t need all of Photoshop s vast feature set br The user interface has been criticized for being hard to use br br br Features br br Tools used to perform image editing can be accessed via the toolbox through menus and dialogue windows They include filters and brushes as well as transformation selection layer and masking tools GIMP s developers have asserted that it has or at least aspire to it having similar functionality to Photoshop but has a different user interface Also as of and version a fundamental and essential difference between GIMP on one hand and major commercial software like Photoshop and Serif Affinity Photo on the other is that very few of GIMP s editing operations occur as non destructive edits unlike the main commercial software br br br Color br There are several ways of selecting colors including palettes color choosers and using an eyedropper tool to select a color on the canvas The built in color choosers include RGB HSV LAB LCH selector or scales water color selector CMYK selector and a color wheel selector Colors can also be selected using hexadecimal color codes as used in HTML color selection GIMP has native support for indexed color and RGB color spaces other color spaces are supported using decomposition where each channel of the new color space becomes a black and white image CMYK LAB and HSV hue saturation value are supported this way Color blending can be achieved using the Blend tool by applying a gradient to the surface of an image and using GIMP s color modes Gradients are also integrated into tools such as the brush tool when the user paints this way the output color slowly changes There are a number of default gradients included with GIMP a user can also create custom gradients with tools provided Gradient plug ins are also available br br br Selections and paths br GIMP selection tools include a rectangular and circular selection tool free select tool and fuzzy select tool also known as magic wand More advanced selection tools include the select by color tool for selecting contiguous regions of color and the scissors select tool which creates selections semi automatically between areas of highly contrasting colors GIMP also supports a quick mask mode where a user can use a brush to paint the area of a selection Visibly this looks like a red colored overlay being added or removed The foreground select tool is an implementation of Simple interactive object extraction SIOX a method used to perform the extraction of foreground elements such as a person or a tree in focus The Paths Tool allows a user to create vectors also known as B zier curves Users can use paths to create complex selections including around natural curves They can paint or stroke the paths with brushes patterns or various line styles Users can name and save paths for reuse br br br Image editing br There are many tools that can be used for editing images in GIMP The more common tools include a paint brush pencil airbrush eraser and ink tools used to create new or blended pixels The Bucket Fill tool can be used to fill a selection with a color or pattern The Blend tool can be used to fill a selection with a color gradient These color transitions can be applied to large regions or smaller custom path selections br GIMP also provides smart tools that use a more complex algorithm to do things that otherwise would be time consuming or impossible These include br br Clone tool which copies pixels using a brush br Healing brush which copies pixels from an area and corrects tone and color br Perspective clone tool which works like the clone tool but corrects for distance changes br Blur and sharpen tools br The Smudge tool can be used to subtly smear a selection where it stands br Dodge and burn tool is a brush that makes target pixels lighter dodges or darker burns br br br Layers layer masks and channels br An image being edited in GIMP can consist of many layers in a stack The user manual suggests that A good way to visualize a GIMP image is as a stack of transparencies where in GIMP terminology each level analogous to a transparency is called a layer Each layer in an image is made up of several channels In an RGB image there are normally or channels each consisting of a red green and blue channel Color sublayers look like slightly different gray images but when put together they make a complete image The fourth channel that may be part of a layer is the alpha channel or layer mask This channel measures opacity where a whole or part of an image can be completely visible partially visible or invisible Each layer has a layer mode that can be set to change the colors in the image br Text layers can be created using the text tool allowing a user to write on an image Text layers can be transformed in several ways such as converting them to a path or selection br br br Automation scripts and plug ins br GIMP has approximately standard effects and filters including Drop Shadow Blur Motion Blur and Noise br GIMP operations can be automated with scripting languages The Script Fu is a Scheme based language implemented using a TinyScheme interpreter built into GIMP GIMP can also be scripted in Perl Python Python Fu or Tcl using interpreters external to GIMP New features can be added to GIMP not only by changing program code GIMP core but also by creating plug ins These are external programs that are executed and controlled by the main GIMP program MathMap is an example of a plug in written in C br There is support for several methods of sharpening and blurring images including the blur and sharpen tool The unsharp mask tool is used to sharpen an image selectively it sharpens only those areas of an image that are sufficiently detailed The Unsharp Mask tool is considered to give more targeted results for photographs than a normal sharpening filter The Selective Gaussian Blur tool works in a similar way except it blurs areas of an image with little detail br GIMP ML is an extension for machine learning with filters br br br GEGL br The Generic Graphics Library GEGL was first introduced as part of GIMP on the release of GIMP This initial introduction does not yet exploit all of the capabilities of GEGL as of the release GIMP can use GEGL to perform high bit depth color operations because of this less information is lost when performing color operations When GEGL is fully integrated GIMP will have a higher color bit depth and better non destructive work flow GIMP xx supports only bit color which is much lower than digital cameras e g produce bit or higher Full support for high bit depth is included with GIMP OpenCL enables hardware acceleration for some operations br br br CTX br CTX is a new rasterizer for vector graphics in GIMP Some simple objects like lines and circles can be reduced to vector objects br br br File formats br GIMP supports importing and exporting with a large number of different file formats GIMP s native format XCF is designed to store all information GIMP can contain about an image XCF is named after the eXperimental Computing Facility where GIMP was authored Import and export capability can be extended to additional file formats by means of plug ins XCF file size is extended to more than GB since and new stable tree x br br br Forks and derivatives br Because of the free and open source nature of GIMP several forks variants and derivatives of the computer program have been created to fit the needs of their creators While GIMP is cross platform variants of GIMP may not be These variants are neither hosted nor linked on the GIMP site The GIMP site does not host GIMP builds for Windows or Unix like operating systems either although it does include a link to a Windows build br br br Forks br CinePaint Formerly Film Gimp it is a fork of GIMP version used for frame by frame retouching of feature film CinePaint supports up to bit IEEE floating point color depth per channel as well as color management and HDR CinePaint is used primarily within the film industry due mainly to its support of high fidelity image formats It is available for BSD Linux and macOS br GIMP classic A patch against GIMP v source code created to undo changes made to the user interface in GIMP v through v A build of GIMP classic for Ubuntu is available As of March a new patch could be downloaded that patches against the experimental GIMP v br GIMP Portable A portable version of GIMP for Microsoft Windows XP or later that preserves brushes and presets between computers br GIMPshop Derivative that aimed to replicate the Adobe Photoshop in some form Development of GIMPshop was halted in and the project disavowed by the developer Scott Moschella after an unrelated party registered GIMPshop as part of an Internet domain name and passed off the website as belonging to Moschella while accepting donations and making revenue from advertising but passing on none of the income to Moschella br GimPhoto GimPhoto follows the Photoshop UI tradition of GIMPshop More modifications are possible with the GimPad tool GimPhoto stands at version for Linux and Windows based on GIMP v and version on macOS based on GIMP v Installers are included for Windows and macOS Ubuntu and Fedora as well as source code Only one developer is at work in this project so fast updates and new versions based on Gimp x or x are not planned br McGimp An independent port for macOS that is aim to run GIMP directly on this platform and integrated multiple plug ins intended to optimize photos br Seashore easier to use image editing application for macOS br Glimpse a discontinued fork of GIMP that was started because the word gimp is also a derogatory word for disabled people br br br Extensions br br GIMP s functionality can be extended with plugins Notable ones include br br GIMP ML which provides machine learning based image enhancement GIMP ML with python is next target in development br GIMP Animation Package GAP official plugin for creating animations GAP can save animations in several formats including GIF and AVI br Resynthesizer which provides content aware fill Original part of Paul Harrison s PhD thesis now maintained by Lloyd
