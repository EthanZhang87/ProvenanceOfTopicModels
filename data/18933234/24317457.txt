Org Mode also org mode is a mode for document editing formatting and organizing within the free software text editor GNU Emacs and its derivatives designed for notes planning and authoring The name is used to encompass plain text files org files that include simple marks to indicate levels of a hierarchy such as the outline of an essay a topic list with subtopics nested computer code etc and an editor with functions that can read the markup and manipulate hierarchy elements expand hide elements move blocks of elements check off to do list items etc br Org Mode was created by Carsten Dominik in originally to organize his own life and work and since the first release numerous other users and developers have contributed to this free software package Emacs has included Org Mode as a major mode by default since Bastien Guerry is the current maintainer in cooperation with an active development community Since its success in Emacs some other systems now provide functions to work with org files br Almost orthogonally Org Mode has functionalities aimed at executing code in various external languages these functionalities form org babel br br br System br The Org Mode home page explains that at its core Org Mode is a simple outliner for note taking and list management The Org system author Carsten Dominik explains that Org Mode does outlining note taking hyperlinks spreadsheets TODO lists project planning GTD HTML and LaTeX authoring all with plain text files in Emacs br The Org system is based on plain text files with a simple markup which makes the files very portable The Linux Information Project explains that Plain text is supported by nearly every application program on every operating system br The system includes a lightweight markup language for plain text files similar in function to Markdown reStructuredText Textile etc with a different implementation allowing lines or sections of plain text to be hierarchically divided tagged linked and so on br br br Functionality br This section gives some sample uses for the hierarchical display and editing of plain text br br To do lists often have subtasks and so lend themselves to a hierarchical system Org Mode facilitates this by allowing items to be subdivided into simple steps nested to dos and or checklists and given tags and properties such as priorities and deadlines An agenda for the items to be done this week or day can then be automatically generated from date tags br Plain text outlines br br Org files as interconnected pages of a personal wiki using the markup for links br Tracking bugs in a project by storing org files in a distributed revision control system such as Git br Extensive linking features within the same file to other files to web pages to emails and also allows defining custom links br An org mode document can also be exported to various formats including HTML LaTeX OpenDocument or plain text these formats being used to render the structural outline in an appropriate fashion including cross references if needed It can also use formatting markup including LaTeX for mathematics with facilities similar to those present in Markdown or LaTeX thus offering an alternative to these tools br br br Org babel br br Org Mode offers the ability to insert source code in the document being edited which is automatically exported and or executed when exporting the document the result s produced by this code can be automatically fetched back in the resulting output br This source code can be structured as reusable snippets inserted in the source document at the place needed for logical exposition thus allowing this exposition to be independent of the structure needed by the compiler interpreter br Together with the markup facilities of org mode these two functionalities allow for br br Literate programming by decoupling the exposition of the functions of a program from its code structure and br Reproducible research by the creation of a consistent document consolidating exposition original data analyses discussion and conclusion in a way that can be reproduced by any reader using the same software tools br As of June org babel directly supports more than programming languages or programmable facilities more than other tools being usable via contributed packages or drivers br br br Integration br Org Mode has some features to export to other formats and other systems have some features to handle org mode formats Further a full featured text editor may have functions to handle wikis personal contacts email calendars and so on because org mode is simply plain text these features could be integrated into org mode documents as well br From org mode add on packages export to other markup format such as MediaWiki org export generic org export to flashcard learning systems implementing SuperMemo s algorithms org drill org learn br Outside of org mode editors org markup is supported by the GitLab GitHub and Gitea code repositories the JIRA issue tracker Pandoc and others br br br Export examples br Org supports exporting to a variety of formats Below you may find examples of Org fragments exported to a number of formats br Other formats are supported by dedicated packages br br br See also br Lightweight markup language br Comparison of notetaking software br Comparison of document markup languages br List of personal
