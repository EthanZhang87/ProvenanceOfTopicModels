The space cadet keyboard is a keyboard designed by John L Kulp in and used on Lisp machines at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT which inspired several still current jargon terms in the field of computer science and influenced the design of Emacs It was inspired by the Knight keyboard which was developed for the Knight TV system used with MIT s Incompatible Timesharing System br br br Description br The space cadet keyboard was equipped with seven modifier keys four keys for bucky bits Control Meta Super and Hyper and three shift keys called Shift Top and Front which was labeled on the front of the key the top was labeled Greek Meta had been introduced on the earlier Knight keyboard while Hyper and Super were introduced by this keyboard Each group was in a row thus allowing easy chording or pressing of several modifier keys for example Control Meta Hyper Super could be pressed with the fingers of one hand while the other hand pressed another key br Many keys had three symbols on them accessible by means of the shift keys a letter and a symbol on the top and a Greek letter on the front For example the G key had a G and an up arrow on the top and the Greek letter gamma on the front By pressing this key with one hand while playing an appropriate chord with the other hand on the shift keys the user could get the following results br br Each of these might in addition be typed with any combination of the Control Meta Super and Hyper keys By combining the modifier keys it is possible to make keys shift types bucky keys different inputs This allowed the user to type very complicated mathematical text and also to have thousands of single character commands at their disposal Many users were willing to memorise the command meanings of so many characters if it reduced typing time This attitude shaped the interface of Emacs compare the use of the Esc key in vi due to the convenient position of the key on the ADM A terminal Other users however thought that so many keys were excessive and objected to this design on the grounds that such a keyboard can be difficult to operate Emacs uses M as the prefix for Alt when describing key presses the M stood for Meta on the space cadet keyboard and when Emacs was ported to PCs the Alt key was used in place of Meta br This keyboard included a Macro key which had limited application support It also included four Roman Numeral keys I II III and IV which allowed for easy interaction with lists of four or fewer choices br br br See also br Lisp machine br Symbolics br Knight keyboard br br br br br br External links br Space Cadet Mike McMahon s discussion of the keyboard with illustrative pictures and technical documentation br Jargon File entry on the space cadet keyboard br The Lisp keyboards overview of the space cadet and other famous Lisp keyboards br Xah Lee Space cadet Keyboard and Lisp Machine Keyboards
