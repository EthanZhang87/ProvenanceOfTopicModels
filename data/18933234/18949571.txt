OpenBSD is a security focused free and open source Unix like operating system based on the Berkeley Software Distribution BSD Theo de Raadt created OpenBSD in by forking NetBSD The OpenBSD project emphasizes portability standardization correctness proactive security and integrated cryptography br The OpenBSD project maintains portable versions of many subsystems as packages for other operating systems Because of the project s preferred BSD license which allows binary redistributions without the source code many components are reused in proprietary and corporate sponsored software projects The firewall code in Apple s macOS is based on OpenBSD s PF firewall code Android s Bionic C standard library is based on OpenBSD code LLVM uses OpenBSD s regular expression library and Windows uses OpenSSH OpenBSD Secure Shell with LibreSSL br The word open in the name OpenBSD refers to the availability of the operating system source code on the Internet although the word open in the name OpenSSH means OpenBSD It also refers to the wide range of hardware platforms the system supports OpenBSD supports a variety of system architectures including x IA ARM PowerPC and bit RISC V br br br History br In December Theo de Raadt a founding member of the NetBSD project was asked to resign from the NetBSD core team over disagreements and conflicts with the other members of the NetBSD team In October De Raadt founded OpenBSD a new project forked from NetBSD The initial release OpenBSD was made in July followed by OpenBSD in October of the same year Since then the project has issued a release every six months each of which is supported for one year br On July OpenBSD developer Bob Beck announced the formation of the OpenBSD Foundation a Canadian non profit organization formed to act as a single point of contact for persons and organizations requiring a legal entity to deal with when they wish to support OpenBSD br br br Usage statistics br br It is hard to determine how widely OpenBSD is used because the developers do not publish or collect usage statistics br In September the BSD Certification Group surveyed individual BSD users showing that used OpenBSD behind FreeBSD with ahead of NetBSD with and DragonFly BSD with However the authors of this survey clarified that it is neither exhaustive nor completely accurate since the survey was spread mainly through mailing lists forums and word of mouth This combined with other factors like the lack of a control group a pre screening process or significant outreach outside of the BSD community makes the survey unreliable for judging BSD usage globally br br br Uses br br br Network appliances br OpenBSD features a robust TCP IP networking stack and can be used as a router or wireless access point OpenBSD s security enhancements built in cryptography and packet filter make it suitable for security purposes such as firewalls intrusion detection systems and VPN gateways br Several proprietary systems are based on OpenBSD including devices from Armorlogic Profense web application firewall Calyptix Security GeNUA RTMX and vantronix br br br Other operating systems br Some versions of Microsoft s Services for UNIX an extension to the Windows operating system to provide Unix like functionality use much of the OpenBSD code base that is included in the Interix interoperability suite developed by Softway Systems Inc which Microsoft acquired in Core Force a security product for Windows is based on OpenBSD s pf firewall The pf firewall is also found in other operating systems including FreeBSD and macOS br br br Personal computers br OpenBSD ships with Xenocara an implementation of the X Window System and is suitable as a desktop operating system for personal computers including laptops xl As of September OpenBSD includes approximately packages in its software repository including desktop environments such as Lumina GNOME KDE Plasma and Xfce and web browsers such as Firefox and Chromium The project also includes three window managers in the main distribution cwm FVWM part of the default configuration for Xenocara and twm br br br Servers br OpenBSD features a full server suite and can be configured as a mail server web server FTP server DNS server router firewall NFS file server or any combination of these Since version OpenBSD has also shipped with native in kernel WireGuard support br br br Security br br Shortly after OpenBSD was created De Raadt was contacted by a local security software company named Secure Networks later acquired by McAfee The company was developing a network security auditing tool called Ballista which was intended to find and exploit software security flaws This coincided with De Raadt s interest in security so the two cooperated leading up to the release of OpenBSD This collaboration helped to define security as the focus of the OpenBSD project br OpenBSD includes numerous features designed to improve security such as br br Secure alternatives to POSIX functions in the C standard library such as strlcat for strcat and strlcpy for strcpy br Toolchain alterations including a static bounds checker br Memory protection techniques to guard against invalid accesses such as ProPolice and the W X page protection feature br Strong cryptography and randomization br System call and filesystem access restrictions to limit process capabilities br To reduce the risk of a vulnerability or misconfiguration allowing privilege escalation many programs have been written or adapted to make use of privilege separation privilege revocation and chrooting Privilege separation is a technique pioneered on OpenBSD and inspired by the principle of least privilege where a program is split into two or more parts one of which performs privileged operations and the other almost always the bulk of the code runs without privilege Privilege revocation is similar and involves a program performing any necessary operations with the privileges it starts with then dropping them Chrooting involves restricting an application to one section of the file system prohibiting it from accessing areas that contain private or system files Developers have applied these enhancements to OpenBSD versions of many common applications such as tcpdump file tmux smtpd and syslogd br OpenBSD developers were instrumental in the creation and development of OpenSSH aka OpenBSD Secure Shell which is developed in the OpenBSD CVS repositories OpenBSD Secure Shell is based on the original SSH It first appeared in OpenBSD and is now by far the most popular SSH client and server available on many operating systems br The project has a policy of continually auditing source code for problems work that developer Marc Espie has described as never finished more a question of process than of a specific bug being hunted He went on to list several typical steps once a bug is found including examining the entire source tree for the same and similar issues try ing to find out whether the documentation ought to be amended and investigating whether it s possible to augment the compiler to warn against this specific problem br br br Security record br The OpenBSD website features a prominent reference to the system s security record Until June it read br br Five years without a remote hole in the default install br In June Mark Dowd of Internet Security Systems disclosed a bug in the OpenSSH code implementing challenge response authentication This vulnerability in the OpenBSD default installation allowed an attacker remote access to the root account which was extremely serious not only to OpenBSD but also to the large number of other operating systems that were using OpenSSH by that time This problem necessitated the adjustment of the slogan on the OpenBSD website to br br One remote hole in the default install in nearly years br The quote remained unchanged as time passed until on March when Alfredo Ortega of Core Security Technologies disclosed a network related remote vulnerability The quote was subsequently changed to br br Only two remote holes in the default install in a heck of a long time br This statement has been criticized because the default install contains few running services and many use cases require additional services Also because the ports tree contains unaudited third party software it is easy for users to compromise security by installing or improperly configuring packages However the project maintains that the slogan is intended to refer to a default install and that it is correct by that measure br One of the fundamental ideas behind OpenBSD is a drive for systems to be simple clean and secure by default The default install is quite minimal which the project states is to ensure novice users do not need to become security experts overnight which fits with open source and code auditing practices considered important elements of a security system Additional services are to be enabled manually to make users think of the security implications first br br br Alleged backdoor br On December Gregory Perry a former technical consultant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI emailed De Raadt alleging that the FBI had paid some OpenBSD ex developers years prior to insert backdoors into the OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework De Raadt made the email public on December by forwarding it to the openbsd tech mailing list and suggested an audit of the IPsec codebase De Raadt s response was skeptical of the report and he invited all developers to independently review the relevant code In the weeks that followed bugs were fixed but no evidence of backdoors was found De Raadt stated I believe that NetSec was probably contracted to write backdoors as alleged If those were written I don t believe they made it into our tree They might have been deployed as their own product br br br Criticisms br In December Ilja van Sprundel director at IOActive gave a talk at the CCC as well as DEF CON entitled Are all BSDs created equally A survey of BSD kernel vulnerabilities in which he stated that although OpenBSD was the clear winner of the BSDs in terms of security Bugs are still easy to find in those kernels even in OpenBSD br Two years later in a talk named A systematic evaluation of OpenBSD s mitigations was given at the CCC arguing that while OpenBSD has some effective mitigations a significant part of them are useless at best and based on pure luck and superstition arguing for a more rational approach when it comes to designing them br br br Subprojects br Many open source projects started as components of OpenBSD including br br Some subsystems have been integrated into other BSD operating systems and many are available as packages for use in other Unix like systems br Linux administrator Carlos Fenollosa commented on moving from Linux to OpenBSD that the system is faithful to the Unix philosophy of small simple tools that work together well Some base components are not as feature rich on purpose Since of the servers don t need the flexibility of Apache OpenBSD s httpd will work fine be more secure and probably faster He characterized the developer community s attitude to components as When the community decides that some module sucks they develop a new one from scratch OpenBSD has its own NTPd SMTPd and more recently HTTPd They work great As a result OpenBSD is relatively prolific in creating components that become widely reused by other systems br OpenBSD runs nearly all of its standard daemons within chroot and privsep security structures by default as part of hardening the base system br The Calgary Internet Exchange was formed in in part to serve the needs of the OpenBSD project br In Isotop a French project aiming to adapt OpenBSD to desktops and laptops using xfce then dwm started to be developed br br br Third party components br OpenBSD includes a number of third party components many with OpenBSD specific patches such as X Org Clang the default compiler on several architectures GCC Perl NSD Unbound ncurses GNU binutils GDB and AWK br br br Development br br Development is continuous and team management is open and tiered Anyone with appropriate skills may contribute with commit rights being awarded on merit and De Raadt acting as coordinator xxxv Two official releases are made per year with the version number incremented by and these are each supported for twelve months two release cycles Snapshot releases are also available at frequent intervals br Maintenance patches for supported releases may be applied using syspatch manually or by updating the system against the patch branch of the CVS source repository for that release Alternatively a system administrator may opt to upgrade to the next snapshot release using sysupgrade or by using the current branch of the CVS repository in order to gain pre release access to recently added features The sysupgrade tool can also upgrade to the latest stable release version br The generic OpenBSD kernel provided by default is strongly recommended for end users in contrast to operating systems that recommend user kernel customization br Packages outside the base system are maintained by CVS through a ports tree and are the responsibility of the individual maintainers known as porters As well as keeping the current branch up to date porters are expected to apply appropriate bug fixes and maintenance fixes to branches of their package for OpenBSD s supported releases Ports are generally not subject to the same continuous auditing as the base system due to lack of manpower br Binary packages are built centrally from the ports tree for each architecture This process is applied for the current version for each supported release and for each snapshot Administrators are recommended to use the package mechanism rather than build the package from the ports tree unless they need to perform their own source changes br OpenBSD s developers regularly meet at special events called hackathons where they sit down and code emphasizing productivity br Most new releases include a song br br br Open source and open documentation br OpenBSD is known for its high quality documentation br When OpenBSD was created De Raadt decided that the source code should be available for anyone to read At the time a small team of developers generally had access to a project s source code Chuck Cranor and De Raadt concluded this practice was counter to the open source philosophy and inconvenient to potential contributors Together Cranor and De Raadt set up the first public anonymous revision control system server De Raadt s decision allowed users to take a more active role and established the project s commitment to open access OpenBSD is notable for its continued use of CVS more precisely an unreleased OpenBSD managed fork named OpenCVS when most other projects that used it have migrated to other systems br OpenBSD does not include closed source binary drivers in the source tree nor does it include code requiring the signing of non disclosure agreements According to the GNU Project OpenBSD includes small blobs of proprietary object code as device firmware br Since OpenBSD is based in Canada no United States export restrictions on cryptography apply allowing the distribution to make full use of modern algorithms for encryption For example the swap space is divided into small sections and each section is encrypted with its own key ensuring that sensitive data does not leak into an insecure part of the system br OpenBSD randomizes various behaviors of applications making them less predictable and thus more difficult to attack For example PIDs are created and associated randomly to processes the bind system call uses random port numbers files are created with random inode numbers and IP datagrams have random identifiers This approach also helps expose bugs in the kernel and in user space programs br The OpenBSD policy on openness extends to hardware documentation in the slides for a December presentation De Raadt explained that without it developers often make mistakes writing drivers and pointed out that the oh my god I got it to work rush is harder to achieve and some developers just give up He went on to say that vendor supplied binary drivers are unacceptable for inclusion in OpenBSD that they have no trust of vendor binaries running in our kernel and that there is no way to fix them when they break br br br Licensing br br OpenBSD maintains a strict license policy preferring the ISC license and other variants of the BSD license The project attempts to maintain the spirit of the original Berkeley Unix copyrights which permitted a relatively un encumbered Unix source distribution The widely used Apache License and GNU General Public License are considered overly restrictive br In June triggered by concerns over Darren Reed s modification of IPFilter s license wording a systematic license audit of the OpenBSD ports and source trees was undertaken Code in more than a hundred files throughout the system was found to be unlicensed ambiguously licensed or in use against the terms of the license To ensure that all licenses were properly adhered to an attempt was made to contact all the relevant copyright holders some pieces of code were removed many were replaced and others such as the multicast routing tools mrinfo and map mbone were relicensed so that OpenBSD could continue to use them Also removed during this audit was all software produced by Daniel J Bernstein At the time Bernstein requested that all modified versions of his code be approved by him prior to redistribution a requirement to which OpenBSD developers were unwilling to devote time or effort br Because of licensing concerns the OpenBSD team has reimplemented software from scratch or adopted suitable existing software For example OpenBSD developers created the PF packet filter after unacceptable restrictions were imposed on IPFilter PF first appeared in OpenBSD and is now available in many other operating systems OpenBSD developers have also replaced GPL licensed tools such as CVS and pkg config with permissively licensed equivalents br br br Funding br Although the operating system and its portable components are used in commercial products De Raadt says that little of the funding for the project comes from the industry traditionally all our funding has come from user donations and users buying our CDs our other products don t really make us much money Obviously that has not been a lot of money br For a two year period in the early s the project received funding from DARPA which paid the salaries of people to work completely full time bought about k in hardware and paid for hackathons from the POSSE project br In the OpenBSD project experienced financial difficulties The Mozilla Foundation and GoDaddy are among the organizations that helped OpenBSD to survive However De Raadt expressed concern about the asymmetry of funding I think that contributions should have come first from the vendors secondly from the corporate users and thirdly from individual users But the response has been almost entirely the opposite with almost a to dollar ratio in favor of the little people Thanks a lot little people br On January Bob Beck issued a request for funding to cover electrical costs If sustainable funding was not found Beck suggested the OpenBSD project would shut down The project soon received a US donation from Mircea Popescu the Romanian creator of the MPEx bitcoin stock exchange paid in bitcoins The project raised US in response to the appeal enabling it to pay its bills and securing its short term future br br br OpenBSD Foundation br br The OpenBSD Foundation is a Canadian federal non profit organization founded by the OpenBSD project as a single point of contact for persons and organizations requiring a legal entity to deal with when they wish to support OpenBSD It was announced to the public by OpenBSD developer Bob Beck on July It also serves as a legal safeguard over other projects which are affiliated with OpenBSD including OpenSSH OpenBGPD OpenNTPD OpenCVS OpenSMTPD and LibreSSL br Since several large contributions to the OpenBSD Foundation have come from corporations such as Microsoft Facebook and Google as well as the Core Infrastructure Initiative br In Microsoft became the foundation s first gold level contributor donating between to support development of OpenSSH which had been integrated into PowerShell in July and later into Windows Server in Other contributors include Google Facebook and DuckDuckGo br During the and fundraising campaigns Smartisan a Chinese company was the leading financial contributor to the OpenBSD Foundation br br br Distribution br OpenBSD is freely available in various ways the source can be retrieved by anonymous CVS and binary releases and development snapshots can be downloaded by FTP HTTP and rsync Prepackaged CD ROM sets through version can be ordered online for a small fee complete with an assortment of stickers and a copy of the release s theme song These with their artwork and other bonuses have been one of the project s few sources of income funding hardware Internet service and other expenses Beginning with version CD ROM sets are no longer released br OpenBSD provides a package management system for easy installation and management of programs which are not part of the base operating system Packages are binary files which are extracted managed and removed using the package tools On OpenBSD the source of packages is the ports system a collection of Makefiles and other infrastructure required to create packages In OpenBSD the ports and base operating system are developed and released together for each version this means that the ports or packages released with for example are not suitable for use with and vice versa br br br Songs and artwork br br Initially OpenBSD used a haloed version of the BSD daemon mascot drawn by Erick Green who was asked by De Raadt to create the logo for the and versions of OpenBSD Green planned to create a full daemon including head and body but only the head was completed in time for OpenBSD The body as well as pitchfork and tail was completed for OpenBSD br Subsequent releases used variations such as a police daemon by Ty Semaka but eventually settled on a pufferfish named Puffy Since then Puffy has appeared on OpenBSD promotional material and featured in release songs and artwork br The promotional material of early OpenBSD releases did not have a cohesive theme or design but later the CD ROMs release songs posters and tee shirts for each release have been produced with a single style and theme sometimes contributed to by Ty Semaka of the Plaid Tongued Devils These have become a part of OpenBSD advocacy with each release expounding a moral or political point important to the project often through parody br Themes have included Puff the Barbarian in OpenBSD which included an s rock song and parody of Conan the Barbarian alluding to open documentation The Wizard of OS in OpenBSD related to the project s work on wireless drivers and Hackers of the Lost RAID a parody of Indiana Jones referencing the new RAID tools in OpenBSD br br br Releases br The following table summarizes the
