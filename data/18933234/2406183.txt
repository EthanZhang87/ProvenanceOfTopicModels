title: Data buffer
id: 2406183
In computer science a data buffer or just buffer is a region of memory used to store data temporarily while it is being moved from one place to another Typically the data is stored in a buffer as it is retrieved from an input device such as a microphone or just before it is sent to an output device such as speakers however a buffer may be used when data is moved between processes within a computer comparable to buffers in telecommunication Buffers can be implemented in a fixed memory location in hardware or by using a virtual data buffer in software that points at a location in the physical memory br In all cases the data stored in a data buffer is stored on a physical storage medium The majority of buffers are implemented in software which typically use RAM to store temporary data because of its much faster access time when compared with hard disk drives Buffers are typically used when there is a difference between the rate at which data is received and the rate at which it can be processed or in the case that these rates are variable for example in a printer spooler or in online video streaming In a distributed computing environment data buffers are often implemented in the form of burst buffers which provides distributed buffering services br A buffer often adjusts timing by implementing a queue or FIFO algorithm in memory simultaneously writing data into the queue at one rate and reading it at another rate br br br Applications br Buffers are often used in conjunction with I O to hardware such as disk drives sending or receiving data to or from a network or playing sound on a speaker A line to a rollercoaster in an amusement park shares many similarities People who ride the coaster come in at an unknown and often variable pace but the roller coaster will be able to load people in bursts as a coaster arrives and is loaded The queue area acts as a buffer a temporary space where those wishing to ride wait until the ride is available Buffers are usually used in a FIFO first in first out method outputting data in the order it arrived br Buffers can increase application performance by allowing synchronous operations such as file reads or writes to complete quickly instead of blocking while waiting for hardware interrupts to access a physical disk subsystem instead an operating system can immediately return a successful result from an API call allowing an application to continue processing while the kernel completes the disk operation in the background Further benefits can be achieved if the application is reading or writing small blocks of data that do not correspond to the block size of the disk subsystem which allows a buffer to be used to aggregate many smaller read or write operations into block sizes that are more efficient for the disk subsystem or in the case of a read sometimes to completely avoid having to physically access a disk br br br Telecommunication buffer br A buffer routine or storage medium used in telecommunications compensates for a difference in rate of flow of data or time of occurrence of events when data is transferred from one device to another br Buffers are used for many purposes including br br Interconnecting two digital circuits operating at different rates br Holding data for later use br Allowing timing corrections to be made on a data stream br Collecting binary data bits into groups that can then be operated on as a unit br Delaying the transit time of a signal in order to allow other operations to occur br br br Examples br The BUFFERS command statement in CONFIG SYS of DOS br The buffer between a serial port UART and a modem The COM port speed may be bit s while the modem may have only a bit s carrier br The integrated disk buffer on a hard disk drive solid state drive or BD DVD CD drive br The integrated SRAM buffer on an Ethernet adapter br The framebuffer on a video card br br br History br An early mention of a print buffer is the Outscriber devised by image processing pioneer Russel A Kirsch for the SEAC computer in br br One of the most important br problems in the design of automatic digital computers is that of getting the calculated results out of the machine rapidly enough to avoid delaying the further progress of the calculations In many of the problems to which a general purpose computer is applied the amount of output data is relatively big so big that serious inefficiency would result from forcing the computer to wait for these data to be typed on existing printing devices This difficulty has been solved in the SEAC by providing magnetic recording devices as output units These devices are able to receive information from the machine at rates up to times as fast as an electric typewriter can be operated Thus better efficiency is achieved in recording the output data transcription can be made later from the magnetic recording device to a printing device without tying up the main computer br br br See also br
