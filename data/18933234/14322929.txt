The GNU Affero General Public License GNU AGPL is a free copyleft license published by the Free Software Foundation in November and based on the GNU GPL version and the Affero General Public License non GNU br It is intended for software designed to be run over a network adding a provision requiring that the corresponding source code of modified versions of the software be prominently offered to all users who interact with the software over a network br The Open Source Initiative approved the GNU AGPLv as an open source license in March after the company Funambol submitted it for consideration through its CEO Fabrizio Capobianco br br br History br In while developing an e learning and e service business model Henry Poole met with Richard Stallman in Amsterdam and discussed the issue of the GPLv license not requiring Web application providers to share source code with the users interacting with their software over a network Over the following months Stallman and Poole discussed approaches to solve the problem In Poole founded Affero Inc a web services business and he needed a license that would require distribution by other organizations who used Affero code to create derivative web services At that time Poole contacted Bradley M Kuhn and Eben Moglen of the Free Software Foundation to get advice on a new license that would resolve this matter in GPLv br Around late February Kuhn suggested based on the idea of a quine a program that prints its own source code that GPLv be supplemented with a section d that would require derivative works to maintain a download source feature that would provide complete and corresponding source code Kuhn argued that there was precedent for such a requirement in GPLv section c which required preserving certain features by downstream distributors and modifiers br Moglen and Kuhn wrote the text of the proposed new section d and provided it to Poole who then requested and received permission from the FSF to publish a derivative of GPLv for this purpose In March Affero Inc published the original Affero General Public License AGPLv for use with the Affero project and made the new license available for use by other software as a service developers br The FSF contemplated including the special provision of AGPLv into GPLv but ultimately decided to publish a separate license nearly identical to GPLv but containing a provision similar in purpose and effect to section d of AGPLv The new license was named the GNU Affero General Public License Retaining the Affero name indicated its close historic relationship with AGPLv The GNU AGPL was given version number for parity with the GPL and the current GNU Affero General Public License is often abbreviated AGPLv br The finalized version of GNU AGPLv was published by the FSF on November br br br Compatibility with the GPL br Both versions of the AGPL like the corresponding versions of the GNU GPL on which they are based are strong copyleft licenses In the Free Software Foundation s judgment the added requirement in section d of Affero GPL v made it incompatible with the otherwise nearly identical GPLv That is to say one cannot distribute a single work formed by combining components covered by each license br By contrast the GPLv and GNU AGPLv licenses include clauses in section of each license that together achieve a form of mutual compatibility for the two licenses These clauses explicitly allow the conveying of a work formed by linking code licensed under the one license against code licensed under the other license despite the licenses otherwise not allowing relicensing under the terms of each other In this way the copyleft of each license is relaxed to allow distributing such combinations br To establish an upgrade path from Affero s original AGPLv to the GNU AGPLv Affero Inc published the Affero General Public License version in November which is merely a transitional license that allows recipients of software licensed under AGPLv or any later version as published by Affero Inc to distribute the software or derivative works under the GNU AGPLv or any later version br br br Examples of applications under GNU AGPL br Stet was the first software system known to be released under the GNU AGPL on November and is the only known program to be used mainly for the production of its own license br Flask developer Armin Ronacher noted in that the GNU AGPL is a terrible success especially among the startup community as a vehicle for dual commercial licensing and gave HumHub MongoDB Odoo RethinkDB Shinken Slic r SugarCRM and WURFL as examples br MongoDB dropped the AGPL in late in favor of the Server Side Public License SSPL a modified version which requires those who offer the licensed software as a service accessible to third parties to make the entire source code of all software used to facilitate the service including without limitation all management software user interfaces application program interfaces automation software monitoring software backup software storage software and hosting software all such that a user could run an instance of the service using the Service Source Code you make available available under the same license As approval for this license by the Open Source Initiative was not forthcoming the application for certification was withdrawn It was banned by both Debian and the Fedora Project who state that the license s intent is to discriminate against cloud computing providers offering services based on the software without purchasing its commercial license br Software continues to be released under AGPLv recent examples include the reference implementation of the Mastodon social network and protocol libraries as well as other fediverse clients as Pixelfed and PeerTube Web Office Suite software OnlyOffice data analysis IDE RStudio Grafana and more br br br See also br br br br br br External links br Official website for
