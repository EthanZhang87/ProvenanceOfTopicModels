WordStar is a word processor application for microcomputers It was published by MicroPro International and originally written for the CP M operating system with later editions added for MS DOS and other bit PC OSes Rob Barnaby was the sole author of the early versions of the program br Starting with WordStar the program was built on new code written principally by Peter Mierau WordStar dominated the market in the early and mid s succeeding the market leader Electric Pencil br WordStar was written with as few assumptions as possible about the operating system and machine hardware allowing it to be easily ported across the many platforms that proliferated in the early s Because all of these versions had relatively similar commands and controls users could move between platforms with equal ease It was already popular when its inclusion with the Osborne portable computer made the program the de facto standard for much of the small computer word processing market br As the market became dominated by the IBM PC and later Microsoft Windows this same portable design made it difficult for the program to add new features and affected its performance In spite of its great popularity in the early s these problems allowed WordPerfect to take WordStar s place as the most widely used word processor from on br br br History br br br Founding br Seymour I Rubinstein was an employee of early microcomputer company IMSAI where he negotiated software contracts with Digital Research and Microsoft After leaving IMSAI Rubinstein planned to start his own software company that would sell through the new network of retail computer stores He founded MicroPro International Corporation in September and hired John Robbins Barnaby as programmer who wrote a word processor WordMaster and a sorting program SuperSort in Intel assembly language After Rubinstein obtained a report that discussed the abilities of contemporary standalone word processors from IBM Xerox and Wang Laboratories Barnaby enhanced WordMaster with similar features and support for the CP M operating system MicroPro began selling the product now renamed WordStar in June Priced at and for the manual by early MicroPro claimed in advertisements that people had purchased WordStar in eight months br br br Early success br WordStar was the first microcomputer word processor to offer mail merge and textual WYSIWYG Besides word wrapping still a notable feature for early microcomputer programs this last was most noticeably implemented as on screen pagination during the editing session Using the number of lines per page given by the user during program installation WordStar would display a full line of dash characters onscreen showing where page breaks would occur during hardcopy printout Many users found this very reassuring during editing knowing beforehand where pages would end and begin and where text would thus be interrupted across pages br Barnaby left the company in March but due to WordStar s sophistication the company s extensive sales and marketing efforts and bundling deals with Osborne and other computer makers MicroPro s sales grew from in to million in fiscal year surpassing earlier market leader Electric Pencil By May BYTE magazine called WordStar without a doubt the best known and probably the most widely used personal computer word processing program The company released WordStar in June the cumulative copies of WordStar for the IBM PC and other computers sold by that fall was more than double that of the second most popular word processor and that year MicroPro had of the personal computer software market By the year it held an initial public offering MicroPro was the world s largest software company with of the word processor market br br A manual that PC Magazine described as incredibly inadequate led many authors to publish replacements One of them Introduction to WordStar was written by future Goldstein Blair founder and Whole Earth Software Catalog contributor Arthur Naiman who hated the program and had a term inserted into his publishing contract that he not be required to use WordStar to write the book using WRITE instead br br br MS DOS br br WordStar the first version for MS DOS appeared in April The DOS version was very similar to the original and although the IBM PC had arrow keys and separate function keys the traditional WordStar diamond and other Ctrl key functions were retained leading to rapid adoption by former CP M users WordStar s ability to use a non document mode to create text files without formatting made it popular among programmers for writing code Like the CP M versions the DOS WordStar was not explicitly designed for IBM PCs but rather for any x machine as there were a number of non IBM compatible PCs that used or CPUs As such it used only DOS s API calls and avoided any BIOS usage or direct hardware access This carried with it an unfortunate performance penalty as everything had to be double processed meaning that the DOS API functions would handle screen or keyboard I O first and then pass them to the BIOS br The first DOS version of WordStar demoed by Jim Fox and executed by a team of Irish programmers in April was a port of the CP M version of WordStar which in turn had been ported from the CP M version in September This had been started by Diane Hajicek and was completed by an Irish team of programmers under ISIS II probably using Intel s source to source translator CONV Thus the main program executable was a COM file which could only access kB of memory Users quickly learned they could make WordStar run dramatically faster by installing a RAM disk board and copying the WordStar program files into it WordStar would still access the disk repeatedly but the far faster access of the RAM drive compared to a floppy disk yielded a substantial speed improvement However edited versions of a document were saved only to this RAM disk and had to be copied to physical media before rebooting br InfoWorld described WordStar as notorious for its complexity but by it was the leading word processing system Although competition appeared early the first version of WordPerfect debuted in and Microsoft Word in WordStar was the dominant word processor on x machines until It was part of the software bundle that accompanied Kaypro computers br At that time the evolution from CP M to MS DOS with an Alt key had taken place WordStar had until then never successfully exploited the MS DOS keyboard and that is one explanation for its demise br By that point MicroPro had dropped the generic MS DOS support and WordStar was exclusively for IBM compatibles which differed from MS DOS compatible programs in terms of screen addressing It was the first version of WordStar supporting directories a feature nearly mandatory to be usable on machines with hard disks Also introduced were simple macros shorthand and the install program was completely updated to include features like reprogramming function keys and an extensive printer support During the second half of the s the fully modernized WordPerfect overtook it in sales br WordStar released in added footnote and endnote capability and a fairly advanced Page preview function Versions and had added features and version released included a complete macro language as well as support for over printers It also featured style sheets and mouse support br br br Problems with piracy br Columnist John Dvorak noted WordStar may have been the most pirated software in the world which in many ways accounted for its success Software companies don t like to admit to this as a possibility Books for WordStar sold like hot cakes and the authors knew they were selling documentation for pirated copies of WordStar The company itself should have just sold the documentation alone to increase sales This was the wink wink nudge nudge aspect of the industry at the time and everyone knew it So when WordStar arrived with a copy protection scheme everyone should have predicted its immediate demise br Besides the ready availability of third party books explaining WordStar in detail the program s extensive and configurable onscreen help facility help text appeared in a resizable window at the top of the screen made it easy to use an illegal copy br br br WordStar br At the time the IBM Displaywriter System dominated the dedicated word processor market IBM s main competition was Wang Laboratories Such machines were expensive and were generally accessed through terminals connected to central mainframe or midrange computers br When IBM announced it was bringing DisplayWrite to the PC MicroPro focused on creating a clone of it which they marketed in as WordStar WordStar supported features such as disk directories but lacked compatibility with the file formats of existing WordStar versions and also made numerous unpopular changes to the interface Gradually competitors such as WordPerfect reduced MicroPro s market share MultiMate in particular used the same key sequences as Wang word processors which made it popular with secretaries switching from those to PCs br BYTE stated that WordStar had all the charm of an elephant on motorized skates warning in that an IBM PC AT with hard drive was highly advisable to run the software which it described as clumsy overdesigned and uninviting I can t come up with a reason why I d want to use it WordStar had a user interface that was substantially different from the original WordStar and the company did little to advertise this However its lasting legacy on the word processing industry was the introduction of three keyboard shortcuts that are still widely used namely Ctrl B for boldfacing Ctrl I for italicizing and Ctrl U for underlining text br br br Newstar br WordStar became popular in large companies without MicroPro The company which did not have a corporate sales program until December developed a poor reputation among customers PC Magazine wrote in that MicroPro s motto often seems to be Ask Your Dealer and in that br br Almost since its birth years ago MicroPro has had a seemingly unshakable reputation for three things arrogant indifference to user feedback MicroPro s classic response to questions about WordStar was Call your dealer possession of one of the more difficult to use word processors on the market and possession of the most powerful word processor available br By late the company admitted according to the magazine that WordStar s reputation for power was fading and by early its sales had decreased for four quarters while those of Multimate and Samna increased Several MicroPro employees meanwhile formed rival company Newstar In September it published WordStar clone NewWord which offered several features the original lacked such as a built in spell checker and support for laser printers Advertisements stated that Anyone with WordStar experience won t even have to read NewWord s manuals WordStar text files work with NewWord Despite competition from NewStar Microsoft Word WordPerfect and dozens of other companies which typically released new versions of their software every to months MicroPro did not release new versions of WordStar beyond during and in part because Rubinstein relinquished control of the company after a January heart attack His replacements canceled the promising office suite Starburst purchased a WordStar clone and used it as the basis of WordStar released in December It received poor reviews by April PC Magazine referred to WordStar as beleaguered due to not being compatible with WordStar files and other disadvantages and by selling at the same price as WordStar confused customers Company employees were divided between WordStar and WordStar factions and fiscal year sales declined to million br By NewWord had released a second version and many WordStar users switched to it A third version appeared in The New York Times wrote that NewWord provides the perfect excuse for WordStar users to switch software as if WordStar users needed an excuse In February MicroPro promised updates to WordStar but none appeared until new management purchased NewWord and used it as the basis of WordStar in four years after the previous version Word four versions from to and WordPerfect five versions however had become the market leaders More conflict between MicroPro s two factions delayed WordStar until late again hurting the program s sales After renaming itself after its flagship product in WordStar International merged with SoftKey in br br br WordStar for Windows br Like many other producers of successful DOS applications WordStar International delayed before deciding to make a version for the commercially successful Windows The company purchased Legacy an existing Windows based word processor which was altered and released as WordStar for Windows in It was a well reviewed product and included many features normally only found in more expensive desktop publishing packages However its delayed launch meant that Microsoft Word had already firmly established itself as the corporate standard during the two previous years br br br Abandonment br WordStar is abandonware It was last updated in December br br br Notable users br WordStar was the program of choice for conservative intellectual William F Buckley Jr who used the software to write many works including his last book His son Christopher Buckley wrote of his father s loyalty to WordStar despite the increasing difficulty of installing it on newer computers He said of WordStar I m told there are better programs but I m also told there are better alphabets br Ralph Ellison also used WordStar br Canadian science fiction author Robert J Sawyer continues to use WordStar for DOS the final release to write his novels br A Song of Ice and Fire author George R R Martin still as of uses the MS DOS version of WordStar br Andy Breckman the creator of Monk is a devoted WordStar user br Vampire fiction writer Anne Rice was another faithful user of WordStar who struggled to have it installed on newer computers until it could no longer reasonably be done She then grudgingly transitioned to Microsoft Word whose design she felt was comparatively unintuitive and illogical WordStar was magnificent I loved it It was logical beautiful perfect adding Compared to it MS Word which I use today is pure madness br br br Version list br This is a list of the various WordStar versions released over the years for

br br br Interface br Prior to WordStar word processors split text entry and formatting into separate functions the latter was often not done until a document was about to be printed WordStar was one of the first WYSIWYG word processors showing accurate line breaks and page breaks It was a major breakthrough to be able to see and while writing force if one so desired where line breaks and page breaks would fall even though being a text based program WordStar couldn t accurately display different typefaces such as bold and italic until version br In a default installation on a line screen the top third of the screen contained a menu of commands and a status line the lower two thirds of the screen displayed the text of the user s document A user configurable option to set the help level released this space for user text The help system could be configured to display help a short time after the first key of a command sequence was entered As users became more familiar with the command sequences the help system could be set to provide less and less assistance until finally all on screen menus and status information would be turned off br The original computer terminals and microcomputers for which WordStar was developed many running the CP M operating system did not have function keys or cursor control keys arrow keys Page Up Page Down WordStar used sequences of alphabetic keys combined with the Control key which on keyboards of the time was conveniently next to the letter A in the position now usually occupied by the Caps Lock key For touch typists in addition reaching the function and cursor keys generally requires them to take their fingers off the home keys with consequent loss of typing rhythm br For example the diamond of Ctrl S E D X s left e up d right x down moved the cursors one character or line to the left up right or down Ctrl A F to the outside of the diamond moved the cursor a full word left right and Ctrl R C just past the Ctrl keys for up and down scrolled a full page up down Prefacing these keystrokes with Ctrl Q generally expanded their action moving the cursor to the end beginning of the line end beginning of the document etc Ctrl G would delete the character under the cursor Ctrl H would backspace and delete Commands to enable bold or italics printing blocking text to copy or delete saving or retrieving files from disk etc were typically a short sequence of keystrokes such as Ctrl P B for bold or Ctrl K S to save a file Formatting codes would appear on screen such as B for bold Y for italics and S for underscoring br Although many of these keystroke sequences were far from self evident they tended to lend themselves to mnemonic devices e g Ctrl Print Bold Ctrl blocK Save and regular users quickly learned them through muscle memory enabling them to rapidly navigate documents by touch rather than memorizing Ctrl S cursor left br Early versions of WordStar lacked features found in other word processors such as the ability to automatically reformat paragraphs to fit the current margins as text was added or deleted a command had to be issued to force reformatting The subsequent WordStar and later versions of WordStar for DOS added automatic paragraph reformatting and all versions of WordStar had commands to manually reformat a paragraph B or the rest of the document QQ B and as a later synonym QU br WordStar was rare among word processing programs in that it permitted the user to mark highlight a block of text with KB and KK commands and leave it marked in place and then go to a different position in the document and later even after considerable work on other things copy the block with KC or move it to a new location with KV Many users found it much easier to manipulate blocks this way than with the Microsoft Word system of highlighting with a mouse and then being forced by Word s select then do approach to immediately deal with the marked block lest any typing replace it The subsequent WordStar retained WordStar s distinctive functionality for block manipulation As part of the K sequence of shortcuts it offered true bookmarks K to K allowing the editor to move about in large documents with ease br Column Mode editing was probably unique to WordStar As a basic text editor the interface showed all characters to be the same width hence characters across an column screen resolution By switching on column mode editing a rectangle of text spanning several characters and several lines could be selected and manipulated This was very handy for manipulating columns of numbers and non standard files Once selected the feature could also be used to calculate the total of a column of numbers and place the result at the insertion point br Formatting with WordStar was carried out before the text to be formatted unlike many other word processors where the formatting of a paragraph is buried within the usually hidden paragraph marker at the end of the paragraph This latter method leaves the user unclear where formatting starts In normal editing WordStar hides formatting markers but these are easily displayed with OD command Formatting information is then displayed in the normal text area displacing the actual text It nonetheless made it absolutely clear where formatting started and finished Page and section formatting was handled differently by the addition of formatting lines A formatting line was indicated by the line starting with a full stop Some third party WordStar books called formatting lines dot commands A few examples lh line height lm left margin rm right margin each of which was followed by a number The number was assumed to be points pt but could be easily modified to inches or mm by the addition of or mm after the number lm and rm were never equal as both values were from the left hand edge of the page Setting rm to made text lines infinitely long Margins could also be set either absolutely or relatively by preceding the value with either or when setting the value br If any invalid formatting commands are encountered when printing WordStar version at least will ignore the line all text until the next carriage return terminating the line This could confuse novice users who unintentionally began a line with a decimal point same as period or dot character and WordStar would not print the line For instance a line reading percent text text text would not appear in the printout though the document would continue on the printout without any error reported br WordStar added few new commands but completely rewrote the user interface using simple English language mnemonics so the command to remove a word which had been T in WordStar became RW in WordStar the command to remove the text from the rest of the line to the right of the cursor changed from QY to RR However many in WordStar s large installed user based were happy with the original WordStar interface and did not consider the changes to be improvements Although WordStar was meant as the successor to WordStar it never gained substantial market share br The original WordStar interface left a large legacy and many of its control key command are still available optionally or as the default in other programs such as the modern cross platform word processing software TextMaker and many text editors running under MS DOS Linux and other UNIX variants Some Borland products including the popular Turbo Pascal compiler and Borland Sidekick used a subset of WordStar keyboard commands the former in its IDE and the latter in the Notepad editors The TEXT editor built into the firmware of the TRS Model portable computer supported a subset of the WordStar cursor movement commands in addition to its own Home word processing software like Write Set not only use the WordStar interface but have been based on WordStar DOS file formats allowing WordStar users who no longer have a copy of the application to easily open and edit their files There are WordStar keyboard command emulators and keymappings both freeware and shareware for current versions of Microsoft Word Popular modern word processing software WordPerfect can open or save to WordStar documents enabling users to move back and forth br br br Add ons and companion products br br MailMerge was an add on program becoming integrated from WordStar onwards which facilitated the merge printing of bulk mailings such as business letters to clients Two files were required br br a data file being a list of recipients stored in a non document comma delimited plain ASCII text file typically named Clients dat although WordStar had no requirement for a specific file extension Each subsequent line of text in the file would be dedicated to a particular client with name and address details separated on the line dedicated to a client by commas read left to right For example Mr Michael Smith Oakland Drive WordStar would also access Lotus spreadsheet files wk for this data and if the data contained flags to start and stop WordStar processing the data then flags could be set so that certain clients are omitted from the output stream br a master document containing the text of the letter using standard paragraphs a k a boilerplate text as required These would be mixed and matched as needed and where appropriate paragraphs could be inserted through external reference to subordinate documents br The writer would insert placeholders delimited by ampersands into the master document e g TITLE INITIAL SURNAME ADDRESS In each copy of the letter the placeholders would be replaced with strings read from the DAT file Mass mailings could thereby be prepared with each letter copy individually addressed br Other add on programs included SpellStar a spell checker program later incorporated as a direct part of the WordStar program and DataStar a program whose purpose was specifically to expedite creating of the data files used for merge printing These were revolutionary features for personal computer users during the early to mid s A companion spreadsheet CalcStar was also produced using a somewhat WordStar like interface collectively WordStar word processing DataStar ReportStar database management a k a InfoStar and CalcStar spreadsheet comprised StarBurst the first ever office suite of personal computer programs br As a product enhancement in the late s WordStar came bundled with PC Outline a popular DOS outliner then available from Brown Bag Software Inc in California PC Outline text had to be exported to a WordStar format file as the programs were not developed to be internally compatible br br br File types br WordStar identified files as either document or nondocument which led to some confusion among users Document referred to WordStar word processing files containing embedded word processing and formatting commands Nondocument files were pure ASCII text files containing no embedded formatting commands Using WordStar in Nondocument Mode was essentially the same as using a traditional text editor WordStar introduced a document mode print preview feature allowing the user to inspect a WYSIWYG version of text complete with inserted graphics as it would appear on the printed page br br br Installation br Installation of early versions of WordStar especially for CP M was very different from the approach of modern programs While later editions had more or less comprehensive installation programs that allowed selection of printers and terminals from a menu in the very early releases each of the escape sequences required for the terminal and printer had to be identified in the hardware documentation then hand entered in hex into reserved locations in the program memory image This was a fairly typical limitation of all CP M programs of the time since there was no mechanism to hide the complexities of the underlying hardware from the application program To use the program with a different printer required re installation of the program Occasionally short machine language programs had to be entered in a patch area in WordStar to provide particular screen effects or cope with particular printers Researching testing and proving out such installations was a time consuming and knowledge intensive process making WordStar installation and customization a staple discussion of CP M users groups during that time br DOS versions of WordStar at least had standardized the screen display but still had to be customized for different printers br br br Running on modern platforms br WordStar version x used the MS DOS File control block FCB interface an early data structure for file input output which was based closely on CP M s file input output functions The provision of the FCB interface was intended to simplify the porting of assembly language programs from CP M to the new MS DOS When MS DOS adopted the Unix like file interface of file handles FCBs became a legacy interface supported for backward compatibility Because FCB compatibility has not been maintained WordStar x will not function properly on modern versions of Windows In particular WordStar x cannot save files br One workaround is to use the DOSEMU emulator on Linux which correctly implements the FCB interface the DOSBox emulator does not even on Linux WordStar does not have this problem because it uses the newer MS DOS interface for input output OS can run WordStar in a DOS session Another option is using the FreeDOS operating system br Another option is to run the CP M versions of WordStar using a CP M emulator such as CPMEmu for Linux and the Raspberry Pi or CP M for OS X for macOS br In October WordStar support was added to vDos a derivative of DOSBox optimized for business applications vDos allows WordStar and above to run under and bit versions of Microsoft Windows from XP through br br br Emulation br Although no current version of WordStar is available for modern operating systems some former WordStar users still prefer WordStar s interface especially the cursor diamond commands described earlier in this article These users say that less hand movement is necessary to issue commands and hence that writing under this interface is more efficient The user accesses the nearby Ctrl key and then a letter or combination of letters thus keeping his hands on or close to the home row instead of moving them away from it to reach for a specialty key or a mouse br To accommodate these users WordStar emulation programs were created One such program is CtrlPlus by Yoji Hagiya which remaps the standard PC keyboard making many WordStar commands available in most Windows programs CtrlPlus switches the Control and Caps Lock keys so that the Ctrl key is back where it was on older keyboards next to the A key It also gives functionality to the chief cursor diamond commands mentioned in this article br Another WordStar emulation utility is WordStar Command Emulator for Microsoft Word also known as WordStar for Word by Mike Petrie Designed to work in conjunction with CtrlPlus the Command Emulator adds many more WordStar commands to MS Word than CtrlPlus by itself and also changes Word XP s menus to be more like those of WordStar for DOS the last DOS version of WordStar For example Ctrl K was WordStar s word count command and Ctrl QL was its spell check command Hitting these commands in the WordStar Emulator within Word runs Word s equivalent commands WordStar for Word also adds WordStar s block commands namely Ctrl KB to mark the beginning of a block Ctrl KK to mark the end and Ctrl KV to move it Alternatively Ctrl KC could be used to copy the block WordStar for Word works on all versions of Word from Word through br The WordStar Command Emulator is written in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications VBA a macro programming language based on Visual Basic built into Microsoft Word to allow for a high level of customization Most Word add ins are written in this language br GNU Emacs used to come with a library wordstar mode el that provides WordStar emulation but it s been declared obsolete as of version A macro set for vi that provides WordStar emulation is available br The cross platform JOE editor is a very WordStar like alternative When invoked as jstar Joe emulates many WordStar keybindings JOE lacks formatting options and essentially only operates in non document mode but formatted documents can be authored in HTML CSS Markdown or another markup language br br br Bidirectional text br Around Elbit Systems in Israel developed a CP M capable microcomputer named the DS CP M machines were readily available and Elbit needed something to differentiate their product from others An agreement was made with MicroPro to develop a version of WordStar that supported both English and Hebrew input The concept was revolutionary as Hebrew is written right to left and all word processors of the time assumed left to right WordStar as developed by Elbit was the first word processor that offered bidirectional input and mixed alphabets br Elbit acquired rights to the source code and a development team in Elbit Haifa worked on the project For several years Hebrew English WordStar was the de facto WYSIWYG word processor leader until inevitably it was ousted by newer competitors br br br Filename extensions br DOS WordStar files by default have no extension some users adopted their own conventions such as the letters WS followed by the version number for example WS or just plain WS Backup files were automatically saved as BAKs br WordStar for Windows files use the extension WSD br WordStar for Windows templates use the extension WST br WordStar for Windows macros use the extension WMC br WordStar for Windows temporary files use the extension WS br WordStar for DOS and UNIX PC do not have a fixed extension but DOC and WS were common br br br Legacy br Newstar produced New Word for Amstrad PCW PCW in the mid s running CP M on inch floppy disks NewWord also was available for MS DOS and in a native version for Concurrent CP M It was very similar to WordStar LapStar was a cut down clone for the TRS Model portable computer br Since a partial WordStar clone has been in the process of being developed under the name of WordTsar In addition German software author Martin Vieregg has sold the Write Set
