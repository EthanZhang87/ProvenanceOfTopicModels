GNUstep is a free software implementation of the Cocoa formerly OpenStep Objective C frameworks widget toolkit and application development tools for Unix like operating systems and Microsoft Windows It is part of the GNU Project br GNUstep features a cross platform object oriented IDE Apart from the default Objective C interface GNUstep also has bindings for Java Ruby GNU Guile and Scheme The GNUstep developers track some additions to Apple s Cocoa to remain compatible The roots of the GNUstep application interface are the same as the roots of Cocoa NeXTSTEP and OpenStep GNUstep thus predates Cocoa which emerged when Apple acquired NeXT s technology and incorporated it into the development of the original Mac OS X while GNUstep was initially an effort by GNU developers to replicate the technically ambitious NeXTSTEP s programmer friendly features br br br History br GNUstep began when Paul Kunz and others at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center wanted to port HippoDraw from NeXTSTEP to another platform Instead of rewriting HippoDraw from scratch and reusing only the application design they decided to rewrite the NeXTSTEP object layer on which the application depended This was the first version of libobjcX It enabled them to port HippoDraw to Unix systems running the X Window System without changing a single line of their application source After the OpenStep specification was released to the public in they decided to write a new objcX which would adhere to the new APIs The software would become known as GNUstep br br br Software architecture br br br Rendering br GNUstep contains a set of graphical control elements written in the Objective C programming language br The graphical user interface GUI of GNUMail is composed of graphics control elements GNUMail has to interact with the windowing system e g X or Wayland and its graphical user interface has to be rendered GNUstep s backend provides a small set of functions used by the user interface library to interface to the actual windowing system It also has a rendering engine which emulates common Postscript functions The package gnustep back provides the following backends br br cairo default backend using the Cairo D graphics library br winlib default backend on Microsoft Windows systems Cairo and Windows API variants br art old deprecated backend on unix like systems Uses the vector based PostScript like D graphics library Libart br xlib old deprecated X backend br br br Paradigms br GNUstep inherits some design principles proposed in OPENSTEP GNUstep predates Cocoa but Cocoa is based on OPENSTEP as well as the Objective C language br br Model view controller paradigm br Target action br Drag and drop br Delegation br Message forwarding through NSInvocation br br br Other interfaces br In addition to the Objective C interface some small projects under the GNUstep umbrella implement other APIs from Apple br br The Boron library aims to implement the Carbon API It is very incomplete br The CoreBase library is designed to be compatible with Core Foundation It is not complete enough for the Base Foundation Kit component to simply be a wrapper around it br The QuartzCore library implements Core Animation APIs The Opal library implements Quartz D br As of February there are no projects that build the Swift programming language against the GNUstep Objective C environment br br br Applications br Here are some examples of applications written for or ported to GNUstep br br br Written from scratch br Addresses an address contacts manager br toil a desktop environment br GNUMail an e mail client br GNUstep Database Library an Enterprise Objects Framework clone br GNUstepWeb an application server compatible with WebObjects x br Gorm a user interface builder application and part of the developer tools of GNUstep Gorm is the equivalent of Interface Builder that was originally found on NeXTSTEP then OPENSTEP and finally on Mac OS X It supports the old nib files as well as its own gorm file format br GWorkspace a workspace and file manager br Grr an RSS feed reader br Oolite a clone of Elite a space simulation game with trading components br PRICE imaging application br ProjectCenter the Project Builder or Xcode equivalent br TalkSoup an IRC client br Terminal br Zipper a file archiver tool br br br Ported from NeXTSTEP OPENSTEP or macOS
