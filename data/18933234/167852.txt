title: GNU TeXmacs
id: 167852
GNU TeXmacs is a scientific word processor and typesetting component of the GNU Project It originated as a variant of GNU Emacs with TeX functionalities though it shares no code with those programs while using TeX fonts It is written and maintained by Joris van der Hoeven and a group of developers The program produces structured documents with a WYSIWYG user interface New document styles can be created by the user The editor provides high quality typesetting algorithms and TeX and other fonts for publishing professional looking documents br br br Background br As a structured WYSIWYG editor and document preparation system TeXmacs is similar to earlier structured document editors such as Interleaf first release Framemaker SoftQuad Author Editor Lilac Grif and Thot there was also academic research into interactive editing of complex typographical constructs represented logically br In the s and s interest on interactive editing of structured text encouraged the development of programs intended for scholars in the humanities an example of this is CWRC Writer a visual XML editor with Close to WYSIWYG editing and enrichment of scholarly texts with meaningful visual representations of markup br On another side of the editing and document preparation world a program for visual interaction with structured texts written in LaTeX is LyX which does not aim at WYSIWYG editing but at visual representation of the structure WYSIWYM br br br Features br br Like in many WYSIWYG editors such as Microsoft Word authors manipulate a document on screen which should print to a similar looking paper copy The goal of TeXmacs is to provide a WYSIWYG editor that nevertheless makes it possible to write correctly structured documents with aesthetically pleasing typesetting results TeXmacs is not a front end to LaTeX but TeXmacs documents can be converted to either TeX or LaTeX LaTeX also can be imported to some extent and both import from and export to HTML Scheme Verbatim and XML is provided the HTML export is stylable with CSS since version There is a converter for MathML as well and TeXmacs can output PDF and PostScript for printing br TeXmacs can handle mathematical formulas tables images cross references and citations It can be used as a front end to a number of computer algebra systems such as Maxima FriCAS and SageMath and can in turn integrate some of their output into its typesetting TeXmacs also supports a Scheme extension language called Guile for customizing the program and writing extensions br It also features a presentation mode and a small technical drawing editor and there are plans to evolve towards a complete scientific office suite with spreadsheet capabilities An implementation of spreadsheets is present starting from version spreadsheets in TeXmacs can take advantage of plugins for example Python or Maxima to compute cell values br TeXmacs currently runs on most Unix based architectures including Linux FreeBSD Cygwin Haiku and macOS Along with the Cygwin version a native port is available for Microsoft Windows br br br The TeXmacs editor br In the TeXmacs editor structure and appearance of the document are represented at the same time the structure is made evident to the user by surrounding logical units of the document in nested focus frames carrying color cues that are displayed according to the movement of the cursor A detailed description of the structure in the proximity of the cursor is provided in the footer of the editor window finely selectable with left right arrow presses In the editor it is possible to switch between text mode and source mode editing and support for the composition of macros is present the source editor is syntax aware br br br Mathematical typography br TeXmacs facilitates the inputting of mathematical formulas by mapping sequences of keyboard presses to symbols For example the symbol br br br br br br br displaystyle Rightarrow br br can be input by typing br Some symbols have no such representation br br br br br br br displaystyle Uparrow br br for instance These can be input with Tab key e g for br br br br br br br displaystyle Uparrow br br the key presses are Tab Tab This keyboard based entry differs from other formulae editors that tend to provide point and click menus for this task br br br Batch processing br It is possible to use TeXmacs as a batch processor which is LaTeX s usual operation mode using X virtual framebuffer to avoid opening unwanted windows while processing For example the command br br xvfb run texmacs convert article tm article pdf quit br generates a PDF file article pdf from a TeXmacs document article tm br br br The TeXmacs format br All TeXmacs documents or document fragments can be thought of as trees the concept of tree exists as well in the SGML markup language to which the Texmacs format is similar For instance the tree br br represents the formula br br br br br x br br y br br br br br br br br br br br y br br z br br br br br displaystyle x y frac sqrt y z br br br written here with the TeX markup used by Wikipedia and is turned by TeXmacs own typesetting engine into a typeset formula here inserted as an image br br TeXmacs trees are represented in TeXmacs files as strings and in the TeXmacs editor as the typeset representation of the document together with its interactive behaviour In the on screen representation of the TeXmacs tree the cursor movement represents the movement inside the tree On disk three representations of the TeXmacs format exist a native representation an XML representation and a representation with Scheme S expressions the Scheme representation is useful for the interfacing with Scheme programs br br br Typesetting and document control br The typesetting process converts TeXmacs trees into boxes Evaluation of TeXmacs trees proceeds by reduction of the primitives that is by evaluation of macro applications The typesetting primitives are designed to be very fast and are built in into the editor the rendering of many of the primitives can be customized through the built in environment variables the stylesheet language allows users to write new primitives as macros on top of the built in primitives br TeXmacs uses a global algorithm for line breaking similar to the TeX one and in addition uses a global algorithm for page breaking the page breaking algorithm takes into account floating objects figures table footnotes and multi column content br br br Document control br Documents can be controlled through a native macro system and through Guile Scheme It is possible to customize the editor s menus and keybindings and to act programmatically on the document tree br br br TeXmacs macros br TeXmacs macros provide a means of structured input as in TeX LaTeX and they are immediately typeset at the same time maintaining editable input fields They are written in source code although the WYSIWYG editor can aid in their composition through the translation of visual structures into their syntax br br br Document control through Scheme br Scheme is embedded in TeXmacs through GNU Guile the editor itself can be controlled in this way menus and keybindings can be customized Scheme commands can be invoked interactively inside TeXmacs documents can be invoked from the command line and from inside TeXmacs macros TeXmacs trees can be passed to Scheme in different forms as passive trees convenient to manipulate content directly using standard Scheme routines on lists as active trees keep track of the position of the tree inside the global document tree and can be used to programmatically modify documents and in a hybrid representation br br br Graphics br Graphics objects are also part of the TeXmacs format and can be manipulated programmatically from Scheme An example of TeXmacs graphics generated in a TeXmacs Scheme session is shown below together with the session which generated the image Images generated programmatically in a Scheme session can also be edited using the internal drawing editor as they are inserted in the document as a tree Scheme scripts can also be executed through the extern TeXmacs macro in this case only the typeset material is available in the document and no direct editing is possible the modifications must be made within the Scheme code br br br Supported back ends br br TeXmacs has back ends supporting many technologies br br Programming languages CLISP CMUCL Python QCL R Shell br Computer algebra systems Axiom Giac Macaulay Mathematica Maxima MuPAD PARI GP Reduce SageMath Yacas br Numeric matrix systems GNU Octave Matlab Scilab br Plotting packages gnuplot Graphviz XYpic Mathemagix br Other DraTeX Eukleides GTybalt Lush Juris M and Zotero br br br Embedding editable plugin output br Plugin output can be embedded within TeXmacs documents using executable switches in this way one can switch back and forth between a given input to the system and the corresponding output which blends seamlessly in the document br br br See also br br Comparison of TeX editors br Comparison of office suites br List of office suites br Comparison of word
