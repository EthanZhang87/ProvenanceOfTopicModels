According to the Free Software Foundation Latin America Linux libre is a modified version of the Linux kernel that contains no binary blobs obfuscated code or code released under proprietary licenses In the Linux kernel they are mostly used for proprietary firmware images While generally redistributable binary blobs do not give the user the freedom to audit modify or consequently redistribute their modified versions The GNU Project keeps Linux libre in synchronization with the mainline Linux kernel br br br History br The Linux kernel started to include binary blobs in The work to clear out the binary blobs began in with gNewSense s find firmware and gen kernel This work was taken further by the BLAG Linux distribution in when deblob and Linux libre was born br Linux libre was first released by the Free Software Foundation Latin America FSFLA then endorsed by the Free Software Foundation FSF as a valuable component for the totally free Linux distributions It became a GNU package in March Alexandre Oliva is the project maintainer br br br Proprietary firmware removal br br br Methods br The removal process is achieved by using a script called deblob main This script is inspired by the one used for gNewSense Jeff Moe made subsequent modifications to meet certain requirements for its use with the BLAG Linux and GNU distribution There is another script called deblob check which is used to check if a kernel source file a patch or a compressed sources file still contains software which is suspected of being proprietary br br br Benefits br Aside from the primary intended effect of running a system with only free software the practical consequences of removing device firmware that a user is not allowed to study or modify has both positive and negative effects br Removal of device firmware can be considered an advantage for security and stability br When the firmware cannot be audited for bugs security problems and malicious functions such as backdoors or when the firmware cannot be fixed by the Linux kernel maintainers themselves even if they know of problems it is possible for the entire system to be compromised by a malicious firmware Without the ability to perform a security audit on manufacturer provided firmware even an innocent bug could undermine the safety of the running system br br br Hardware support br Removing proprietary firmware from the kernel will cause loss of functionality of certain hardware that does not have a free software replacement available This affects certain sound video TV tuner and network cards especially in the case of recent Intel Wi Fi cards and recent nVidia graphics cards as well as some other devices When possible free software replacement firmware is provided as a substitute such as the openfwwf for b carl and ath k htc wireless card drivers Reviewer Ramces Red summarized the issue with Linux Libre writing it does not always have the best hardware support br br br Microcode br Linux libre does not suggest the user install CPU microcode update bundles since the code is proprietary Microcode update bundles have been used in the Linux kernel version among other things to mitigate hardware vulnerabilities br br br Availability br The source code and precompiled packages of the deblobbed Linux kernel are available directly from the distributions which use the Linux libre scripts Freed ora is a subproject which prepares and maintains RPM packages based on Fedora There are also precompiled packages for Debian and derived distributions such as Ubuntu br br br Distributions br br br

distributions br br libreCMC br ProteanOS If the underlying hardware is not supported it must be ported br Historical br br Musix GNU Linux br br br Distributions that compile a free Linux kernel br These distros do not use the packaged Linux libre but instead completely remove binary blobs from the mainline Linux kernel The source is then compiled and the resulting free Linux kernel is used by default in these systems br br Debian May install binary blobs with the installer or kernel by default br PureOS br Trisquel The Linux libre deblob script is used during its development br Uruk GNU
