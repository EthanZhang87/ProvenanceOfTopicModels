GNU Octave is a scientific programming language for scientific computing and numerical computation Octave helps in solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with MATLAB It may also be used as a batch oriented language As part of the GNU Project it is free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License br br br History br The project was conceived around At first it was intended to be a companion to a chemical reactor design course Full development was started by John W Eaton in The first alpha release dates back to January and on February version was released Version was released on November br The program is named after Octave Levenspiel a former professor of the principal author Levenspiel was known for his ability to perform quick back of the envelope calculations br br br Development history br br br Developments br In addition to use on desktops for personal scientific computing Octave is used in academia and industry For example Octave was used on a massive parallel computer at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center to find vulnerabilities related to guessing social security numbers br Acceleration with OpenCL or CUDA is also possible with use of GPUs br br br Technical details br Octave is written in C using the C standard library br Octave uses an interpreter to execute the Octave scripting language br Octave is extensible using dynamically loadable modules br Octave interpreter has an OpenGL based graphics engine to create plots graphs and charts and to save or print them Alternatively gnuplot can be used for the same purpose br Octave includes a Graphical User Interface GUI in addition to the traditional command line interface CLI see User interfaces for details br br br Octave the language br The Octave language is an interpreted programming language It is a structured programming language similar to C and supports many common C standard library functions and also certain UNIX system calls and functions However it does not support passing arguments by reference although function arguments are copy on write to avoid unnecessary duplication br Octave programs consist of a list of function calls or a script The syntax is matrix based and provides various functions for matrix operations It supports various data structures and allows object oriented programming br Its syntax is very similar to MATLAB and careful programming of a script will allow it to run on both Octave and MATLAB br Because Octave is made available under the GNU General Public License it may be freely changed copied and used The program runs on Microsoft Windows and most Unix and Unix like operating systems including Linux Android and macOS br br br Notable features br br br Command and variable name completion br Typing a TAB character on the command line causes Octave to attempt to complete variable function and file names similar to Bash s tab completion Octave uses the text before the cursor as the initial portion of the name to complete br br br Command history br When running interactively Octave saves the commands typed in an internal buffer so that they can be recalled and edited br br br Data structures br Octave includes a limited amount of support for organizing data in structures In this example we see a structure x with elements a b and c an integer an array and a string respectively br br br Short circuit Boolean operators br Octave s and logical operators are evaluated in a short circuit fashion like the corresponding operators in the C language in contrast to the element by element operators and br br br Increment and decrement operators br br Octave includes the C like increment and decrement operators and in both their prefix and postfix forms br Octave also does augmented assignment e g x br br br Unwind protect br Octave supports a limited form of exception handling modelled after the unwind protect of Lisp The general form of an unwind protect block looks like this br br As a general rule GNU Octave recognizes as termination of a given block either the keyword end which is compatible with the MATLAB language or a more specific keyword endblock or in some cases end block As a consequence an unwind protect block can be terminated either with the keyword end unwind protect as in the example or with the more portable keyword end br The cleanup part of the block is always executed In case an exception is raised by the body part cleanup is executed immediately before propagating the exception outside the block unwind protect br GNU Octave also supports another form of exception handling compatible with the MATLAB language br br This latter form differs from an unwind protect block in two ways First exception handling is only executed when an exception is raised by body Second after the execution of exception handling the exception is not propagated outside the block unless a rethrow lasterror statement is explicitly inserted within the exception handling code br br br Variable length argument lists br Octave has a mechanism for handling functions that take an unspecified number of arguments without explicit upper limit To specify a list of zero or more arguments use the special argument varargin as the last or only argument in the list varargin is a cell array containing all the input arguments br br br Variable length return lists br A function can be set up to return any number of values by using the special return value varargout For example br br br C integration br It is also possible to execute Octave code directly in a C program For example here is a code snippet for calling rand br br C and C code can be integrated into GNU Octave by creating oct files or using the MATLAB compatible MEX files br br br MATLAB compatibility br Octave has been built with MATLAB compatibility in mind and shares many features with MATLAB br br Matrices as fundamental data type br Built in support for complex numbers br Powerful built in math functions and extensive function libraries br Extensibility in the form of user defined functions br Octave treats incompatibility with MATLAB as a bug therefore it could be considered a software clone which does not infringe software copyright as per Lotus v Borland court case br MATLAB scripts from the MathWorks FileExchange repository in principle are compatible with Octave However while they are often provided and uploaded by users under an Octave compatible and proper open source BSD license the FileExchange Terms of use prohibit any usage beside MathWorks proprietary MATLAB br br br Syntax compatibility br There are a few purposeful albeit minor syntax additions Archived at the Wayback Machine br br Comment lines can be prefixed with the character as well as the character br Various C based operators are supported br Elements can be referenced without creating a new variable by cascaded indexing e g br Strings can be defined with the double quote character as well as the single quote character br When the variable type is single a single precision floating point number Octave calculates the mean in the single domain MATLAB in double domain which is faster but gives less accurate results br Blocks can also be terminated with more specific Control structure keywords i e endif endfor endwhile etc br Functions can be defined within scripts and at the Octave prompt br Presence of a do until loop similar to do while in C br br br Function compatibility br Many but not all of the numerous MATLAB functions are available in GNU Octave some of them accessible through packages in Octave Forge The functions available as part of either core Octave or Forge packages are listed online Archived at the Wayback Machine br A list of unavailable functions is included in the Octave function unimplemented m Unimplemented functions are also listed under many Octave Forge packages in the Octave Wiki br When an unimplemented function is called the following error message is shown br br br User interfaces br Octave comes with an official graphical user interface GUI and an integrated development environment IDE based on Qt It has been available since Octave and has become the default interface over the command line interface with the release of Octave br It was well received by an EDN contributor who wrote Octave now has a very workable GUI in reviewing the then new GUI in br Several rd party graphical front ends have also been developed like ToolboX for coding education br br br GUI applications br With Octave code the user can create GUI applications See GUI Development GNU Octave version Below are some examples br br Button edit control checkboxTextboxListbox with message boxes Radiobuttons br br br Packages br Octave also has many packages available Those packages are located at Octave Forge Octave Forge Packages or Github Octave Packages It is also possible for anyone to create and maintain packages br br br Comparison with other similar software br Other free alternatives to MATLAB include Scilab and FreeMat Octave is more compatible with MATLAB than Scilab is and FreeMat has not been updated since June br br br See also br br List of numerical analysis software br Comparison of numerical
