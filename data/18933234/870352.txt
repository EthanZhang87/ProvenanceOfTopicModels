In linguistics and grammar a sentence is a linguistic expression such as the English example The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog In traditional grammar it is typically defined as a string of words that expresses a complete thought or as a unit consisting of a subject and predicate In non functional linguistics it is typically defined as a maximal unit of syntactic structure such as a constituent In functional linguistics it is defined as a unit of written texts delimited by graphological features such as upper case letters and markers such as periods question marks and exclamation marks This notion contrasts with a curve which is delimited by phonologic features such as pitch and loudness and markers such as pauses and with a clause which is a sequence of words that represents some process going on throughout time br A sentence can include words grouped meaningfully to express a statement question exclamation request command or suggestion br br br Typical associates br br br Clauses br A sentence is typically associated with a clause A clause can either be a clause simplex or a clause complex A clause simplex represents a single process going on through time A clause complex represents a logical relation between two or more processes and is thus composed of two or more clause simplexes br A clause simplex typically contains a predication structure with a subject noun phrase and a finite verb Although the subject is usually a noun phrase other kinds of phrases such as gerund phrases work as well and some languages allow subjects to be omitted In the examples below the subject of the outmost clause simplex is in italics and the subject of boiling is in square brackets There is clause embedding in the second and third examples br br Water boils at degrees Celsius br It is quite interesting that water boils at degrees Celsius br The fact that water boils at degrees Celsius is quite interesting br There are two types of clauses independent and non independent interdependent An independent clause realises a speech act such as a statement a question a command or an offer A non independent clause does not realise any act A non independent clause simplex or complex is usually logically related to other non independent clauses Together they usually constitute a single independent clause complex For that reason non independent clauses are also called interdependent For instance the non independent clause because I have no friends is related to the non independent clause I don t go out in I don t go out because I have no friends The whole clause complex is independent because it realises a statement What is stated is the causal nexus between having no friend and not going out When such a statement is acted out the fact that the speaker doesn t go out is already established therefore it cannot be stated What is still open and under negotiation is the reason for that fact The causal nexus is represented by the independent clause complex and not by the two interdependent clause simplexes br See also copula for the consequences of the verb to be on the theory of sentence structure br br br Classification br br br By structure br One traditional scheme for classifying English sentences is by clause structure the number and types of clauses in the sentence with finite verbs br br A simple sentence consists of a single independent clause with no dependent clauses br A compound sentence consists of multiple independent clauses with no dependent clauses These clauses are joined together using conjunctions punctuation or both br A complex sentence consists of one independent clause and at least one dependent clause br A compound complex sentence or complex compound sentence consists of multiple independent clauses at least one of which has at least one dependent clause br br br By function or speech act br Sentences can also be classified based on the speech act which they perform For instance English sentence types can be described as follows br br A declarative sentence makes a statement or assertion br You are my friend br An interrogative sentence raises a question br Are you my friend br An imperative sentence makes a command br Be my friend br An exclamative or exclamatory sentence raises an exclamation br What a good friend you are br The form declarative interrogative imperative or exclamative and meaning statement question command or exclamation of a sentence usually match but not always For instance the interrogative sentence Can you pass me the salt is not intended to express a question but rather to express a command Likewise the interrogative sentence Can t you do anything right is not intended to express a question on the listener s ability but rather to make an exclamation about the listener s lack of ability also called a rhetorical question br br br Major and minor sentences br A major sentence is a regular sentence it has a subject and a predicate e g I have a ball In this sentence one can change the persons e g We have a ball However a minor sentence is an irregular type of sentence that does not contain a main clause e g Mary Precisely so Next Tuesday evening after it gets dark Other examples of minor sentences are headings stereotyped expressions Hello emotional expressions Wow proverbs etc These can also include nominal sentences like The more the merrier These mostly omit a main verb for the sake of conciseness but may also do so in order to intensify the meaning around the nouns br Sentences that comprise a single word are called word sentences and the words themselves sentence words br br br Length br The s saw a renewed surge in interest in sentence length primarily in relation to other syntactic phenomena br One definition of the average sentence length of a prose passage is the ratio of the number of words to the number of sentences br The textbook Mathematical Linguistics by Andr s Kornai suggests that in journalistic prose the median sentence length is above words br The average length of a sentence generally serves as a measure of sentence difficulty or complexity In general as the average sentence length increases the complexity of the sentences also increases br Another definition of sentence length is the number of clauses in the sentence whereas the clause length is the number of phones in the clause br Research by Erik Schils and Pieter de Haan by sampling five texts showed that two adjacent sentences are more likely to have similar lengths than two non adjacent sentences and almost certainly have a similar length when in a work of fiction This countered the theory that authors may aim at an alternation of long and short sentences br Sentence length as well as word difficulty are both factors in the readability of a sentence however other factors such as the presence of conjunctions have been said to facilitate comprehension considerably br br br See also br Clause br Constituent br Discourse br Periodic
