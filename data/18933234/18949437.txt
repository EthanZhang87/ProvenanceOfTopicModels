The Free Software Foundation FSF is a c non profit organization founded by Richard Stallman on October to support the free software movement with the organization s preference for software being distributed under copyleft share alike terms such as with its own GNU General Public License The FSF was incorporated in Boston Massachusetts United States where it is also based br From its founding until the mid s FSF s funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write free software for the GNU Project and its employees and volunteers have mostly worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the free software community br Consistent with its goals the FSF aims to use only free software on its own computers br br br History br br The Free Software Foundation was founded in as a non profit corporation supporting free software development It continued existing GNU projects such as the sale of manuals and tapes and employed developers of the free software system Since then it has continued these activities as well as advocating for the free software movement The FSF is also the steward of several free software licenses meaning it publishes them and has the ability to make revisions as needed br The FSF holds the copyrights on many pieces of the GNU system such as GNU Compiler Collection As the holder of these copyrights it has authority to enforce the copyleft requirements of the GNU General Public License GPL when copyright infringement occurs br From until GPL enforcement was done informally usually by Stallman himself often with assistance from FSF s lawyer Eben Moglen Typically GPL violations during this time were cleared up by short email exchanges between Stallman and the violator In the interest of promoting copyleft assertiveness by software companies to the level that the FSF was already doing in Harald Welte launched gpl violations org br In late Bradley M Kuhn then executive director with the assistance of Moglen David Turner and Peter T Brown formalized these efforts into FSF s GPL Compliance Labs From high profile GPL enforcement cases such as those against Linksys and OpenTV became frequent br GPL enforcement and educational campaigns on GPL compliance was a major focus of the FSF s efforts during this period br In March SCO filed suit against IBM alleging that IBM s contributions to various free software including FSF s GNU violated SCO s rights While FSF was never a party to the lawsuit FSF was subpoenaed on November During and FSF put substantial advocacy effort into responding to the lawsuit and quelling its negative impact on the adoption and promotion of free software br From to FSF held legal seminars to explain the GPL and the surrounding law Usually taught by Bradley M Kuhn and Daniel Ravicher these seminars offered CLE credit and were the first effort to give formal legal education on the GPL br In the FSF published the third version of the GNU General Public License after significant outside input br In December FSF filed a lawsuit against Cisco for using GPL licensed components shipped with Linksys products Cisco was notified of the licensing issue in but Cisco repeatedly disregarded its obligations under the GPL In May Cisco and FSF reached settlement under which Cisco agreed to make a monetary donation to the FSF and appoint a Free Software Director to conduct continuous reviews of the company s license compliance practices br In September Richard Stallman resigned as president of the FSF after pressure from journalists and members of the open source community in response to him making controversial comments in defense of Marvin Minsky on Jeffrey Epstein s sex trafficking scandal Nevertheless Stallman remained head of the GNU Project and in he returned to the FSF board of directors br br br Current and ongoing activities br br br The GNU Project br br The original purpose of the FSF was to promote the ideals of free software The organization envisaged the GNU operating system as an example of this br br br GNU licenses br The GNU General Public License GPL is a widely used license for free software projects The current version version was released in June The FSF has also published the GNU Lesser General Public License LGPL the GNU Free Documentation License GFDL and the GNU Affero General Public License AGPL br br br GNU Press br The FSF s publishing department responsible for publishing affordable books on computer science using freely distributable licenses br br br The Free Software Directory br br This is a list of software packages that have been verified as free software Each package entry contains up to pieces of information such as the project s homepage developers programming language etc The goals are to provide a search engine for free software and to provide a cross reference for users to check if a package has been verified as being free software The FSF has received a small amount of funding from UNESCO for this project br br br Maintaining the Free Software Definition br br FSF maintains many of the documents that define the free software movement br br br Project hosting br FSF hosts software development projects on its Savannah website br br br h node br An abbreviation for Hardware Node the h node website lists hardware and device drivers that have been verified as compatible with free software It is user edited and volunteer supported with hardware entries tested by users before publication br br br Advocacy br FSF sponsors a number of campaigns against what it perceives as dangers to software freedom including software patents digital rights management which the FSF and others have re termed digital restrictions management as part of its effort to highlight technologies that are designed to take away and limit your rights and user interface copyright Since Defective by Design is an FSF initiated campaign against DRM It also has a campaign to promote Ogg Vorbis a free alternative to proprietary formats like AAC and MQA FSF also sponsors free software projects it deems high priority br br br Annual awards br br Outstanding new Free Software contributor Award for the Advancement of Free Software and Free Software Award for Projects of Social Benefit br br br LibrePlanet wiki br The LibrePlanet wiki organizes FSF members into regional groups in order to promote free software activism against Digital Restrictions Management and other issues promoted by the FSF br br br High priority projects br br The FSF maintains a list of high priority projects to which the Foundation claims that there is a vital need to draw the free software community s attention The FSF considers these projects important because computer users are continually being seduced into using non free software because there is no adequate free replacement br As of high priority tasks include reverse engineering proprietary firmware reversible debugging in GNU Debugger developing automatic transcription and video editing software Coreboot drivers for network routers a free smartphone operating system and creating replacements for Skype and Siri br Previous projects highlighted as needing work included the Free Java implementations GNU Classpath and GNU Compiler for Java which ensure compatibility for the Java part of OpenOffice org and the GNOME desktop environment see Java Licensing br The effort has been criticized by Michael Larabel for either not instigating active development or for being slow at the work being done even after certain projects were added to the list br br br Endorsements br br br Operating systems br The FSF maintains a list of approved Linux operating systems that maintain free software by default br br Dragora GNU Linux Libre br dyne bolic br GNU Guix System br Hyperbola GNU Linux libre br Parabola GNU Linux libre br PureOS br Trisquel br Ututo br LibreCMC br ProteanOS br The project also maintains a list of operating systems that are not versions of the GNU system br br Replicant br br br Discontinued operating systems br The following are previously endorsed operating systems that are no longer actively maintained br br gNewSense br BLAG Linux and GNU br Musix GNU Linux br br br Hardware endorsements RYF br br Since the FSF maintains a Respects Your Freedom RYF hardware certification program To be granted certification a product must use Free Software allow user installation of modified software be free of backdoors and conform with several other requirements br br br Structure br br br Board

maintain the Foundation s long term future through economic stability br The FSF is a tax exempt organization and posts annual IRS Form filings online br br br Criticism br br br Position on DRM br Linus Torvalds has criticized FSF for using GPLv as a weapon in the fight against DRM Torvalds argues that the issue of DRM and that of a software license should be treated as two separate issues br br br Defective by Design campaign br On June Joe Brockmeier a journalist at Linux Magazine criticized the Defective by Design campaign by the FSF as negative and juvenile and not being adequate for providing users with credible alternatives to proprietary software FSF responded to this criticism by saying that there is a fundamental difference between speaking out against policies or actions and smear campaigns and that if one is taking an ethical position it is justified and often necessary to not only speak about the benefits of freedom but against acts of dispossession and disenfranchisement br br br GNU LibreDWG license controversy br In a license update of LibDWG LibreDWG to version of the GNU GPL made it impossible for the free software projects LibreCAD and FreeCAD to use LibreDWG legally Many projects voiced their unhappiness about the GPLv license selection for LibreDWG such as FreeCAD LibreCAD Assimp and Blender Some suggested the selection of a license with a broader license compatibility for instance the MIT BSD or LGPL A request went to the FSF to relicense GNU LibreDWG as GPLv which was rejected in br The libDWG has stalled since for various reasons including license issues br br br Accusations against Richard Stallman br Stallman resigned from the board in after making controversial comments about one of the victims of Jeffrey Epstein but rejoined the board months later Several prominent organizations and individuals who develop free software objected to the decision citing past writings on Stallman s blog which they considered antithetical to promoting a diverse community As a result of Stallman s reinstatement prominent members of the Free Software Foundation quit in protest and Red Hat announced that it would stop funding and supporting the Free Software Foundation br br br Recognition br br Key players and industries that have made honorific mention and awards include br br GNU Project received the USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award for the ubiquity breadth and quality of its freely available redistributable and modifiable software which has enabled a generation of research and commercial development br Prix Ars
