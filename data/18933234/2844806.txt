Gnash is a media player for playing SWF files Gnash is available both as a standalone player for desktop computers and embedded devices as well as a plugin for the browsers still supporting NPAPI It is part of the GNU Project and is a free and open source alternative to Adobe Flash Player It was developed from the gameswf project br Gnash was first announced in late by software developer John Gilmore As of the project s maintainer is Rob Savoye The main developer s web site for Gnash is located on the Free Software Foundation s GNU Savannah project support server br Gnash supports most SWF v features and some SWF v and v however SWF v is not supported br br br History br Writing a free software Flash player has been a priority of the GNU Project for some time Prior to the launch of Gnash the GNU Project had asked for people to assist the GPLFlash project The majority of the previous GPLFlash developers have now moved to the Gnash project and the existing GPLFlash codebase will be refocused towards supporting embedded systems br The primary distribution terms for Gnash are those of the GNU GPL However since Gnash was started using the codebase of the gameswf project which is in the public domain code developed by the Gnash project which might be useful in gameswf is placed in the public domain br br br Technical details br br br Architecture br Adobe only provides an outdated version of its official player for Linux on IA and an AMD developer preview release in a binary only form Gnash however can be compiled and executed on many architectures including x ARM MIPS and PowerPC It also supports BSD based operating systems An early port for RISC OS which has never had Macromedia Adobe Flash support beyond Flash does exist as well as an early port for BeOS where Flash support terminated at Version Development of a port to AmigaOS has also begun A port to the Haiku Operating System also exists br Gnash requires one of AGG Cairo or OpenGL for rendering In contrast to most GNU projects which are typically written in C Gnash is written in the C programming language because of its gameswf heritage br br br Flash compatibility br Gnash can play SWF files up to version and of ActionScript br The goal of the Gnash developers is to be as compatible as possible with the proprietary player including behavior on bad ActionScript code However Gnash offers some special features not available in the Adobe player such as the possibility to extend the ActionScript classes via shared libraries sample extensions include MySQL support file system access and more For security reasons the extension mechanism must be compiled in explicitly and enabled via configuration files br br br Video support br br Gnash supports playback of FLV videos and allows playing some FLV files from YouTube Myspace ShowMeDo and other similar websites older files with sound newer files without playing sound FLV support requires FFmpeg or GStreamer to be installed on the system br Some other free software programs such as MPlayer VLC media player or players for Windows based on the ffdshow DirectShow codecs can play back the FLV format if the file is specially downloaded or piped to it br Version was released August Rob Savoye announced that Gnash should now work with all YouTube videos Version has GPU support which pushed it ahead of the proprietary Adobe Flash Player in Linux until Flash came out with hardware acceleration built in Gnash still suffers from high CPU usage A Flashblock plugin can be installed by the user turning on the Flash support on a case by case as needed basis YouTube video controls and full screen mode is functioning although version has a bug that can cause YouTube to display Invalid parameters Many popular Flash games do not work with Gnash br br br Cygnal br Cygnal is the Gnash Project s Flash Media Server compatible audio and video server It handles negotiating the copyright metadata exchange as well as streaming the content It will need to handle many thousands of simultaneous network connection and support running on large Linux clusters It should support handling multiple streams with differing content as well as a multicast stream with a single data source br Due to the patent issues surrounding MP and the fact that FLV and ON are closed formats one of the main goals of this project is to support free codes and free protocols as the primary way of doing things There is an optional support for MP FLV and ON VP and VP when playing existing Flash content Both FLV and the VP VP codecs are included in ffmpeg Users can use the ffmpeg plugin for GStreamer to use these proprietary codecs br br br Platform availability br Gnash has successfully run on Microsoft Windows Darwin OS X Irix Solaris BeOs OS and Haiku Gnash has also run on the following bit systems PowerPC Itanium UltraSparc and AMD br br br Microsoft Windows br Gnash has been ported to Windows and the plugin works best with Firefox or newer and should work in any Mozilla based browser However in newer browsers the plugin may become unstable or inoperative br Newer Gnash binaries for Windows do not include a plugin and currently there is no newer working Gnash plugin on Windows br br br Financial support br The project was financially supported by a commercial company Lulu com until July br As of March the lead developer reported donations were barely enough to pay for hosting the project on the web br br br Adobe Flash Player End User License Agreement br One problem for the project is the difficulty of finding developers The current developers have never installed Adobe s Flash player because they fear that anyone who has ever installed the Adobe Flash Player has at the same time accepted an agreement not to modify or reverse engineer Adobe Flash Player Therefore the Gnash project has only about active developers as of November br Such generic clauses however may be against national anticompetition laws when used in normal software license agreements On May the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in case C of SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd that the functionality of a computer program is not covered by copyright in the European Union and that contractual provisions are null and void if they forbid observing studying and testing a computer program in order to reproduce its behavior in a second program This holds as long as no source code or object code was copied br br br See also br br Free Software br Lightspark br Shumway software br Swfdec br Ruffle software br br
