The eMac short for education Mac is a discontinued all in one Mac desktop computer that was produced and designed by Apple Computer Released in it was originally aimed at the education market but was later made available as a cheaper mass market alternative to Apple s Sunflower iMac G The eMac was pulled from retail on October and was again sold exclusively to educational institutions thereafter It was discontinued by Apple on July and replaced by a cheaper low end iMac G that like the eMac was exclusively sold to educational institutions br The eMac design closely resembles the Snow iMac G though the eMac was only available in white slightly larger in size did not include a carry handle and was heavier than the preceding G weighing lb kg The unique shape of the computer was also similar to Apple s last CRT based inch Studio Display released in the last standalone CRT monitor Apple made The Apple eMac features a PowerPC G e processor that is significantly faster than the previous generation PowerPC G processor as well as a inch flat CRT display which was aimed at the education market as LCD screens would be expensive br br br Background br In Apple released the iMac G an all in one computer built around a cathode ray tube display The iMac was a major success for Apple selling more than five million units it also sold for as low as US making it the most affordable Mac model Apple offered In January Apple announced a successor to the iMac G the iMac G This iMac was built around a floating flat panel display and started at a higher price than the previous generation While a few models of the iMac G remained at lower price points they lacked power for educational tasks like video Education customers made up nearly a quarter of Apple s sales and with Windows based computers eating into Apple s market share of the sector Apple consulted with educators to build a cheaper G powered successor for the price conscious market br Apple announced the eMac on April to be sold only to education markets Apple had previously created education only computer models including the iMac predecessor Power Macintosh G All In One The machine s CRT screen made it cheaper than the iMac G the most expensive configuration was still cheaper than the cheapest iMac G and its bulk was intended to make it more resilient to wear and tear in a school setting than the fragile hinge and flat screen of the iMac br br br Design br br The eMac has a substantially similar design to the iMac G but features a larger inch mm inch viewable flat screen CRT monitor The larger screen has percent more viewing area than the iMac Thanks to the short necked CRT it takes up the same space as the iMac in fact it is a few millimeters shorter but also is heavier at pounds kg The computer is powered by a PowerPC G processor much faster than the G powered iMacs The machine s serial number and networking identification are printed on the front of the computer behind the optical drive door intended to make it easier for schools to track purchases RAM can be upgraded through a service hatch at the bottom of the computer Apple sold a separate acrylic tilt and swivel stand to enable changing the viewing angle of the screen br br br Release br After demand from consumers Apple announced on June that the eMac would be available through general retail Regular consumers did not get the same prices and configuration options as education customers for example education buyers could get a model without a modem br The eMac generally catered to the mass market eventually taking over the entry level previously held by the iMac G Macintosh from to while the iMac G was positioned as a premium offering throughout the lifetime of the eMac line The eMac generally offered similar performance and features to the iMac G while they were sold side by side The eMac was gradually supplanted by the iMac G in to br In October MHz model was eliminated as a standard configuration and the GHz model was brought down in price This revision was the last in the line to officially run Apple s OS operating system natively br The next revision to the eMac line came in April with DDR SDRAM a faster processor running at GHz and a better ATI Radeon video chipset The most recent revision came in May with an even faster CPU running at GHz Radeon graphics and larger standard hard disk br On October Apple once again restricted sales of the eMac to educational institutions and returned to its E is for Education marketing plan that had been attached to the product from the original restriction to education buyers The company re implemented this restrictive measure for unspecified reasons Some analysts believe Apple wanted to force the general public to purchase the more expensive Mac Mini or iMac which had higher profit margins Also the eMac was the only CRT display product left in Apple s lineup which made it somewhat bulky compared to new offerings which had compact form factors due to their LCD screens The falling cost of LCD displays would also gradually bring down the prices of the iMac G However the eMac was still available for sale to the general public through some third party retailer websites br On July the entire eMac line was discontinued An educational configuration of the iMac Core Duo was introduced that same day which had a Combo drive rather than a SuperDrive and a smaller GB hard disk br Early eMac models natively boot Mac OS and Mac OS X beginning with OS X while later models only officially boot Mac OS X GHz and faster models cannot boot OS while eMacs slower than GHz do not officially support requirements are an MHz G with MB RAM br br br Reception br The eMac was generally well received Macworld s Jason Snell wrote that the eMac served as a worthy successor to the iMac G Criticism of the initial release version was that the low amount of installed RAM MB was not sufficient for Mac OS X br br br Technical problems br A number of early eMac machines have suffered from what was known as Raster Shift a phenomenon where the bottom third or half of the screen goes black with the rest of image shifting upward and beyond the top boundary of the display Serious static also accompanies the problem rendering the viewable part of the screen virtually useless In response to the problem Apple offered a solution which involved the replacement of the video cable inside the eMac s case br Certain models of eMac also suffered from capacitor plague that caused video distortion or the computer to lock up Apple responded to these issues by implementing a warranty extension program br br br Technical specifications br All are standard configurations from Apple unless otherwise noted br According to Apple all of these models are obsolete br br br Timeline of eMac models br br br Notes br br br br br Michaels Philip March The iMac Flat is Where It s At Macworld No Special Report pp ISSN br Musilek
