Gosling Emacs often shortened to Gosmacs or gmacs is a discontinued Emacs implementation written in by James Gosling in C br Gosling initially allowed Gosling Emacs to be redistributed with no formal restrictions as required by the Emacs commune since the s only asking for a letter acknowledging his authorship Later wishing to move on and after a failed search for people who would maintain it under the same rights he finally sold his version of Emacs to UniPress because they agreed to sell it under reasonable terms The dispute between Richard Stallman and UniPress inspired the creation of the first formal license for Emacs which later became the GPL as Congress had introduced copyright for software in br br br Features br Gosling Emacs was especially noteworthy because of the effective redisplay code which used a dynamic programming technique to solve the classical string to string correction problem The algorithm was quite sophisticated that section of the source was headed by a skull and crossbones in ASCII art warning any would be improver that even if they thought they understood how the display code worked they probably did not br br br Distribution br Since Gosling had permitted its unrestricted redistribution Richard Stallman used some Gosling Emacs code in the initial version of GNU Emacs Among other things he rewrote part of the Gosling code headed by the skull and crossbones comment and made it shorter faster clearer and more extensible br In UniPress began selling Gosling Emacs on Unix for and on VMS for marketing it as EMACS multi window text editor Gosling version br Controversially Unipress asked Stallman to stop distributing his version of Emacs for Unix br UniPress never took legal action against Stallman or his nascent Free Software Foundation believing hobbyists and academics could never produce an Emacs that could compete with their product All Gosling Emacs code was removed from GNU Emacs by version July with the possible exception of a few particularly involved sections of the display code The latest versions of GNU Emacs since August do not feature the skull and crossbones warning br br br Extension language br Its extension language Mocklisp has a syntax that appears similar to Lisp but Mocklisp does not have lists only strings and arrays The Mocklisp interpreter built by Gosling and a collaborator was replaced by a full Lisp interpreter in GNU Emacs br br br br br Christopher Kelty EMACS grep and UNIX authorship invention and translation in software https web archive org web http www burlingtontelecom net ashawley gnu emacs ConText Kelty pdf
