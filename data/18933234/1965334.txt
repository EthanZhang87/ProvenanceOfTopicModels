Markus Hess is a German hacker who was active in the s Alongside Dirk Brzezinski and Peter Carl Hess hacked into networks of military and industrial computers based in the United States Europe and East Asia and sold the information to the Soviet KGB for US During his time working for the KGB Hess is estimated to have broken into U S military computers The hacked material included sensitive semiconductor satellite space and aircraft technologies br br br Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory br Hess s hacking activities were discovered in by Clifford Stoll an astronomer turned system administrator of the computer center of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory LBL in California Stoll s first job duty was to track a cent accounting error in the LBL system Early in his investigation Stoll discovered that the LBL computer system was compromised and that the hacker had obtained root or system privileges Such a security compromise was more important than the accounting error Stoll eventually discovered how the hacker broke in and identified the hacker s activities on the system LBL management considered attempting to seal off the system from this hacker but Stoll and his colleagues convinced LBL s management that this would not be effective Ultimately they installed a honeypot to ensnare the hacker br br br Getting in br Hess initial activities started at the University of Bremen in Germany through the German Datex P network via satellite link or transatlantic cable to the Tymnet International Gateway Tymnet was a gateway service that a user called into that routed them to any one of a number of computer systems that also used the service Tymnet was one of a number of services available that provided local telephone numbers where directly accessing the computer would have been a long distance call Users normally used packet switching services like Tymnet for their lower costs Once he accessed Tymnet Hess branched out to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena California and to the Tymnet Switching System It was through this switching system that he accessed the LBL computers br Hess was able to attack U S military computers by using LBL to piggyback to ARPANET and MILNET ARPANET was a civilian wide area network created by the Department of Defense which would later become what is now known as the Internet MILNET was its military counterpart br br br Targets br The facilities that Hess breached included br br SRI International Menlo Park California U S br U S Army Darcom Seckenheim West Germany br Fort Buckner Camp Foster Okinawa Prefecture Japan br U S Army th Infantry Fort Stewart Georgia U S br U S Navy Coastal Systems Computer Panama City Florida U S br U S Air Force Ramstein Air Base West Germany br Massachusetts Institute of Technology MX Computer Cambridge Massachusetts U S br OPTIMIS Database The Pentagon U S br United States Air Force Systems Command El Segundo California U S br Anniston Army Depot Anniston Alabama U S br br br Tracking Hess and his capture br Stoll with the help of local authorities traced the call to a Tymnet switch in Oakland California Because the call came from Oakland rather than Berkeley it was obvious that the hacker was not working local to the university Tymnet officials helped LBL trace the various calls even though the hacker attempted to conceal their origin Enlisting the aid of AT T and the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI Stoll eventually determined that the calls were being piggybacked across the United States but originated from Hanover Germany br Stoll trapped Hess by creating records of a bogus military project conducted on LBL computers according to The Cuckoo s Egg he and his girlfriend conceived this plan while showering giving it the unofficial name of Operation Showerhead While the bogus information was convincing the primary goal was simply to keep the hacker connected long enough to trace his connection and with the hope that the hacker might send a written request for further information listed as available in hard copy This simple technique worked a request for the additional information was received from a Pittsburgh Pennsylvania address br At the time this type of hacking was unheard of and it was a considerable challenge to get the cooperation of the FBI and the West German government Eventually the West German authorities were able to break in and arrest Hess Hess went to trial in and Stoll testified against him Hess was found guilty of espionage and was given a month suspended sentence br br br Literature and films br After Hess s capture Stoll wrote about his efforts to track and locate Hess in a technical paper Stalking the Wily Hacker for the journal Communications of the ACM br and a book br The Cuckoo s Egg for the general public br The Cuckoo s Egg was adapted into a Nova episode The KGB The Computer and Me br a semi fictional German movie about the incident merges Hess with another hacker
