James Gosling born May is a Canadian computer scientist best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language br Gosling was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in for the conception and development of the architecture for the Java programming language and for contributions to window systems br br br Early life br Gosling attended William Aberhart High School in Calgary Alberta While in high school he wrote some of the software to analyze data from the ISIS satellite working for the University of Calgary physics department He received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Calgary and his M A and Ph D from Carnegie Mellon University all in computer science He wrote a version of Emacs called Gosling Emacs Gosmacs while working toward his doctorate He built a multi processor version of Unix for a way computer system while at Carnegie Mellon University before joining Sun Microsystems He also developed several compilers and mail systems there br Gosling has two children Katie and Kelsey who are half siblings from his two marriages br br br Career contributions br Gosling was with Sun Microsystems between and years At Sun he invented an early Unix windowing system called NeWS which became a lesser used alternative to the still used X Window System because Sun did not give it an open source license br He is known as the father of the Java programming language He got the idea for the Java VM while writing a program to port software from a PERQ by translating Perq Q Code to VAX assembler and emulating the hardware He is generally credited with having invented the Java programming language in br He created the original design of Java and implemented the language s original compiler and virtual machine Gosling traces the origins of the approach to his early graduate student days when he created a p code virtual machine for the lab s DEC VAX computer so that his professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal In the work leading to Java at Sun he saw that architecture neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved by implementing a similar philosophy always program for the same virtual machine br Another contribution of Gosling s was co writing the bundle program known as shar a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike s book The Unix Programming Environment br He left Sun Microsystems on April after it was acquired by the Oracle Corporation citing reductions in pay status and decision making ability along with change of role and ethical challenges He has since taken a very critical stance towards Oracle in interviews noting that during the integration meetings between Sun and Oracle where we were being grilled about the patent situation between Sun and Google we could see the Oracle lawyer s eyes sparkle He clarified his position during the Oracle v Google trial over Android While I have differences with Oracle in this case they are in the right Google totally slimed Sun We were all really disturbed even Jonathan Schwartz he just decided to put on a happy face and tried to turn lemons into lemonade which annoyed a lot of folks at Sun However he approved of the court s ruling that APIs should not be copyrightable br In March Gosling joined Google Six months later he followed his colleague Bill Vass and joined a startup called Liquid Robotics In late Liquid Robotics was acquired by Boeing Following the acquisition Gosling left Liquid Robotics to work at Amazon Web Services as Distinguished Engineer in May He retired in July br He is an advisor at the Scala company Lightbend Independent Director at Jelastic and Strategic Advisor for Eucalyptus and is a board member of DIRTT Environmental Solutions br br br Awards br For his achievement the National Academy of Engineering in the United States elected him as a Foreign Associate member br br awarded The Economist Innovation Award br awarded The Flame Award USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award br made an Officer of the Order of Canada The Order is Canada s second highest civilian honor Officers are the second highest grade within the Order br became a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery br awarded IEEE John von Neumann Medal br named a Computer History Museum Fellow for the conception design and implementation of the Java programming language
