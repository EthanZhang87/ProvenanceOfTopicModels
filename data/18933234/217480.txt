title: Penance
id: 217480
Penance is any act or a set of actions done out of repentance for sins committed as well as an alternate name for the Catholic Lutheran Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox sacrament of Reconciliation or Confession It also plays a part in confession among Anglicans and Methodists in which it is a rite as well as among other Protestants br The word penance derives from Old French and Latin paenitentia both of which derive from the same root meaning repentance a sincere change of heart and feeling of remorse contrition Penance and repentance similar in their derivation and original sense have come to represent conflicting views of the essence of repentance arising from the controversy in the Protestant Reformation as to the respective merits of faith and good works br According to dictionary definitions the primary meaning of penance is the deeds done out of penitence Like the latter repentance refers to the genuine interior sorrow for one s hurtful words or actions Only repentance implies a purpose of amendment the resolve to avoid such hurtful behavior in the future The words true and firm might be added to all but penance to specify the depth of change in one s hurtful attitude Contrition is the state of feeling remorseful and can describe both the show of deepest regret and the firmest sorrow for one s wrongdoings br br br Christianity br br br Penance as a religious attitude br br Protestant Reformers upholding the doctrine of justification by faith alone held that repentance consisted in a change of the whole moral attitude of the mind and soul Matthew Luke and that the divine forgiveness preceded true repentance and confession to God without any reparation of works In his Of Justification By Faith Calvin says without forgiveness no man is pleasing to God Nonetheless in traditions formed by a Calvinist or Zwinglian sensibility there has traditionally been a stress on reconciliation as a precondition to fellowship br br Typically in the non Protestant view the attitude of penance or repentance can be externalized in acts that a believer imposes on themselves acts that are called penances Penitential activity is particularly common during the season of Lent and Holy Week In some cultural traditions this week which commemorates the Passion of Christ may be marked by penances that include flagellantism or even voluntary pseudo crucifixion Advent is another season during which to a lesser extent penances are performed Acts of self discipline are used as tokens of repentance Easier acts of self discipline include devoting time to prayer or reading of the Bible or other spiritual books Examples of harder acts of self discipline are fasting continence abstaining from alcohol or tobacco or other privations Self flagellation and the wearing of a cilice are more rarely used Such acts have sometimes been called mortification of the flesh a phrase inspired by Romans If you live according to the flesh you will die but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live br Such acts are associated also with the Sacrament of Penance In the New Testament there is no codified ritual described for reconciliation except with God through baptism Confession of sins to one another for the sake of healing is mentioned in the Epistle of James With the delay of the expected Second Coming there was a recognized need for a means of accepting back into the Christian community those who had been expelled for serious sins In early Christianity bishops declared that God had forgiven sins when it was clear that there was repentance and the penitent was readmitted to the community Today the act of penance or satisfaction imposed in connection with the sacrament for the same therapeutic purpose can consist of set prayers or a certain number of prostrations or an act or omission intended to reinforce what is positive in the penitent s behaviour or to inhibit what is negative The act imposed is itself called a penance or epitemia br br br Penance as a sacrament or rite br br br Eastern Orthodox Church br br In the Eastern Orthodox Church penance is usually called Sacred Mystery of Confession In Orthodoxy the intention of the sacramental mystery of Holy Confession is to provide reconciliation with God through means of healing br Similar to the Eastern Catholic Churches in the Eastern Orthodox Church there are no confessionals Traditionally the penitent stands or kneels before either the Icon of Christ the Teacher to the viewers right of the Royal Door or in front of an Icon of Christ Not Made by Hands This is because in Orthodox sacramental theology confession is not made to the priest but to Christ the priest being there as a witness friend and advisor On an analogion in front of the penitent has been placed a Gospel Book and a Crucifix The penitent venerates the Gospel Book and the cross and kneels This is to show humility before the whole church and before Christ Once they are ready to start the priest says Blessed is our God always now and ever and unto the ages of ages reads the Trisagion Prayers and the Psalm in the Septuagint in the KJV this is Psalm br The priest then advises the penitent that Christ is invisibly present and that the penitent should not be embarrassed or be afraid but should open up their heart and reveal their sins so that Christ may forgive them The penitent then accuses themselves of sins The priest quietly and patiently listens gently asking questions to encourage the penitent not to withhold any sins out of fear or shame After the confessant reveals all their sins the priest offers advice and counsel The priest may modify the prayer rule of the penitent or even prescribe another rule if needed to combat the sins the penitent struggles most with Penances known as epitemia are given with a therapeutic intent so they are opposite to the sin committed br Epitemia are neither a punishment nor merely a pious action but are specifically aimed at healing the spiritual ailment that has been confessed For example if the penitent broke the Eighth Commandment by stealing something the priest could prescribe they return what they stole if possible and give alms to the poor on a more regular basis Opposites are treated with opposites If the penitent suffers from gluttony the confessant s fasting rule is reviewed and perhaps increased The intention of Confession is never to punish but to heal and purify Confession is also seen as a second baptism and is sometimes referred to as the baptism of tears br In Orthodoxy Confession is seen as a means to procure better spiritual health and purity Confession does not involve merely stating the sinful things the person does the good things a person does or is considering doing are also discussed The approach is holistic examining the full life of the confessant The good works do not earn salvation but are part of a psychotherapeutic treatment to preserve salvation and purity Sin is treated as a spiritual illness or wound only cured through Jesus Christ The Orthodox belief is that in Confession the sinful wounds of the soul are to be exposed and treated in the open air in this case the Spirit of God Note the fact that the Greek word for Spirit can be translated as air in motion or wind br Once the penitent has accepted the therapeutic advice and counsel freely given to them by the priest then placing his epitrachelion over the head of the confessant the priest says the prayer of forgiveness over the penitent In the prayer of forgiveness the priests asks of God to forgive the sins committed He then concludes by placing his hand on the head of the penitent and says The Grace of the All Holy Spirit through my insignificance has loosened and granted to you forgiveness br In summary the Priest reminds the penitent what they have received is a second baptism through the Mystery of Confession and that they should be careful not to defile this restored purity but to do good and to hear the voice of the psalmist Turn from evil and do good Psalm Most importantly the priest urges the penitent to guard themselves from sin and to commune as often as permitted The priest dismisses the repentant one in peace br br br Anglicanism br Private confession of sins to a priest followed by absolution has always been provided for in the Book of Common Prayer In the Communion Service of the English Prayer Book for example we read br br And because it is requisite that no man should come to the holy Communion but with a full trust in God s mercy and with a quiet conscience therefore if there be any of you who by this means that is by personal confession of sins cannot quiet his own conscience herein but requireth further comfort or counsel let him come to me or to some other discreet and learned Minister of God s Word and open his grief that by the ministry of God s holy Word he may receive the benefit of absolution together with ghostly counsel and advice to the quieting of his conscience and avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness br The status of confession as a special friend sacrament is stated in Anglican formularies such as the Thirty Nine Articles Article XXV includes it among Those five commonly called Sacraments which are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God It is important to note however that commonly called Sacraments does not mean wrongly called Sacraments and that the Article merely distinguishes confession and the other rites from the two great Sacraments of the Gospel br Until the Prayer Book revisions of the s and the creation of Alternative Service Books in various Anglican provinces the penitential rite was always part of larger services Prior to the revision private confessions would be according to the form of Ministry to the Sick The form of absolution provided in the order for the Visitation of the Sick reads Our Lord Jesus Christ who hath left power to his Church to absolve all sinners who truly repent and believe in him of his great mercy forgive thee thine offences And by his authority committed to me I absolve thee from all thy sins In the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Amen br Despite the provision for private confession in every edition of the Book of Common Prayer the practice was frequently contested during the Ritualist controversies of the later nineteenth century br br br Methodism br br In the Methodist Church as with the Anglican Communion penance is defined by the Articles of Religion as one those Commonly called Sacraments but not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel also known as the five lesser sacraments John Wesley the founder of the Methodist Church held the validity of Anglican practice in his day as reflected in the Book of Common Prayer stating that We grant confession to men to be in many cases of use public in case of public scandal private to a spiritual guide for disburdening of the conscience and as a help to repentance Additionally per the recommendation of John Wesley Methodist class meetings traditionally meet weekly in order to confess sins to one another The Book of Worship of The United Methodist Church contains the rite for private confession and absolution in A Service of Healing II in which the minister pronounces the words In the name of Jesus Christ you are forgiven some Methodist churches have regularly scheduled auricular confession and absolution while others make it available upon request Since Methodism holds the office of the keys to belong to all baptized persons private confession does not necessarily need to be made to a pastor and therefore lay confession is permitted although this is not the norm Near the time of death many Methodists confess their sins and receive absolution from an ordained minister in addition to being anointed In Methodism the minister is bound by the Seal of the Confessional with The Book of Discipline stating All clergy of The United Methodist Church are charged to maintain all confidences inviolate including confessional confidences any confessor who divulges information revealed in confession is subject to being defrocked in accordance with canon law As with Lutheranism in the Methodist tradition corporate confession is the most common practice with the Methodist liturgy including prayers of confession assurance and pardon The traditional confession of The Sunday Service the first liturgical text used by Methodists comes from the service of Morning Prayer in The Book of Common Prayer The confession of one s sin is particularly important before receiving Holy Communion the official United Methodist publication about the Eucharist titled This Holy Mystery states that br br We respond to the invitation to the Table by immediately confessing our personal and corporate sin trusting that If we confess our sins He who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness John Our expression of repentance is answered by the absolution in which forgiveness is proclaimed In the name of Jesus Christ you are forgiven br Many Methodists like other Protestants regularly practice confession of their sin to God himself holding that When we do confess our fellowship with the Father is restored He extends His parental forgiveness He cleanses us of all unrighteousness thus removing the consequences of the previously unconfessed sin We are back on track to realise the best plan that He has for our lives br br br Lutheranism br br The Lutheran Church teaches two key parts in repentance contrition and faith In mainstream Lutheranism the faithful often receive the sacrament of penance from a Lutheran priest before receiving the Eucharist Prior to going to Confessing and receiving Absolution the faithful are expected to examine their lives in light of the Ten Commandments The order of Confession and Absolution is contained in the Small Catechism as well as other liturgical books of the Lutheran Churches Lutherans typically kneel at the communion rails to confess their sins while the confessor a Lutheran priest listens and then offers absolution while laying their stole on the penitent s head Clergy are prohibited from revealing anything said during private Confession and Absolution per the Seal of the Confessional and face excommunication if it is violated In Laestadian Lutheranism penitent sinners in accordance with the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers practice lay confession confess ing their transgressions to other church members who can then absolve the penitent br br br Catholicism br The Catholic Church uses the term penance in a number of separate but related instances a as a moral virtue b as a sacrament c as acts of satisfaction and d as those specific acts of satisfaction assigned the penitent by the confessor in the context of the sacrament These have as in common the concept that the person who sins must repent and as far as possible make reparation to divine justice br br br A moral virtue br Penance is a moral virtue whereby the sinner is disposed to hatred of their sin as an offence against God and to a firm purpose of amendment and satisfaction The principal act in the exercise of this virtue is the detestation of one s own sin The motive of this detestation is that sin offends God Theologians following Thomas Aquinas Summa III Q lxxxv a regard penance as truly a virtue though they have disagreed regarding its place among the virtues Some have classed it with the virtue of charity others with the virtue of religion Bonaventure saw it as a part of the virtue of justice Cajetan seems to have considered it as belonging to all three however most theologians agree with Aquinas that penance is a distinct virtue virtus specialis br br Penance as a virtue resides in the will Since it is a part of the cardinal virtue of justice it can operate in a soul which has lost the virtue of charity by mortal sin However it cannot exist in a soul which has lost the virtue of faith since without faith all sense of the just measure of the injustice of sin is lost It urges the individual to undergo punishment for the sake of repairing the order of justice when motivated by even an ordinary measure of supernatural charity it infallibly obtains the forgiveness of venial sins and their temporal punishments when motivated by that extraordinary measure which is called perfect charity love of God for his own sake it obtains the forgiveness of even mortal sins when it desires simultaneously to seek out the Sacrament of penance as soon as possible and of large quantities of temporal punishment br Penance while a duty is considered to be a gift in Catholicism as it is held that no person can do any penance worthy of God s consideration without God first giving the grace to do so Penance proclaims mankind s unworthiness in the face of God s condescension the indispensable disposition to God s grace for though sanctifying grace alone forgives and purges sins from the soul it is necessary that the individual consent to this action of grace by the work of the virtue of penance Penance helps to conquer sinful habits and builds generosity humility and patience br br br Sacrament of Penance br br According to the Catholic Catechism the process of repentance and conversion was described by Jesus in the parable of prodigal son In the Catholic Church the sacrament of penance also called reconciliation forgiveness confession and conversion is one of the two sacraments of healing Jesus Christ has willed that by this means the church should continue in the power of the Holy Spirit his work of healing and salvation Reconciliation with God is both the purpose and effect of this sacrament br Through the priest who is the minister of the sacrament and who acts not in his own name but on behalf of God confession of sins is made to God and absolution is received from God In this sacrament the sinner placing themselves before the merciful judgment of God anticipates in a certain way the judgment to which they will be subjected at the end of their earthly life br Essential to the sacrament are acts both by the sinner examination of conscience contrition with a determination not to sin again confession to a priest and performance of some act to repair the damage caused by sin and by the priest determination of the act of reparation to be performed and absolution among the penitent s acts contrition holds first place Serious sins mortal sins must be confessed within at most a year and always before receiving Holy Communion while confession of venial sins also is recommended br br br Assigned penance br The act of penance or satisfaction that the priest imposes helps the penitent to overcome selfishness to desire more strongly to live a holy life to be closer to Jesus and to show to others the love and compassion of Jesus It is part of the healing that the sacrament brings Sin injures and weakens the sinner himself as well as his relations with God and neighbour Absolution takes away sin but it does not remedy all the disorders sin has caused Raised up from sin the sinner must still recover his full spiritual health by doing something more to make amends for the sin he must make satisfaction for or expiate his sins This is done by prayer charity or an act of Christian asceticism The rite of the sacrament requires that the kind and extent of the satisfaction should be suited to the personal condition of each penitent so that each one may restore the order which he disturbed and through the corresponding remedy be cured of the sickness from which he suffered br Penance may consist of prayer works of mercy service of neighbor voluntary self denial sacrifices and above all the patient acceptance of the cross we all must bear Such penances help configure us to Christ who alone expiated our sins once for all br br br Penitential acts br br In the apostolic constitution Paenitemini Pope Paul VI said Penance therefore already in the Old Testament is a religious personal act which has as its aim love and surrender to God fasting for the sake of God not for one s own self The Church reaffirms the primacy of the religious and supernatural values of penitence values extremely suitable for restoring to the world today a sense of the presence of God and of His sovereignty over man and a sense of Christ and His salvation In Paenitemini it is affirmed that b y divine law all the faithful are required to do penance As from the fact of sin we Christians can claim no exception so from the obligation to penance we can seek no exemption Chapter of the Didache enjoined Christians to fast every Wednesday and Friday br The conversion of heart can be expressed in many ways Scripture and the Fathers insist above all on three forms fasting prayer and almsgiving which express conversion in relation to oneself to God and to others Also mentioned are efforts at reconciliation with one s neighbor and the practice of charity which covers a multitude of sins as in Peter Taking up one s cross each day and following Jesus is the surest way of penance br In the Liturgical year the seasons of Advent and Lent are particularly appropriate for penitential exercises such as voluntary self denial and fraternal sharing Under canon of the Code of Canon Law The penitential days and times in the universal Church are every Friday of the whole year and the season of Lent Canon states that The conference of bishops can determine more precisely the observance of fast and abstinence as well as substitute other forms of penance especially works of charity and exercises of piety in whole or in part for abstinence and fast br In the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops in a document titled Penitential Practices for Today s Catholics reiterated their decision to allow U S Catholics to substitute another form of penance for abstinence from meat on the Fridays outside of Lent While the document includes a list of suggested penitential practices the selection of a Friday penance is left to the individual br In Catholic bishops in England and Wales reversed their earlier decision to permit Catholics to practice a penance other than meat abstinence on Fridays They said in part The bishops wish to re establish the practice of Friday penance in the lives of the faithful as a clear and distinctive mark of their own Catholic identity It is important that all the faithful be united in a common celebration of Friday penance br It is held that if fasting honestly causes one to be unable to fulfill their required tasks it is uncharitable to fast and the law of fasting would not apply br Many acts of penance carry an indulgence which may be applied in behalf of the souls departed God alone knows what remains to be expiated The Church in granting an indulgence to the living exercises its jurisdiction over the dead it has no jurisdiction and therefore makes the indulgence available for them by way of suffrage per modum suffragii i e it petitions God to accept these works of satisfaction and in consideration thereof to mitigate or shorten the sufferings of the souls in Purgatory br br br Irvingism br In the Irvingian Churches such as the New Apostolic Church persons may confess their sins to an Apostle The Apostle is then able to take the confession and proclaim absolution A seal of confession ensures that confidentiality between the Apostle and Penitent is maintained In cases of grave urgency any priestly minister can hear confessions and pronounce absolutions Auricular confession is not necessary for forgiveness but it may provide peace if a believer feels burdened br br br Penance in Indian beliefs br br In Hinduism acts of hardship committed on oneself fasting lying on rocks heated by the Sun etc especially as part of an ascetic way of life as monk or wise man in order to attain a higher form of mental awareness through detachment from the earthly not punishing guilt or favours from god s are considered penance In Hinduism penance is widely discussed in Dharmasastra literature In the Gita there is a warning against excessive penance of a merely physical nature There is the special term Tapas for intense concentration that is like a powerful fire and this used to be sometimes translated as penance although the connotations are different br The Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba stated that When penance is carefully nourished and practiced it inevitably results in the mental revocation of undesirable modes of thought and conduct and makes one amenable to a life of
