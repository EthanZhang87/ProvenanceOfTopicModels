In computing WYSIWYG WIZ ee wig an acronym for what you see is what you get refers to software that allows content to be edited in a form that resembles its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product such as a printed document web page or slide presentation WYSIWYG implies a user interface that allows the user to view something very similar to the result while the document is being created In general WYSIWYG implies the ability to directly manipulate the layout of a document without having to type or remember names of layout commands br br br History br Before the adoption of WYSIWYG techniques text appeared in editors using the system standard typeface and style with little indication of layout margins spacing etc Users were required to enter special non printing control codes now referred to as markup code tags to indicate that some text should be in boldface italics or a different typeface or size In this environment there was very little distinction between text editors and word processors br These applications typically used an arbitrary markup language to define the codes tags Each program had its own special way to format a document and it was a difficult and time consuming process to change from one word processor to another br The use of markup tags and codes remains popular today in some applications due to their ability to store complex formatting information When the tags are made visible in the editor however they occupy space in the unformatted text and as a result can disrupt the desired layout and flow br Bravo a document preparation program for the Alto produced at Xerox PARC by Butler Lampson Charles Simonyi and colleagues in is generally considered to be the first program to incorporate the WYSIWYG technology displaying text with formatting e g with justification fonts and proportional spacing of characters The Alto monitor PPI based on the typographic unit was designed so that one full page of text could be seen and then printed on the first laser printers When the text was laid out on the screen PPI font metric files were used but when printed PPI files were used As a result one would occasionally find characters and words that are slightly off a problem that would continue up to this day br Bravo was released commercially and the software eventually included in the Xerox Star can be seen as a direct descendant of it br In late in parallel with but independent of the work at Xerox PARC Hewlett Packard developed and released the first commercial WYSIWYG software application for producing overhead slides or what today are referred to as presentation graphics The first release named BRUNO after an HP sales training puppet ran on the HP minicomputer taking advantage of HP HP s first bitmapped computer terminal BRUNO was then ported to the HP and re released as HP Draw br By MicroPro advertised that its WordStar word processor had WYSIWYG but its display was limited to displaying styled text in WYSIWYG fashion bold and italic text would be represented on screen instead of being surrounded by tags or special control characters In the Weekly Reader advertised its Stickybear educational software with the slogan what you see is what you get with photographs of its Apple II graphics but home computers of the s and early s lacked the sophisticated graphics capabilities necessary to display WYSIWYG documents meaning that such applications were usually confined to limited purpose high end workstations such as the IBM Displaywriter System that were too expensive for the general public to afford As improving technology allowed the production of cheaper bitmapped displays WYSIWYG software started to appear in more popular computers including LisaWrite for the Apple Lisa released in and MacWrite for the Apple Macintosh released in br The Apple Macintosh system was originally designed so that the screen resolution and the resolution of the ImageWriter dot matrix printers sold by Apple were easily scaled PPI for the screen and DPI for the printers Thus the scale and dimensions of the on screen display in programs such as MacWrite and MacPaint were easily translated to the printed output If the paper were held up to the screen the printed image would be the same size as the on screen image but at twice the resolution As the ImageWriter was the only model of printer physically compatible with the Macintosh printer port this created an effective closed system Later when Macs using external displays became available the resolution was fixed to the size of the screen to achieve DPI These resolutions often differed from the VGA standard resolutions common in the PC world at the time Thus while a Macintosh inch cm monitor had the same resolution as a PC a inch cm screen would be fixed at rather than the resolution used by PCs With the introduction of third party dot matrix printers as well as laser printers and multisync monitors resolutions deviated from even multiples of the screen resolution making true WYSIWYG harder to achieve br br br Etymology br The phrase what you see is what you get from which the acronym derives was a catchphrase popularized by Flip Wilson s drag persona Geraldine first appearing in September then regularly in the early s on The Flip Wilson Show The phrase was a statement demanding acceptance of Geraldine s entire personality and appearance br As it relates to computing there are multiple claims to first use of the phrase br br Around Karen Thacker the technophobe wife of Xerox hardware designer Charles Chuck Thacker was introduced to a Xerox Alto running Bravo and commented You mean what I see is what I get br In mid John W Seybold the founder of Seybold Publications and researchers at PARC incorporated Gypsy software into Bravo to create Bravo which allowed text to be printed as displayed Charles Simonyi and the other engineers appropriated Flip Wilson s popular phrase around that time br Barbara Beeton reports that the term was coined by Bill Tunnicliffe in a presentation at a committee meeting involving the Graphic Communications Association GCA the American Mathematical Society AMS and the Printing Industries of America PIA br br br Variations br Many variations are used only to illustrate a point or make a joke and have very limited real use Some that have been proposed include the following br br WYGIWYG what you get is what you get often used in a similar way to WYSIAYG WYSIMOLWYG or WYSINWYW br WYGIWYS what you get is what you see used in computing to describe an interaction paradigm in results oriented user interface The term was used by Jakob Nielsen to describe Microsoft Office s Ribbon interface br WYSIAWYG what you see is almost what you get similar to WYSIMOLWYG br WYSIAYG what you see is all you get used to point out that advanced users are sometimes limited by the user interface br WYSIMOLWYG what you see is more or less what you get recognizing that most WYSIWYG implementations are imperfect br WYSINWYW what you see is not what you want suggesting that Microsoft Word often controls the user not the other way around br WYSIWYW what you see is what you want used to describe GNU TeXmacs editing platform The abbreviation clarifies that unlike in WYSIWYG editors the user is able to customize WYSIWYW platforms to act possibly in part as manual typesetting programs such as TeX or troff br WYTIWYG what you think is what you get found in Ward Cunninghams Wiki the first user editable website meaning What we look for is often what we find Used as a principle for WackoWiki markup meaning that formatted output actually looks like you expect it to look br YAFIYGI you asked for it you got it used to describe a text command oriented document editing system that does not include WYSIWYG in reference to the fact that users of such systems often ask for something they did not really want It is considered to be the opposite of WYSIWYG The phrase was first used in this context in in the essay Real Programmers Don t Use Pascal to describe the TECO text editor system and began to be abbreviated circa br br br See also br
