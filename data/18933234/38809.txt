GNU Privacy Guard GnuPG or GPG is a free software replacement for Symantec s cryptographic software suite PGP The software is compliant with RFC the IETF standards track specification of OpenPGP Modern versions of PGP are interoperable with GnuPG and other OpenPGP compliant systems GnuPG is however expected as of April to break compliance with the upcoming revision of OpenPGP and thus with other implementations that will continue to comply br GnuPG is part of the GNU Project and received major funding from the German government in br br br Overview br GnuPG is a hybrid encryption software program because it uses a combination of conventional symmetric key cryptography for speed and public key cryptography for ease of secure key exchange typically by using the recipient s public key to encrypt a session key which is used only once This mode of operation is part of the OpenPGP standard and has been part of PGP from its first version br The GnuPG x series uses an integrated cryptographic library while the GnuPG x series replaces this with Libgcrypt br GnuPG encrypts messages using asymmetric key pairs individually generated by GnuPG users The resulting public keys may be exchanged with other users in a variety of ways such as Internet key servers They must always be exchanged carefully to prevent identity spoofing by corrupting public key owner identity correspondences It is also possible to add a cryptographic digital signature to a message so the message integrity and sender can be verified if a particular correspondence relied upon has not been corrupted br GnuPG also supports symmetric encryption algorithms By default GnuPG uses the AES symmetrical algorithm since version CAST was used in earlier versions GnuPG does not use patented or otherwise restricted software or algorithms Instead GnuPG uses a variety of other non patented algorithms br For a long time it did not support the IDEA encryption algorithm used in PGP It was in fact possible to use IDEA in GnuPG by downloading a plugin for it however this might require a license for some uses in countries in which IDEA was patented Starting with versions and GnuPG supports IDEA because the last patent of IDEA expired in Support of IDEA is intended to get rid of all the questions from folks either trying to decrypt old data or migrating keys from PGP to GnuPG and hence is not recommended for regular use br More recent releases of GnuPG x modern and the now deprecated stable series expose most cryptographic functions and algorithms Libgcrypt its cryptography library provides including support for elliptic curve cryptography ECDH ECDSA and EdDSA in the modern series i e since GnuPG br br br Algorithms br As of or versions GnuPG supports the following algorithms br

was initially developed by Werner Koch The first production version version was released on September almost two years after the first GnuPG release version The German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology funded the documentation and the port to Microsoft Windows in br GnuPG is a system compliant to the OpenPGP standard thus the history of OpenPGP is of importance it was designed to interoperate with PGP an email encryption program initially designed and developed by Phil Zimmermann br On February a GnuPG crowdfunding effort closed raising for a new website and infrastructure improvements br br br Branches br Since the release of a stable GnuPG starting with version in October three stable branches of GnuPG are actively maintained br br A stable branch which currently is as of the branch br A LTS long term support branch which currently is as of the branch which was formerly called modern branch in comparison to the branch br The old legacy branch formerly called classic branch which is and will stay the branch br Before GnuPG two stable branches of GnuPG were actively maintained br br Modern with numerous new features such as elliptic curve cryptography compared to the former stable branch which it replaced with the release of GnuPG on August It was initially released on November br Classic the very old but still maintained stand alone version most suitable for outdated or embedded platforms Initially released on December br Different GnuPG x versions e g from the and branches cannot be installed at the same time However it is possible to install a classic GnuPG version i e from the branch along with any GnuPG x version br Before the release of GnuPG modern the now deprecated stable branch was recommended for general use initially released on November This branch reached its end of life on December Its last version is released on December br Before the release of GnuPG all stable releases originated from a single branch i e before November no multiple release branches were maintained in parallel These former sequentially succeeding up to release branches were br br branch initially released on September with as the last version released on October br branch initially released on September with as the last version released on April br Note that before the release of GnuPG branches with an odd minor release number e g were development branches leading to a stable release branch with a higher version number e g hence branches and both belong to the modern series and both to the stable series while the branches and both belong to the classic series br With the release of GnuPG this nomenclature was altered to be composed of a stable and LTS branch from the modern series plus as the last maintained classic branch Also note that even or odd minor release numbers do not indicate a stable or development release branch anymore br br br Platforms br br Although the basic GnuPG program has a command line interface there exists various front ends that provide it with a graphical user interface For example GnuPG encryption support has been integrated into KMail and Evolution the graphical email clients found in KDE and GNOME the most popular Linux desktops There are also graphical GnuPG front ends for example Seahorse for GNOME and KGPG and Kleopatra for KDE br GPGTools provides a number of front ends for OS integration of encryption and key management as well as GnuPG installations via Installer packages for macOS GPG Suite installs all related OpenPGP applications GPG Keychain plugins GPG Mail and dependencies MacGPG along with GPG Services integration into macOS Services menu to use GnuPG based encryption br Instant messaging applications such as Psi and Fire can automatically secure messages when GnuPG is installed and configured Web based software such as Horde also makes use of it The cross platform extension Enigmail provides GnuPG support for Mozilla Thunderbird and SeaMonkey Similarly Enigform provides GnuPG support for Mozilla Firefox FireGPG was discontinued June br In g Code GmbH and Intevation GmbH released Gpg win a software suite that includes GnuPG for Windows GNU Privacy Assistant and GnuPG plug ins for Windows Explorer and Outlook These tools are wrapped in a standard Windows installer making it easier for GnuPG to be installed and used on Windows systems br br br Vulnerabilities br The OpenPGP standard specifies several methods of digitally signing messages In due to an error in a change to GnuPG intended to make one of those methods more efficient a security vulnerability was introduced It affected only one method of digitally signing messages only for some releases of GnuPG through and there were fewer than such keys listed on the key servers Most people did not use this method and were in any case discouraged from doing so so the damage caused if any since none has been publicly reported would appear to have been minimal Support for this method has been removed from GnuPG versions released after this discovery and later br Two further vulnerabilities were discovered in early the first being that scripted uses of GnuPG for signature verification may result in false positives the second that non MIME messages were vulnerable to the injection of data which while not covered by the digital signature would be reported as being part of the signed message In both cases updated versions of GnuPG were made available at the time of the announcement br In June a vulnerability CVE was discovered within Libgcrypt by Bernstein Breitner and others a library used by GnuPG which enabled a full key recovery for RSA and about more than th of RSA keys This side channel attack exploits the fact that Libgcrypt used a sliding windows method for exponentiation which leads to the leakage of exponent bits and to full key recovery Again an updated version of GnuPG was made available at the time of the announcement br In October the ROCA vulnerability was announced that affects RSA keys generated by YubiKey tokens which often are used with PGP GPG Many published PGP keys were found to be susceptible br Around June the SigSpoof attacks were announced These allowed an attacker to convincingly spoof digital signatures br In January Libgcrypt was released which was found to contain a severe bug that was simple to exploit A fix was released days later in Libgcrypt br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Official website br A Short History of the GNU Privacy Guard written by Werner Koch published on
