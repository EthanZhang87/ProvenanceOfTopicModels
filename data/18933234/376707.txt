title: R (programming language)
id: 376707
R is a programming language for statistical computing and data visualization It has been adopted in the fields of data mining bioinformatics and data analysis br The core R language is augmented by a large number of extension packages containing reusable code documentation and sample data br R software is open source and free software It is licensed by the GNU Project and available under the GNU General Public License It is written primarily in C Fortran and R itself Precompiled executables are provided for various operating systems br As an interpreted language R has a native command line interface Moreover multiple third party graphical user interfaces are available such as RStudio an integrated development environment and Jupyter a notebook interface br br br History br br R was started by professors Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman as a programming language to teach introductory statistics at the University of Auckland The language was inspired by the S programming language with most S programs able to run unaltered in R The language was also inspired by Scheme s lexical scoping allowing for local variables br The name of the language R comes from being both an S language successor as well as the shared first letter of the authors Ross and Robert In August Ihaka and Gentleman posted a binary of R on StatLib a data archive website At the same time they announced the posting on the s news mailing list On December R became a GNU project when version was released On February the first official version was released br br br Packages br br R packages are collections of functions documentation and data that expand R For example packages add report features such as RMarkdown Quarto knitr and Sweave Easy package installation and use have contributed to the language s adoption in data science br Base packages are immediately available when starting R and provide the necessary syntax and commands for programming computing graphics production basic arithmetic and statistical functionality br The Comprehensive R Archive Network CRAN was founded in by Kurt Hornik and Fritz Leisch to host R s source code executable files documentation and user created packages Its name and scope mimic the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network and the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network CRAN originally had three mirrors and contributed packages As of June it has mirrors and contributed packages Packages are also available on repositories R Forge Omegahat and GitHub br The Task Views on the CRAN website lists packages in fields such as finance genetics high performance computing machine learning medical imaging meta analysis social sciences and spatial statistics br The Bioconductor project provides packages for genomic data analysis complementary DNA microarray and high throughput sequencing methods br Packages add the capability to implement various statistical techniques such as linear generalized linear and nonlinear modeling classical statistical tests spatial analysis time series analysis and clustering br An example package is the tidyverse package Its focus is having a common interface around accessing and processing data contained in a data frame data structure a two dimensional table of rows and columns called tidy data Each function in the package is designed to couple together all the other functions in the package br Installing a package occurs only once To install tidyverse br br To instantiate the functions data and documentation of a package execute the library function To instantiate tidyverse br br br Interfaces br R comes installed with a command line console Available for installation are various integrated development environments IDE IDEs for R include R app OSX macOS only Rattle GUI R Commander RKWard RStudio and Tinn R br General purpose IDEs that support R include Eclipse via the StatET plugin and Visual Studio via R Tools for Visual Studio br Editors that support R include Emacs Vim via the Nvim R plugin Kate LyX via Sweave WinEdt website and Jupyter website br Scripting languages that support R include Python website Perl website Ruby source code F website and Julia source code br General purpose programming languages that support R include Java via the Rserve socket server and NET C website br Statistical frameworks which use R in the background include Jamovi and JASP br br br Community br The R Core Team was founded in to maintain the R source code The R Foundation for Statistical Computing was founded in April to provide financial support The R Consortium is a Linux Foundation project to develop R infrastructure br The R Journal is an open access academic journal which features short to medium length articles on the use and development of R It includes articles on packages programming tips CRAN news and foundation news br The R community hosts many conferences and in person meetups These groups include br br UseR an annual international R user conference website br Directions in Statistical Computing DSC website br R Ladies an organization to promote gender diversity in the R community website br SatRdays R focused conferences held on Saturdays website br R Conference website br posit conf formerly known as rstudio conf website br br br Implementations br The main R implementation is written primarily in C Fortran and R itself Other implementations include br br pretty quick R pqR by Radford M Neal attempts to improve memory management br Renjin is an implementation of R for the Java Virtual Machine br CXXR and Riposte are implementations of R written in C br Oracle s FastR is an implementation of R built on GraalVM br TIBCO Software creator of S PLUS wrote TERR an R implementation to integrate with Spotfire br Microsoft R Open MRO was an R implementation As of June Microsoft started to phase out MRO in favor of the CRAN distribution br br br Commercial support br br Although R is an open source project some companies provide commercial support br br Revolution Analytics provides commercial support for Revolution R br Oracle provides commercial support for the Big Data Appliance which integrates R into its other products br IBM provides commercial support for in Hadoop execution of R br br br Examples br br br Hello World br Hello World program br br br Basic syntax br The following examples illustrate the basic syntax of the language and use of the command line interface An expanded list of standard language features can be found in the R manual An Introduction to R br In R the generally preferred assignment operator is an arrow made from two characters although can be used in some cases br br br Structure of a function br One of R s strengths is the ease of creating new functions Objects in the function body remain local to the function and any data type may be returned In R almost all functions and all user defined functions are closures br Create a function br br Usage output br br It is possible to define functions to be used as infix operators with the special syntax name where name is the function variable name br br Since version functions can be written in a short notation which is useful for passing anonymous functions to higher order functions br br br Native pipe operator br In R version a native pipe operator was introduced This operator allows users to chain functions together one after another instead of a nested function call br br Another alternative to nested functions in contrast to using the pipe character is using intermediate objects However some argue that using the pipe operator will produce code that is easier to read br br br Object oriented programming br The R language has native support for object oriented programming There are two native frameworks the so called S and S systems The former being more informal supports single dispatch on the first argument and objects are assigned to a class by just setting a class attribute in each object The latter is a Common Lisp Object System CLOS like system of formal classes also derived from S and generic methods that supports multiple dispatch and multiple inheritance br In the example summary is a generic function that dispatches to different methods depending on whether its argument is a numeric vector or a factor br br br Modeling and plotting br br The R language has built in support for data modeling and graphics The following example shows how R can generate and plot a linear model with residuals br br Output br br br Mandelbrot set br br This Mandelbrot set example highlights the use of complex numbers It models the first iterations of the equation z z c where c represents different complex constants br Install the package that provides the write gif function beforehand br br R Source code br br br Version names br br All R version releases from onward have codenames that make reference to Peanuts comics and films br In core R developer Peter Dalgaard presented a history of R releases since Some notable early releases before the named releases include br br Version released on February a leap day br Version released on October which at least had a nice ring to it br The idea of naming R version releases was inspired by the Debian and Ubuntu version naming system Dalgaard also noted that another reason for the use of Peanuts references for R codenames is because everyone in statistics is a P nut br br br See also br Comparison of numerical analysis software br Comparison of statistical packages br List of
