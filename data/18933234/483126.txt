id: 483126
GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic operating on signed integers rational numbers and floating point numbers There are no practical limits to the precision except the ones implied by the available memory operands may be of up to bits on bit machines and bits on bit machines GMP has a rich set of functions and the functions have a regular interface The basic interface is for C but wrappers exist for other languages including Ada C C Julia NET OCaml Perl PHP Python R Ruby and Rust Prior to Kaffe a Java virtual machine used GMP to support Java built in arbitrary precision arithmetic Shortly after GMP support was added to GNU Classpath br The main target applications of GMP are cryptography applications and research Internet security applications and computer algebra systems br GMP aims to be faster than any other bignum library for all operand sizes Some important factors in doing this are br br Full words are the basic type for all arithmetic br Different algorithms are used for different operand sizes algorithms which are more efficient with large numbers are not used when dealing with small numbers br Assembly language specialized for different processors is used in the most common inner loops to optimize them as much as possible br The first GMP release was made in It is constantly developed and maintained br GMP is part of the GNU project although its website being off gnu org may cause confusion and is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License LGPL br GMP is used for integer arithmetic in many computer algebra systems such as Mathematica and Maple It is also used in the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library CGAL br GMP is needed to build the GNU Compiler Collection GCC br br br Examples br Here is an example of C code showing the use of the GMP library to multiply and print large numbers br br This code calculates the value of br Compiling and running this program gives this result The lgmp flag is used if compiling on Unix type systems br br For comparison one can write instead the following equivalent C program The lgmpxx lgmp flags are used if compiling on Unix type systems br br br Language bindings br br br See also br GNU MPFR a library for arbitrary precision computations with correct rounding based on GNU MP br CLN a class library for arbitrary precision br MPIR a fork of GMP not maintained any more br br br br br br External links br Official website
