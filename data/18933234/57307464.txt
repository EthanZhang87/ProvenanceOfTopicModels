A word processor WP is a device or computer program that provides for input editing formatting and output of text often with some additional features br Early word processors were stand alone devices dedicated to the function but current word processors are word processor programs running on general purpose computers br The functions of a word processor program fall somewhere between those of a simple text editor and a fully functioned desktop publishing program While the distinction between a text editor and a word processor is clear namely the capability of editing rich text the distinctions between a word processor and a desktop publishing program has become unclear as word processing software has gained features such as ligature support added to the version of Microsoft Word br Common word processor programs include LibreOffice Writer Google Docs and Microsoft Word br br br Background br Word processors developed from mechanical machines later merging with computer technology The history of word processing is the story of the gradual automation of the physical aspects of writing and editing and then to the refinement of the technology to make it available to corporations and Individuals br The term word processing appeared in American offices in the early s centered on the idea of streamlining the work to typists but the meaning soon shifted toward the automation of the whole editing cycle br At first the designers of word processing systems combined existing technologies with emerging ones to develop stand alone equipment creating a new business distinct from the emerging world of the personal computer The concept of word processing arose from the more general data processing which since the s had been the application of computers to business administration br Through history there have been three types of word processors mechanical electronic and software br br br Mechanical word processing br The first word processing device a Machine for Transcribing Letters that appears to have been similar to a typewriter was patented in by Henry Mill for a machine that was capable of writing so clearly and accurately you could not distinguish it from a printing press More than a century later another patent appeared in the name of William Austin Burt for the typographer In the late th century Christopher Latham Sholes created the first recognizable typewriter which was described as a literary piano br The only word processing these mechanical systems could perform was to change where letters appeared on the page to fill in spaces that were previously left on the page or to skip over lines It was not until decades later that the introduction of electricity and electronics into typewriters began to help the writer with the mechanical part The term word processing translated from the German word Textverarbeitung itself was possibly created in the s by Ulrich Steinhilper a German IBM typewriter sales executive or by an American electro mechanical typewriter executive George M Ryan who obtained a trademark registration in the USPTO for the phrase However it did not make its appearance in s office management or computing literature an example of grey literature though many of the ideas products and technologies to which it would later be applied were already well known Nonetheless by the term was recognized by the New York Times as a business buzz word Word processing paralleled the more general data processing or the application of computers to business administration br Thus by the discussion of word processing was common in publications devoted to business office management and technology by the mid s the term would have been familiar to any office manager who consulted business periodicals br br br Electromechanical and electronic word processing br By the late s IBM had developed the IBM MT ST Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter It was a model of the IBM Selectric typewriter from earlier in but it came built into its own desk integrated with magnetic tape recording and playback facilities along with controls and a bank of electrical relays The MT ST automated word wrap but it had no screen This device allowed a user to rewrite text that had been written on another tape and it also allowed limited collaboration in the sense that a user could send the tape to another person to let them edit the document or make a copy It was a revolution for the word processing industry In the tapes were replaced by magnetic cards These memory cards were inserted into an extra device that accompanied the MT ST able to read and record users work br Throughout the s and s word processing began to slowly shift from glorified typewriters augmented with electronic features to become fully computer based although only with single purpose hardware with the development of several innovations Just before the arrival of the personal computer PC IBM developed the floppy disk In the s the first proper word processing systems appeared which allowed display and editing of documents on CRT screens br During this era these early stand alone word processing systems were designed built and marketed by several pioneering companies Linolex Systems was founded in by James Lincoln and Robert Oleksiak Linolex based its technology on microprocessors floppy drives and software It was a computer based system for application in the word processing businesses and it sold systems through its own sales force With a base of installed systems in over sites Linolex Systems sold million units in a year before the Apple computer was released br At that time the Lexitron Corporation also produced a series of dedicated word processing microcomputers Lexitron was the first to use a full sized video display screen CRT in its models by Lexitron also used inch floppy diskettes which became the standard in the personal computer field The program disk was inserted in one drive and the system booted up The data diskette was then put in the second drive The operating system and the word processing program were combined in one file br Another of the early word processing adopters was Vydec which created in the first modern text processor the Vydec Word Processing System It had built in multiple functions like the ability to share content by diskette and print it The Vydec Word Processing System sold for at the time about adjusted for inflation br The Redactron Corporation organized by Evelyn Berezin in designed and manufactured editing systems including correcting editing typewriters cassette and card units and eventually a word processor called the Data Secretary The Burroughs Corporation acquired Redactron in br A CRT based system by Wang Laboratories became one of the most popular systems of the s and early s The Wang system displayed text on a CRT screen and incorporated virtually every fundamental characteristic of word processors as they are known today While early computerized word processor system were often expensive and hard to use that is like the computer mainframes of the s the Wang system was a true office machine affordable to organizations such as medium sized law firms and easily mastered and operated by secretarial staff br The phrase word processor rapidly came to refer to CRT based machines similar to Wang s Numerous machines of this kind emerged typically marketed by traditional office equipment companies such as IBM Lanier AES Data machines re badged CPT and NBI All were specialized dedicated proprietary systems with prices in the range Cheap general purpose personal computers were still the domain of hobbyists br br br Japanese word processor devices br In Japan even though typewriters with Japanese writing system had widely been used for businesses and governments they were limited to specialists and required special skills due to the wide variety of letters until computer based devices came onto the market In Sharp showcased a prototype of a computer based word processing dedicated device with Japanese writing system in Business Show in Tokyo br br Toshiba released the first Japanese word processor JW in February The price was JPY equivalent to US This is selected as one of the milestones of IEEE br br br br The Japanese writing system uses a large number of kanji logographic Chinese characters which require bytes to store so having one key per each symbol is infeasible Japanese word processing became possible with the development of the Japanese input method a sequence of keypresses with visual feedback which selects a character now widely used in personal computers Oki launched OKI WORD EDITOR in March with this kana based keyboard input system In several electronics and office equipment brands including entered this rapidly growing market with more compact and affordable devices For instance NEC introduced the NWP and Fujitsu launched the Fujitsu OASYS While the average unit price in was JPY US it was dropped to JPY US in Even after personal computers became widely available Japanese word processors remained popular as they tended to be more portable an office computer was initially too large to carry around and become commonplace for business and academics even for private individuals in the second half of the s The phrase word processor has been abbreviated as Wa pro or wapuro in Japanese br br br Word processing software br br The final step in word processing came with the advent of the personal computer in the late s and s and with the subsequent creation of word processing software Word processing software that would create much more complex and capable output was developed and prices began to fall making them more accessible to the public By the late s computerized word processors were still primarily used by employees composing documents for large and midsized businesses e g law firms and newspapers Within a few years the falling prices of PCs made word processing available for the first time to all writers in the convenience of their homes br The first word processing program for personal computers microcomputers was Electric Pencil from Michael Shrayer Software which went on sale in December In WordStar appeared and because of its many new features soon dominated the market WordStar was written for the early CP M Control Program Micro operating system ported to CP M then to MS DOS and was the most popular word processing program until when WordPerfect sales first exceeded WordStar sales br Early word processing software was not as intuitive as word processor devices Most early word processing software required users to memorize semi mnemonic key combinations rather than pressing keys such as copy or bold Moreover CP M lacked cursor keys for example WordStar used the E S D X centered diamond for cursor navigation A notable exception was the software Lexitype for MS DOS that took inspiration from the Lexitron dedicated word processor s user interface and which mapped individual functions to particular keyboard function keys and a set of stick on keycaps describing the function were provided with the software Lexitype was popular with large organizations that had previously used the Lexitron Eventually the price differences between dedicated word processors and general purpose PCs and the value added to the latter by software such as killer app spreadsheet applications e g VisiCalc and Lotus were so compelling that personal computers and word processing software became serious competition for the dedicated machines and soon dominated the market br In the late s innovations such as the advent of laser printers a typographic approach to word processing WYSIWYG What You See Is What You Get using bitmap displays with multiple fonts pioneered by the Xerox Alto computer and Bravo word processing program and graphical user interfaces such as copy and paste another Xerox PARC innovation with the Gypsy word processor These were popularized by MacWrite on the Apple Macintosh in and Microsoft Word on the IBM PC in These were probably the first true WYSIWYG word processors to become known to many people br Of particular interest also is the standardization of TrueType fonts used in both Macintosh and Windows PCs While the publishers of the operating systems provide TrueType typefaces they are largely gathered from traditional typefaces converted by smaller font publishing houses to replicate standard fonts Demand for new and interesting fonts which can be found free of copyright restrictions or commissioned from font designers developed br The growing popularity of the Windows operating system in the s later took Microsoft Word along with it Originally called Microsoft Multi Tool Word this program quickly became a synonym for word processor br Early in the st century Google Docs popularized the transition to online or offline web browser based word processing this was enabled by the widespread adoption of suitable internet connectivity in businesses and domestic households and later the popularity of smartphones Google Docs enabled word processing from within any vendor s web browser which could run on any vendor s operating system on any physical device type including tablets and smartphones although offline editing is limited to a few Chromium based web browsers Google Docs also enabled the significant growth of use of information technology such as remote access to files and collaborative real time editing both becoming simple to do with little or no need for costly software and specialist IT support br br br See also br Comparison of word processors br List of word processors br Formatted text br br br
