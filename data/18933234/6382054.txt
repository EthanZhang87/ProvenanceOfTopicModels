The Electric VLSI Design System is an EDA tool written in the early s by Steven M Rubin Electric is used to construct logic wire schematics and to perform analysis of integrated circuit layout br It can also handle hardware description languages such as VHDL and Verilog The system has many analysis and synthesis tools including design rule checking simulation routing Layout vs Schematic logical effort and more br Electric is written in Java and was released as part of the GNU project in under the GNU General Public License br In Electric development ceased but support and bug fixes continue br br br Alternative design style for integrated circuits br Unlike other systems that design integrated circuits ICs by manipulating polygons on different layers of the wafer Electric views IC layout as connected circuitry similar to the way schematic capture systems work In Electric designers place nodes transistors contacts etc and connect them with arcs wires This has advantages and disadvantages br One advantage is that circuits are always extracted so analyses that need to know the topology Layout vs Schematic simulation etc can run faster Also by presenting a schematic capture like user interface the system offers a uniform user experience for both IC layout and schematic design And finally the nodes and arcs view of a circuit makes it easy to add layout constraints to the arcs which allow the designer to program the layout so that it stays connected as changes are made br This style of design also has disadvantages One disadvantage is that designers are not used to such an interaction and require training in order to use it It has been observed that people with no previous experience in IC layout are comfortable with Electric s unusual style but those who have done IC layout on other systems find Electric difficult to use Another disadvantage is that it is hard to import polygons from traditional systems because they have to be node extracted and the polygons don t always match the set of nodes and arcs provided by Electric Furthermore it is not possible to execute polygon commands directly as a result of nodal interference caused within the software itself br br br History br br Originally written in C during the s Electric was distributed for free to universities and sold by Applicon as Bravo VLSI during the mid s br In Electric Editor Incorporated was founded to sell Electric and starting in it is distributed as free software by the Free Software Foundation and by Static Free Software starting in br In development moved to Sun Microsystems and in the original C version of Electric was discontinued in favour of a Java version which was completed in br Active development of Electric stopped in but fixes and support continues br br br See also br br List of free electronics circuit simulators br Comparison of EDA Software br br br br br br External links br Official website
