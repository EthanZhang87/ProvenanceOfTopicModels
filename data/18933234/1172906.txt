Conkeror is a Mozilla based web browser designed to be navigated primarily by a computer keyboard Its design is mainly patterned after the text editor GNU Emacs with some influence from other programs including vi br It was originally written by Shawn Betts the primary author of keyboard driven ratpoison and Stumpwm tiling window managers Formerly an extension for the Mozilla Firefox browser it is now developed for XULRunner as a stand alone application Since Firefox ESR September when the last official Mozilla browser that supported XULRunner reached end of life there is no officially supported browser from Mozilla for Conkeror to be based on Firefox forks like Pale Moon and Waterfox continue to bundle XULRunner and can be used to run Conkeror br Conkeror is released under the same set of free software licenses as Mozilla the GNU General Public License the GNU Lesser General Public License and the Mozilla Public License br br br Browsing br Conkeror emphasizes Emacs derived key bindings and keyboard based browser navigation By pressing a key f for follow by default Conkeror brings up a small numbered label beside every element within the current view on the page that can be clicked The user can type the number of the link and ENTER to follow the link or type the link name to narrow down the choices when the part of the name already typed uniquely identifies a link it becomes numbered one highlighted green and then hitting Enter will follow it br Conkeror has a large number of standard key bindings and more can be added The following are some examples of default key bindings key bindings are case sensitive br br Like Emacs Conkeror makes use of buffers in order to allow multiple pages to remain open at the same time similar to tabs in traditional browsers Users can open new buffers and navigate through them using key bindings For example C u C f opens a hyperlink in a new buffer C u C g goes to a URL or search term in a new buffer and C u C h i opens the start page in a new buffer Buffers can be cycled through using M n to go to the next buffer or M p to go to the previous one C x b displays a list of the currently open buffers from which the user can choose a buffer using the up and down arrows br br br Customization br The Conkeror browser can be customized in many ways using JavaScript as the scripting language much in the way that Emacs uses Emacs Lisp Customizations can be as simple as rebinding keys but can also be more involved for instance writing new interactive commands By default Conkeror looks for these customizations in conkerorrc If conkerorrc is a directory instead of a file then all the contained files will be read which is a technique to enable modularization of bigger customizations br Conkeror also ships with a number of loadable JavaScript modules some of which provide core functionality others are user loadable and provide additional functionality br Conkeror has modes in which the key bindings page display or browser behaviour become uri specific Some modes like xkcd mode come by default In xkcd mode the message which is normally displayed when the user mouses over the comic strip is instead displayed in a special font below the strip Other modes include those for Google Maps Reddit and YouTube and modes can be user defined as well br br br Name br The name of the browser is pronounced identically to that of the Konqueror web browser from the KDE suite of desktop software although according to the Conkeror FAQ the full name of the browser in spoken English is Conkeror with a C to avoid confusion br Also according to the FAQ the name derives from the name given to the winner of a game of conkers a children s game involving horse chestnuts on a string as well as from a brand of beer also called Conkeror br br br See also br br Vimperator br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Official website br Conkeror at the Emacs Wiki br Conkeror browsing the web emacs style with Conkeror customizations
