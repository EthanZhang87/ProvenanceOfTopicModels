title: Keyboard layout
id: 26301474
A keyboard layout is any specific physical visual or functional arrangement of the keys legends or key meaning associations respectively of a computer keyboard mobile phone or other computer controlled typographic keyboard br Physical layout is the actual positioning of keys on a keyboard Visual layout is the arrangement of the legends labels markings engravings that appear on those keys Functional layout is the arrangement of the key meaning association or keyboard mapping determined in software of all the keys of a keyboard it is this rather than the legends that determines the actual response to a key press br Modern computer keyboards are designed to send a scancode to the operating system OS when a key is pressed or released this code reports only the key s row and column not the specific character engraved on that key The OS converts the scancode into a specific binary character code using a scancode to character conversion table called the keyboard mapping table This means that a physical keyboard may be dynamically mapped to any layout without switching hardware components merely by changing the software that interprets the keystrokes Often a user can change keyboard mapping in system settings In addition software may be available to modify or extend keyboard functionality Thus the symbol shown on the physical key top need not be the same as appears on the screen or goes into a document being typed Modern USB keyboards are plug and play they communicate their default visual layout to the OS when connected though the user is still able to reset this at will br br br Key types br br A computer keyboard consists of alphanumeric or character keys for typing modifier keys for altering the functions of other keys navigation keys for moving the text cursor on the screen function keys and system command keys such as Esc and Break for special actions and often a numeric keypad to facilitate calculations br There is some variation between different keyboard models in the physical layout i e how many keys there are and how they are positioned on the keyboard However differences between national layouts are mostly due to different selections and placements of symbols on the character keys br br br Character keys br The core section of a keyboard consists of character keys which can be used to type letters and other characters Typically there are three rows of keys for typing letters and punctuation an upper row for typing digits and special symbols and the Space bar on the bottom row The positioning of the character keys is similar to the keyboard of a typewriter br br br Modifier keys br br Besides the character keys a keyboard incorporates special keys that do nothing by themselves but modify the functions of other keys For example the Shift key can be used to alter the output of character keys whereas the Ctrl control Alt alternate and AltGr alternative graphic keys trigger special operations when used in concert with other keys Apple keyboards have differently labelled but equivalent keys see below br Typically a modifier key is held down while another key is struck To facilitate this modifier keys usually come in pairs one functionally identical key for each hand so holding a modifier key with one hand leaves the other hand free to strike another key br An alphanumeric key labelled with only a single letter usually the capital form can generally be struck to type either a lower case or capital letter the latter requiring the simultaneous holding of the Shift key The Shift key is also used to type the upper of two symbols engraved on a given key the lower being typed without using the modifier key br The Latin alphabet keyboard has a dedicated key for each of the letters A Z keys for punctuation and other symbols usually a row of function keys often a numeric keypad and some system control keys In most languages except English additional letters some with diacritics are required and some are present as standard on each national keyboard as appropriate for its national language These keyboards have another modified key labelled AltGr alternative graphic to the right of the space bar US keyboards just have a second Alt key in this position It can be used to type an extra symbol in addition to the two otherwise available with an alphanumeric key and using it simultaneously with the Shift key usually gives access to a fourth symbol These third level and fourth level symbols may be engraved on the right half of the key top or they may be unmarked Cyrillic alphabet and Greek alphabet keyboards have similar arrangements br Instead of the Ctrl Alt and AltGr keys seen on commodity keyboards Apple Keyboards have Cmd command and Option keys The Option key is used much like the AltGr and the Cmd key like the Ctrl and Alt to access menu options and shortcuts Macs have a Ctrl key for compatibility with programs that expect a more traditional keyboard layout It is especially useful when using a terminal X a Unix environment included with OS X as an install option or MS Windows The key can generally be used to produce a secondary mouse click as well There is also a Fn key on modern Mac keyboards which is used for switching between use of the F F etc keys either as function keys or for other functions like media control accessing Spotlight controlling the volume or handling Mission Control Fn key can be also found on smaller Windows and Linux laptops and tablets where it serves a similar purpose br Many Unix workstations and also home computers like the Amiga keyboards placed the Ctrl key to the left of the letter A and the Caps Lock key in the bottom left This position of the Ctrl key is also used on the XO laptop which does not have a Caps Lock The UNIX keyboard layout also differs in the placement of the Esc key which is to the left of br Some early keyboards experimented with using large numbers of modifier keys The most extreme example of such a keyboard the so called space cadet keyboard found on MIT LISP machines had no fewer than seven modifier keys four control keys Ctrl Meta Hyper and Super along with three shift keys Shift Top and Front This allowed the user to type over possible characters by playing suitable chords with many modifier keys pressed simultaneously br br br Dead keys br br A dead key is a special kind of a modifier key that instead of being held while another key is struck is pressed and released before the other key The dead key does not generate a character by itself but it modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after typically making it possible to type a letter with a specific diacritic For example on some keyboard layouts the grave accent key is a dead key in this case striking and then A results in a with grave accent followed by Shift E results in E with grave accent A grave accent in isolated form can be typed by striking and then Space bar br A key may function as a dead key by default or sometimes a normal key can temporarily be altered to function as a dead key by simultaneously holding down the secondary shift key AltGr or Option a typical example might be AltGr a will produce assuming the key is also the key In some systems there is no indication to the user that a dead key has been struck so the key appears dead but in some text entry systems the diacritical mark is displayed along with an indication that the system is waiting for another keystroke either the base character to be marked an additional diacritical mark or Space bar to produce the diacritical mark in isolation br Compared with the secondary shift modifier key the dead key approach may be a little more complicated but it allows more additional letters Using AltGr only one or if used simultaneously with the normal shift key two additional letters with each key whereas using a dead key a specific diacritic can be attached to a range of different base letters br br br Compose key br br A Compose key can be characterized as a generic dead key that may in some systems be available instead of or in addition to the more specific dead keys It allows access to a wide range of predefined extra characters by interpreting a whole sequence of keystrokes following it For example striking Compose followed by apostrophe and then A results in a with acute accent Compose followed by A and then E results in ae ligature and Compose followed by O and then C results in circled c copyright symbol br The Compose key is supported by the X Window System used by most Unix like operating systems including most Linux distributions Some keyboards have a key labeled Compose but any key can be configured to serve this function For example the otherwise redundant right hand Win key may when available be used for this purpose This can be emulated in Windows with third party programs for example WinCompose br br br System command keys br Depending on the application some keyboard keys are not used to enter a printable character but instead are interpreted by the system as a formatting mode shift or special commands to the system The following examples are found on personal computer keyboards br br br SysRq and PrtSc br br The system request SysRq and print screen PrtSc or on some keyboards e g PrtScn commands often share the same key SysRq was used in earlier computers as a panic button to recover from crashes and it is still used in this sense to some extent by the Linux kernel see Magic SysRq key The print screen command is used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer but in the present it usually puts a screenshot in the clipboard br br br Break key br The Break key Pause key no longer has a well defined purpose Its origins go back to teleprinter users who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line The Break key can be used by software in several different ways such as to switch between multiple login sessions to terminate a program or to interrupt a modem connection br In programming especially old DOS style BASIC Pascal and C Break is used in conjunction with Ctrl to stop program execution In addition to this Linux and variants as well as many DOS programs treat this combination the same as Ctrl C On modern keyboards the break key is usually labeled Pause Break In most Microsoft Windows environments the key combination WindowsPause brings up the system properties br br br Escape key br br The escape key often abbreviated Esc nearly all of the time signals Stop QUIT or let me get out of a dialog or pop up window br Another common application today of the Esc key is to trigger the Stop button in many web browsers and operating systems br ESC was part of the standard keyboard of the Teletype Model introduced in and used with many early minicomputers The DEC VT introduced July also had an Esc key The TECO text editor c and its descendant Emacs c use the Esc key extensively br Historically it also served as a type of shift key such that one or more following characters were interpreted differently hence the term escape sequence which refers to a series of characters usually preceded by the escape character br On machines running Microsoft Windows prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards the typical practice for invoking the start button was to hold down the control key and press escape This process still works in Windows and br br br Enter key br An enter key may terminate a paragraph of text and advance an editing cursor to the start of the next available line similar to the carriage return key of a typewriter When the attached system is processing a user command line pressing enter may signal that the command has been completely entered and that the system may now process it br br br Shift key br Shift key when one presses shift and a letter it will capitalize the letter pressed with the shift key Another use is to type more symbols than appear to be available for instance the semi colon key is accompanied with a colon symbol on the top To type a semi colon the key is pressed without pressing any other key To type a colon both this key and the Shift key are pressed concurrently Some systems make provision for users with mobility impairment by allowing the Shift key to be pressed first and then the desired symbol key br br br Menu key Command key Windows key br The Menu key or Application key is a key found on Windows oriented computer keyboards on Apple keyboard the same function is provided by the Command key labelled It is used to launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button The key s symbol is usually a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu On some Samsung keyboards the cursor in the icon is not present showing the menu only This key was created at the same time as the Windows key This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right clicking however in many Windows applications a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift F keyboard shortcut br The Windows key opens the Start applications menu br br br History br br Keyboard layouts have evolved over time usually alongside major technology changes Particularly influential have been the Sholes and Glidden typewriter also known as Remington No the first commercially successful typewriter which introduced QWERTY its successor the Remington No which introduced the shift key the IBM Selectric a very influential electric typewriter which was imitated by computer keyboards and the IBM PC namely the Model M which is the basis for many modern keyboard layouts br Within a community keyboard layout is generally quite stable due to the high training cost of touch typing and the resulting network effect of having a standard layout and high switching cost of retraining and the suboptimal QWERTY layout is a case study in switching costs Nevertheless significant market forces can result in changes as in Turkish adoption of QWERTY and non core keys are more prone to change as they are less frequently used and less subject to the lock in of touch typing The main alphanumeric portion is typically stable while symbol keys and shifted key values change somewhat modifier keys more so and function keys most of all QWERTY dates to the No though and were added later shifted keys date in some cases to the No in other cases to the Selectric and modifier key placement largely dates to the Model M function key placement typically dates to the Model M but varies significantly particularly on laptops br The earliest mechanical keyboards were used in musical instruments to play particular notes With the advent of the printing telegraph a keyboard was needed to select characters Some of the earliest printing telegraph machines either used a piano keyboard outright or a layout similar to a piano keyboard The Hughes Phelps printing telegraph piano keyboard laid keys A N in left to right order on the black piano keys and keys O Z in right to left order on the white piano keys below br In countries using the Latin script the center alphanumeric portion of the modern keyboard is most often based on the QWERTY design by Christopher Sholes Sholes layout was long thought to have been laid out in such a way that common two letter combinations were placed on opposite sides of the keyboard so that his mechanical keyboard would not jam However evidence for this claim has often been contested In an argument was advanced by two Japanese historians of technology showing that the key order on the earliest Sholes prototypes in fact followed the left right and right left arrangement of the contemporary Hughes Phelps printing telegraph described above Later iterations diverged progressively for various technical reasons and strong vestiges of the left right A N right left O Z arrangement can still be seen in the modern QWERTY layout Sholes chief improvement was thus to lay out the keys in rows offset horizontally from each other by three eighths three sixteenths and three eighths inches to provide room for the levers and to reduce hand movement distance Although it has been demonstrated that the QWERTY layout is not the most efficient layout for typing it remains the standard br Sholes chose the size of the keys to be on three quarter or inch centers about mm versus musical piano keys which are mm or about inches wide inches has turned out to be optimum for fast key entry by the average size hand and keyboards with this key size are called full sized keyboards br On a manual typewriter the operator could press the key down with a lighter touch for such characters as the period or comma which did not occupy as much area on the paper Since an electric typewriter supplied the force to the typebar itself after the typist merely touched the key the typewriter itself had to be designed to supply different forces for different characters To simplify this the most common layout for electric typewriters in the United States differed from that for the one most common on manual typewriters Single quote and double quote instead of being above the keys for the digits and respectively were placed together on a key of their own The underscore another light character replaced the asterisk above the hyphen br The ASCII communications code was designed so that characters on a mechanical teletypewriter keyboard could be laid out in a manner somewhat resembling that of a manual typewriter This was imperfect as some shifted special characters were moved one key to the left as the number zero although on the right was low in code sequence Later when computer terminals were designed from less expensive electronic components it was not necessary to have any bits in common between the shifted and unshifted characters on a given key This eventually led to standards being adopted for the bit pairing and typewriter pairing forms of keyboards for computer terminals br The typewriter pairing standard came under reconsideration on the basis that typewriters have many different keyboard arrangements The U S keyboard for the IBM PC although it resembles the typewriter pairing standard in most respects differs in one significant respect the braces are on the same two keys as the brackets as their shifts This innovation predated the IBM Personal Computer by several years br IBM adopted the key layout on the PS in after previously using an key keyboard that did not have a separate cursor and numeric keypads br Most modern keyboards basically conform to the layout specifications contained in parts and of the international standard series ISO IEC These specifications were first defined by the user group at AFNOR in working under the direction of Alain Souloumiac Based on this work a well known ergonomic expert wrote a report which was adopted at the ISO Berlin meeting in and became the reference for keyboard layouts br The key PC keyboard was born when two Win keys and a Menu key were added on the bottom row originally for the Microsoft Windows operating system Newer keyboards may incorporate even further additions such as Internet access World Wide Web navigation keys and multimedia access to media players buttons br br br Physical visual and functional layouts br As noted before the layout of a keyboard may refer to its physical arrangement of keys visual physical labeling of keys or functional software response to a key press or release layout br br br Physical layouts br br Physical layouts only address tangible differences among keyboards When a key is pressed the keyboard does not send a message such as the A key is depressed but rather the left most main key of the home row is depressed Technically each key has an internal reference number the scan code and these numbers are what is sent to the computer when a key is pressed or released The keyboard and the computer each have no information about what is marked on that key and it could equally well be the letter A or the digit Historically the user of the computer was requested to identify the functional layout of the keyboard when installing or customizing the operating system Modern USB keyboards are plug and play they communicate their visual layout to the OS when connected though the user is still able to reset this at will br Today most keyboards use one of three different physical layouts usually referred to as simply ISO ISO IEC ANSI ANSI INCITS and JIS JIS X referring roughly to the organizations issuing the relevant worldwide United States and Japanese standards respectively In fact the physical layouts referred such as ISO and ANSI comply with the primary recommendations in the named standards while each of these standards in fact also allows the other Keyboard layout in this sense may refer either to this broad categorization or to finer distinctions within these categories For example as of May Apple Inc produces ISO ANSI and JIS desktop keyboards each in both extended and compact forms The extended keyboards have and keys ISO ANSI and JIS respectively and the compact models have and br br br Visual layouts br br The visual layout includes the symbols printed on the physical keycaps Visual layouts vary by language country and user preference and any one physical and functional layout can be employed with a number of different visual layouts For example the ISO keyboard layout is used throughout Europe but typical French German and UK variants of physically identical keyboards appear different because they bear different legends on their keys Even blank keyboards with no legends are sometimes used to learn typing skills or by user preference br Some users choose to attach custom labels on top of their keycaps This can be e g for masking foreign layouts adding additional information such as shortcuts learning aids gaming controls or solely for decorational purposes br br br Functional layouts br The functional layout of the keyboard refers to the mapping between the physical keys such as the A key and software events such as the letter A appearing on the screen Usually the functional layout is set in the system configuration to match the visual layout of the keyboard being used so that pressing a key will produce the expected result corresponding to the legends on the keyboard However most operating systems have software that allow the user to easily switch between functional layouts such as the language bar in Microsoft Windows For example a user with a Swedish keyboard who wishes to type more easily in German may switch to a functional layout intended for German without regard to key markings just as a Dvorak touch typist may choose a Dvorak layout regardless of the visual layout of the keyboard used br br br Customized functional layouts br br Functional layouts can be redefined or customized within the operating system by reconfiguring the operating system keyboard driver or with the use of a separate software application Transliteration is one example of that whereby letters in other languages get matched to visible Latin letters on the keyboard by the way they sound Thus a touch typist can type in various foreign languages with a visible English language keyboard only br Mixed hardware to software keyboard extensions exist to overcome the above discrepancies between functional and visual layouts A keyboard overlay is a plastic or paper masks that can be placed over the empty space between the keys providing the user with the functional use of various keys Alternatively a user applies keyboard stickers with an extra imprinted language alphabet and adds another keyboard layout via language support options in the operating system The visual layout of any keyboard can also be changed by simply replacing its keys or attaching labels to them such as to change an English language keyboard from the common QWERTY to the Dvorak layout although for touch typists the placement of the tactile bumps on the home keys is of more practical importance than that of the visual markings br In the past complex software that mapped many non standard functions to the keys such as a flight simulator would be shipped with a keyboard overlay a large sheet of paper with pre cut holes matching the key layout of a particular model of computer When placed over the keyboard the overlay provided a quick visual reference as to what each key s new function was without blocking the keys or permanently modifying their appearance The overlay was often made from good quality laminated paper and was designed to fold up and fit in the game s packaging when not in use br br br National variants br The U S IBM PC keyboard has keys while the PC keyboards for most other countries have keys In an operating system configured for a non English language the keys are placed differently For example keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted to make room for similarly those for French or Portuguese may have a special key for the character Keyboards designed for Japanese may have special keys to switch between Japanese and Latin scripts and the character yen and yuan sign instead of backslash which itself additionally may be displayed as a or a in some renditions Using the same keyboard for alternative languages leads to a conflict the image on the key may not correspond to the character displayed on screen because of different keyboard mappings In such cases each new language may require an additional label on the key because the national standard keyboard layouts may not share similar characters of different languages or even lay them out in different ways br The United States keyboard layout is used as default in some Linux distributions br Most operating systems allow switching between functional keyboard layouts using a key combination involving register keys that are not used for normal operations e g Microsoft reserve Alt Shift or Ctrl Shift register control keys for sequential layout switching those keys were inherited from old DOS keyboard drivers There are keyboards with two parallel sets of characters labeled on the keys representing alternate alphabets or scripts It is also possible to add a second set of characters to a keyboard with keyboard stickers manufactured by third parties br br br Size variation br br Modern keyboard models contain a set number of total keys according to their given standard described as etc and sold as full size keyboards This number is not always followed and individual keys or whole sections are commonly skipped for the sake of compactness or user preference Consequently generic keyboard mappings may not be completely effective on unusual layouts br br br Latin script keyboard layouts br br Although there are a large number of keyboard layouts used for languages written with Latin script alphabets most of these layouts are quite similar They can be divided into three main families according to where the A M Q W Y and Z keys are placed on the keyboard These layouts are usually named after the first six letters on the first row AZERTY QWERTY QWERTZ QZERTY and national variants thereof br While the central area of the keyboard the alphabetic section remains fairly constant and the numbers from are almost invariably on the row above keyboards may differ in br br the placement of punctuation typographic and other special characters and which of these characters are included br whether numbers are accessible directly or in a shift state br the presence and placement of letters with diacritics in some layouts diacritics are applied using dead keys but these are rarely engraved br the presence and placement of a row of function keys above the number row br the presence and placement of one or two Alt keys an AltGr key or Option key a backspace or delete key a control key or command key a compose key an Esc key and OS specific keys like the Windows key br The physical keyboard is of the basic ISO ANSI or JIS type pressing a key sends a scan code to the operating system or other software which in turn determines the character to be generated this arrangement is known as the keyboard mapping It is customary for keyboards to be engraved appropriately to the local default mapping For example when the Shift and numeric keys are pressed simultaneously on a US keyboard is generated and the key is engraved appropriately On a UK keyboard this key combination generates the double quote character and UK keyboards are so engraved br In the keyboard charts listed below the primary letters or characters available with each alphanumeric key are often shown in black in the left half of the key whereas characters accessed using the AltGr key appear in blue in the right half of the corresponding key Symbols representing dead keys usually appear in red br br br QWERTY br br The QWERTY layout is by far the most widespread layout in use and the only one that is not confined to a particular geographical area In some territories keys like Enter and Caps Lock are not translated to the language of the territory in question In other varieties such keys have been translated like Intro and Bloq May s on Spanish computer keyboards respectively for the example above On Macintosh computers these keys are usually just represented by symbols without the word Enter Shift Command Option Alt or Control with the exception of keyboards distributed in the US and East Asia br br br Q ERTY Azerbaijani br br Azerbaijani keyboards use a layout known as Q ERTY where appears in place of W above S with W not being accessible at all It is supported by Microsoft Windows br br br P UD Azerbaijani br In a new layout known as P UD was designed and proposed by Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences It was praised by Ministry of Digital Development and Transportation This layout is completely different than the most used one Q ERTY br br br WERTY Turkmen br br Turkmen keyboards use a layout known as WERTY av UR tee where appears in place of Q above A appears in place of X below S appears in place of C and appears in place of V with C Q V and X not being accessible at all It is supported by Microsoft Windows Vista and later only br br br QWERTZ br br The QWERTZ layout is the normal keyboard layout in Germany Austria and Switzerland It is also fairly widely used in Czechia Slovakia and other parts of Central Europe The main difference between it and QWERTY is that Y and Z are swapped and some special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters like In Czechia and Slovakia diacritical characters like also replace numbers Caps lock can be a shift lock as in AZERTY see below br br br AZERTY br br The AZERTY layout is used in France Belgium and some African countries It differs from the QWERTY layout thus br br A and Q are swapped br Z and W are swapped br M is moved to the right of L taking place of the or colon semicolon key on a US keyboard br The digits to are on the same keys but to be typed the shift key must be pressed The unshifted positions are used for accented characters br Caps lock is replaced by Shift lock thus affecting non letter keys as well However there is an ongoing evolution towards a Caps lock key instead of a Shift lock br br br ERTY Lithuanian br As standardized in LST Lithuanian keyboards have a defined layout known as ERTY where appears in place of Q above A in place of W above S and in place of X below S with Q W and X being available either on the far right hand side or by use of the AltGr key However instead of ERTY the Lithuanian QWERTY keyboard is universally used br br br QZERTY br br The QZERTY KZUR tee layout was used mostly in Italy where it was the traditional typewriter layout In recent years however a modified QWERTY layout with stressed keys such as has gained widespread usage throughout Italy Computer keyboards usually have QWERTY although non alphanumeric characters vary br br Z and W are swapped br M is moved from the right of N to the right of L as in AZERTY br Number keys are shifted br Apple supported QZERTY layout in its early Italian keyboards and also the iPod Touch had it available br br br S mi Extended br S mi keyboards use a layout known as the S mi Extended where appears in place of Q above A appears in place of W above S appears in place of X to the left of C and appears in place of Y to the right of T with Q W X and Y being available by use of the AltGr key Also is to the right of P to match the Norwegian and Swedish Finnish keyboards is to the right of and is to the right of It is different in Norway than in Sweden and Finland because of the placement of the letters different between Norwegian and Swedish Finnish and which are placed where they match the standard keyboard for the main language spoken in the country It is supported by Microsoft Windows Windows XP SP and later only Microsoft Windows also has Swedish with Sami Norwegian with Sami and Finnish with Sami layouts which match the normal Swedish Norwegian or Finnish keyboards but has additional Sami characters as AltGr combinations br br br Other Latin script keyboard layouts br br There are also keyboard layouts that do not resemble traditional typewriter layouts very closely if at all These are designed to reduce finger movement and are claimed by some proponents to offer higher typing speed along with ergonomic benefits br br br Dvorak br br The Dvorak layout was named after its inventor August Dvorak There are also numerous adaptations for languages other than English and single handed variants Dvorak s original layout had the numerals rearranged but the present day layout had them in numerical order Dvorak has numerous properties designed to increase typing speed decrease errors and increase comfort Research has found a average advantage to the end user in typing speed The layout concentrates the most used English letters in the home row where the fingers rest thus having of typing done in the home row compared to in QWERTY br The layout came before computers came to be so it challenges programmers and power users because keyboard shortcuts like copy paste are in totally different locations punctuation symbols are significantly affected while common commands like ls ls result in strenuous use of the pinky finger br br The Dvorak layout is available out of the box on most operating systems making switching through software very easy Hardwired Dvorak keyboards are also available though only from specialized hardware companies br br br Colemak br br The Colemak layout is another popular alternative to the standard QWERTY layout offering a more familiar change for users already accustomed to the standard layout br It builds upon the QWERTY layout as a base changing the positions of keys while retaining the QWERTY positions of most non alphabetic characters and many popular keyboard shortcuts supposedly making it easier to learn than Dvorak for people who already type in QWERTY without sacrificing efficiency It shares several design goals with the Dvorak layout such as minimizing finger path distance and making heavy use of the home row An additional defining albeit optional feature of the Colemak layout is the lack of a caps lock key an additional backspace key occupies the position typically occupied by Caps Lock on modern keyboards br Operating systems such as macOS Linux Android ChromeOS and BSD allow a user to switch to the Colemak layout A program to install the layout is available for Microsoft Windows as well as a portable AutoHotKey implementation br Colemak variants exist including Colemak Mod DH which seeks to rectify concerns that the layout places too much emphasis on the middle row centre column keys D and H leading to awkward lateral hand movements for certain common English bigrams such as HE Others seek to have more compatibility with other keyboard layouts br br br Workman br br Workman is an English layout supported out of the box in Linux X systems br The Workman layout employs a hypothesis about the preferential movement of each finger rather than categorically considering the lowest letter row to be least accessible Specifically the index finger prefers to curl inwards rather than stretch outwards So for the index finger the position of second preference goes to the bottom row rather than the top row Contrarily the middle and ring fingers are relatively long and prefer to stretch out rather than curl in Based on this weighting is allotted to each key specifically rather than each row generically br Another principle applied is that it is more natural and less effort to curl in or stretch out fingers rather than rotate br one s wrist inwards or outwards Thus the Workman layout allots a lower priority to the two innermost columns between the home keys G and H columns on a QWERTY layout similarly to the Colemak DH or Curl mods Workman also balances the load quite evenly between both hands br The Workman layout is found to achieve overall less travel distance of the fingers for the English language than even Colemak It does however generally incur higher same finger n gram frequencies or in other words one finger will need to hit two keys in succession more often than in other layouts br br br Other English layouts br There are many other layouts for English each developed with differing basic principles br The Norman Layout like Workman deprioritizes the central columns but gives more load to the right hand with the assumption that the right hand is more capable than the left It also gives importance to retaining letters in the same position or at least the same finger as QWERTY br MTGAP s Layout for a Standard Keyboard an Ergonomic Keyboard has the lowest finger travel for a standard keyboard and travel distance for an ergonomic keyboard second only to Arensito s keyboard layout br Further variations were created using the keyboard layout optimizer br Other layouts lay importance on minimal key deviation from QWERTY to give a reasonable increase in typing speed and ergonomics with minimal relearning of keys In Canada the CSA keyboard is designed to write several languages especially French br br br Sholes nd Layout br br Christopher Latham Sholes inventor of the QWERTY layout created his own alternative and patented it in br Similar to Dvorak he placed all the vowels on the home row but in this case on the right hand The layout is right hand biased with both the vowels and many of the most common consonants on the right side of the layout br br br Qwpr br br Qwpr is a layout that changes only basic keys from their QWERTY positions with only keys typed with different fingers Minimak has versions that changes four six eight or twelve keys all have only keys change finger These intend to offer much of the reduced finger movement of Dvorak without the steep learning curve and with an increased ability to remain proficient with a QWERTY keyboard The Qwpr layout is also designed for programmers and multilingual users as it uses Caps Lock as a punctuation shift offering quicker access to ASCII symbols and arrow keys as well as to dead keys for typing hundreds of different glyphs such as accented characters mathematical symbols or emoji br br br Engram br br Engram is a keyboard layout created in by Arno Klein that is based on English bigram frequency and is based on a variety of parameters such as hand alternation ease of inward vs outward rolling finger lengths row jumps minimal lateral movement among other ergonomic factors It assigns out of the letters on the columns and reserves the middle columns for punctuation to minimize lateral finger movement br br br Semimak br br Semimak was created on July and is designed to reduce the speed at which fingers must travel to type on average It not only minimizes same finger bigrams but also disjointed same finger bigrams SFBs or skipgrams e g m y in the word may Additionally it takes into account the finger used and the distance Finger dexterity was weighted based on how fast the keys move and it also has a small reward for rolling and a small penalty for redirects Due to its optimization for lower finger speed several users can type at over WPM and it has inspired many newer keyboard layouts However a Semimak typing tournament while producing some fast typists proved that layout quality is subjective with the layout being uncomfortable or unintuitive for many people br br br JCUKEN Latin br br The JCUKEN layout was used in the USSR for all computers both domestically produced and imported such as Japan made MSX compatible systems except IBM compatible ES PEVM due to its phonetic compatibility with Russian layout see right The layout has the advantage of having punctuation marks on Latin and Cyrillic layouts mapped on the same keys br br br Neo br br The Neo layout is an optimized German keyboard layout developed in by the Neo Users Group supporting nearly all Latin based alphabets including the International Phonetic Alphabet the Vietnamese language and some African languages br The positions of the letters are not only optimized for German letter frequency but also for typical groups of two or three letters English is considered a major target as well The design tries to enforce the alternating usage of both hands to increase typing speed It is based on ideas from de ergo and other ergonomic layouts The high frequency keys are placed in the home row The current layout Neo has unique features not present in other layouts making it suited for many target groups such as programmers mathematicians scientists or LaTeX authors Neo is grouped in different layers each designed for a special purpose br br Most special characters inherit the meaning of the lower layers the character is one layer above the or the Greek is above the a character Neo uses a total of six layers with the following general use br br Lowercase characters br Uppercase characters typographical characters br Special characters for programming etc br WASD like movement keys and number block br Greek characters br Mathematical symbols and Greek uppercase characters br br br CAMOES br br The CAMOES keyboard layout is an ergonomic layout crafted for Portuguese

The Malt layout named for its inventor South African born Lilian Malt is best known for its use on molded ergonomic Maltron keyboards Nevertheless it has been adapted as well for flat keyboards with a compromise involved a flat keyboard has a single wide space bar rather than a space button as on Maltron keyboards so the E key was moved to the bottom row br Archived September at the Wayback Machine br br br Modified Blickensderfer br br The Blickensderfer typewriter designed by George Canfield Blickensderfer in was known for its novel keyboard layout its interchangeable font and its suitability for travel The Blickensderfer keyboard had three banks rows of keys with special characters being entered using a separate Shift key the home row was uniquely the bottom one i e the typist kept her hands on the bottom row A computer or standard typewriter keyboard on the other hand has four banks of keys with home row being second from bottom br To fit on a Sholes patterned typewriter or computer keyboard the Blickensderfer layout was modified by Nick Matavka in and released for both Mac OS X and Windows To accommodate the differences between Blickensderfer and Sholes keyboards not the layouts but the keyboards themselves the order of the rows was changed and special characters were given their own keys br The keyboard drivers created by Nick Matavka for the modified Blickensderfer layout nicknamed the Blick have several variations including one that includes the option of switching between Blick and another keyboard layout and one that is internationalised allowing the entry of diacritics br br br Hexagon br br The honeycomb layout has hexagon keys and was invented by Typewise in cooperation with the ETH Zurich in for smartphones It exists for languages including English German Spanish French and Afrikaans The keys are arranged like those of the respective traditional keyboard with a few changes Instead of the Space bar there are two smaller space bars in the middle of the keyboard The Shift is replaced by swiping up on keys and Backspace by swiping to the left on the keyboard Diacritic characters can be accessed by holding on a key br br br Alphabetical layout br A few companies offer ABC alphabetical layout keyboards The ABCDEF layout was used by Minitel The layout can also be useful for people who do not type often or where using both hands is not practical such as touchscreens br br br Chorded keyboards and mobile devices br br Chorded keyboards such as the Stenotype and Velotype allow letters and words to be entered using combinations of keys in a single stroke Users of stenotype machines regularly reach rates of words per minute These systems are commonly used for real time transcription by court reporters and in live closed captioning systems Ordinary keyboards may be adapted for this purpose using Plover However due to hardware constraints chording three or more keys may not work as expected Many high end keyboards support n key rollover and so do not have this limitation br The multi touch screens of mobile devices allow implementation of virtual on screen chorded keyboards Buttons are fewer so they can be made larger Symbols on the keys can be changed dynamically depending on what other keys are pressed thus eliminating the need to memorize combos for characters and functions before use For example in the chorded GKOS keyboard which has been adapted for the Google Android Apple iPhone MS Windows Phone and Intel MeeGo Harmattan platforms thumbs are used for chording by pressing one or two keys at the same time The layout divides the keys into two separate pads which are positioned near the sides of the screen while text appears in the middle The most frequent letters have dedicated keys and do not require chording br Some other layouts have also been designed specifically for use with mobile devices The FITALY layout is optimized for use with a stylus by placing the most commonly used letters closest to the centre and thus minimizing the distance travelled when entering words A similar concept was followed to research and develop the MessagEase keyboard layout for fast text entry with stylus or finger The ATOMIK layout designed for stylus use was developed by IBM using the Metropolis Algorithm to mathematically minimize the movement necessary to spell words in English The ATOMIK keyboard layout is an alternative to QWERTY in ShapeWriter s WritingPad software ASETNIOP is a keyboard layout designed for tablet computers that uses input points eight of them on the home row br br br Other original layouts and layout design software br br Several other alternative keyboard layouts have been designed either for use with specialist commercial keyboards e g Maltron and PLUM or by hobbyists e g Asset Arensito Minimak Norman Qwpr Workman as well as symmetric typing layouts Niro and Soul however none of them are in widespread use and many of them are merely proofs of concept Principles commonly used in their design include maximizing use of the home row minimizing finger movement maximizing hand alternation or inward rolls where successive letters are typed moving towards the center of the keyboard minimizing changes from QWERTY to ease the learning curve and so on br Maltron also has a single handed keyboard layout br Programs such as the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator basic editor free for use on MS Windows SIL Ukelele advanced editor free for use on Apple s Mac OS X br KbdEdit commercial editor for Windows and Keyman Developer free open source editor for Windows macOS iOS Android or for sites on the web as virtual keyboards make it easy to create custom keyboard layouts for regular keyboards users may satisfy their own typing patterns or specific needs by creating new ones from scratch like the IPA or pan Iberian br layouts or modify existing ones for example the Latin American Extended or Gaelic br layouts Such editors can also construct complex key sequences using dead keys or the AltGr key br Certain virtual keyboards and keyboard layouts are accessible online With no hardware limitations those online keyboards can display custom layouts or allow the user to pre configure or try out different language layouts Resulting text can then be pasted into other websites or applications flexibly with no need to reprogram keyboard mappings at all br Some high end keyboards allow users flexibility to reprogram keyboard mappings at the hardware level For example the Kinesis Advantage contoured keyboard allows for reprogramming single keys not key combinations as well as creating macros for remapping combinations of keys this however includes more processing from the keyboard hardware and can therefore be slightly slower with a lag that may be noticed in daily use br Non QWERTY layouts were also used with specialized machines such as the key Linotype type setting machine br br br Keyboard layouts for non Latin alphabetic scripts br Some keyboard layouts for non Latin alphabetic scripts most notably the Greek layout are based on the QWERTY layout in that glyphs are assigned as far as possible to keys that bear similar sounding or appearing glyphs in QWERTY This saves learning time for those familiar with QWERTY and eases entry of Latin characters with QWERTY as well for Greek users br This is not a general rule and many non Latin keyboard layouts have been invented from scratch br All non Latin computer keyboard layouts can also input Latin letters as well as the script of the language for example when typing in URLs or names This may be done through a special key on the keyboard devoted to this task or through some special combination of keys or through software

scripts are derived from Brahmi therefore their alphabetic order is identical On the basis of this property the InScript keyboard layout scheme was prepared So a person who knows InScript typing in one language can type in other scripts using dictation even without knowledge of that script br An InScript keyboard is inbuilt in most modern operating systems including Windows Linux and Mac OS It is also available in some mobile phones br br br Khmer br br Khmer uses its own layout designed to correspond to the extent practicable to its QWERTY counterpart thus easing the learning curve in either direction For example the letter l is typed on the same key as the letter L on the English based QWERTY It also has many specifics due to its record number of vowels consonants and punctuation signs as well as its cluster structure which bundles letters together in one br br br Thai br br The Thai Kedmanee keyboard layout predominates The Thai Pattachote keyboard layout is also used though it is much less common Infrequently used characters are accessed via the Shift key Despite their wide usage in Thai Arabic numerals are not present on the main section of the keyboard Instead they are

identical commonly available keyboard layouts for Windows Both contain a basic Latin layout in its base and shift states with a few Latin characters in the AltGr shift states The Canadian Aboriginal syllabics can be found in the Capslock and AltGr shift states in both layouts as well br The difference between the two layouts lies in the use of as an alternate to AltGr to create the dotted long vowel syllables and the mapping of the small plain consonants to the Caps number keys in the Naqittaut layout while the Latin layout does not have access to the plain consonants and can only access the long vowel syllables through the AltGr shift states br br br Abjads br br br Arabic br br This layout was developed by Microsoft from the classic Arabic typewriter layout and is used by IBM PCs

most but not all cases a given Armenian letter is at the same location as the corresponding Latin letter on the QWERTY keyboard The illustrated keyboard layout can be enabled on Linux with setxkbmap am variant phonetic Western and Eastern Armenian have different layouts br In the pre computer times Armenian keyboards had quite a different layout more suitable for producing letter combinations inherent to the language br Several attempts have been made to create innovative ergonomic layouts some of them inspired by Dvorak br br br Cyrillic br br br Bulgarian br br The current official Bulgarian keyboard layout for both typewriters and computer keyboards is described in BDS Bulgarian State National Standard It superseded the old standard BDS on January Like the Dvorak layout it has been designed to optimize typing speed and efficiency placing the most common letters in the Bulgarian language and under the strongest fingers In addition to the standard letters of the Bulgarian alphabet the layout includes the non Bulgarian Cyrillic symbols and and the Roman numerals I and V the X is supposed to be represented by the Cyrillic capital which is acceptable in typewriters but problematic in computers br There is also a second informal layout in widespread use the so called phonetic layout in which Cyrillic letters are mapped to the QWERTY keys for Latin letters that sound or look the same with several exceptions is mapped to Q is mapped to V etc see the layout and compare it to the standard QWERTY layout This layout is available as an alternative to the BDS one in some operating systems including Microsoft Windows Apple Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux Normally the layouts are set up so that the user can switch between Latin and Cyrillic script by pressing Shift Alt and between BDS and Phonetic by pressing Shift Ctrl br In Prof Dimiter Skordev from the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of Sofia University and Dimitar Dobrev from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences proposed a new standard prBDS including a revised version of the old BDS layout which includes the letter and the capital and replaces the letters I and V with the currency symbols of and respectively and a standardization of the informal phonetic layout After some controversy and a public discussion in the proposal was not accepted although it had been already used in several places the Bulgarian Phonetic layout in MS Windows Vista is based on it There is a new Bulgarian Phonetic layout in MS Windows br br br Macedonian br br The Macedonian keyboard layout is phonetic The Latin letters that have a phonetic equivalent in Macedonian are used for the corresponding Cyrillic letters The letters in the Macedonian alphabet and characters used in the Macedonian orthography that do not have any phonetic equivalent are br Even though they are not part of the Macedonian alphabet and are not used in the Macedonian language the first Macedonian keyboard layout supported by Windows uses Alt Gr to type the glyphs and where their capital forms are next to the small forms This keyboard does not include the glyphs and br A new revised standard version of the layout was supported with Windows Vista This version includes the glyphs and and uses Alt Gr to add an acute accent which is not included in the original Macedonian layout br br br Russian br br br JCUKEN br br The most common keyboard layout in modern Russia is the so called Windows layout which is the default Russian layout used in the MS Windows operating system The layout was designed to be compatible with the hardware standard in many other countries but introduced compromises to accommodate the larger alphabet The full stop and comma symbols share a key requiring the shift key to be held to produce a comma despite the high relative frequency of comma in the language br There are some other Russian keyboard layouts in use in particular the traditional Russian Typewriter layout punctuation symbols are placed on numerical keys one needs to press Shift to enter numbers and the Russian DOS layout similar to the Russian Typewriter layout with common punctuation symbols on numerical keys but numbers are entered without Shift The Russian Typewriter layout can be found on many Russian typewriters produced before the s and it is the default Russian keyboard layout in the OpenSolaris operating system br Keyboards in Russia always have Cyrillic letters on the keytops as well as Latin letters Usually Cyrillic and Latin letters are labeled with different colors br br br Russian QWERTY QWERTZ based phonetic layouts br br The Russian phonetic keyboard layout also called homophonic or transliterated is widely used outside Russia where normally there are no Russian letters drawn on keyboard buttons This layout is made for typists who are more familiar with other layouts like the common English QWERTY keyboard and follows the Greek and Armenian layouts in placing most letters at the corresponding Latin letter locations It is famous among both native speakers and people who use teach or are learning Russian and is recommended along with the Standard Layout by the linguists translators teachers and students of AATSEEL org The earliest known implementation of the Cyrillic to QWERTY homophonic keyboard was by former AATSEEL officer Constance Curtin between and for the PLATO education system s Russian Language curriculum developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Curtin s design sought to map phonetically related Russian sounds to QWERTY keys to map proximate phonetic and visual cues nearby one another as well as to map unused positions in a mnemonically ideal way Peter Zelchenko worked under Curtin at UIUC and his later modifications to the number row for Windows and Macintosh keyboards follow Curtin s original design intent br There are several different Russian phonetic layouts for example YaZhERT YaWERT and YaShERT suggested by AATSEEL org and called Student layout They are named after the first several letters that take over the QWERTY row on the Latin keyboard They differ by where a few of the letters are placed For example some have Cyrillic B which is pronounced V on the Latin W key after the German transliteration of B while others have it on the Latin V key br There are also variations within these variations for example the Mac OS X Phonetic Russian layout is YaShERT but differs in placement of and br Windows includes its own implementation of a mnemonic QWERTY based input method for Russian which does not fully rely on assigning a key to every Russian letter but uses the sh sc ch ya ja yu ju ye je yo jo combinations to input and respectively br Virtual on screen keyboards allow entering Cyrillic directly in a browser without activating the system layout br br br Serbian Cyrillic br br Apart from a set of characters common to most Cyrillic alphabets the Serbian Cyrillic layout uses six additional special characters unique or nearly unique to the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet and The Macedonian is on this keyboard despite not being used in Serbian Cyrillic br Due to the bialphabetic nature of the language actual physical keyboards with the Serbian Cyrillic layout printed on the keys are uncommon today Typical keyboards sold in Serbian speaking markets are marked with Serbian Latin characters and used with both the Latin QWERTZ and Cyrillic layout configured in the software What makes the two layouts this readily interchangeable is that the non alphabetic keys are identical between them and alphabetic keys always correspond directly to their counterparts except the Latin letters Q W X and Y that have no Cyrillic equivalents and the Cyrillic letters and whose Latin counterparts are digraphs LJ NJ and D This also makes the Serbian Cyrillic layout a rare example of a non Latin layout based on QWERTZ br br br Ukrainian br br Ukrainian keyboards based on a slight modification of Russian Standard Layout often also have the Russian Standard Windows layout marked on them making it easy to switch from one language to another This keyboard layout had several problems one of which was the omission of the letter which does not exist in Russian The other long standing problem was the omission of the apostrophe which is used in Ukrainian almost as commonly as in English though with a different meaning but which also does not exist in Russian Both of these problems were resolved with the improved Ukrainian keyboard layout for Windows available with Vista and subsequent Windows versions br There also exists an adapted keyboard for Westerners learning Ukrainian mostly in the diaspora which closely matches the QWERTY keyboard so that the letters either have the same sound or same shape for example pressing the v on the Latin QWERTY produces the Cyrillic which makes roughly the same sound and pressing the QWERTY w key gives the Cyrillic based on the similar shape This is usually called a homophonic or phonetic layout br br br Georgian br br There are no keyboards in Georgia with the Georgian script printed on the hardware The conventional keyboards are American QWERTY with a phonetically matched Georgian software layout Hardware with both Latin QWERTY and the Russian layout are very common forcing Georgians to know the Georgian layout blindly As with the Armenian Greek and phonetic Russian layouts most Georgian letters are on the same keys as their Latin equivalents During the Soviet era the Georgian alphabet was adapted to the Russian JCUKEN layout mainly for typewriters Soviet computers did not support Georgian keyboards After the dissolution of the Soviet Union a large variety of computers were introduced to post Soviet countries The keyboards had QWERTY layout for Latin alphabet and JCUKEN for Cyrillic both printed on keys Georgia started to adopt the QWERTY pattern In both cases the letters which did not exist in the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets were substituted by letters that did not exist in Georgian alphabet Today the most commonly used layout follows the QWERTY pattern with some changes br br br Greek br br The usual Greek layout follows the US layout for letters related to Latin letters ABDEHIKLMNOPRSTXYZ respectively substitutes phonetically similar letters at F at G and uses the remaining slots for the remaining Greek letters at J at C at V at U br Greek has two fewer letters than English but has two diacritic marks which because of their frequency are placed on the home row at the U K position they are dead keys Word final sigma has its own position as well replacing W and semicolon which is used as a question mark in Greek and colon move to the position of Q br br The Greek Polytonic layout has various dead keys to input the accented letters In Microsoft Windows there is also the Greek layout and the Greek layout There is a keyboard layout for Beta Code similar to greek standard layout The Greek Beta Code layout is based in a system for encoding Greek text using ASCII characters commonly used in digital humanities br br br Syllabic br br br Paleohispanic br br The Paleohispanic keyboard layout is designed to support the ancient scripts used in the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman influence These scripts include both Northern and Southern variations which are in the supplementary multilingual plane Unicode roadmap A keyboard that supports the base glyphs is available for the Northern version br br br Cherokee br br The Cherokee language uses an character syllabary The keyboard is available for the iPhone and iPad and is supported by Google br br br East Asian languages br br The orthography used for Chinese Japanese and Korean CJK characters require special input methods due to the thousands of possible characters in these languages Various methods have been invented to fit every possibility into a QWERTY keyboard so East Asian keyboards are essentially the same as those in other countries However their input methods are considerably more complex without one to one mappings between keys and characters br In general the range of possibilities is first narrowed down often by entering the desired character s pronunciation Then if there remains more than one possibility the desired ideogram is selected either by typing the number before the character or using a graphical menu to select it The computer assists the typist by using heuristics to guess which character is most likely desired Although this may seem painstaking East Asian input methods are today sufficient in that even for beginners typing in these languages is only slightly slower than typing an alphabetic language like English where each phoneme is represented by one grapheme br In Japanese the QWERTY based JIS keyboard layout is used and the pronunciation of each character is entered using various approximations to Hepburn romanization or Kunrei shiki romanization There are several kana based typing methods br Of the three Chinese has the most varied input options Characters can either be entered by pronunciation like Japanese and Hanja in Korean or by structure Most of the structural methods are very difficult to learn but extremely efficient for experienced typists as there is no need to select characters from a menu br There exist a variety of other slower methods in which a character may be entered If the pronunciation of a character is not known the selection can be narrowed down by giving its component shapes radicals and stroke count Also many input systems include a drawing pad permitting handwriting of a character using a mouse Finally if the computer does not have CJK software installed it may be possible to enter a character directly through its encoding number e g Unicode br In contrast to Chinese and Japanese Korean is typed similarly to Western languages There exist two major forms of keyboard layouts Dubeolsik and Sebeolsik Dubeolsik which shares its symbol layout with the QWERTY keyboard is much more commonly used While Korean consonants and vowels jamo are grouped together into syllabic grids when written the script is essentially alphabetical and therefore typing in Korean is quite simple for those who understand the Korean alphabet Hangul Each jamo is assigned to a single key As the user types letters the computer automatically groups them into syllabic characters Given a sequence of jamo there is only one unambiguous way letters can be validly grouped into syllables so the computer groups them together as the user types br br br Korean br br Pressing the Han Eng key once switches between Hangul as shown and QWERTY US layout There is another key to the left of the space bar for Hanja or input If using an ordinary keyboard without the two extra keys the right Alt key will become the Ha En key and the right Ctrl key will become the Hanja key br br br Dubeolsik br br Dubeolsik set is by far the most common and the sole national standard of Hangul keyboard layout in use in South Korea since Consonants occupy the left side of the layout while vowels are on the right br br br Sebeolsik br br Sebeolsik set was released in It is based on Kong Byung Woo s earlier work This layout is notable for its compatibility with the QWERTY layout almost all QWERTY symbols that are not alphanumeric are available in Hangul mode Numbers are placed in three rows Syllable initial consonants are on the right shown green in the picture and syllable final consonants and consonant clusters are on the left shown red Some consonant clusters are not printed on the keyboard the user has to press multiple consonant keys to input some consonant clusters unlike Sebeolsik Final It is more ergonomic than the dubeolsik but is not in wide use br br br Sebeolsik Final br br Sebeolsik Final set Final is another Hangul keyboard layout in use in South Korea It is the final Sebeolsik layout designed by Kong Byung Woo hence the name Numbers are placed on two rows Syllable initial consonants are on the right and syllable final consonants and consonant clusters are on the left Vowels are in the middle All consonant clusters are available on the keyboard unlike the Sebeolsik which does not include all of them It is more ergonomic than the dubeolsik but is not in wide use br br br Sebeolsik Noshift br br Sebeolsik Noshift is a variant of sebeolsik which can be used without pressing the shift key Its advantage is that people with disabilities who cannot press two keys at the same time will still be able to use it to type in Hangul br br br Korean Phonetic SIL br br Korean Phonetic SIL is a desktop keyboard layout It uses Korean letters arranged in a transliteration system that closely resembles Korean pronunciation It doesn t use romanization but provides a mnemonic layout for ease of use br br br Chinese br br Chinese keyboards are usually in US layout with without Chinese input method labels printed on keys Without an input method handler activated these keyboards would simply respond to Latin characters as physically labelled provided that the US keyboard layout is selected correctly in the operating system Most modern input methods allow input of both simplified and traditional characters and will simply default to one or the other based on the locale setting br br br People s Republic of China br br Keyboards used in the People s Republic of China are standard or slightly modified English US QWERTY ones without extra labelling while various IMEs are employed to input Chinese characters The most common IMEs are Hanyu pinyin based representing the pronunciation of characters using Latin letters However keyboards with labels for alternative structural input methods such as Wubi method can also be found although those are usually very old products and are extremely rare as of br br br Taiwan br br Computers in Taiwan often use Zhuyin bopomofo style keyboards US keyboards with bopomofo labels many also with Cangjie method key labels as Cangjie is a popular method for typing in traditional Chinese characters The bopomofo style keyboards are in lexicographical order top to bottom left to right The codes of three input methods are typically printed on the Chinese traditional keyboard Zhuyin upper right Cangjie lower left and Dayi lower right br br br Hong Kong and Macau br br In Hong Kong both Chinese Taiwan and US keyboards are found Japanese keyboards are occasionally found and UK keyboards are rare br For Chinese input Shape based input methods such as Cangjie pronounced cong kit in Cantonese or Chinese handwriting recognition are the most common input method The use of phonetic based input method is uncommon due to the lack of official standard for Cantonese romanisation and people in Hong Kong almost never learn any romanisation schemes in schools An advantage of phonetic based input method is that most Cantonese speakers are able to input Traditional Chinese characters with no particular training at all where they spell out the Cantonese sound of each character without tone marks e g heung gong for Cantonese Yale h ung g ng Hong Kong and to choose the characters from a list However Microsoft Windows which is the most popular operating system used in desktops does not provide any Cantonese phonetic input method requiring users to find and install third party input method software Also most people find the process of picking characters from a list being too slow due to homonyms so the Cangjie method is generally preferred br Although thorough training and practice are required to use Cangjie many Cantonese speakers have taken Cangjie input courses because of the fast typing speed availed by the input method This method is the fastest because it has the capability to fetch the exact unambiguous Chinese character which the user has in mind to input pinpointing to only one character in most cases This is also the reason why no provision for an input of phonetic accent is needed to complement this Input Method The Cangjie character feature is available on both Mac OS X and Windows On Mac OS X handwriting recognition input method is bundled with the OS br Macau utilizes the same layouts as Hong Kong with the addition of Portuguese Portugal or English US layout for Portuguese language br br br Malaysia and Singapore br br In Malaysia and Singapore English US or Traditional Chinese layout keyboards are found to input Chinese language br br br Japanese br br The JIS standard layout includes Japanese kana in addition to a QWERTY style layout The shifted values of many keys digits together with are a legacy of bit paired keyboards dating to ASCII telex machines and terminals of the s and s br For entering Japanese the most common method is entering text phonetically as romanized transliterated kana which are then converted to kanji as appropriate by an input method editor It is also possible to type kana directly depending on the mode used To type Takahashi a Japanese name one could type either TAKAHAS H I in Romanized R maji input mode or QTFD in kana input mode Then the user can proceed to the conversion step to convert the input into the appropriate kanji br The extra keys in the bottom row muhenkan henkan and the Hiragana Katakana switch key and the special keys in the leftmost column the hankaku zenkaku key at the upper left corner and the eis key at the Caps Lock position control various aspects of the conversion process and select different modes of input br br The Oyayubi Shifuto Thumb Shift layout is based on kana input but uses two modifying keys replacing the space bar When a key is pressed simultaneously with one of the keys it yields another letter Letters with the dakuten diacritic are typed with the opposite side thumb shift Letters with handakuten are either typed while the conventional pinky operated shift key is pressed that is each key corresponds to a maximum of letters or on the NICOLA variation on a key which does not have a dakuten counterpart br The H key in the QWERTY layout individually yields but with the R Thumb Shift key yields Simultaneous input with L Thumb Shift yields which is the individually mapped letter with the aforementioned dakuten While the pinky operated Shift key is pressed the same key yields This same letter must be typed with L Thumb Shift Y on the NICOLA variant br In Japan key Japanese keyboards and key English US layout keyboards are usually found br br br Layout changing software br The character code produced by any key press is determined by the keyboard driver software A key press generates a scancode which is interpreted as an alphanumeric character or control function Depending on operating systems various application programs are
