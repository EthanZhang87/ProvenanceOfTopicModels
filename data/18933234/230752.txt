A paragraph from Ancient Greek par graphos to write beside is a self contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea Though not required by the orthographic conventions of any language with a writing system paragraphs are a conventional means of organizing extended segments of prose br br The oldest classical British and Latin writings had little or no space between words and could be written in boustrophedon alternating directions Over time text direction left to right became standardized Word dividers and terminal punctuation became common The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original paragraphos similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group The Greek par graphos evolved into the pilcrow which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences br br br Ancient manuscripts also divided sentences into paragraphs with line breaks newline followed by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph An initial is an oversized capital letter sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text This style can be seen for example in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf Outdenting is still used in English typography though not commonly Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line This style can be seen in the handwritten United States Constitution from For additional ornamentation a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter paragraph white space or put in the indentation space br A second common modern English style is to use no indenting but add vertical white space to create block paragraphs On a typewriter a double carriage return produces a blank line for this purpose professional typesetters or word processing software may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting leading This style is very common in electronic formats such as on the World Wide Web and email Wikipedia itself employs this format br br Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph but indents those that follow For example Robert Bringhurst states that we should Set opening paragraphs flush left Bringhurst explains as follows br br The function of a paragraph is to mark a pause setting the paragraph apart from what precedes it If a paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead the indent is superfluous and can therefore be omitted br The Elements of Typographic Style states that at least one en space should be used to indent paragraphs after the first noting that that is the practical minimum An em space is the most commonly used paragraph indent Miles Tinker in his book Legibility of Print concluded that indenting the first line of paragraphs increases readability by on average br When referencing a paragraph typographic symbol U A SECTION SIGN sect may be used See Background br In modern usage paragraph initiation is typically indicated by one or more of a preceding blank line indentation an Initial drop cap or other indication Historically the pilcrow symbol was used in Latin and western European languages Other languages have their own marks with similar function br Widows and orphans occur when the first line of a paragraph is the last in a column or page or when the last line of a paragraph is the first line of a new column or page br br In word processing and desktop publishing a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new paragraph to be distinguished from the soft return at the end of a line internal to a paragraph This distinction allows word wrap to automatically re flow text as it is edited without losing paragraph breaks The software may apply vertical white space or indenting at paragraph breaks depending on the selected style br How such documents are actually stored depends on the file format For example HTML uses the p tag as a paragraph container In plaintext files there are two common formats The pre formatted text will have a newline at the end of every physical line and two newlines at the end of a paragraph creating a blank line An alternative is to only put newlines at the end of each paragraph and leave word wrapping up to the application that displays or processes the text br A line break that is inserted manually and preserved when re flowing may still be distinct from a paragraph break although this is typically not done in prose HTML s br tag produces a line break without ending the paragraph the W C recommends using it only to separate lines of verse where each paragraph is a stanza or in a street address br br Paragraphs are commonly numbered using the decimal system where in books the integral part of the decimal represents the number of the chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter in order of magnitude Thus in Whittaker and Watson s A Course of Modern Analysis chapter is devoted to Fourier Series within that chapter introduces Riemann s theory the following section treats an associated function following some properties of that function following a related lemma while introduces Riemann s main theorem and so on Whittaker and Watson attribute this system of numbering to Giuseppe Peano on their Contents page although this attribution does not seem to be widely credited elsewhere Gradshteyn and Ryzhik is another book using this scheme since its third edition in br br Many published books use a device to separate certain paragraphs further when there is a change of scene or time This extra space especially when co occurring at a page or section break may contain a special symbol known as a dinkus a fleuron or a stylistic dingbat br br The crafting of clear coherent paragraphs is the subject of considerable stylistic debate The form varies among different types of writing For example newspapers scientific journals and fictional essays have somewhat different conventions for the placement of paragraph breaks br A common English usage misconception is that a paragraph has three to five sentences single word paragraphs can be seen in some professional writing and journalists often use single sentence paragraphs br English students are sometimes taught that a paragraph should have a topic sentence or main idea preferably first and multiple supporting or detail sentences that explain or supply evidence One technique of this type intended for essay writing is known as the Schaffer paragraph Topic sentences are largely a phenomenon of school based writing and the convention does not necessarily obtain in other contexts This advice is also culturally specific for example it differs from stock advice for the construction of paragraphs in Japanese translated as danraku br br
