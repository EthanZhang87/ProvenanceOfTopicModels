Tetris Russian is a puzzle video game created in by Alexey Pajitnov a Soviet software engineer It has been published by several companies on more than platforms setting a Guinness world record for the most ported game After a significant period of publication by Nintendo in the rights reverted to Pajitnov who co founded the Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage licensing br In Tetris players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces tetrominoes which descend onto the playing field The completed lines disappear and grant the player points and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces The game ends when the uncleared lines reach the top of the playing field The longer the player can delay this outcome the higher their score will be In multiplayer games players must last longer than their opponents in certain versions players can inflict penalties on opponents by completing a significant number of lines Some versions add variations such as D displays or systems for reserving pieces br Tetris is often named one of the greatest video games By December it had sold million copies approximately million physical units and million paid mobile game downloads making it one of the best selling video game franchises The Game Boy version is one of the best selling games of all time with more than million copies sold Imagery from the game has influenced architecture music and cosplay Tetris also been the subject of various studies that have analyzed its theoretical complexity and have shown its effect on the human brain following a session in particular the Tetris effect br br br Gameplay br Tetris is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms called tetrominoes descend from the top of the field During this descent the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them but can accelerate them in most versions The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many complete horizontal lines of blocks as possible When a line is completed it disappears and the blocks placed above fall one rank Completing lines grants points and accumulating a certain number of points or cleared lines moves the player up a level which increases the number of points granted per completed line br In most versions the speed of the falling pieces increases with each level leaving the player with less time to think about the placement The player can clear multiple lines at once which can earn bonus points in some versions It is possible to complete up to four lines simultaneously with the use of the I shaped tetromino this move is called a Tetris and along with the fact that its seven different pieces tetrominoes are made up of squares is the basis of the game s title br If the player cannot make the blocks disappear quickly enough the field will start to fill when the pieces reach the top of the field and prevent the arrival of additional pieces the game ends At the end of each game the player receives a score based on the number of lines that have been completed The game never ends with the player s victory as the player can complete only as many lines as possible before an inevitable loss br Since the Tetris Company has internally defined specifications and guidelines to which publishers must adhere to be granted a license to Tetris The contents of these guidelines establish elements such as the correspondence of buttons and actions the size of the field of play and the system of rotation br br br Game pieces br br The pieces on which the game of Tetris is based around are called tetrominoes Pajitnov s original version for the Electronika computer used green brackets to represent the blocks that make up tetrominoes Versions of Tetris on the original Game Boy Game Boy Color and on most dedicated handheld games use black and white or grayscale graphics but most popular versions use a separate color for each distinct shape Prior to the Tetris Company s standardization in the early s those colors varied widely from implementation to implementation br br br Scoring br The scoring formula for the majority of Tetris products is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points For example a single line clear in Tetris Zone is worth points clearing four lines at once known as a Tetris is worth while each subsequent back to back Tetris is worth In conjunction players can be awarded combos that exist in certain games which reward multiple line clears in quick succession The exact conditions for triggering combos and the amount of importance assigned to them vary from game to game br Nearly all Tetris games allow the player to press a button to increase the speed of the current piece s descent or cause the piece to drop and lock into place immediately known as a soft drop and a hard drop respectively While performing a soft drop the player can also stop the piece s increased speed by releasing the button before the piece settles into place Some games allow only one of either soft drop or hard drop others have separate buttons for each Many games award a number of points based on the height that the piece fell before locking so using the hard drop generally awards more points br br br Infinite game question br In John Brzustowski at the University of British Columbia wrote a thesis reflecting on the question of whether or not one could theoretically play Tetris forever He reached the conclusion that the game is statistically doomed to end If a player receives a sufficiently large sequence of alternating S and Z tetrominoes the na ve gravity used by the standard game eventually forces the player to leave holes on the board The holes will necessarily stack to the top and ultimately end the game If the pieces are distributed randomly this sequence will eventually occur Thus if a game with for example an ideal uniform uncorrelated random number generator is played long enough any player will almost surely top out br Modern versions of Tetris released after use a bag style randomizer that guarantees players will never receive more than four S and Z pieces in a row by shuffling tetrominoes of all types for each seven pieces This is one of the Indispensable Rules enforced by the Tetris Guideline that all officially licensed Tetris games must follow br br br Easy spin dispute br Easy spin or infinite spin is a feature in some Tetris games where a tetromino stops falling for a moment after left or right movement or rotation effectively allowing the player to suspend the piece while deciding where to place it The mechanic was introduced in s The Next Tetris and drew criticism in reviews of s Tetris Worlds br This feature has been implemented into the Tetris Company s official guideline This type of play differs from traditional Tetris because it takes away the pressure of higher level speed Some reviewers went so far as to say that this mechanism broke the game The goal in Tetris Worlds is to complete a certain number of lines as fast as possible so the ability to hold off a piece s placement will not make achieving that goal any faster Later GameSpot received easy spin more openly saying that the infinite spin issue honestly really affects only a few of the single player gameplay modes in Tetris DS because any competitive mode requires you to lay down pieces as quickly as humanly possible br Henk Rogers told Nintendo World Report that infinite spin was an intentional part of the game design allowing novice players to expend some of their available scoring time to decide on the best placement of a piece He observed that gratuitous spinning does not occur in competitive play as expert players do not require much time to think about where a piece should be placed A limitation has been placed on infinite lock delay in later games of the franchise where after a certain amount of rotations and movements the piece will instantly lock itself This is defaulted to such actions br br br History br br br Conception br br In Alexey Pajitnov joined the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences as a speech recognition researcher While he was tasked with testing the capabilities of new hardware his ambition was to use computers to make people happy Pajitnov developed several puzzle games on the institute s computer an Electronika a scarce resource at the time due in part to CoCom For Pajitnov games allow people to get to know each other better and act as revealers of things you might not normally notice such as their way of thinking br In while trying to recreate a favorite puzzle game from his childhood featuring pentominoes Pajitnov imagined a game consisting of a descent of random pieces that the player would turn to fill rows Pajitnov felt that the game would be needlessly complicated with twelve different shape variations so he scaled the concept down to tetrominoes of which there are seven variants Pajitnov titled the game Tetris a word created from a combination of tetra meaning four and his favorite sport tennis br Because the Electronika had no graphical interface Pajitnov modelled the field and pieces using spaces and brackets lines of ASCII characters Realizing that completed lines filled the screen quickly Pajitnov decided to delete them creating a key part of Tetris gameplay This early version of Tetris had no scoring system and no levels but its addictive quality distinguished it from the other puzzle games Pajitnov had created Pajitnov wrote the game using Pascal for the RT operating system on the Electronika br Pajitnov had completed the first playable version of Tetris c Pajitnov presented Tetris to his colleagues who quickly became addicted to it It permeated the offices within the Academy of Sciences and within a few weeks it reached every Moscow institute with a computer min A friend of Pajitnov Vladimir Pokhilko who requested the game for the Moscow Medical Institute saw people stop working to play Tetris Pokhilko eventually banned the game from the Medical Institute to restore productivity br Pajitnov sought to adapt Tetris to the IBM Personal Computer which had a higher quality display than the Electronika Pajitnov recruited Vadim Gerasimov a year old high school student who was known for his computer skills Pajitnov had met Gerasimov before through a mutual acquaintance and they had worked together on previous games Gerasimov adapted Tetris to the IBM PC over the course of a few weeks incorporating color and a scoreboard The PC port was written with Turbo Pascal br br br Acquisition of rights by Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte br Pajitnov wanted to export Tetris but had no knowledge of the business world His superiors in the Academy were not necessarily happy with the success of the game since they had not intended such a creation from the research team Furthermore copyright law of the Soviet Union created a state monopoly on import and export of copyrighted works and the Soviet researchers were not allowed to sell their creations min Pajitnov asked his supervisor Victor Brjabrin who had knowledge of the world outside the Soviet Union to help him publish Tetris Pajitnov offered to transfer the rights of the game to the Academy and was delighted to receive a non compulsory remuneration from Brjabrin through this deal br In Brjabrin sent a copy of Tetris to Hungarian game publisher Novotrade From there copies of the game began circulating via floppy disks throughout Hungary and as far as Poland Robert Stein an international software salesman for the London based firm Andromeda Software saw the game s commercial potential during a visit to Hungary in June min After an indifferent response from the Academy min Stein contacted Pajitnov and Brjabrin by fax to obtain the license rights min The researchers expressed interest in forming an agreement with Stein via fax but they were unaware that this fax communication could be considered a legal contract in the Western world Stein began to approach other companies to produce the game br Stein approached publishers at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Gary Carlston co founder of Broderbund retrieved a copy and brought it to California Despite enthusiasm amongst its employees Broderbund remained skeptical because of the game s Soviet origins Likewise Mastertronic co founder Martin Alper declared that no Soviet product will ever work in the Western world br Stein ultimately signed two agreements he sold the European rights to the publisher Mirrorsoft and the American rights to sister company Spectrum HoloByte The latter obtained the rights after a visit to Mirrorsoft by Spectrum HoloByte president Phil Adam in which he played Tetris for two hours min At that time Stein had not yet signed a contract with the Soviet Union Nevertheless he sold the rights to the two companies for and a royalty of to on sales br Before releasing Tetris in the United States Spectrum HoloByte CEO Gilman Louie asked for an overhaul of the game s graphics and music The Soviet spirit was preserved with fields illustrating Russian parks and buildings as well as melodies anchored in Russian folklore of the time The company s goal was to make people want to buy a Russian product The game came complete with a red package and Cyrillic text an unusual approach on the other side of the Berlin Wall min The Spectrum HoloByte version was released for the DOS PCs in January with other platforms following over the next year br Mirrorsoft ported Tetris to platforms including the Amiga Atari ST ZX Spectrum Commodore and Amstrad CPC Tetris was a commercial success in Europe and the United States Mirrorsoft sold tens of thousands of copies in two months and Spectrum HoloByte sold over units in the space of a year min According to Spectrum HoloByte the average Tetris player was between and years old and was a manager or engineer At the Software Publishers Association s Excellence in Software Awards ceremony in March Tetris won Best Entertainment Software Best Original Game Best Strategy Program and Best Consumer Software br Stein was faced with a problem the only document certifying a license fee was the fax from Pajitnov and Brjabrin meaning that Stein sold the license for a game he did not yet own Stein contacted Pajitnov and asked him for a contract for the rights Stein began negotiations via fax offering of the revenue generated by Stein from the license Elektronorgtechnica Elorg the Soviet Union s central organization for the import and export of computer software was unconvinced and requested of the revenue Stein made several trips to Moscow and held long discussions with Elorg representatives br Stein came to an agreement with Elorg on February On May min he signed a contract for a ten year worldwide Tetris license for all current and future computer systems Pajitnov and Brjabrin were unaware that the game was already on sale and that Stein had claimed to own the rights prior to the agreement Although Pajitnov did not receive any percentage from these sales he said that the fact that so many people enjoy my game is enough for me br br br Acquisition of rights by Nintendo and legal battle br br In Spectrum HoloByte sold the Japanese rights to its computer games to Bullet Proof Software s Henk Rogers who was searching for games for the Japanese market min Mirrorsoft sold arcade rights to Atari Games subsidiary Tengen which then sold the Japanese arcade rights to Sega and the console rights to BPS which published versions for Japanese computers including the MSX PC and X along with a console port for the Nintendo Family Computer Famicom known outside Japan as the Nintendo Entertainment System The Japanese port was written in C and in assembly language for Nintendo br At this point almost a dozen companies believed they held the Tetris rights with Stein retaining rights for home computer versions The Soviet Union s Elorg was still unaware of the deals Stein had negotiated which did not bring money to them Tetris was a commercial success in North America Europe and Asia min br The same year Nintendo was preparing to launch its first portable console the Game Boy Nintendo was attracted to Tetris by its simplicity and established success on the Famicom Rogers who was close to then Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi sought to obtain the handheld rights After a failed negotiation with Atari Rogers contacted Stein in November Stein agreed to sign a contract but explained that he had to consult Elorg before returning to negotiations with Rogers min After contacting Stein several times Rogers began to suspect a breach of contract on Stein s part and he decided in February to go to the Soviet Union and negotiate the rights with Elorg br Rogers arrived at the Elorg offices uninvited while Stein and Mirrorsoft manager Kevin Maxwell made an appointment the same day without consulting each other min During the discussions Rogers explained that he wanted to obtain the rights to Tetris for the Game Boy After quickly obtaining an agreement with Elorg president Nikolai Belikov Rogers showed Belikov a Famicom Tetris cartridge Belikov was surprised as he believed at the time that the rights to Tetris were only signed for computer systems min br The present parties accused Rogers of illegal publication but Rogers defended himself by explaining that he had obtained the rights via Atari Games which had itself signed an agreement with Stein Belikov then realized the complex path that the license had followed within four years because of Stein s contracts and he constructed a strategy to regain possession of the rights and obtain better commercial agreements At that point Elorg was faced with three different companies seeking to buy the rights min br During this time Rogers befriended Pajitnov over a game of Go Pajitnov supported Rogers throughout the discussions to the detriment of Maxwell who had come to secure the console rights for Mirrorsoft Belikov proposed to Rogers that Stein s rights would be cancelled and Nintendo would be granted the game rights for both home and handheld consoles Rogers flew to the United States to convince Nintendo s American branch to sign up for the rights The contract with Elorg was signed by executive and president Minoru Arakawa for plus cents per cartridge sold min br Elorg then sent an updated contract to Stein One of the clauses defined a computer as a machine with a screen and keyboard and thus Stein s rights to console versions were withdrawn min Stein signed the contract without paying attention to this clause and later realized that all the contract s other clauses notably on payments were only a smokescreen to deceive him min br In March Nintendo sent a cease and desist to Atari Games concerning production of the NES version of Tetris min Atari Games contacted Mirrorsoft and were assured that they still retained the rights Nintendo maintained its position In response Mirrorsoft owner Robert Maxwell pressured Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev to cancel the contract between Elorg and Nintendo Despite the threats to Belikov Elorg refused to give in and highlighted the financial advantages of their contract compared to those signed with Stein and Mirrorsoft min br On June Nintendo and Atari Games began a legal battle in the courts of San Francisco Atari Games sought to prove that the NES was a computer as indicated by its Japanese name Famicom an abbreviation of Family Computer In this case the initial license would authorize Atari Games to release the game The central argument of Atari Games was that the Famicom was designed to be convertible into a computer via its extension port This argument was not accepted and Pajitnov stressed that the initial contract only concerned computers and no other machine br Nintendo brought Belikov to testify on its behalf min Judge Fern M Smith declared that Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte never received explicit authorization for marketing on consoles and on June ruled in Nintendo s favor granting them a preliminary injunction against Atari Games in the process The next day Atari Games withdrew its NES version from sale and thousands of cartridges remained unsold in the company s warehouses br Sega had planned to release a Genesis version of Tetris on April but cancelled its release during Nintendo and Atari s legal battle fewer than ten copies were manufactured A new port of the arcade version by M was included in the Sega Genesis Mini microconsole released in September br br br Commercial success and acquisition of rights by Pajitnov br br Through the legal history of the license Pajitnov gained a reputation in the West He was regularly invited by journalists and publishers through which he discovered that Tetris had sold millions of copies from which he had not made any money He took pride in the game which he considered an electronic ambassador of benevolence br In January Pajitnov was invited by Spectrum HoloByte to the Consumer Electronics Show and he was immersed in American life for the first time After a period of adaptation he explored American culture in several cities including Las Vegas San Francisco New York City and Boston He engaged in interviews with several hosts including the directors of Nintendo of America He marveled at the freedom and the advantages of Western society and upon returning to the Soviet Union he spoke often of his travels to his colleagues He realized that there was no market in Russia for their programs At the same time sales of the Game Boy bundled with a handheld version of Tetris exploded exceeding sales forecasts three times br In Pajitnov and Pokhilko emigrated to the United States Pajitnov moved to Seattle where he produced games for Spectrum HoloByte In April as agreed with the Academy ten years earlier and following an agreement with Rogers the rights to Tetris reverted to Pajitnov Pajitnov and Rogers founded the Tetris Company in June to manage the rights on all platforms the previous agreements having expired Pajitnov now receives a royalty for each Tetris game and derivative sold worldwide br In Pajitnov and Rogers founded Tetris Holding after the purchase of the game s remaining rights from Elorg now a private entity following the dissolution of the Soviet Union The Tetris Company now owns all rights to the Tetris brand and it is mainly responsible for removing unlicensed clones from the market The company regularly calls on Apple Inc and Google to remove illegal versions from their mobile app stores In one notable case Tetris Holding LLC v Xio Interactive Inc Tetris Holding and the Tetris Company defended its copyright against an iOS clone which established a new stance on evaluating video game clone infringements based on look and feel br In December Electronic Arts acquired Jamdat a company specializing in mobile games Jamdat had previously bought a company founded by Rogers in which managed the Tetris license on mobile platforms As a result Electronic Arts held a year license on all mobile phone releases of Tetris which expired on April br As of Blue Planet Software a successor company to Bullet Proof Software founded by Henk Rogers owns a stake of The Tetris Company with Tetris Holding having the other half br br br Versions br br Tetris has been released on a multitude of platforms since the creation of the original version on the Electronika The game is available on most game consoles and is playable on personal computers smartphones and iPods Guinness World Records recognized Tetris as the most ported video game in history with over variants having appeared on over different platforms as of October By this number had increased to official variants br Since the s internet versions of the game have been developed Commercial versions not approved by the Tetris Company tend to be purged due to company policy The most famous online version Tetris Friends by Tetris Online Inc had attracted over a million registered users Tetris Online had also developed versions for console based digital download services Because of its popularity and simplicity of development Tetris is often used as a hello world project for programmers coding for a new system or programming language This has resulted in the availability of a large number of ports for different platforms For instance Torrent and GNU Emacs contain similar shape stacking games as easter eggs br Within official franchise installments each version has made improvements to accommodate advancing technology and the goal to provide a more complete game Developers are given freedom to add new modes of play and revisit the concept from different angles Some concepts developed on official versions have been integrated into the Tetris guidelines in order to standardize future versions and allow players to migrate between different versions with little effort The IBM PC version was the most evolved from the original version featuring a graphical interface colored tetrominoes running statistics for the number of tetrominoes placed and a guide for the controls br br br Computational complexity br In computer science it is common to analyze the computational complexity of problems including real life problems and games It was proven that for the offline version of Tetris the player knows the complete sequence of pieces that will be dropped i e there is no hidden information the following objectives are NP complete br br Maximizing the number of rows cleared while playing the given piece sequence br Maximizing the number of pieces placed before a loss occurs br Maximizing the number of simultaneous clearing of four rows br Minimizing the height of the highest filled grid square over the course of the sequence br Also it is difficult to even approximately solve the first second and fourth problem It is NP hard given an initial gameboard and a sequence of p pieces to approximate the first two problems to within a factor of p for any constant br It is NP hard to approximate the last problem within a factor of for any constant br To prove NP completeness it was shown that there is a polynomial reduction between the partition problem which is also NP complete and the Tetris problem br br br Music br br The earliest versions of Tetris had no music The s Russian folk tune Korobeiniki first appeared in Spectrum Holobyte s Macintosh and Apple IIGS versions of Tetris as one of the tunes that briefly plays at the start of each level It also appeared as the title screen music in Bullet Proof Software s Japanese Famicom release Nintendo s NES version does not include Korobeiniki instead it includes an arrangement of Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy from the second act of The Nutcracker composed by Tchaikovsky and arranged by Hirokazu Tanaka along with two original compositions by Tanaka Nintendo s Game Boy version includes Korobeiniki as well as Johann Sebastian Bach s French Suite No In B Minor BWV and an original track by Tanaka The version included in the Super NES compilation Tetris Dr Mario uses arrangements of the Game Boy version s music br Korobeiniki is used in most versions of the game and has appeared in other games albums and films that make reference to Tetris Doctor Spin s Eurodance cover under the name Tetris reached on the UK singles chart In the s the Tetris Company added as a prerequisite for the granting of the license that a version of Korobeiniki be available in the game br The World War II Soviet folk tune Katyusha also appeared in the Tengen and Bullet Proof Software versions br br br Cognitive effects br br Tetris has been the subject of academic research Vladimir Pokhilko was the first clinical psychologist to conduct experiments using Tetris Subsequently it has been used for research in several fields including the theory of computation algorithmic theory and cognitive psychology br Tetris can cause the brain to involuntarily picture Tetris combinations even when the player is not playing the Tetris effect although this can occur with any computer game or situation showcasing repeated images or scenarios such as a jigsaw puzzle While debates about Tetris s cognitive benefits continue some researchers view it as a milestone in the gamification of education br Studies by American psychologist Richard Haier discovered in that the brain used less energy as players gaming skills got better The study showed that regular Tetris playing allowed the brain to perform more optimally and even increased the thickness of the cerebral cortex Prolonged Tetris activity can also lead to more efficient brain activity during play When first playing Tetris brain function and activity increases along with greater cerebral energy consumption measured by glucose metabolic rate As Tetris players become more proficient their brains show a reduced consumption of glucose indicating more efficient brain activity for this task According to one study moderate play of Tetris half an hour a day for three months boosts general cognitive functions such as critical thinking reasoning language and processing and increases cerebral cortex thickness br Jackie Andrade and Jon May from Plymouth University s Cognition Institute and doctoral student Jessica Skorka Brown have conducted research that shows that playing Tetris could distract from cravings and give a quick and manageable fix for people struggling to stick to diets or quit smoking or drinking br Harvard University researcher Robert Stickgold conducted extensive studies in relating sleep to Tetris After playing several hours each night before bed of users reported seeing pieces of Tetris as they fell asleep and even when they were waking up This is a result of hours of game play which allows the brain to start creating new neural pathways This helps the brain recognize patterns easier and perform well with less effort The brain starts to get trained to search for more images to organize Players have been found to unconsciously think about ways they can fit objects together in real life such as visualizing buildings or store shelves Using his findings to build on Richard Haier s previous work he coined the term Tetris effect br In January an Oxford University research group headed by Emily Holmes reported that for healthy volunteers playing Tetris soon after viewing traumatic material in the laboratory reduced the number of flashbacks to those scenes in the following week They believe that the computer game may disrupt the memories that are retained of the sights and sounds witnessed at the time and which are later re experienced through involuntary distressing flashbacks of that moment The group hoped to develop this approach further as a potential intervention to reduce the flashbacks experienced in post traumatic stress disorder but emphasized that these are only preliminary results A study found that people who played Tetris and similar games such as Candy Crush while waiting for treatment following traffic accidents had fewer intrusive memories the following week br A study conducted by Mind Research Network in noticed that girls who played Tetris for minutes over a month period showed a higher function in brain efficiency and cortical thickness Prolonged Tetris playing may have significant improvement on players cognitive skills spatial awareness and memory retention br Another notable effect is that according to a Canadian study in April playing Tetris has been found to treat older adolescents with amblyopia lazy eye which was better than patching a victim s well eye to train their weaker eye Robert Hess of the research team said It s much better than patching much more enjoyable it s faster and it seems to work better Tested in the United Kingdom this experiment also appears to help children with that problem br Tetris is addictive because of the Zeigarnik effect the human brain stores incomplete tasks and disposes of them when no longer needed Tetris by constantly creating new unfinished tasks holds our attention br A study in conducted a data extraction on studies conducted between and and found a positive correlation to reduced stress with playing casual games The study categorized Tetris as a casual video game Tetris was also included in this category as a relaxation tool for many who struggled with anxiety br br br Reception and legacy br br Compute called the IBM version of Tetris one of the most addictive computer games this side of the Berlin Wall it is not the game to start if you have work to do or an appointment to keep Consider yourself warned Orson Scott Card joked that the game proves that Russia still wants to bury us I shudder to think of the blow to our economy as computer productivity drops to Noting that Tetris was not copy protected he wrote Obviously the game is meant to find its way onto every American machine br The IBM version of the game was reviewed in in Dragon No by Hartley Patricia and Kirk Lesser in The Role of Computers column The reviewers gave the game out of stars The Lessers later reviewed Spectrum HoloByte s Macintosh version of Tetris in in Dragon No giving that version out of stars br Macworld reviewed the Macintosh version of Tetris in praising its strategic gameplay stating that Tetris offers the rare combination of being simple to learn but extremely challenging to play and also praising the inclusion of the Desk Accessory version which uses less RAM Macworld summarized their review by listing Tetris pros and cons stating that Tetris is elegant easy to play challenging and addicting requires quick thinking long term strategy and lightning reflexes and listed Tetris cons as None br Roy Wagner reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World and said that Tetris is simple in concept simple to play and a unique design br In their June issue Zzap awarded the Commodore version a score of the joint highest score in the history of the magazine br There was a hoax that circulated in February that the original NES instruction manual for Tetris had named the seven tetrominoes with names like Orange Ricky Hero and Smashboy but was disproven Despite being disproven by video game historians a question on the October broadcast of Jeopardy alluded to these names br br br Sales br Spectrum HoloByte s versions for personal computers sold copies for million million adjusted for inflation in two years between and Tetris gained greater success with the release of Nintendo s NES version and Game Boy version in In six months of release by the NES version sold million copies for million million adjusted for inflation while Game Boy bundles with Tetris sold million units It topped the Japanese sales charts during August September and from December to January br Tetris became Nintendo s top seller for the first few months of Nintendo s versions of Tetris sold million copies in the United States by and more than million worldwide by Nintendo eventually sold a total of million copies for the Game Boy and million for the NES min br Sega s arcade version of Tetris was successful in Japan where it became the highest grossing arcade game of Spectrum HoloByte s PC versions of Tetris sold more than million copies as of with women accounting for nearly half of Tetris players in contrast to most other PC games br In January the Tetris franchise had sold more than million copies including approximately million physical copies and over million copies for cell phones making it one of the best selling video game franchises of all time As of December Tetris has sold million paid mobile game downloads br br br Accolades br In the ZX Spectrum version of the game was voted number in the Your Sinclair Official Top Games of All Time In
