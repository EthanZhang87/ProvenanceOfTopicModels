An organization or organisation Commonwealth English see spelling differences is an entity such as a company an institution formal organization or an association comprising one or more people and having a particular purpose br The word is derived from the Greek word organon which means tool or instrument musical instrument and organ br br br Types br There are a variety of legal types of organizations including corporations governments non governmental organizations political organizations international organizations armed forces charities not for profit corporations partnerships cooperatives and educational institutions etc br A hybrid organization is a body that operates in both the public sector and the private sector simultaneously fulfilling public duties and developing commercial market activities br A voluntary association is an organization consisting of volunteers Such organizations may be able to operate without legal formalities depending on jurisdiction including informal clubs or coordinating bodies with a goal in mind which they may express in the form of an manifesto mission statement or implicitly through the organization s actions br Organizations may also operate secretly or illegally in the case of secret societies criminal organizations and resistance movements And in some cases may have obstacles from other organizations e g MLK s organization br What makes an organization recognized by the government is either filling out incorporation or recognition in the form of either societal pressure e g Advocacy group causing concerns e g Resistance movement or being considered the spokesperson of a group of people subject to negotiation e g the Polisario Front being recognized as the sole representative of the Sahrawi people and forming a partially recognized state br Compare the concept of social groups which may include non organizations br Organizations and institutions can be synonymous but Jack Knight writes that organizations are a narrow version of institutions or represent a cluster of institutions the two are distinct in the sense that organizations contain internal institutions that govern interactions between the members of the organizations br br br Structures br br The study of organizations includes a focus on optimising organizational structure According to management science most human organizations fall roughly into four types br br Committees or juries br Ecologies br Matrix organizations br Pyramids or hierarchies br br br Committees or juries br These consist of a group of peers who decide as a group perhaps by voting The difference between a jury and a committee is that the members of the committee are usually assigned to perform or lead further actions after the group comes to a decision whereas members of a jury come to a decision In common law countries legal juries render decisions of guilt liability and quantify damages juries are also used in athletic contests book awards and similar activities Sometimes a selection committee functions like a jury In the Middle Ages juries in continental Europe were used to determine the law according to consensus among local notables br Committees are often the most reliable way to make decisions Condorcet s jury theorem proved that if the average member votes better than a roll of dice then adding more members increases the number of majorities that can come to a correct vote however correctness is defined The problem is that if the average member is subsequently worse than a roll of dice the committee s decisions grow worse not better therefore staffing is crucial br Parliamentary procedure such as Robert s Rules of Order helps prevent committees from engaging in lengthy discussions without reaching decisions br br br Ecologies br This organizational structure promotes internal competition Inefficient components of the organization starve while effective ones get more work Everybody is paid for what they actually do and so runs a tiny business that has to show a profit or they are fired br Companies that utilize this organization type reflect a rather one sided view of what goes on in ecology It is also the case that a natural ecosystem has a natural border ecoregions do not in general compete with one another in any way but are very autonomous br The pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline talks about functioning as this type of organization in this external article from The Guardian br By Bastian Batac De Leon br br br Matrix organization br br This organizational type assigns each worker two bosses in two different hierarchies One hierarchy is functional and assures that each type of expert in the organization is well trained and measured by a boss who is a super expert in the same field The other direction is executive and tries to get projects completed using the experts Projects might be organized by products regions customer types or some other schemes br As an example a company might have an individual with overall responsibility for products X and Y and another individual with overall responsibility for engineering quality control etc Therefore subordinates responsible for quality control of project X will have two reporting lines The United States aerospace industries were the first to officially use this organizational structure after it emerged in the early s br br br Pyramids or hierarchical br A hierarchy exemplifies an arrangement with a leader who leads other individual members of the organization This arrangement is often associated with the basis that there are enough to imagine a real pyramid if there are not enough stone blocks to hold up the higher ones gravity would irrevocably bring down the monumental structure So one can imagine that if the leader does not have the support of his subordinates the entire structure will collapse Hierarchies were satirized in The Peter Principle a book that introduced hierarchiology and the saying that in a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence br br br Theories br br In the social sciences organizations are the object of analysis for a number of disciplines such as sociology economics political science psychology management and organizational communication The broader analysis of organizations is commonly referred to as organizational structure organizational studies organizational behavior or organization analysis A number of different perspectives exist some of which are compatible br br From a functional perspective the focus is on how entities like businesses or state authorities are used br From an institutional perspective an organization is viewed as a purposeful structure within a social context br From a process related perspective an organization is viewed as an entity being re organized and the focus is on the organization as a set of tasks or actions br Sociology can be defined as the science of the institutions of modernity specific institutions serve a function akin to the individual organs of a coherent body In the social and political sciences in general an organization may be more loosely understood as the planned coordinated and purposeful action of human beings working through collective action to reach a common goal or construct a tangible product This action is usually framed by formal membership and form institutional rules Sociology distinguishes the term organization into planned formal and unplanned informal i e spontaneously formed organizations Sociology analyses organizations in the first line from an institutional perspective In this sense the organization is an enduring arrangement of elements These elements and their actions are determined by rules so that a certain task can be fulfilled through a system of coordinated division of labor br Economic approaches to organizations also take the division of labor as a starting point The division of labor allows for economies of specialization Increasing specialization necessitates coordination From an economic point of view markets and organizations are alternative coordination mechanisms for the execution of transactions br An organization is defined by the elements that are part of it who belongs to the organization and who does not its communication which elements communicate and how do they communicate its autonomy which changes are executed autonomously by the organization or its elements and its rules of action compared to outside events what causes an organization to act as a collective actor br By coordinated and planned cooperation of the elements the organization is able to solve tasks that lie beyond the abilities of the single element The price paid by the elements is the limitation of the degrees of freedom of the elements Advantages of organizations are enhancement more of the same addition combination of different features and extension Disadvantages can be inertness through coordination and loss of interaction br Among the theories that are or have been influential are br br Activity theory is the major theoretical influence acknowledged by de Clodomir Santos de Morais in the development of Organization Workshop method br Actor network theory an approach to social theory and research originating in the field of science studies which treats objects as part of social networks br Complexity theory and organizations the use of complexity theory in the field of strategic management and organizational studies br Contingency theory a class of behavioral theories that claim that there is no best way to organize a corporation to lead a company or to make decisions br Critical management studies a loose but extensive grouping of theoretically informed critiques of management business and organization grounded originally in a critical theory perspective br Economic sociology studies both the social effects and the social causes of various economic phenomena br Enterprise architecture the conceptual model that defines the coalescence of organizational structure and organizational behavior br Garbage Can Model describes a model which disconnects problems solutions and decision makers from each other br Principal agent problem concerns the difficulties in motivating one party the agent to act in the best interests of another the principal rather than in his or her own interests br Scientific management mainly following Frederick W Taylor a theory of management that analyses and synthesizes workflows br Social entrepreneurship the process of pursuing innovative solutions to social problems br Transaction cost theory the idea that people begin to organize their production in firms when the transaction cost of coordinating production through the market exchange given imperfect information is greater than within the firm br Weber s Ideal of Bureaucracy refer to Max Weber s chapter on Bureaucracy in his book Economy and Society br br br Leadership br br A leader in a formal hierarchical organization is appointed to a managerial position and has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of his position However he must possess adequate personal attributes to match his authority because authority is only potentially available to him In the absence of sufficient personal competence a manager may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead However only the authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in the hierarchy with commensurate authority br br br Formal organizations br An organization that is established as a means for achieving defined objectives has been referred to as a formal organization Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organization Divisions departments sections positions jobs and tasks make up this work structure Thus the formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard to relationships with clients or with its members According to Weber s definition entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority Each employee receives a salary and enjoys a degree of tenure that safeguards him from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients The higher his position in the hierarchy the greater his presumed expertise in adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization It is this bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position br br br Informal organizations br In contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit a leader emerges within the context of the informal organization that underlies the formal structure The informal organization expresses the personal objectives and goals of the individual membership Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves br In prehistoric times man was preoccupied with his personal security maintenance protection and survival Now man spends a major portion of his waking hours working for organizations His need to identify with a community that provides security protection maintenance and a feeling of belonging continues unchanged from prehistoric times This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent or unofficial leaders br Leaders emerge from within the structure of the informal organization Their personal qualities the demands of the situation or a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief the emergent leader wields influence or power Influence is the ability of a person to gain cooperation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards Power is a stronger form of influence because it reflects a person s ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment br br br The interplay between formal and informal organizations br As most organizations operate through a mix of formal and informal mechanisms organization science scholars have paid attention to the type of interplay between formal and informal organizations On the one hand some have argued that formal and informal organizations operate as substitutes as one type of organization would decrease the advantages of using the other one For instance if parties trust each other the use of a formal contract is unnecessary or even detrimental to the relationship On the other hand other scholars have suggested that formal and informal organizations can complement each other For instance formal mechanisms of control can pave the way for the development of relational norms br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br Baligh
