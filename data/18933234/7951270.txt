In mathematics the sign of a real number is its property of being either positive negative or Depending on local conventions zero may be considered as having its own unique sign having no sign or having both positive and negative sign In some contexts it makes sense to distinguish between a positive and a negative zero br In mathematics and physics the phrase change of sign is associated with exchanging an object for its additive inverse multiplication with negation an operation which is not restricted to real numbers It applies among other objects to vectors matrices and complex numbers which are not prescribed to be only either positive negative or zero br The word sign is also often used to indicate binary aspects of mathematical or scientific objects such as odd and even sign of a permutation sense of orientation or rotation cw ccw one sided limits and other concepts described in Other meanings below br br br Sign of a number br Numbers from various number systems like integers rationals complex numbers quaternions octonions may have multiple attributes that fix certain properties of a number A number system that bears the structure of an ordered ring contains a unique number that when added with any number leaves the latter unchanged This unique number is known as the system s additive identity element For example the integers has the structure of an ordered ring This number is generally denoted as Because of the total order in this ring there are numbers greater than zero called the positive numbers Another property required for a ring to be ordered is that for each positive number there exists a unique corresponding number less than whose sum with the original positive number is These numbers less than are called the negative numbers The numbers in each such pair are their respective additive inverses This attribute of a number being exclusively either zero positive or negative is called its sign and is often encoded to the real numbers and respectively similar to the way the sign function is defined Since rational and real numbers are also ordered rings in fact ordered fields the sign attribute also applies to these number systems br When a minus sign is used in between two numbers it represents the binary operation of subtraction When a minus sign is written before a single number it represents the unary operation of yielding the additive inverse sometimes called negation of the operand Abstractly then the difference of two number is the sum of the minuend with the additive inverse of the subtrahend While is its own additive inverse the additive inverse of a positive number is negative and the additive inverse of a negative number is positive A double application of this operation is written as The plus sign is predominantly used in algebra to denote the binary operation of addition and only rarely to emphasize the positivity of an expression br In common numeral notation used in arithmetic and elsewhere the sign of a number is often made explicit by placing a plus or a minus sign before the number For example denotes positive three and denotes negative three algebraically the additive inverse of Without specific context or when no explicit sign is given a number is interpreted per default as positive This notation establishes a strong association of the minus sign with negative numbers and the plus sign with positive numbers br br br Sign of zero br Within the convention of zero being neither positive nor negative a specific sign value may be assigned to the number value This is exploited in the

its sign although the convention of assigning both signs to does not immediately allow for this discrimination br In certain European countries e g in Belgium and France is considered to be both positive and negative following the convention set forth by Nicolas Bourbaki br In some contexts such as floating point representations of real numbers within computers it is useful to consider signed versions of zero with signed zeros referring to different discrete number representations see signed number representations for more br The symbols and rarely appear as substitutes for and used in calculus and mathematical analysis for one sided limits right sided limit and left sided limit respectively This notation refers to the behaviour of a function as its real input variable approaches along positive resp negative values the two limits need not exist or agree br br br Terminology for signs br When is said to be neither positive nor negative the following phrases may refer to the sign of a number br br A number is positive if it is greater than zero br A number is negative if it is less than zero br A number is non negative if it is greater than or equal to zero br A number is non positive if it is less than or equal to zero br When is said to be both positive and negative modified phrases are used to refer to the sign of a number br br A number is strictly positive if it is greater than zero br A number is strictly negative if it is less than zero br A number is positive if it is greater than or equal to zero br A number is negative if it is less than or equal to zero br For example the absolute value of a real number is always non negative but is not necessarily positive in the first interpretation whereas in the second interpretation it is called positive though not necessarily strictly positive br The same terminology is sometimes used for functions that yield real or other signed values For example a function would be called a positive function if its values are positive for all arguments of its domain or a non negative function if all of its values are non negative br br br Complex numbers br Complex numbers are impossible to order so they cannot carry the structure of an ordered ring and accordingly cannot be partitioned into positive and negative complex numbers They do however share an attribute with the reals which is called absolute value or magnitude Magnitudes are always non negative real numbers and to any non zero number there belongs a positive real number its absolute value br For example the absolute value of and the absolute value of are both equal to This is written in symbols as and br In general any arbitrary real value can be specified by its magnitude and its sign Using the standard encoding any real value is given by the product of the magnitude and the sign in standard encoding This relation can be generalized to define a sign for complex numbers br Since the real and complex numbers both form a field and contain the positive reals they also contain the reciprocals of the magnitudes of all non zero numbers This means that any non zero number may be multiplied with the reciprocal of its magnitude that is divided by its magnitude It is immediate that the quotient of any non zero real number by its magnitude yields exactly its sign By analogy the sign of a complex number z can be defined as the quotient of z and its magnitude z The sign of a complex number is the exponential of the product of its argument with the imaginary unit represents in some sense its complex argument This is to be compared to the sign of real numbers except with br br br br br e br br i br br br br br br br br br displaystyle e i pi br br For the definition of a complex sign function see Complex sign function below br br br Sign functions br br When dealing with numbers it is often convenient to have their sign available as a number This is accomplished by functions that extract the sign of any number and map it to a predefined value before making it available for further calculations For example it might be advantageous to formulate an intricate algorithm for positive values only and take care of the sign only afterwards br br br Real sign function br The sign function or signum function extracts the sign of a real number by mapping the set of real numbers to the set of the three reals br br br br

normalized vector that is a vector whose direction is unchanged and whose length is fixed to unity If the original value was R in polar form then sign R is Extension of sign or signum to any number of dimensions is obvious but this has already been defined as normalizing a vector br br br Signs per convention br br In situations where there are exactly two possibilities on equal footing for an attribute these are often labelled by convention as plus and minus respectively In some contexts the choice of this assignment i e which range of values is considered positive and which negative is natural whereas in other contexts the choice is arbitrary making an explicit sign convention necessary the only requirement being consistent use of the convention br br br Sign of an angle br br In many contexts it is common to associate a sign with the measure of an angle particularly an oriented angle or an angle of rotation In such a situation the sign indicates whether the angle is in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction Though different conventions can be used it is common in mathematics to have counterclockwise angles count as positive and clockwise angles count as negative br It is also possible to associate a sign to an angle of rotation in three dimensions assuming that the axis of rotation has been oriented Specifically a right handed rotation around an oriented axis typically counts as positive while a left handed rotation counts as negative br An angle which is the negative of a given angle has an equal arc but the opposite axis br br br Sign of a change br When a quantity x changes over time the change in the value of x is typically defined by the equation br br br br br br x br br br x br br final br br br br br x br br initial br br br br br br displaystyle Delta x x text final x text initial br br br Using this convention an increase in x counts as positive change while a decrease of x counts as negative change In calculus this same convention is used in the definition of the derivative As a result any increasing function has positive derivative while any decreasing function has negative derivative br br br Sign of a direction br When studying one dimensional displacements and motions in analytic geometry and physics it is common to label the two possible directions as positive and negative Because the number line is usually drawn with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left a common convention is for motions to the right to be given a positive sign and for motions to the left to be given a negative sign br br On the Cartesian plane the rightward and upward directions are usually thought of as positive with rightward being the positive x direction and upward being the positive y direction If a displacement vector is separated into its vector components then the horizontal part will be positive for motion to the right and negative for motion to the left while the vertical part will be positive for motion upward and negative for motion downward br Likewise a negative speed rate of change of displacement implies a velocity in the opposite direction i e receding instead of advancing a special case is the radial speed br In D space notions related to sign can be found in the two normal orientations and orientability in general br br br Signedness in computing br br In computing an integer value may be either signed or unsigned depending on whether the computer is keeping track of a sign for the number By restricting an integer variable to non negative values only one more bit can be used for storing the value of a number Because of the way integer arithmetic is done within computers signed number representations usually do not store the sign as a single independent bit instead using e g two s complement br In contrast real numbers are stored and manipulated as floating point values The floating point values are represented using three separate values mantissa exponent and sign Given this separate sign bit it is possible to represent both positive and negative zero Most programming languages normally treat positive zero and negative zero as equivalent values albeit they provide means by which the distinction can be detected br br br Other meanings br br In addition to the sign of a real number the word sign is also used in various related ways throughout mathematics and other sciences br br Words up to sign mean that for a quantity q it is known that either q Q or q Q for certain Q It is often expressed as q Q For real numbers it means that only the absolute value q of the quantity is known For complex numbers and vectors a quantity known up to sign is a stronger condition than a quantity with known magnitude aside Q and Q there are many other possible values of q such that q Q br The sign of a permutation is defined to be positive if the permutation is even and negative if the permutation is odd br In graph theory a signed graph is a graph in which each edge has been marked with a positive or negative sign br In mathematical analysis a signed measure is a generalization of the concept of measure in which the measure of a set may have positive or negative values br The concept of signed distance is used to convey side inside or out br The ideas of signed area and signed volume are sometimes used when it is convenient for certain areas or volumes to count as negative This is particularly true in the theory of determinants In an abstract oriented vector space each ordered basis for the vector space can be classified as either positively or negatively oriented br In a signed digit representation each digit of a number may have a positive or negative sign br In physics any electric charge comes with a sign either positive or negative By convention a positive charge is a charge with the same sign as that of a proton and a negative charge is a charge with the same sign as that of an electron br br br See also br
