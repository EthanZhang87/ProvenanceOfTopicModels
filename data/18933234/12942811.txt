Daniel L Weinreb January September was an American computer scientist and programmer with significant work in the environment of the programming language Lisp br br br Early life br Weinreb was born on January in Brooklyn New York and was raised there by his parents Herbert and Phyllis Weinreb He had two brothers Bill and David and attended Saint Ann s School br br br Education br Weinreb graduated from St Ann s School in Brooklyn New York in He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT from to starting at age graduating with a B S in computer science and electrical engineering where he and Mike McMahon wrote EINE and ZWEI text editors for MIT Lisp machines EINE made use of the windowing system of the Lisp machine and thus is the first Emacs written for a graphical user interface GUI EINE was the second implementation of Emacs ever written and the first implementation of Emacs in Lisp Most of the notable subsequent Emacs implementations used Lisp including Richard Stallman s GNU Emacs James Gosling s Gosmacs and Bernard Greenberg s Multics Emacs br br br Professional life br During Weinreb worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory LLNL on the operating system Amber for the S supercomputer more so the file system and the multiprocess scheduler br In he cofounded Symbolics developing software for their Lisp machine He also participated significantly in the design of the programming language Common Lisp CL He was one of the five co authors of the original language specification Common Lisp the Language First Edition He worked on Statice an object oriented database published by Symbolics in br In he cofounded Object Design Incorporated ODI where he was one of the architects and implementors of ObjectStore a leading commercial object oriented database management system object database It is still commercially maintained and available from Progress Software which bought Object Design then eXcelon Inc br In he joined BEA Systems where he was Operations Administration and Management Architect for WebLogic br In he joined ITA Software working on an airline reservations system ARS In Daniel Weinreb gave a Google Tech Talk about the use of Common Lisp as one of the implementation languages for the airline reservation system The video is no longer available for reasons Dan described as kind of stupid br In he was the chair of the International Lisp Conference in Cambridge Massachusetts br br br Personal life br Weinreb married Cheryl Moreau in and they had a son Adam in br Dan Weinreb died on
