title: List of GNU packages
id: 774936
A number of notable software packages were developed for or are maintained by the Free Software Foundation as part of the GNU Project br br br What it means to be a GNU package br Summarising the situation in Richard Stallman identified nine aspects which generally apply to being a GNU package but he noted that exceptions and flexibility are possible when there are good reasons br br The package should say that it is a GNU package br It should be distributed via ftp gnu org or another site offering access to everyone br The package s homepage should be on the GNU website br The developers must pay attention to making their software work well with other GNU packages br Documentation should be in Texinfo format or in a format easily convertible to Texinfo br Should use GNU Guile for its extension language but exceptions are explicitly possible in this regard br Should not recommend any non free program nor refer the user to any non free documentation or non free software br Use GNU terminology including referring to GNU Linux systems and free software in situations where other observers would write Linux and open source br The maintainer should be contactable at least infrequently to discuss problems in the software or fixing compatibility issues br br br Base system br There is no official base system of the GNU operating system GNU was designed to be a replacement for Unix operating systems of the s and used the POSIX standards as a guide but either definition would give a much larger base system The following list is instead a small set of GNU packages which seem closer to being core packages than being in any of the further down sections Inclusions such as plotutils and exclusions such as the C standard library are of course debatable br br br Notes br br br Software development br The software listed below is generally useful to software developers and other computer programmers br br br GNU toolchain br br GNU Binutils contains the
