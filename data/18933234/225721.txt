firm Paul Sanford and Merwin who renamed the company the Consolidated Temperature Controlling Company br As the years passed CTCC struggled with debt and the company underwent several name changes After it was renamed the Electric Heat Regulator Company in W R Sweatt a stockholder in the company was sold an extensive list of patents and named secretary treasurer By Sweatt had bought out the remaining shares of the company from the other stockholders br br br Honeywell Heating Specialty Company founded br In Mark Honeywell founded the Honeywell Heating Specialty Company in Wabash Indiana to manufacture and market his invention the mercury seal generator br br br Mergers and acquisitions br As Honeywell s company grew thanks in part to the acquisition of Jewell Manufacturing Company in to better automate his heating system it began to clash with the Electric Heat Regulator Company now renamed Minneapolis Heat Regulator Company In this led to the merging of both companies into the publicly held Minneapolis Honeywell Regulator Company Honeywell was named the company s first president alongside W R Sweatt as its first chairman br In combined assets were valued at over million with less than million in liabilities just months before Black Monday In Minneapolis Honeywell began a period of expansion and acquisition when they purchased the Time O Stat Controls Company giving

Honeywell developed a superior tank periscope camera stabilizers and the C autopilot br br The C revolutionized precision bombing and was ultimately used on the two B bombers that dropped atomic bombs on Japan in The success of these projects led Minneapolis Honeywell to open an Aero division in Chicago on October This division was responsible for the development of the formation stick to control

USS Nautilus In the company acquired Intervox Company for their sonar ultrasonic and telemetry technologies Honeywell also helped develop and manufacture the RUR ASROC for the US Navy br br br s br In in cooperation with the USAF Wright Air Development Center Honeywell developed an automated control unit that could control an aircraft through various stages of a flight from taxiing to takeoff to the point where the aircraft neared its destination and the pilot took over for landing Called the Automatic Master Sequence Selector the onboard control operated similarly to a player piano to relay instructions to the aircraft s autopilot at certain way points during the flight significantly reducing the pilot s workload Technologically this effort had parallels to contemporary efforts in
