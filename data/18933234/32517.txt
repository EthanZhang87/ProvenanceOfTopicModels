VAX an acronym for Virtual Address eXtension is a series of computers featuring a bit instruction set architecture ISA and virtual memory that was developed and sold by Digital Equipment Corporation DEC in the late th century The VAX introduced October was the first of a range of popular and influential computers implementing the VAX ISA The VAX family was a huge success for DEC with the last members arriving in the early s The VAX was succeeded by the DEC Alpha which included several features from VAX machines to make porting from the VAX easier br VAX was designed as a successor to the bit PDP one of the most successful minicomputers in history with approximately units sold The system was designed to offer backward compatibility with the PDP while extending the memory to a full bit implementation and adding demand paged virtual memory The name VAX refers to its Virtual Address eXtension concept that allowed programs to make use of this newly available memory while still being compatible with unmodified user mode PDP code The name VAX used on early models was chosen to highlight this capability The VAX ISA is considered a complex instruction set computer CISC design br DEC quickly dropped the branding as PDP compatibility was no longer a major concern The line expanded to both high end mainframes like the VAX as well as to the workstation scale systems like the VAXstation series The VAX family ultimately contained ten distinct designs and over individual models in total All of them were compatible with each other and normally ran the VAX VMS operating system br VAX has been perceived as the quintessential CISC ISA with its very large number of assembly language programmer friendly addressing modes and machine instructions highly orthogonal instruction set architecture and instructions for complex operations such as queue insertion or deletion number formatting and polynomial evaluation br br br Name br br The name VAX originated as an acronym for Virtual Address eXtension both because the VAX was seen as a bit extension of the older bit PDP and because it was after Prime Computer an early adopter of virtual memory to manage this larger address space br Early versions of the VAX processor implement a compatibility mode that emulates many of the PDP s instructions giving it the in VAX to highlight this compatibility Later versions offloaded the compatibility mode and some of the less used CISC instructions to emulation in the operating system software br br br Instruction set br The VAX instruction set was designed to be powerful and orthogonal When it was introduced many programs were written in assembly language so having a programmer friendly instruction set was important In time as more programs were written in high level programming languages the instruction set became less visible and the only ones much concerned about it were compiler writers br One unusual aspect of the VAX instruction set is the presence of register masks at the start of each subprogram These are arbitrary bit patterns that specify when control is passed to the subprogram which registers are to be preserved On most architectures it is up to the compiler to produce instructions to save out the needed data typically using the call stack for temporary storage On the VAX with registers this might require instructions to save the data and another to restore it Using the mask a single bit value performs the same operations internally in hardware saving time and memory br Since register masks are a form of data embedded within the executable code they can make linear parsing of the machine code difficult This can complicate optimization techniques that are applied on machine code br br br Operating systems br br The native VAX operating system is Digital s VAX VMS renamed to OpenVMS in or early when it was ported to Alpha modified to comply with POSIX standards and branded as compliant with XPG by the X Open consortium The VAX architecture and VMS operating system were engineered concurrently to take maximum advantage of each other as was the initial implementation of the VAXcluster facility br During the s a hypervisor for the VAX architecture named VMM Virtual Machine Monitor also known as the VAX Security Kernel was developed at Digital with the aim of allowing multiple isolated instances of VMS and ULTRIX to be run on the same hardware VMM was intended to achieve TCSEC A compliance By the late s it was operational on VAX series hardware but was abandoned before release to customers br Other VAX operating systems have included various releases of Berkeley Software Distribution BSD UNIX up to BSD Ultrix VAXELN and Xinu More recently NetBSD and OpenBSD have supported various VAX models and some work has been done on porting Linux to the VAX architecture OpenBSD discontinued support for the architecture in September br br br History br br The first VAX model sold was the VAX which was introduced on October at the Digital Equipment Corporation s Annual Meeting of Shareholders Bill Strecker C Gordon Bell s doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University was responsible for the architecture Many different models with different prices performance levels and capacities were subsequently created VAX superminicomputers were very popular in the early s br For a while the VAX was used as a standard in CPU benchmarks It was initially described as a one MIPS machine because its performance was equivalent to an IBM System that ran at one MIPS and the System implementations had previously been de facto performance standards The actual number of instructions executed in second was about which led to complaints of marketing exaggeration The result was the definition of a VAX MIPS the speed of a VAX a computer performing at VAX MIPS would run the same program roughly times faster than the VAX br Within the Digital community the term VUP VAX Unit of Performance was the more common term because MIPS do not compare well across different architectures The related term cluster VUPs was informally used to describe the aggregate performance of a VAXcluster The performance of the VAX still serves as the baseline metric in the BRL CAD Benchmark a performance analysis suite included in the BRL CAD solid modeling software distribution The VAX included a subordinate stand alone LSI computer that performed microcode load booting and diagnostic functions for the parent computer This was dropped from subsequent VAX models Enterprising VAX users could therefore run three different Digital Equipment Corporation operating systems VMS on the VAX processor from the hard drives and either RSX S or RT on the LSI from the single density single drive floppy disk br The VAX went through many different implementations The original VAX was implemented in TTL and filled a four by five foot cabinet with a single CPU Through the s the high end of the family was continually improved using ever faster discrete components an evolution that ended with the introduction of the VAX in October This design proved too complex and expensive and was ultimately abandoned not long after introduction CPU implementations that consisted of multiple emitter coupled logic ECL gate array or macrocell array chips included the VAX and superminis and finally the VAX mainframe class machines CPU implementations that consisted of multiple MOSFET custom chips included the and class machines The VAX and low end machines were built using AMD Am bit slice components for the ALU br The MicroVAX I represented a major transition within the VAX family At the time of its design it was not yet possible to implement the full VAX architecture as a single VLSI chip or even a few VLSI chips as was later done with the V CPU of the VAX Instead the MicroVAX I was the first VAX implementation to move some of the more complex VAX instructions such as the packed decimal and related opcodes into emulation software This partitioning substantially reduced the amount of microcode required and was referred to as the MicroVAX architecture In the MicroVAX I the ALU and registers were implemented as a single gate array chip while the rest of the machine control was conventional logic br A full VLSI microprocessor implementation of the MicroVAX architecture arrived with the MicroVAX II s or DC CPU and DC FPU The was the first microprocessor with an on board memory management unit The MicroVAX II was based on a single quad sized processor board which carried the processor chips and ran the MicroVMS or Ultrix operating systems The machine featured MB of on board memory and a Q bus interface with DMA transfers The MicroVAX II was succeeded by many further MicroVAX models with much improved performance and memory br Further VLSI VAX processors followed in the form of the V CVAX CVAX SOC System On Chip a single chip CVAX Rigel Mariah and NVAX implementations The VAX microprocessors extended the architecture to inexpensive workstations and later also supplanted the high end VAX models This wide range of platforms mainframe to workstation using one architecture was unique in the computer industry at that time Sundry graphics were etched onto the CVAX microprocessor die The phrase CVAX when you care enough to steal the very best was etched in broken Russian as a play on a Hallmark Cards slogan intended as a message to Soviet engineers who were known to be both purloining DEC computers for military applications and reverse engineering their chip design By the late s the VAX microprocessors had grown in power to be competitive with discrete designs This led to the abandonment of the and series and their replacement by Rigel powered models of the VAX and later by NVAX powered VAX systems br In DEC s product offerings the VAX architecture was eventually superseded by RISC technology In DEC introduced a range of workstations and servers that ran Ultrix the DECstation and DECsystem respectively using processors from MIPS Computer Systems In DEC introduced their own RISC instruction set architecture the Alpha AXP later renamed Alpha and their own Alpha based microprocessor the DECchip a high performance bit design capable of running OpenVMS br In August Compaq announced that the remaining VAX models would be discontinued by the end of the year but old systems remain in widespread use The Stromasys CHARON VAX and SIMH software based VAX emulators remain available VMS is now developed by VMS Software Incorporated albeit only for the Alpha HPE

replaced the VAX in October and was joined by the entry level MicroVAX minicomputers and the VAXstation workstations in the mid s The MicroVAX was superseded by the VAX the VAX was superseded by the VAX in the late s and the mainframe class VAX was introduced In the early s the fault tolerant VAXft was introduced as were the Alpha compatible VAX A variant of various VAX based systems were sold as the VAXserver br br br SImultaneous Machine ACceSs SIMACS br System Industries developed an ability to give more than one DEC CPU but not at the same time write access to a shared disk They implemented an enhancement named SImultaneous Machine ACceSs SIMACS which allowed their special disk controller to set a semaphore flag for disk access allowing multiple WRITES to the same files the disk is shared by multiple DEC systems SIMACS also existed on PDP RSTS systems br br br Canceled systems br Canceled systems include the BVAX a high end emitter coupled logic ECL based VAX and two other ECL based VAX models Argonaut and Raven Raven was canceled in A VAX named Gemini was also canceled which was a fall back in case the LSI based Scorpio failed It never shipped br br br Clones br
