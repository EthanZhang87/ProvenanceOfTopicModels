title: Control key
id: 188035
In computing a Control key Ctrl is a modifier key which when pressed in conjunction with another key performs a special operation for example Ctrl C Similarly to the Shift key the Control key rarely performs any function when pressed by itself The Control key is located on or near the bottom left side of most keyboards in accordance with the international standard ISO IEC with many featuring an additional one at the bottom right br On keyboards that use English abbreviations for key labeling it is usually labeled Ctrl Control or Ctl are sometimes used but it is uncommon Abbreviations in the language of the keyboard layout also are in use e g the German keyboard layout uses Strg as required by the German standard DIN There is a standardized keyboard symbol to be used when Latin lettering is not preferred This symbol is encoded in Unicode as U helm symbol but it is very rarely used br br br History br br On teletypewriters and computer terminals holding down the Control key while pressing another key would send an ASCII C control character instead of directly reporting a key press to the system The control characters were used as non printing characters that signal the terminal or teletypewriter to perform a special action such as ringing a bell ejecting a page or erasing the screen or controlling where the next character will display br The first ASCII characters are the control characters representable by a bit binary number Because ASCII characters were represented as bits if a key is pressed while the Control key was held down teletypewriters and terminals would simply set the first bits of a character to converting the character into a control character For example the character a has a binary ASCII code of This code would be converted to corresponding to the ASCII character with id the SOH Character The table at C and C control codes C controls shows the ASCII control characters with the Caret notation column showing a caret followed by the character to press while the Control key is held down to generate the character br If a teletypewriter or terminal is connected to a computer the software on the computer can interpret control characters it receives however it is written to do so a given control character can be interpreted differently from how it would be interpreted by a teletypewriter or terminal that receives it For example Control C received from a teletypewriter or terminal is interpreted as interrupt the current program in some command line interfaces and Control E is interpreted by the Emacs text editor as move the editor cursor to the end of the line br Computer keyboards directly attached to a computer as is the case for a personal computer or workstation distinguish each physical key from every other and report all keypresses and releases to the controlling software This allows the software to interpret Control key combinations as it chooses including being able to interpret a combination of the Control key another modifier key and a letter number or symbol key differently from the way it interprets a combination of the Control key and the letter number or symbol key without that other modifier key br br br Location br br The keyboards of many early computer terminals including the Teletype Model ASR and Lear Siegler ADM A and early models of the IBM PC positioned the Control key on the left of the keyboard whereas caps lock resides in the same position on most modern keyboards The traditional layout was preserved for later workstation systems and is often associated with Unix workstations Keyboards from Sun Microsystems came in two layouts Unix and PC style with the Unix layout having the traditional placing of the Control key and other keys The keyboards produced for One Laptop Per Child computers also have the Control key in this location Other vendors produce keyboards for different computer systems with this placement of the Control key such as the Happy Hacking Keyboard br Some users of keyboards with caps lock on the left remap the keys to exchange Control and caps lock finding the traditional location more ergonomic for using programs benefiting from use of the Control key Keyboard layout preferences specifically to address this need are available in some operating systems br Others leave the control key in the lower left corner of the keyboard and press it using the side of their palm The choice of location for the control key often comes down to the typist s hand shape and posture br br br Notation br There are several common notations for pressing the Control key in conjunction with another key Each notation below means press and hold Ctrl while pressing the X key br br br Table of examples br Different application programs user interfaces and operating systems use the various control key combinations for different purposes br br In early first person shooters the left Ctrl key is often used to fire a weapon In newer games the key is often used for crouching instead br br br Similar concepts br Generally the Command key labeled with the symbol on Apple Macintosh computers performs the equivalent functions in classic Mac OS and macOS applications for example C copies while P prints the same holds for saving cutting and pasting br Macintoshes also have a Control key but it has different functionality The original Apple mouse design reduced complexity by only offering one button As the interface developed contextual menus were offered to access extra options Another button was needed to access these On Unix and Windows the user had other mouse buttons to use On Classic Mac OS and macOS the Control key is used to invoke a right click Apple calls this a secondary click as left handers can choose which side this button is on br br It is mostly used as a modifier key for key combinations br Pressing Control and clicking the mouse button will invoke a contextual menu This is a compatibility feature for users with one button mice users with two button mice just use the right mouse button with no modifiers br It is used in the command line interface with programs made for that interface br In Quickbooks the Control Key is used to validate login credentials during OLSU and OLSU errors Keeping it depressed while sending information to the Quickbooks servers fixes the errors br Under macOS the Control key allows the use of Emacs style key combinations in most text entry fields For example Ctrl A moves the caret to the start of the paragraph Ctrl L vertically centers the current line in the editing field Ctrl K cuts text to the end of the line to a kill ring separate from the normal clipboard etc br br br Notes br br br br br br See also br Alt key br Break key br Control characters
