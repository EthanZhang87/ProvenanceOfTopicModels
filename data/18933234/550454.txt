In human computer interaction WIMP stands for windows icons menus pointer denoting a style of interaction using these elements of the user interface Other expansions are sometimes used such as substituting mouse and mice for menus or pull down menu and pointing for pointer br Though the acronym has fallen into disuse it has often been likened to the term graphical user interface GUI Any interface that uses graphics can be called a GUI and WIMP systems derive from such systems However while all WIMP systems use graphics as a key element the icon and pointer elements and therefore are GUIs the reverse is not true Some GUIs are not based in windows icons menus and pointers For example most mobile phones represent actions as icons and menus but often do not rely on a conventional pointer or containerized windows to host program interactions br WIMP interaction was developed at Xerox PARC see Xerox Alto developed in and popularized with Apple s introduction of the Macintosh in which added the concepts of the menu bar and extended window management br The WIMP interface has the following components br br A window runs a self contained program isolated from other programs that if in a multi program operating system run at the same time in other windows br These individual program containers enable users to move fluidly between different windows br The window manager software is typically designed such that it is clear which window is currently active Design principles of spacing grouping and simplicity help the user maintain focus when working between more than one window br An icon acts as a shortcut to an action the computer performs e g execute a program or task br Text labels can be used alongside icons to help identification for small icon sets br A menu is a text or icon based selection system that selects and executes programs or tasks Menus may change depending on context in which they are accessed br The pointer is an onscreen symbol that represents movement of a physical device that the user controls to select icons data elements etc br This style of system improves human computer interaction HCI by emulating real world interactions and providing greater ease of use for non technical people Because programs contained by a WIMP interface subsequently rely on the same core input methods the interactions throughout the system are standardized This consistency allows users skills to carry from one application to another br br br Criticism br Some human computer interaction researchers consider WIMP to be ill suited for multiple applications especially those requiring precise human input or more than three dimensions of input Drawing and writing are example of these limitations a traditional pointer is limited by two dimensions and consequently doesn t account for the pressure applied when using a physical writing utility Pressure sensitive graphics tablets are often used to overcome this limitation br Another issue with WIMP style user interfaces is that many implementations put users with disabilities at a disadvantage For example visually impaired users may have difficulty using applications when alternative text based interfaces are not made available People with motor impairments such as Parkinson s disease may not be able to navigate devices precisely using the traditional mouse pointer for input To overcome these barriers researchers continue to explore ways to make modern computer systems more accessible Recent developments in artificial intelligence specifically machine learning have opened new doors for accessibility in technology or assistive technology br br br Moving past the WIMP interface br Multiple studies have explored the possibilities of moving past the WIMP interface such as using reality based interaction making the interface three dimensional by adding visual depth through the use of monocular cues and even combining depth with physics The latter resulted in the development of BumpTop desktop and its acquisition and release by Google br br br See also br Desktop metaphor br History of the graphical user interface br Natural user interface br Touch user interface br X Window System br br br br br br Bibliography br Alistair D N Edwards The design of auditory interfaces for visually disabled users In Proceedings of ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems CHI pp http doi acm org br Mark Green Robert Jacob SIGGRAPH Workshop report software architectures and metaphors for non WIMP user interfaces In ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics July pp http doi acm org br Ashley George Taylor WIMP Interfaces winter https web archive org web http www static cc gatech edu classes cs winter Topics dialog wimp br br br External links br ISO Ergonomics of human system interaction Part Usability Definitions and concepts https www iso org standard html
