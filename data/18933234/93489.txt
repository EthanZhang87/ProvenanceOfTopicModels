RSS RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized computer readable format Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator which constantly monitor sites for new content removing the need for the user to manually check them News aggregators or RSS readers can be built into a browser installed on a desktop computer or installed on a mobile device br Websites usually use RSS feeds to publish frequently updated information such as blog entries news headlines episodes of audio and video series or for distributing podcasts An RSS document called feed web feed or channel includes full or summarized text and metadata like publishing date and author s name RSS formats are specified using a generic XML file br Although RSS formats have evolved from as early as March it was between and when RSS gained widespread use and the icon was decided upon by several major web browsers RSS feed data is presented to users using software called a news aggregator and the passing of content is called web syndication Users subscribe to feeds either by entering a feed s URI into the reader or by clicking on the browser s feed icon The RSS reader checks the user s feeds regularly for new information and can automatically download it if that function is enabled br br br History br br The RSS formats were preceded by several attempts at web syndication that did not achieve widespread popularity The basic idea of restructuring information about websites goes back to as early as when Ramanathan V Guha and others in Apple s Advanced Technology Group developed the Meta Content Framework br RDF Site Summary the first version of RSS was created by Dan Libby and Ramanathan V Guha at Netscape It was released in March for use on the My Netscape Com portal This version became known as RSS In July Dan Libby of Netscape produced a new version RSS which simplified the format by removing RDF elements and incorporating elements from Dave Winer s news syndication format Libby also renamed the format from RDF to RSS Rich Site Summary and outlined further development of the format in a futures document br This would be Netscape s last participation in RSS development for eight years As RSS was being embraced by web publishers who wanted their feeds to be used on My Netscape Com and other early RSS portals Netscape dropped RSS support from My Netscape Com in April during new owner AOL s restructuring of the company also removing documentation and tools that supported the format br Two parties emerged to fill the void with neither Netscape s help nor approval The RSS DEV Working Group and Dave Winer whose UserLand Software had published some of the first publishing tools outside Netscape that could read and write RSS br Winer published a modified version of the RSS specification on the UserLand website covering how it was being used in his company s products and claimed copyright to the document A few months later UserLand filed a U S trademark registration for RSS but failed to respond to a USPTO trademark examiner s request and the request was rejected in December br The RSS DEV Working Group a project whose members included Aaron Swartz Guha and representatives of O Reilly Media and Moreover produced RSS in December This new version which reclaimed the name RDF Site Summary from RSS reintroduced support for RDF and added XML namespaces support adopting elements from standard metadata vocabularies such as Dublin Core br In December Winer released RSS br a minor set of changes aside from the introduction of the enclosure element which permitted audio files to be carried in RSS feeds and helped spark podcasting He also released drafts of RSS and RSS that were subsequently withdrawn br In September Winer released a major new version of the format RSS that redubbed its initials Really Simple Syndication RSS removed the type attribute added in the RSS draft and added support for namespaces To preserve backward compatibility with RSS namespace support applies only to other content included within an RSS feed not the RSS elements themselves Although other standards such as Atom attempt to correct this limitation RSS feeds are not aggregated with other content often enough to shift the popularity from RSS to other formats having full namespace support br Because neither Winer nor the RSS DEV Working Group had Netscape s involvement they could not make an official claim on the RSS name or format This has fueled ongoing controversy in the syndication development community as to which entity was the proper publisher of RSS br One product of that contentious debate was the creation of an alternative syndication format Atom that began in June The Atom syndication format whose creation was in part motivated by a desire to get a clean start free of the issues surrounding RSS has been adopted as IETF Proposed Standard RFC br In July Winer and UserLand Software assigned the copyright of the RSS specification to Harvard s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society where he had just begun a term as a visiting fellow At the same time Winer launched the RSS Advisory Board with Brent Simmons and Jon Udell a group whose purpose was to maintain and publish the specification and answer questions about the format br In September Stephen Horlander created the now ubiquitous RSS icon for use in the Mozilla Firefox browser br In December the Microsoft Internet Explorer team and br Microsoft Outlook team announced on their blogs that they were adopting Firefox s RSS icon In February Opera Software followed suit This effectively made the orange square with white radio waves the industry standard for RSS and Atom feeds replacing the large variety of icons and text that had been used previously to identify syndication data br In January Rogers Cadenhead relaunched the RSS Advisory Board without Dave Winer s participation with a stated desire to continue the development of the RSS format and resolve ambiguities In June the board revised their version of the specification to confirm that namespaces may extend core elements with namespace attributes as Microsoft has done in Internet Explorer According to their view a difference of interpretation left publishers unsure of whether this was permitted or forbidden br br br Example br RSS is XML formatted plain text The RSS format itself is relatively easy to read both by automated processes and by humans alike An example feed could have contents such as the following br br br Aggregators br br When retrieved RSS reading software could use the XML structure to present a neat display to the end users There are various news aggregator software for desktop and mobile devices but RSS can also be built in inside web browsers or email clients like Mozilla Thunderbird br br br Variants br There are several different versions of RSS falling into two major branches RDF and br The RDF or RSS branch includes the following versions br br RSS was the original Netscape RSS version This RSS was called RDF Site Summary but was based on an early working draft of the RDF standard and was not compatible with the final RDF Recommendation br RSS is an open format by the RSS DEV Working Group again standing for RDF Site Summary RSS is an RDF format like RSS but not fully compatible with it since is based on the final RDF Recommendation br RSS is also an open format and is intended to update and replace RSS The specification is an independent draft not supported or endorsed in any way by the RSS Dev Working Group or any other organization br The RSS branch initially UserLand now Harvard includes the following versions br br RSS is the simplified RSS version released by Netscape and also the version number of the simplified version originally championed by Dave Winer from Userland Software The Netscape version was now called Rich Site Summary this was no longer an RDF format but was relatively easy to use br RSS through are expansions of the RSS format which are mostly compatible with each other and with Winer s version of RSS but are not compatible with RSS br RSS has the internal version number RSS was proclaimed to be frozen but still updated shortly after release without changing the version number RSS now stood for Really Simple Syndication The major change in this version is an explicit extension mechanism using XML namespaces br Later versions in each branch are backward compatible with earlier versions aside from non conformant RDF syntax in and both versions include properly documented extension mechanisms using XML Namespaces either directly in the branch or through RDF in the branch Most syndication software supports both branches The Myth of RSS Compatibility an article written in by RSS critic and Atom advocate Mark Pilgrim discusses RSS version compatibility issues in more detail br The extension mechanisms make it possible for each branch to copy innovations in the other For example the RSS branch was the first to support enclosures making it the current leading choice for podcasting and as of is the format supported for that use by iTunes and other podcasting software however an enclosure extension is now available for the RSS branch mod enclosure Likewise the RSS core specification does not support providing full text in addition to a synopsis but the RSS markup can be and often is used as an extension There are also several common outside extension packages available e g one from Microsoft for use in Internet Explorer br The most serious compatibility problem is with HTML markup Userland s RSS reader generally considered as the reference implementation did not originally filter out HTML markup from feeds As a result publishers began placing HTML markup into the titles and descriptions of items in their RSS feeds This behavior has become expected of readers to the point of becoming a de facto standard Though there is still some inconsistency in how software handles this markup particularly in titles The RSS specification was later updated to include examples of entity encoded HTML however all prior plain text usages remain valid br As of January tracking data from www syndic com indicates that the three main versions of RSS in current use are and constituting and of worldwide RSS usage respectively These figures however do not include usage of the rival web feed format Atom As of August the syndic com website is indexing total feeds of which were some dialect of Atom and were some dialect of RSS br br br Modules br The primary objective of all RSS modules is to extend the basic XML schema established for more robust syndication of content This inherently allows for more diverse yet standardized transactions without modifying the core RSS specification br To accomplish this extension a tightly controlled vocabulary in the RSS world module in the XML world schema is declared through an XML namespace to give names to concepts and relationships between those concepts br Some RSS modules with established namespaces are br br Media RSS MRSS Module br OpenSearch RSS Module br br br Interoperability br Although the number of items in an RSS channel is theoretically unlimited some news aggregators do not support RSS files larger than KB For example applications that rely on the Common Feed List of Windows might handle such files as if they were corrupt and not open them Interoperability can be maximized by keeping the file size under this limit br Podcasts are distributed using RSS To listen to a podcast a user adds the RSS feed to their podcast client and the client can then list available episodes and download or stream them for listening or viewing To be included in a podcast directory the feed must for each episode provide a title description artwork category language and explicit rating There are some services that specifically indexes and is a search engine for podcasts br Some BitTorrent clients support RSS RSS feeds which provide links to torrent files allow users to subscribe and automatically download content as soon as it is published br br br RSS to email br br Some services deliver RSS to an email inbox sending updates from user s personal selection and schedules Examples of such services include IFTTT Zapier and others Conversely some services deliver email to RSS readers Further services like e g Gmane allow to subscribe to feeds via NNTP br It may be noted that email clients such as Thunderbird supports RSS natively br br br RSS compared with Atom br Both RSS and Atom are widely supported and are compatible with all major consumer feed readers RSS gained wider use because of early feed reader support Technically Atom has several advantages less restrictive licensing IANA registered MIME type XML namespace URI support RELAX NG support br The following table shows RSS elements alongside Atom elements where they are equivalent br Note the asterisk character indicates that an element must be provided Atom elements author and link are only required under certain conditions br br br Current usage br Several major sites such as Facebook and Twitter previously offered RSS feeds but have reduced or removed support Additionally widely used readers such as Shiira FeedDemon and particularly Google Reader have all been discontinued as of citing declining popularity in RSS RSS support was removed in OS X Mountain Lion s versions of Mail and Safari although the features were partially restored in Safari Mozilla removed RSS support from Mozilla Firefox version joining Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge which do not include RSS support thus leaving Internet Explorer as the last major browser to include RSS support by default br Since the late s there has been an uptick in RSS interest again In Wired published an article named It s Time for an RSS Revival citing that RSS gives more control over content compared to algorithms and trackers from social media sites At that time Feedly
