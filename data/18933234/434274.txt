Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory CSAIL is a research institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT formed by the merger of the Laboratory for Computer Science LCS and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory AI Lab Housed within the Ray and Maria Stata Center CSAIL is the largest on campus laboratory as measured by research scope and membership It is part of the Schwarzman College of Computing but is also overseen by the MIT Vice President of Research br br br Research activities br CSAIL s research activities are organized around a number of semi autonomous research groups each of which is headed by one or more professors or research scientists These groups are divided up into seven general areas of research br br Artificial intelligence br Computational biology br Graphics and vision br Language and learning br Theory of computation br Robotics br Systems includes computer architecture databases distributed systems networks and networked systems operating systems programming methodology and software engineering among others br br br History br Computing Research at MIT began with Vannevar Bush s research into a differential analyzer and Claude Shannon s electronic Boolean algebra in the s the wartime MIT Radiation Laboratory the post war Project Whirlwind and Research Laboratory of Electronics RLE and MIT Lincoln Laboratory s SAGE in the early s At MIT research in the field of artificial intelligence began in late s br br br Project MAC br On July Project MAC the Project on Mathematics and Computation later backronymed to Multiple Access Computer Machine Aided Cognitions or Man and Computer was launched with a million grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA Project MAC s original director was Robert Fano of MIT s Research Laboratory of Electronics RLE Fano decided to call MAC a project rather than a laboratory for reasons of internal MIT politics if MAC had been called a laboratory then it would have been more difficult to raid other MIT departments for research staff The program manager responsible for the DARPA grant was J C R Licklider who had previously been at MIT conducting research in RLE and would later succeed Fano as director of Project MAC br Project MAC would become famous for groundbreaking research in operating systems artificial intelligence and the theory of computation Its contemporaries included Project Genie at Berkeley the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and somewhat later University of Southern California s USC s Information Sciences Institute br An AI Group including Marvin Minsky the director John McCarthy inventor of Lisp and a talented community of computer programmers were incorporated into Project MAC They were interested principally in the problems of vision mechanical motion and manipulation and language which they view as the keys to more intelligent machines In the s and s the AI Group developed a time sharing operating system called Incompatible Timesharing System ITS which ran on PDP and later PDP computers br The early Project MAC community included Fano Minsky Licklider Fernando J Corbat and a community of computer programmers and enthusiasts among others who drew their inspiration from former colleague John McCarthy These founders envisioned the creation of a computer utility whose computational power would be as reliable as an electric utility To this end Corbat brought the first computer time sharing system Compatible Time Sharing System CTSS with him from the MIT Computation Center using the DARPA funding to purchase an IBM for research use One of the early focuses of Project MAC would be the development of a successor to CTSS Multics which was to be the first high availability computer system developed as a part of an industry consortium including General Electric and Bell Laboratories br In Scientific American featured Project MAC in the September thematic issue devoted to computer science that was later published in book form At the time the system was described as having approximately TTY terminals mostly on campus but with a few in private homes Only users could be logged in at the same time The project enlisted students in various classes to use the terminals simultaneously in problem solving simulations and multi terminal communications as tests for the multi access computing software being developed br br br AI Lab and LCS br In the late s Minsky s artificial intelligence group was seeking more space and was unable to get satisfaction from project director Licklider Minsky found that although Project MAC as a single entity could not get the additional space he wanted he could split off to form his own laboratory and then be entitled to more office space As a result the MIT AI Lab was formed in and many of Minsky s AI colleagues left Project MAC to join him in the new laboratory while most of the remaining members went on to form the Laboratory for Computer Science Talented programmers such as Richard Stallman who used TECO to develop EMACS flourished in the AI Lab during this time br Those researchers who did not join the smaller AI Lab formed the Laboratory for Computer Science and continued their research into operating systems programming languages distributed systems and the theory of computation Two professors Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman chose to remain neutral their group was referred to variously as Switzerland and Project MAC for the next years br Among much else the AI Lab led to the invention of Lisp machines and their attempted commercialization by two companies in the s Symbolics and Lisp Machines Inc This divided the AI Lab into camps which resulted in a hiring away of many of the talented programmers The incident inspired Richard Stallman s later work on the GNU Project Nobody had envisioned that the AI lab s hacker group would be wiped out but it was That is the basis for the free software movement the experience I had the life that I ve lived at the MIT AI lab to be working on human knowledge and not be standing in the way of anybody s further using and further disseminating human knowledge br br br CSAIL br On the fortieth anniversary of Project MAC s establishment July LCS was merged with the AI Lab to form the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory or CSAIL This merger created the largest laboratory over personnel on the MIT campus and was regarded as a reuniting of the diversified elements of Project MAC br In CSAIL launched a five year collaboration program with IFlytek a company sanctioned the following year for allegedly using its technology for surveillance and human rights abuses in Xinjiang In October MIT announced that it would review its partnerships with sanctioned firms such as iFlyTek and SenseTime In April the agreement with iFlyTek was terminated br CSAIL moved from the School of Engineering to the newly formed Schwarzman College of Computing by February br br br Offices br From to Project MAC LCS the AI Lab and CSAIL had their offices at Technology Square taking over more and more floors of the building over the years In CSAIL moved to the new Ray and Maria Stata Center which was built specifically to house it and other departments br br br Outreach activities br The IMARA from Swahili word for power group sponsors a variety of outreach programs that bridge the global digital divide Its aim is to find and implement long term sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities These projects are run under the aegis of CSAIL and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training install and donate computer setups in greater Boston Massachusetts Kenya Native American Indian tribal reservations in the American Southwest such as the Navajo Nation the Middle East and Fiji Islands The CommuniTech project strives to empower under served communities through sustainable technology and education and does this through the MIT Used Computer Factory UCF providing refurbished computers to under served families and through the Families Accessing Computer Technology FACT classes it trains those families to become familiar and comfortable with computer technology br br br Notable researchers br Including members and alumni of CSAIL s
