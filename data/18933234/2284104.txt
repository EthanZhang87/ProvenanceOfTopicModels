Dissociated press is a parody generator a computer program that generates nonsensical text The generated text is based on another text using the Markov chain technique The name is a play on Associated Press and the psychological term dissociation although word salad is more typical of conditions like aphasia and schizophrenia which is however frequently confused with dissociative identity disorder by laypeople br An implementation of the algorithm is available in Emacs Another implementation is available as a Perl module in CPAN Games Dissociate br br br The algorithm br The algorithm starts by printing a number of consecutive words or letters from the source text Then it searches the source text for an occurrence of the few last words or letters printed out so far If multiple occurrences are found it picks a random one and proceeds with printing the text following the chosen occurrence After a predetermined length of text is printed out the search procedure is repeated for the newly printed ending br Considering that words and phrases tend to appear in specific grammatical contexts the resulting text usually seems correct grammatically and if the source text is uniform in style the result appears to be of similar style and subject and takes some effort on the reader s side to recognize as not genuine Still the randomness of the assembly process deprives it of any logical flow the loosely related parts are connected in a nonsensical way creating a humorously abstract random result br br br Examples br Here is a short example of word based Dissociated Press applied to the Jargon File br br wart n A small crocky feature that sticks out of an array C has no checks for this This is relatively benign and easy to spot if the phrase is bent so as to be not worth paying attention to the medium in question br Here is a short example of letter based Dissociated Press applied to the same source br br window sysIWYG n A bit was named aften bee t prefer to use the other guy s re especially in every cast a chuckle on neithout getting into useful informash speech makes removing a featuring a move or usage actual abstractionsidered interj Indeed spectace logic or problem br br br History br The dissociated press algorithm is described in HAKMEM Item The name dissociated press is first known to have been associated with the Emacs implementation br Brian Hayes discussed a Travesty algorithm in Scientific American in November The article provided a garbled William Faulkner passage br br When he got on the table he come in He never come out of my own pocket as a measure of protecting the company against riot and bloodshed And when he said You tell me a bus ticket let alone write out no case histories Then the law come back with a knife br Hugh Kenner and Joseph O Rourke of Johns Hopkins University discussed their frequency table based Travesty generator for microcomputers in BYTE in November The article included the Turbo Pascal source for two versions of the generator one using Hayes algorithm and another using Claude Shannon s Hellbat algorithm Murray Lesser offered a compiled BASIC version in the magazine in July in September Peter Wayner offered a version that used tree data structures instead of frequency tables and in December Neil J Rubenking offered a version written in Turbo Pascal that stored frequency information in a B tree br br br See also br Cut up technique br Markov chain br Mark V Shaney br Racter br Word salad br Parody generator generic term for a computer program that generates nonsensical text br SCIgen a computer program that generates nonsensical computer science research papers br br br br br br External links br Emacs documentation on Dissociated Press br Dissociated Press in the Jargon File br Dissociated Press on celebrity Twitter feeds br A parody text generator a Pascal implementaiton br This article is based in part on the Jargon File which is in the public domain
