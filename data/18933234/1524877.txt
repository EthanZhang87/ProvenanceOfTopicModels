title: Comparison of text editors
id: 1524877
This article provides basic comparisons for notable text editors More feature details for text editors are available from the Category of text editor features and from the individual products articles This article may not be up to date or necessarily all inclusive br Feature comparisons are made between stable versions of software not the upcoming versions or beta releases and are exclusive of any add ons extensions or external programs unless specified in footnotes br br br Overview br br br Operating system support br This section lists the operating systems that different editors can run on Some editors run on additional operating systems that are not listed br br br Cross platform br br br Natural language localization br br br Document interface br br br Notes br Multiple instances multiple instances of the program can be opened simultaneously for editing multiple files Applies both for single document interface SDI and multiple document interface MDI programs Also applies for program that has a user interface that looks like multiple instances of the same program such as some versions of Microsoft Word br Single document window splitting window can be split to simultaneously view different areas of a file br MDI Overlappable windows each opened document gets its own fully movable window inside the editor environment br MDI Tabbed document interface multiple documents can be viewed as tabs in a single window br MDI Window splitting splitting application window to show multiple documents non overlapping windows br br br Basic features br br br Programming features br br br Notes br Syntax highlighting Displays text in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms br Function list Lists all functions from current file in a window or sidebar and allows user to jump directly to the definition of that function for example by double clicking on the function name in the list More or less realtime does not require creating a symbol database see below br Symbol database Database of functions variable and type definitions macro definitions etc in all the files belonging to the software being developed The database can be created by the editor itself or by an external program such as ctags The database can be used to instantly locate the definition even if it is in another file br Bracket matching Find matching parenthesis or bracket taking into account nesting br Auto indentation May refer to just simple indenting to the same level as the line above or intelligent indenting that is language specific e g ensuring a given indent style br Compiler integration Allows running compilers linkers debuggers from within editor capturing the compiler output and stepping through errors automatically moving cursor to corresponding location in the source file br br br Extra features br br Large file support br br In general most text editors do not support large text files Some restrict themselves to available in core RAM while others use sophisticated virtual memory management techniques and paging algorithms br Search in files br Perform search and possibly replace in multiple files on disk for example on a sub directory and recursively all the directories below it br Similar to grep br br br Key bindings br Support for custom key bindings br br br Notes bugs br Vim custom maps of Ctrl Ctrl Ctrl cannot be set nor is Control Shift char distinguished from Ctrl char br Notepad custom shortcuts of Shift char cannot be set they need an added modifier such as Ctrl or Alt i e SCI LINESCROLLUP cannot be bound to Shift I as the Add button is greyed out br Emacs and Pico pico uses most of Emacs s motion and deletion commands F B P N D etc br br br Protocol support br Support for editing files over a network or the Internet br br br Unicode and other character encodings br To support specified character encoding the editor must be able to load save view and edit text in the specific encoding and not destroy any characters For UTF and UTF this requires internal bit character support br Partial support is indicated if the editor can only convert the character encoding to internal bit format for editing br If some encodings are supported only in some platforms br If the editor can only display specific character set such as OEM by loading corresponding font but does not support keyboard entry for that character set br br br Right to left and bidirectional text br Support for Right To Left RTL texts is necessary for editing some languages like Arabic Persian Hebrew and Yiddish and the mixture of left to right LTR and RTL known as bi directional BiDi support br Depending on the algorithm used in the programs it might only render the bidirectional text correctly but may not be able to edit them e g Notepad shows bidirectional texts correctly but cannot edit it and user should change the text direction to RTL to be able to edit RTL texts correctly br br br Newline support br br
