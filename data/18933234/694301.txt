GNU Screen is a terminal multiplexer a software application that can be used to multiplex several virtual consoles allowing a user to access multiple separate login sessions inside a single terminal window or detach and reattach sessions from a terminal It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface and for separating programs from the session of the Unix shell that started the program particularly so a remote process continues running even when the user is disconnected br Released under the terms of version or later of the GNU General Public License GNU Screen is free software br br br Features br br GNU Screen can be thought of as a text version of graphical window managers or as a way of putting virtual terminals into any login session It is a wrapper that allows multiple text programs to run at the same time and provides features that allow the user to use the programs within a single interface productively This enables the following features persistence multiple windows and session sharing br Screen is often used when a network connection to the terminal is unreliable as a dropped network connection typically terminates all programs the user was running child processes of the login session due to the session ending and sending a hangup signal SIGHUP to all the child processes Running the applications under screen means that the session does not terminate only the now defunct terminal gets detached so applications don t even know the terminal has detached and allows the user to reattach the session later and continue working from where they left off br br br History br Screen was originally designed by Oliver Laumann and Carsten Bormann at Technische Universit t Berlin and published in br Design criteria included VT emulation including ANSI X ISO and ISO and reasonable performance for heavy daily use when character based terminals were still common Later the at the time novel feature of disconnection reattachment was added br Around Laumann handed over maintenance of the code to J rgen Weigert and Michael Schroeder at the University of Erlangen Nuremberg who later moved the project to the GNU Project and added features such as scrollback split screen copy and paste and screen sharing br By development had slowed to a crawl Wanting to change this Amadeusz S awi ski volunteered to help In response Laumann granted him maintainership S awi ski proceeded to put out the first new Screen release in half a decade Because there were some unofficial Screen releases floating around the Internet he called this new release Screen br In May on openSUSE Conference J rgen Weigert invited Alexander Naumov to help to develop and maintain GNU screen Two months later with Alex s help GNU screen was released br br br See also br br xpra a tool to run X Window System applications on one machine disconnect them from that machine s display then reconnect them to another machine s display br Byobu a frontend for GNU Screen or tmux br tmux an ISC licensed terminal multiplexer with a feature set similar to GNU Screen br br br Further reading br Jeff Covey Oct The Antidesktop Freshmeat br br br br br br Notes br br br External links br Official website br Quick reference br Source code repository
