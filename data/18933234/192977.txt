Gnus or Gnus Network User Services is a message reader which is part of GNU Emacs It supports reading and composing both e mail and news and can also act as an RSS reader web processor and directory browser for both local and remote filesystems br Gnus blurs the distinction between news and e mail treating them both as articles that come from different sources News articles are kept separate by group and e mail can be split into arbitrary groups similar to folders in other mail readers In addition Gnus is able to use a number of web based sources as inputs for its groups br br br Features br Some Gnus features br br a range of backends that support any or all of br reading email from the local filesystem or over a network via IMAP or POP br reading web pages via an RSS feed br treating a directory of files either local or remote via FTP or other method as articles to browse br reading Usenet News including the Gmane and Gwene mail to news archives of mailing lists br searching local or remote indices of emails or news items e g via Notmuch br simple or advanced mail splitting automatic sorting of incoming mail to user defined groups br incoming mail can be set to expire instead of just plain deletion br custom posting styles e g a different From address signature etc for each group br virtual groups e g directory on the computer can be read as a group br an advanced message scoring system br user defined hooks for almost any method in emacs lisp br many of the parameters e g expiration posting style can be specified individually for all of the groups br integration with the Insidious Big Brother Database BBDB to handle contacts in a highly automated fashion br integration with other Emacs packages such as the W web browser LDAP lookup code etc br As part of Emacs Gnus features can be extended indefinitely through Emacs lisp br To quote the Gnus Manual br br You know that Gnus gives you all the opportunity you d ever want for shooting yourself in the foot Some people call it flexibility Gnus is also customizable to a great extent which means that the user has a say on how Gnus behaves Other newsreaders might unconditionally shoot you in your foot but with Gnus you have a choice br Note that the composition of HTML email messages as users of more WYSIWYG editors may be used to is not included by default the lack of this ability is counted as a feature by Gnus traditional user base br br br History br Gnus is a rewrite of GNUS by Masanobu Umeda which ceased to be developed in In autumn Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen started the rewrite under the name ding which is a recursive acronym for ding is not Gnus intending to produce a version for which the interface and configuration would work almost exactly the same but the internals would be completely revamped and improved The new version proved to be popular and has undergone constant expansion and enhancement Ingebrigtsen is also programmer of eww br br br Versions br In general users receive Gnus bundled with their copy of GNU Emacs and only need to worry about version numbers if they want to upgrade to newer versions themselves instead of receiving updates through Emacs or their operating system s packaging system br The following versions have been released br br Gnus ding Gnus November br Gnus rebranded bundled with GNU Emacs br Gnus September Gnus May br Gnus a rebranded bundled with GNU Emacs and all later versions of GNU Emacs x br Gnus Red Gnus January br Gnus a rebranded bundled with GNU Emacs September and also included in XEmacs br Gnus Quassia Gnus March br Gnus Pterodactyl Gnus December br Gnus Oort Gnus May br Gnus a rebranded bundled with GNU Emacs June development from the Oort development branch wrapped up around Some versions such as that packaged by Ubuntu Linux as v are actually based on the later No Gnus development branch br Gnus No Gnus bundled with GNU Emacs July br The No Gnus development branch began January and wrapped up in early with version br Gnus Ma Gnus or Gnus is the current development version v first released in May br The odd minor version numbers like and are for the Gnus versions bundled with GNU Emacs The even version numbers are the unbundled releases So for example Gnus is similar to Gnus but bundled with Emacs br Development is done using named versions whose first letters run backwards in the alphabet No Gnus v was released in early and development transitioned to Ma Gnus No named version ever reaches instead when it is considered stable enough for general release it sheds its name and gets packaged with as simply Gnus version number Entering the V command in the Groups buffer of a running copy of Gnus will usually cause it to divulge a version number but there is no easy way for an end user to know if for example No Gnus is older or newer than Gnus br After being developed separately for years the developer of Gnus announced that further development would take place inside Gnu Emacs git tree A side effect of this change is that support for XEmacs and older versions of Gnu Emacs will be dropped br br br See also br br Comparison of e mail clients br Text based email client br Comparison of feed
