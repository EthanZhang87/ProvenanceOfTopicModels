Guy Lewis Steele Jr born October is an American computer scientist who has played an important role in designing and documenting several computer programming languages and technical standards br br br Biography br Steele was born in Missouri and graduated from the Boston Latin School in He received a Bachelor of Arts BA in applied mathematics from Harvard University and a Master s degree MS and Doctor of Philosophy PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT in computer science He then worked as an assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and a compiler implementer at Tartan Laboratories Then he joined the supercomputer company Thinking Machines where he helped define and promote a parallel computing version of the Lisp programming language named Lisp Star Lisp and a parallel version of the language C named C br In Steele joined Sun Microsystems and was invited by Bill Joy to become a member of the Java team after the language had been designed since he had a track record of writing good specifications for extant languages He was named a Sun Fellow in Steele joined Oracle in when Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems br br br Works br While at MIT Steele published more than two dozen papers with Gerald Jay Sussman on the subject of the language Lisp and its implementation the Lambda Papers One of their most notable contributions was the design of the language Scheme br Steele also designed the original command set of Emacs and was the first to port TeX from WAITS to ITS He has published papers on other subjects including compilers parallel processing and constraint languages One song he composed has been published in the official journal of the Association for Computing Machinery Communications of the ACM CACM The Telnet Song April a parody of the behavior of a series of PDP TELNET implementations written by Mark Crispin br Steele has served on accredited technical standards committees including Ecma International formerly European Computer Manufacturers Association ECMA TC for the language ECMAScript for which he was editor of the first edition X J for C and X J for Fortran and is as of chairman of X J for Common Lisp He was also a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE working group that produced the IEEE Standard for the language Scheme IEEE Std He represented Sun Microsystems in the High Performance Fortran Forum which produced the High Performance Fortran specification in May br In addition to specifications of the language Java Steele s work at Sun Microsystems has included research in parallel algorithms implementation strategies and architecture and software support In Steele began leading a team of researchers at Sun developing a new language named Fortress a high performance language designed to obsolete Fortran br Steele participated in the development of the Verse programming language designed by Epic Games br br br Books br In Steele edited The Hacker s Dictionary Harper Row ISBN which was a print version of the Jargon File br Steele and Samuel P Harbison wrote C A Reference Manual Prentice Hall ISBN to provide a precise description of the language C which Tartan Laboratories was trying to implement on a wide range of systems Both authors participated in the American National Standards Institute ANSI C standardization process several revisions of the book were issued to reflect the new standard br On March Steele published Common Lisp the Language Digital Press ISBN X pages This first edition was the original specification of Common Lisp CLtL and served as the basis for the ANSI standard Steele released a greatly expanded second edition in pages which documented a near final version of the ANSI standard br Steele along with Charles H Koelbel David B Loveman Robert S Schreiber and Mary E Zosel wrote The High Performance Fortran Handbook MIT Press ISBN br Steele also coauthored the original The Java Language Specification with James Gosling and Bill Joy br br br Awards br Steele received the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award in He was named a Founding AAAI Fellow in an ACM Fellow in a member of the National Academy of Engineering of the United States of America in and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in He received the Dr Dobb s Excellence in Programming Award in br br br Other activities br Steele is a modern western square dancer and caller from Mainstream up through C A a member of Tech Squares and a member of Callerlab br Under the pseudonym Great Quux which was an old student nickname at the Boston Latin School and MIT he has published light verse and Crunchly cartoons a few of the latter appeared in The New Hacker s Dictionary He has also used his initials GLS br In Steele solved the game Teeko via computer showing what must occur if both players play wisely he found that neither player can force a win He also showed that the Advanced Teeko variant is a win for Black again assuming perfect play as is one other variant but the other fourteen variants are draws br br br br br br Further reading br Seibel Peter September Coders at Work Reflections on the
