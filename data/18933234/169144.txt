LilyPond is a computer program and file format for music engraving One of LilyPond s major goals is to produce scores that are engraved with traditional layout rules reflecting the era when scores were engraved by hand br LilyPond is cross platform and is available for several common operating systems released under the terms of the GNU General Public License LilyPond is free software and part of the GNU Project br br br History br The LilyPond project was started in by Han Wen Nienhuys and Jan Nieuwenhuizen after they decided to abandon work on MPP MusiXTeX PreProcessor a project they began collaborating on in Its name was inspired both by the Rosegarden project and an acquaintance of Nienhuys and Nieuwenhuizen named Suzanne a name that means lily in Hebrew br br br Version br LilyPond was released on July highlighting the development of a custom music font Feta and the complete separation of LilyPond from MusiXTeX br br br Version br LilyPond was released on September announcing a simplified syntax model and a much more complete set of facilities for notating various styles of music br br br Design br br LilyPond is mostly written in C and uses Scheme interpreted by GNU Guile as its extension language allowing for user customization It has a relatively large codebase as of March the source includes over lines of C lines of Scheme and lines of Python code br It uses a simple text notation for music input which LilyPond interprets and processes in a series of stages In the final stage music notation is output to PDF via PostScript or other graphical formats such as SVG or PNG LilyPond can also generate MIDI files that correspond to the music notation output br LilyPond is a text based application so it does not contain its own graphical user interface to assist with score creation However a text editor based LilyPad GUI for Windows and MacOS is included by default on these systems It does however have a flexible input language that strives to be simple easing the learning curve for new users LilyPond adheres to the WYSIWYM paradigm the workflow for typesetting music notation with LilyPond is similar to that of preparing documents with LaTeX br LilyPond supports experimental musical notation Its guitar facilities support alternative tunings such as major thirds tuning br br br Software features br br LilyPond s primary goal is to produce output comparable to professionally engraved scores instead of output that looks mechanical and computer generated An essay from the LilyPond website written by LilyPond developers explains some typographical issues addressed by LilyPond br br Optical font scaling depending on the staff size the design of the music font is slightly altered this is a feature that Donald Knuth s Computer Modern font is known for As a result note heads become more rounded and staff lines become thicker br Optical spacing stem directions are taken into account when spacing subsequent notes br Special ledger line handling ledger lines are shortened when accidentals are nearby thus enhancing readability br Proportional spacing notes can be positioned in such a way that exactly reflects their duration For example with this setting the space between consecutive quarter notes is four times greater than between consecutive sixteenth notes br br br Overview of input syntax br The native input language for LilyPond is comprehensive and consists of many commands needed for expressing any sort of articulation dynamic meter etc It is similar to that of TeX The ability to embed Scheme code within a LilyPond source file permits arbitrary extensions to the input language and assists with algorithmic composition Some general syntactic features are listed below br br Single line comments begin with a percent sign br Notes are represented in pitch duration format pitch is specified with Helmholtz pitch notation and duration is specified with a numeral based system The semantics of the pitch duration format change depending on the active input mode this is explained in depth in the LilyPond manual For example in absolute mode a is an A one octave up from the base A A in scientific pitch notation of quarter note length br Commands usually begin with a backslash such as time or slurUp The function of the command in question determines where the command is placed for example if the command is used to indicate a fixed dynamic on a specific note it is placed after the note br Some common commands are represented symbolically to ease typing One example is with slurs where and indicate the beginning and ending of a slur respectively Another example is with manual beaming where and indicate the extent of the beam br LilyPond s interface with Pango requires the input character encoding to be UTF One benefit of this is that more than one language can be included in the same source file br br br Example of LilyPond input file br br br Corresponding output br br br More complex output br Lilypond can also create extensively customised output An example is the short extract of a Karlheinz Stockhausen piano piece below br br br Collaboration with other projects br br Several graphical scorewriters such as Rosegarden NoteEdit Canorus Denemo and TuxGuitar can export files directly to LilyPond format Other graphical applications serve as front ends to LilyPond including Frescobaldi and the LilyPondTool plugin for jEdit Denemo integrates the PDF output of LilyPond in its display allowing some editing operations on the final typeset score br The Mutopia Project which distributes free content sheet music uses LilyPond to typeset its music as does Musipedia a collaborative music encyclopedia br Emacs org mode contains support for embedding LilyPond scores into documents br OOoLilyPond a LibreOffice extension provides support for calling LilyPond to embed scores into documents br br br Integration into MediaWiki br Lilypond is available in MediaWiki via the Score extension code br This for example transforms the notation br br into br br The above excerpt is a simplified version of Solfeggio in C Minor by C P E Bach More complex scores including lyrics are also possible within MediaWiki wikis See Pastime with Good Company for an example of this br br br Integration into text using lilypond book br Integration of LilyPond musical elements into various document formats both TeX based systems such as LaTeX and Texinfo and also DocBook and HTML pages is natively supported through the companion program lilypond book developed and maintained by the LilyPond community This allows users to embed musical elements within texts such as musicology song booklets work sheets for teaching and school examinations br br br Integration into LaTeX br For integration into the LaTeX document preparation system lyLuaTeX has been developed as a LuaLaTeX package to embed musical elements within texts It includes features for matching layout and appearance of the musical elements with the surrounding text document Music elements may consist of music symbols song lyrics guitar chords diagrams lead sheets music excerpts guitar tablatures or multi page scores br br br Comparison to other scorewriters br Finale and Sibelius are two proprietary scorewriters often compared to LilyPond Andrew Hawryluk a LilyPond user wrote a series of articles comparing output quality between Finale and LilyPond br Another scorewriter with comparable features to LilyPond is SCORE but SCORE relies on manual positioning more than Lilypond does br See also Comparison of
