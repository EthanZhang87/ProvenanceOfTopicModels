title: Free and open-source software
id: 1721496
Free and open source software FOSS is software that is available under a license that grants the right to use modify and distribute the software modified or not to everyone free of charge The public availability of the source code is therefore a necessary but not sufficient condition FOSS is an inclusive umbrella term for free software and open source software FOSS is in contrast to proprietary software where the software is under restrictive copyright or licensing and the source code is hidden from the users br FOSS maintains the software user s civil liberty rights via the Four Essential Freedoms of free software Other benefits of using FOSS include decreased software costs increased security against malware stability privacy opportunities for educational usage and giving users more control over their own hardware Free and open source operating systems such as Linux distributions and descendants of BSD are widely used today powering millions of servers desktops smartphones and other devices Free software licenses and open source licenses are used by many software packages today The free software movement and the open source software movement are online social movements behind widespread production adoption and promotion of FOSS with the former preferring to use the terms FLOSS free or libre br br br Overview br br Free and open source software FOSS is an umbrella term for software that is simultaneously considered both free software and open source software The precise definition of the terms free software and open source software applies them to any software distributed under terms that allow users to use modify and redistribute said software in any manner they see fit without requiring that they pay the author s of the software a royalty or fee for engaging in the listed activities br Although there is an almost complete overlap between free software licenses and open source software licenses there is a strong philosophical disagreement between the advocates of these two positions The terminology of FOSS was created to be a neutral on these philosophical disagreements between the Free Software Foundation FSF and Open Source Initiative OSI and have a single unified term that could refer to both concepts br br br Free software br Richard Stallman s Free Software Definition adopted by the FSF defines free software as a matter of liberty not price and that which upholds the Four Essential Freedoms The earliest known publication of this definition of his free software definition was in the February edition of the FSF s now discontinued GNU s Bulletin publication The canonical source for the document is in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website As of August it is published in languages br br br Four essential freedoms of Free Software br To meet the definition of free software the FSF requires the software s licensing respect the civil liberties human rights of what the FSF calls the software user s Four Essential Freedoms br br The freedom to run the program as you wish for any purpose freedom br The freedom to study how the program works and change it so it does your computing as you wish freedom Access to the source code is a precondition for this br The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others freedom br The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others freedom By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes Access to the source code is a precondition for this br br br Open source br The Open Source Definition is used by the Open Source Initiative OSI to determine whether a software license qualifies for the organization s insignia for open source software The definition was based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines written and adapted primarily by Bruce Perens Perens did not base his writing on the Four Essential Freedoms of free software from the Free Software Foundation which were only later available on the web Perens subsequently stated that he felt Eric Raymond s promotion of open source unfairly overshadowed the Free Software Foundation s efforts and reaffirmed his support for free software In the following s he spoke about open source again br br br History br br From the s and on through the s it was common for computer users to have the source code for all programs they used and the permission and ability to modify it for their own use Software including source code was commonly shared by individuals who used computers often as public domain software FOSS is not the same as public domain software as public domain software does not contain copyrights Most companies had a business model based on hardware sales and provided or bundled software with hardware free of charge br By the late s the prevailing business model around software was changing A growing and evolving software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer s bundled software products rather than funding software development from hardware revenue these new companies were selling software directly Leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software and some customers who were able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of software bundled with hardware product costs In United States vs IBM filed January the government charged that bundled software was anticompetitive While some software was still being provided without monetary cost and license restriction there was a growing amount of software that was only at a monetary cost with restricted licensing In the s and early s some parts of the software industry began using technical measures such as distributing only binary copies of computer programs to prevent computer users from being able to use reverse engineering techniques to study and customize software they had paid for In the copyright law was extended to computer programs in the United States previously computer programs could be considered ideas procedures methods systems and processes which are not copyrightable br Early on closed source software was uncommon until the mid s to the s when IBM implemented in an object code only policy no longer distributing source code br In Richard Stallman longtime member of the hacker community at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory announced the GNU project saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users Software development for the GNU operating system began in January and the Free Software Foundation FSF was founded in October An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March titled the GNU Manifesto The manifesto included significant explanation of the GNU philosophy Free Software Definition and copyleft ideas The FSF takes the position that the fundamental issue Free software addresses is an ethical one to ensure software users can exercise what it calls The Four Essential Freedoms br The Linux kernel created by Linus Torvalds was released as freely modifiable source code in Initially Linux was not released under either a Free software or an Open source software license However with version in February he relicensed the project under the GNU General Public License br FreeBSD and NetBSD both derived from BSD were released as Free software when the USL v BSDi lawsuit was settled out of court in OpenBSD forked from NetBSD in Also in The Apache HTTP Server commonly referred to as Apache was released under the Apache License br In Eric Raymond published The Cathedral and the Bazaar a reflective analysis of the hacker community and Free software principles The paper received significant attention in early and was one factor in motivating Netscape Communications Corporation to release their popular Netscape Communicator Internet suite as Free software This code is today better known as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird br Netscape s act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring the FSF s Free software ideas and perceived benefits to the commercial software industry They concluded that FSF s social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape and looked for a way to rebrand the Free software movement to emphasize the business potential of sharing and collaborating on software source code The new name they chose was Open source and quickly Bruce Perens publisher Tim O Reilly Linus Torvalds and others signed on to the rebranding The Open Source Initiative was founded in February to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize open source principles br While the Open Source Initiative sought to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize the principles it adhered to commercial software vendors found themselves increasingly threatened by the concept of freely distributed software and universal access to an application s source code A Microsoft executive publicly stated in that Open source is an intellectual property destroyer I can t imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual property business Companies have indeed faced copyright infringement issues when embracing FOSS For many years FOSS played a niche role outside of the mainstream of private software development However the success of FOSS Operating Systems such as Linux BSD and the companies based on FOSS such as Red Hat has changed the software industry s attitude and there has been a dramatic shift in the corporate philosophy concerning its development br br br Usage br br br Benefits over proprietary software br br br Personal control customizability and freedom br br Users of FOSS benefit from the Four Essential Freedoms to make unrestricted use of and to study copy modify and redistribute such software with or without modification If they would like to change the functionality of software they can bring about changes to the code and if they wish distribute such modified versions of the software or often depending on the software s decision making model and its other users even push or request such changes to be made via updates to the original software br br br Privacy and security br br Manufacturers of proprietary closed source software are sometimes pressured to building in backdoors or other covert undesired features into their software Instead of having to trust software vendors users of FOSS can inspect and verify the source code themselves and can put trust on a community of volunteers and users As proprietary code is typically hidden from public view only the vendors themselves and hackers may be aware of any vulnerabilities in them while FOSS involves as many people as possible for exposing bugs quickly br br br Low costs or no costs br FOSS is often free of charge although donations are often encouraged This also allows users to better test and compare software br br br Quality collaboration and efficiency br br FOSS allows for better collaboration among various parties and individuals with the goal of developing the most efficient software for its users or use cases while proprietary software is typically meant to generate profits Furthermore in many cases more organizations and individuals contribute to such projects than to proprietary software It has been shown that technical superiority is typically the primary reason why companies choose open source software br br br Drawbacks compared to proprietary software br br br Security and user support br br According to Linus s law the more people who can see and test a set of code the more likely any flaws will be caught and fixed quickly However this does not guarantee a high level of participation Having a grouping of full time professionals behind a commercial product can in some cases be superior to FOSS br Furthermore publicized source code might make it easier for hackers to find vulnerabilities in it and write exploits This however assumes that such malicious hackers are more effective than white hat hackers which responsibly disclose or help fix the vulnerabilities that no code leaks or exfiltrations occur and that reverse engineering of proprietary code is a hindrance of significance for malicious hackers br br br Hardware and software compatibility br br Sometimes FOSS is not compatible with proprietary hardware or specific software This is often due to manufacturers obstructing FOSS such as by not disclosing the interfaces or other specifications needed for members of the FOSS movement to write drivers for their hardware for instance as they wish customers to run only their own proprietary software or as they might benefit from partnerships br br br Bugs and missing features br br While FOSS can be superior to proprietary equivalents in terms of software features and stability in many cases it has more unfixed bugs and missing features when compared to similar commercial software This varies per case and usually depends on the level of interest in a particular project However unlike close sourced software improvements can be made by anyone who has the motivation time and skill to do so br A common obstacle in FOSS development is the lack of access to some common official standards due to costly royalties or required non disclosure agreements e g for the DVD Video format br br br Less guarantee of development br There is often less certainty of FOSS projects gaining the required resources and participation for continued development than commercial software backed by companies However companies also often abolish projects for being unprofitable yet large companies may rely on and hence co develop open source software On the other hand if the vendor of proprietary software ceases development there are no alternatives whereas with FOSS any user who needs it still has the right and the source code to continue to develop it themself or pay a rd party to do so br br br Missing applications br As the FOSS operating system distributions of Linux has a lower market share of end users there are also fewer applications available br br br Adoption by governments br br br Adoption by supranational unions and international organizations br br br European Union br br In the European Commission stated that EU institutions should become open source software users themselves even more than they already are and listed open source software as one of the nine key drivers of innovation together with big data mobility cloud computing and the internet of things br In the European Commission adopted its Open Source Strategy including encouraging sharing and reuse of software and publishing Commission s source code as key objectives Among concrete actions there is also to set up an Open Source Programme Office in and in it launched its own FOSS repository https code europa eu br In the Commission Decision on the open source licensing and reuse of Commission br software C I was adopted under which as a general principle the European Commission may release software under EUPL or another FOSS license if more appropriate There are exceptions though br In May the Expert group on the Interoperability of European Public Services came published recommendations to strengthen the interoperability of public administrations across the EU These recommendations are to be taken into account later in the same year in Commission s proposal of the Interoperable Europe Act br br br Production br br br Issues and incidents br br br GPLv controversy br br While copyright is the primary legal mechanism that FOSS authors use to ensure license compliance for their software other mechanisms such as legislation patents and trademarks have implications as well In response to legal issues with patents and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA the Free Software Foundation released version of its GNU General Public License GNU GPLv in that explicitly addressed the DMCA and patent rights br After the development of the GNU GPLv in the FSF as the copyright holder of many pieces of the GNU system updated many of the GNU programs licenses from GPLv to GPLv On the other hand the adoption of the new GPL version was heavily discussed in the FOSS ecosystem several projects decided against upgrading to GPLv For instance the Linux kernel the BusyBox project AdvFS Blender and the VLC media player decided against adopting the GPLv br Apple a user of GCC and a heavy user of both DRM and patents switched the compiler in its Xcode IDE from GCC to Clang which is another FOSS compiler but is under a permissive license LWN speculated that Apple was motivated partly by a desire to avoid GPLv The Samba project also switched to GPLv so Apple replaced Samba in their software suite by a closed source proprietary software alternative br br br Skewed prioritization ineffectiveness and egoism of developers br br Leemhuis criticizes the prioritization of skilled developers who instead of fixing issues in already popular open source applications and desktop environments create new mostly redundant software to gain fame and fortune br He also criticizes notebook manufacturers for optimizing their own products only privately or creating workarounds instead of helping fix the actual causes of the many issues with Linux on notebooks such as the unnecessary power consumption br br br Commercial ownership of open source software br Mergers have affected major open source software Sun Microsystems Sun acquired MySQL AB owner of the popular open source MySQL database in br Oracle in turn purchased Sun in January acquiring their copyrights patents and trademarks Thus Oracle became the owner of both the most popular proprietary database and the most popular open source database Oracle s attempts to commercialize the open source MySQL database have raised concerns in the FOSS community Partly in response to uncertainty about the future of MySQL the FOSS community forked the project into new database systems outside of Oracle s control These include MariaDB Percona and Drizzle All of these have distinct names they are distinct projects and cannot use the trademarked name MySQL br br br Legal cases br br br Oracle v Google br br In August Oracle sued Google claiming that its use of Java in Android infringed on Oracle s copyrights and patents In May the trial judge determined that Google did not infringe on Oracle s patents and ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable The jury found that Google infringed a small number of copied files but the parties stipulated that Google would pay no damages Oracle appealed to the Federal Circuit and Google filed a cross appeal on the literal copying claim br br br As part driver of a new socio economic model br br By defying ownership regulations in the construction and use of information a key area of contemporary growth the Free Open Source Software FOSS movement counters neoliberalism and privatization in general br By realizing the historical potential of an economy of abundance for the new digital world FOSS may lay down a plan for political resistance or show the way towards a potential transformation of capitalism br According to Yochai Benkler Jack N and Lillian R Berkman Professor for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at Harvard Law School free software is the most visible part of a new economy of commons based peer production of information knowledge and culture As examples he cites a variety of FOSS projects including both free software and open source br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br Sources br br br Further reading
