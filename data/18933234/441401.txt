id: 441401
A parody religion or mock religion is a belief system that challenges the spiritual convictions of others often through humor satire or burlesque literary ridicule Often constructed to achieve a specific purpose related to another belief system a parody religion can be a parody of several religions sects gurus cults or new religious movements at the same time or even a parody of no particular religion instead parodying the concept of religious belief itself Some parody religions emphasise having fun the new faith may serve as a convenient excuse for pleasant social interaction among the like minded br One approach of parody religions aims to highlight deficiencies in particular pro religious arguments following the logic that if a given argument can also be used to support a clear parody then the original argument is clearly flawed This can be done through fictional religions found in many works of fiction one example of this can be the Bokononism from the novel Cat s Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut Another example of this is the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster which parodies the demand for equal time employed by intelligent design and creationism br Occasionally a parody religion may offer ordination by mail or on line at a nominal fee seeking equal recognition for its clergy officiants under freedom of religion provisions including the st and th amendments to the United States Constitution to legally solemnise marriages Parody religions also have sought the same reasonable accommodation legally afforded to mainstream religions including religious specific garb or headgear A U S federal court ruled in that the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster Pastafarianism is not a religion but Pastafarianism or The Church of the Latter Day Dude Dudeism have been accommodated to some extent by a few U S states and by some other countries br Several religions that are considered as parody religions have a number of relatively serious followers who embrace the perceived absurdity of these religions as spiritually significant a decidedly post modern approach to religion Since scholars of new religious movements have come to consider Discordianism as having a complex and subtle religious system concluding that Discordianism can no longer be considered a purely parodic religion br br br List of notable parody religions br br br Parodies of particular beliefs br br The following were created as parodies of particular religious beliefs br br br Post modern religions br The following post modern religions that may be seen as elaborate parodies of already existent religions br br br Aspects br br br Beliefs br Parody religions are often created to satirize or mock established religions and as such their beliefs often reflect this satirical or humorous tone Parody religions may also use their beliefs as a means of commenting on societal issues or political ideologies The Church of the SubGenius for instance pokes fun at organized religion and American culture through its parodic depiction of a mock religion that celebrates slackness and absurdity Other parody religions target specific religions sects or cults and craft their beliefs to mock those of the religion they are targeting br One common belief found in many parody religions is the rejection of dogma and religious authority Parody religions often portray themselves as free thinking and open minded rejecting the idea of blind faith and instead encouraging critical thinking and skepticism br Parody religions may also incorporate elements of pop culture or science fiction into their beliefs For example The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster a parody religion that originated in response to the teaching of intelligent design in schools posits that a flying spaghetti monster created the universe Similarly the Jediism movement which began as a parody religion but has since become more serious is based on the beliefs and practices of the Jedi Order from the Star Wars franchise br br br Practices br Similar to many other religions the practices of parody religions can include rituals sermons meditation prayer commemoration of a deity or god sacrifices parades festivals holidays initiations marital ceremonies religious music art dance public service or other aspects of human culture br Parody religions often use their practices as a way to further satirize or critique established religious practices or as a way to create a sense of community and belonging among their followers Parody religions may also use their practices to highlight societal issues or political ideologies br One common practice found in many parody religions is the use of humor and satire in religious ceremonies and rituals The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster for example often includes a noodle mass in which followers consume spaghetti and meatballs as a form of communion The Church of the SubGenius also uses humor in its ceremonies with rituals that include mock baptisms and the slack off ritual in which followers are encouraged to relax and do nothing br Parody religions may also incorporate elements of pop culture or science fiction into their practices The Jediism movement for instance practices lightsaber training and meditation inspired by the Jedi Order from the Star Wars franchise The Church of the Latter Day Dude a parody religion based on the character from the film The Big Lebowski practices dudeist philosophy and encourages followers to take it easy and abide br In addition to these unique practices many parody religions also incorporate elements of more traditional religions into their practices The Church of the SubGenius for instance uses elements of Christianity Hinduism and other religions in its rituals and iconography br br br Social organization br Parody religions often have unique social structures and organizations that reflect their satirical or humorous tone Parody religions may also use their social organization to create a sense of community and belonging among their followers or as a way to comment on societal issues or political ideologies br One common aspect of parody religions is that they often lack a centralized hierarchy or leadership structure Instead many parody religions operate as decentralized communities with individual followers taking on roles and responsibilities as needed For example the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster has no official leaders and instead relies on a community of individuals to organize events and spread the message of the religion br Parody religions may also use their social organization to comment on societal issues or political ideologies The Church of Euthanasia for example encourages its followers to live a sustainable lifestyle and reduce their environmental impact and has organized protests and demonstrations to raise awareness for these issues br br br Usage by atheist commentators br I contend that we are both atheists I just believe in one fewer god than you do When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods you will understand why I dismiss yours br Many atheists including Richard Dawkins use parody religions such as those of the Flying Spaghetti Monster and the Invisible Pink Unicorn as well as ancient gods like Zeus and Thor as modern versions of Russell s teapot to argue that the burden of proof is on the believer not the atheist br Dawkins also created a parody of the criticism of atheism coining the term athorism or the firm belief that the Norse deity Thor does not exist The intention is to emphasize that atheism is not a form of religious creed but merely denial of specific beliefs br A common challenge against atheism is the idea that atheism is itself a form of faith a belief without proof The theist might say No one can prove that God does not exist therefore an atheist is exercising faith by asserting that there is no God Dawkins argues that by replacing the word God with Thor one should see that the assertion is fallacious The burden of proof he claims rests upon the believer in the supernatural not upon the non believer who considers such things unlikely Athorism is an attempt to illustrate through absurdity that there is no logical difference between disbelieving particular religions br br br Legal issues br Cavanaugh v Bartelt et al Stephen Cavanaugh an inmate at the Nebraska State Penitentiary sued prison officials for refusing to accommodate his religious rights and requests such as the ability to order and wear religious clothing and pendants the right to meet for weekly worship services and classes and the right to receive communion Cavanaugh identifies as a Pastafarian and practices FSMism Cavanaugh claimed that by prison officials rejecting his requests his First Amendment Right was violated Ultimately the Court found that FSMism could not be defined as a religion under federal statutes and they granted the defendants motion to dismiss br Netherlands and The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster In the Dutch court ruled that law student Mienke de Wilde did not qualify for religious exemption in wearing Pastafarian headwear for a government issued ID photo The court claimed that Pastafarianism lacked the seriousness and coherence of a legitimate religious faith br br br See also br New religious movement br Religious humanism
