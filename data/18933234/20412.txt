MATLAB an abbreviation of MATrix LABoratory is a proprietary multi paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks MATLAB allows matrix manipulations plotting of functions and data implementation of algorithms creation of user interfaces and interfacing with programs written in other languages br Although MATLAB is intended primarily for numeric computing an optional toolbox uses the MuPAD symbolic engine allowing access to symbolic computing abilities An additional package Simulink adds graphical multi domain simulation and model based design for dynamic and embedded systems br As of MATLAB has more than four million users worldwide They come from various backgrounds of engineering science and economics As of more than global colleges and universities use MATLAB to support instruction and research br br br History br br br Origins br MATLAB was invented by mathematician and computer programmer Cleve Moler The idea for MATLAB was based on his s PhD thesis Moler became a math professor at the University of New Mexico and started developing MATLAB for his students as a hobby He developed MATLAB s initial linear algebra programming in with his one time thesis advisor George Forsythe This was followed by Fortran code for linear equations in br Before version MATLAB was not a programming language it was a simple interactive matrix calculator There were no programs no toolboxes no graphics And no ODEs or FFTs br The first early version of MATLAB was completed in the late s The software was disclosed to the public for the first time in February at the Naval Postgraduate School in California Early versions of MATLAB were simple matrix calculators with pre built functions At the time MATLAB was distributed for free to universities Moler would leave copies at universities he visited and the software developed a strong following in the math departments of university campuses br In the s Cleve Moler met John N Little They decided to reprogram MATLAB in C and market it for the IBM desktops that were replacing mainframe computers at the time John Little and programmer Steve Bangert re programmed MATLAB in C created the MATLAB programming language and developed features for toolboxes br Since an open source alternative GNU Octave mostly compatible with matlab and scilab similar to matlab have been available br br br Commercial development br MATLAB was first released as a commercial product in at the Automatic Control Conference in Las Vegas MathWorks Inc was founded to develop the software and the MATLAB programming language was released The first MATLAB sale was the following year when Nick Trefethen from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology bought ten copies br By the end of the s several hundred copies of MATLAB had been sold to universities for student use The software was popularized largely thanks to toolboxes created by experts in various fields for performing specialized mathematical tasks Many of the toolboxes were developed as a result of Stanford students that used MATLAB in academia then brought the software with them to the private sector br Over time MATLAB was re written for early operating systems created by Digital Equipment Corporation VAX Sun Microsystems and for Unix PCs Version was released in The first MATLAB compiler was developed by Stephen C Johnson in the s br In MathWorks added a Fortran based library for linear algebra in MATLAB replacing the software s original LINPACK and EISPACK subroutines that were in C MATLAB s Parallel Computing Toolbox was released at the Supercomputing Conference and support for graphics processing units GPUs was added to it in br br br Recent history br Some especially large changes to the software were made with version in The user interface was reworked and Simulink s functionality was expanded By MATLAB had introduced several technical and user interface improvements including the MATLAB Live Editor notebook and other features br br br Syntax br The MATLAB application is built around the MATLAB programming language Common usage of the MATLAB application involves using the Command Window as an interactive mathematical shell or executing text files containing MATLAB code br br br Hello world example br An example of a Hello world program exists in MATLAB br br It displays like so br br br Variables br Variables are defined using the assignment operator MATLAB is a weakly typed programming language because types are implicitly converted It is an inferred typed language because variables can be assigned without declaring their type except if they are to be treated as symbolic objects and that their type can change Values can come from constants from computation involving values of other variables or from the output of a function For example br br br Vectors and matrices br A simple array is defined using the colon syntax initial increment terminator For instance br br defines a variable named array or assigns a new value to an existing variable with the name array which is an array consisting of the values and That is the array starts at the initial value increments with each step from the previous value by the increment value and stops once it reaches or is about to exceed the terminator value br The increment value can actually be left out of this syntax along with one of the colons to use a default value of br br assigns to the variable named ari an array with the values and since the default value of is used as the increment br Indexing is one based which is the usual convention for matrices in mathematics unlike zero based indexing commonly used in other programming languages such as C C and Java br Matrices can be defined by separating the elements of a row with blank space or comma and using a semicolon to separate the rows The list of elements should be surrounded by square brackets Parentheses are used to access elements and subarrays they are also used to denote a function argument list br br Sets of indices can be specified by expressions such as which evaluates to For example a submatrix taken from rows through and columns through can be written as br br A square identity matrix of size n can be generated using the function eye and matrices of any size with zeros or ones can be generated with the functions zeros and ones respectively br br Transposing a vector or a matrix is done either by the function transpose or by adding dot prime after the matrix without the dot prime will perform conjugate transpose for complex arrays br br Most functions accept arrays as input and operate element wise on each element For example mod J n will multiply every element in J by and then reduce each element modulo n MATLAB does include standard for and while loops but as in other similar applications such as APL and R using the vectorized notation is encouraged and is often faster to execute The following code excerpted from the function magic m creates a magic square M for odd values of n MATLAB function meshgrid is used here to generate square matrices I and J containing br br br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br br br br Structures br MATLAB supports structure data types Since all variables in MATLAB are arrays a more adequate name is structure array where each element of the array has the same field names In addition MATLAB supports dynamic field names field look ups by name field manipulations etc br br br Functions br When creating a MATLAB function the name of the file should match the name of the first function in the file Valid function names begin with an alphabetic character and can contain letters numbers or underscores Variables and functions are case sensitive br br br Function handles br MATLAB supports elements of lambda calculus by introducing function handles or function references which are implemented either in m files or anonymous nested functions br br br Classes and object oriented programming br MATLAB supports object oriented programming including classes inheritance virtual dispatch packages pass by value semantics and pass by reference semantics However the syntax and calling conventions are significantly different from other languages MATLAB has value classes and reference classes depending on whether the class has handle as a super class for reference classes or not for value classes br Method call behavior is different between value and reference classes For example a call to a method br br can alter any member of object only if object is an instance of a reference class otherwise value class methods must return a new instance if it needs to modify the object br An example of a simple class is provided below br br When put into a file named hello m this can be executed with the following commands br br br Graphics and graphical user interface programming br br MATLAB has tightly integrated graph plotting features For example the function plot can be used to produce a graph from two vectors x and y The code br br produces the following figure of the sine function br br MATLAB supports three dimensional graphics as well br br MATLAB supports developing graphical user interface GUI applications UIs can be generated either programmatically or using visual design environments such as GUIDE and App Designer br br br MATLAB and other languages br MATLAB can call functions and subroutines written in the programming languages C or Fortran A wrapper function is created allowing MATLAB data types to be passed and returned MEX files MATLAB executables are the dynamically loadable object files created by compiling such functions Since increasing two way interfacing with Python was being added br Libraries written in Perl Java ActiveX or NET can be directly called from MATLAB and many MATLAB libraries for example XML or SQL support are implemented as wrappers around Java or ActiveX libraries Calling MATLAB from Java is more complicated but can be done with a MATLAB toolbox which is sold separately by MathWorks or using an undocumented mechanism called JMI Java to MATLAB Interface which should not be confused with the unrelated Java Metadata Interface that is also called JMI Official MATLAB API for Java was added in br As alternatives to the MuPAD based Symbolic Math Toolbox available from MathWorks MATLAB can be connected to Maple or Mathematica br Libraries also exist to import and export MathML br br br Relations to US sanctions br In MATLAB withdrew services from two Chinese universities as a result of US sanctions The universities said this will be responded to by increased use of open source alternatives and by developing domestic alternatives br br br See also br Comparison of numerical analysis
