title: Superuser
id: 264209
In computing the superuser is a special user account used for system administration Depending on the operating system OS the actual name of this account might be root administrator admin or supervisor In some cases the actual name of the account is not the determining factor on Unix like systems for example the user with a user identifier UID of zero is the superuser regardless of the name of that account and in systems which implement a role based security model any user with the role of superuser or its synonyms can carry out all actions of the superuser account br The principle of least privilege recommends that most users and applications run under an ordinary account to perform their work as a superuser account is capable of making unrestricted potentially adverse system wide changes br br br Unix and Unix like br In Unix like computer OSes such as Linux root is the conventional name of the user who has all rights or permissions to all files and programs in all modes single or multi user Alternative names include baron in BeOS and avatar on some Unix variants BSD often provides a toor root written backward account in addition to a root account Regardless of the name the superuser always has a user ID of The root user can do many things an ordinary user cannot such as changing the ownership of files and binding to network ports numbered below br The name root may have originated because root is the only user account with permission to modify the root directory of a Unix system This directory was originally considered to be root s home directory but the UNIX Filesystem Hierarchy Standard now recommends that root s home be at root The first process bootstrapped in a Unix like system usually called init runs with root privileges It spawns all other processes directly or indirectly which inherit their parents privileges Only a process running as root is allowed to change its user ID to that of another user once it has done so there is no way back Doing so is sometimes called dropping root privileges and is often done as a security measure to limit the damage from possible contamination of the process Another case is login and other programs that ask users for credentials and in case of successful authentication allow them to run programs with privileges of their accounts br It is often recommended that root is never used as a normal user account since simple typographical errors in entering commands can cause major damage to the system Instead a normal user account should be used and then either the su substitute user or sudo substitute user do command is used The su approach requires the user to know the root password while the sudo method requires that the user be set up with the power to run as root within the etc sudoers file typically indirectly by being made a member of the wheel adm admin or sudo group br For a number of reasons the sudo approach is now generally preferred for example it leaves an audit trail of who has used the command and what administrative operations they performed br Some OSes such as macOS and some Linux distributions most notably Ubuntu automatically give the initial user created the ability to run as root via sudo but this is configured to ask them for their password before doing administrative actions In some cases the actual root account is disabled by default so it can t be directly used In mobile platform oriented OSs such as Apple iOS and Android superuser access is inaccessible by design but generally the security system can be exploited in order to obtain it In a few systems such as Plan there is no superuser at all br br br Microsoft Windows br In Windows NT and later systems derived from it such as Windows Windows XP Windows Server and Windows Vista there must be at least one administrator account Windows XP and earlier or one able to elevate privileges to superuser Windows Vista via User Account Control In Windows XP and earlier systems there is a built in administrator account that remains hidden when a user administrator equivalent account exists This built in administrator account is created with a blank password This poses security risks as local users would be able to access the computer via the built in administrator account if the password is left blank so the account is disabled by default in Windows Vista and later systems due to the introduction of User Account Control UAC Remote users are unable to access the built in administrator account br A Windows administrator account is not an exact analogue of the Unix root account Administrator the built in administrator account and a user administrator account have the same level of privileges The default user account created in Windows systems is an administrator account Unlike macOS Linux and Windows Vista administrator accounts administrator accounts in Windows systems without UAC do not insulate the system from most of the pitfalls of full root access One of these pitfalls includes decreased resilience to malware infections To avoid this and maintain optimal system security on pre UAC Windows systems it is recommended to simply authenticate when necessary from a standard user account either via a password set to the built in administrator account or another administrator account br In Windows Vista administrator accounts a prompt will appear to authenticate running a process with elevated privileges Usually no user credentials are required to authenticate the UAC prompt in administrator accounts but authenticating the UAC prompt requires entering the username and password of an administrator in standard user accounts In Windows XP and earlier systems administrator accounts authentication is not required to run a process with elevated privileges This poses a security risk that led to the development of UAC Users can set a process to run with elevated privileges from standard accounts by setting the process to run as administrator or using the runas command and authenticating the prompt with credentials username and password of an administrator account Much of the benefit of authenticating from a standard account is negated if the administrator account s credentials being used has a blank password as in the built in administrator account in Windows XP and earlier systems hence why it is recommended to set a password for the built in administrator account br In Windows NT and higher the root user is the Administrator account br br br Novell NetWare br In Novell NetWare the superuser was called supervisor later admin br br br OpenVMS br In OpenVMS SYSTEM is the superuser account for the OS br br br Older personal systems br On many older OSes on computers intended for personal and home use anyone using the system had full privileges Many such systems such as DOS did not have the concept of multiple accounts and although others such as Windows did allow multiple accounts this was only so that each could have its own preferences profile all users still had full administrative control over the machine br br br See also br Hypervisor br Jailbreaking iOS br nobody username br passwd br Power user br Privilege
