Archimedes is a TCAD package for use by engineers to design and simulate submicron and mesoscopic semiconductor devices Archimedes is free software and thus it can be copied modified and redistributed under GPL Archimedes uses the Ensemble Monte Carlo method and is able to simulate physics effects and transport for electrons and heavy holes in Silicon Germanium GaAs InSb AlSb AlAs AlxInxSb AlxIn x Sb AlP AlSb GaP GaSb InP and their compounds III V semiconductor materials along with Silicon Oxide Applied and or self consistent electrostatic and magnetic fields are handled with the Poisson and Faraday equations br The GNU project has announced in May that the software package Aeneas will be substituted by Archimedes making this one the GNU package for Monte Carlo semiconductor devices simulations br br br Introduction br Archimedes is the GNU package for semiconductor device simulations that has been released for the first time on under GPL It has been created by Jean Michel Sellier who is since then the leader of the project and the main developer It is a free software and thus it can be copied modified and redistributed under GPL br Archimedes belongs to the well known family of TCAD software i e tools utilized to assist the development of technologically relevant products In particular this package assists engineers in designing and simulating submicron and mesoscopic semiconductor devices In a next future version Archimedes will also be able to simulate nanodevices using the Wigner Monte Carlo formalism an experimental release can be found at Today Archimedes is used in several big companies for simulation and production purposes br Archimedes is also useful for teaching purposes since everybody can access the sources modify and test them Today it is used for teaching courses in several hundreds universities all around the world Furthermore a simplified version developed for students is available on nanoHUB org br The Ensemble Monte Carlo method is the method that Archimedes uses to simulate and predict the behavior of a devices Being the Monte Carlo very stable and reliable Archimedes can be used to know the characteristics of a device even before this last is built br The physics and geometry of a device is described simply by a script which makes in this sense Archimedes a powerful tool for the simulation of quite general semiconductor devices br Archimedes is able to simulate a plenty of physics effects and transport for electrons and heavy holes in Silicon Germanium GaAs InSb AlSb AlAs AlxInxSb AlxIn x Sb AlP AlSb GaP GaSb InP and their compounds III V semiconductor materials along with Silicon Oxide the applied and or self consistent electrostatic and magnetic fields by means of Poisson and Faraday equation It is also able to deal with heterostructures br br br Boltzmann transport equation br The Boltzmann transport equation model has been the main tool used in the analysis of transport in semiconductors

distribution in both real and k space Further it physically represents the probability of particle occupation of energy k at position r and time t In addition due to being a seven dimensional integro differential equation six dimensions in the phase space and one in time the solution to the BTE is cumbersome and can be solved in closed analytical form under very special restrictions Numerically solution to the BTE is employed using either a deterministic method or a stochastic method The deterministic method solution is based on a grid based numerical method such as the spherical harmonics approach whereas the Monte Carlo is the stochastic approach used to solve the BTE br br br Monte Carlo method br The semiclassical Monte Carlo method is a statistical method used to yield exact solution to the Boltzmann transport equation which includes complex band structure and scattering processes This approach is semiclassical for the reason that scattering mechanisms are treated quantum mechanically using the Fermi s Golden Rule whereas the transport between scattering events is treated using the classical particle notion The Monte Carlo model in essence tracks the particle trajectory at each free flight and chooses a corresponding scattering mechanism stochastically Two of the great advantages of semiclassical Monte Carlo are its capability to provide accurate quantum mechanical treatment of various distinct scattering mechanisms within the scattering terms and the absence of assumption about the form of carrier distribution in energy or k space The semiclassical

electric field E k is the energy dispersion relation and k is the momentum wave vector To solve the above equation one needs strong knowledge of the band structure E k The E k relation describes how the particle moves inside the device in addition to depicting useful information necessary for transport such as the density of states DOS and the particle velocity A Full band E K relation can be obtained using the semi empirical pseudopotential method br br br Screenshots br br br br br br br br br br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Official website br draft of a complete
