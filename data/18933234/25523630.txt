title: Jargon File
id: 25523630
The Jargon File is a glossary and usage dictionary of slang used by computer programmers The original Jargon File was a collection of terms from technical cultures such as the MIT AI Lab the Stanford AI Lab SAIL and others of the old ARPANET AI LISP PDP communities including Bolt Beranek and Newman BBN Carnegie Mellon University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute It was published in paperback form in as The Hacker s Dictionary edited by Guy Steele revised in as The New Hacker s Dictionary ed Eric S Raymond third edition published br The concept of the file began with the Tech Model Railroad Club TMRC that came out of early TX and PDP hackers in the s where the term hacker emerged and the ethic philosophies and some of the nomenclature emerged br br br to br The Jargon File referred to here as Jargon or the File was made by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in From that time until the plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in the File was named AIWORD RF UP DOC UP DOC was a system directory for User Program DOCumentation on the WAITS operating system Some terms such as frob foo and mung are believed to date back to the early s from the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT and documented in the Dictionary of the TMRC Language compiled by Peter Samson The revisions of Jargon were all unnumbered and may be collectively considered version Note that it was always called AIWORD or the Jargon file never the File the last term was coined by Eric Raymond br In Mark Crispin having seen an announcement about the File on the SAIL computer FTPed a copy of the File to the MIT AI Lab He noticed that it was hardly restricted to AI words and so stored the file on his directory named as AI MRC SAIL JARGON AI lab computer directory MRC file SAIL JARGON br Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter and Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File which was subsequently kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT with periodic resynchronizations br The File expanded by fits and starts until Richard Stallman was prominent among the contributors adding many MIT and ITS related coinages The Incompatible Timesharing System ITS was named to distinguish it from another early MIT computer operating system Compatible Time Sharing System CTSS br In a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of the File published in Stewart Brand s CoEvolution Quarterly issue pages with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy Steele including a couple of Steele s Crunchly cartoons This appears to have been the File s first paper publication br A late version of Jargon expanded with commentary for the mass market was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in as The Hacker s Dictionary Harper Row CN ISBN It included all of Steele s Crunchly cartoons The other Jargon editors Raphael Finkel Don Woods and Mark Crispin contributed to this revision as did Stallman and Geoff Goodfellow This book now out of print is hereafter referred to as Steele and those six as the Steele coauthors br br br to br Shortly after the publication of Steele the File effectively stopped growing and changing Originally this was due to a desire to freeze the file temporarily to ease the production of Steele but external conditions caused the temporary freeze to become permanent br The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late s by funding cuts and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor supported hardware and associated proprietary software instead of homebrew whenever possible At MIT most AI work had turned to dedicated Lisp machines At the same time the commercialization of AI technology lured some of the AI Lab s best and brightest away to startups along the Route strip in Massachusetts and out west in Silicon Valley The startups built Lisp machines for MIT the central MIT AI computer became a TWENEX system rather than a host for the AI hackers ITS br The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by although the SAIL computer continued as a computer science department resource until Stanford became a major TWENEX site at one point operating more than a dozen TOPS systems but by the mid s most of the interesting software work was being done on the emerging BSD Unix standard br In May the PDP centered cultures that had nourished the File were dealt a death blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter project at DEC The File s compilers already dispersed moved on to other things Steele was partly a monument to what its authors thought was a dying tradition no one involved realized at the time just how wide its influence was to be br As mentioned in some editions br br By the mid s the File s content was dated but the legend that had grown up around it never quite died out The book and softcopies obtained off the ARPANET circulated even in cultures far removed from MIT s the content exerted a strong and continuing influence on hackish slang and humor Even as the advent of the microcomputer and other trends fueled a tremendous expansion of hackerdom the File and related materials like the AI Koans in Appendix A came to be seen as a sort of sacred epic a hacker culture Matter of Britain chronicling the heroic exploits of the Knights of the Lab The pace of change in hackerdom at large accelerated tremendously but the Jargon File passed from living document to icon and remained essentially untouched for seven years br br br and later br A new revision was begun in which contained nearly the entire text of a late version of Jargon a few obsolete PDP related entries were dropped after consultation with the editors of Steele It merged in about of the Steele text omitting some framing material and a very few entries introduced in Steele that are now only of historical interest br The new version cast a wider net than the old Jargon File its aim was to cover not just AI or PDP hacker culture but all of the technical computing cultures in which the true hacker nature is manifested More than half of the entries derived from Usenet and represented jargon then current in the C and Unix communities but special efforts were made to collect jargon from other cultures including IBM PC programmers Amiga fans Mac enthusiasts and even the IBM mainframe world br Eric Raymond maintained the new File with assistance from Guy Steele and is the credited editor of the print version of it The New Hacker s Dictionary published by MIT Press in hereafter Raymond Some of the changes made under his watch were controversial early critics accused Raymond of unfairly changing the file s focus to the Unix hacker culture instead of the older hacker cultures where the Jargon File originated Raymond has responded by saying that the nature of hacking had changed and the Jargon File should report on hacker culture and not attempt to enshrine it After the second edition of NHD MIT Press hereafter Raymond Raymond was accused of adding terms reflecting his own politics and vocabulary even though he says that entries to be added are checked to make sure that they are in live use not just the private coinage of one or two people br The Raymond version was revised again to include terminology from the nascent subculture of the public Internet and the World Wide Web and published by MIT Press as The New Hacker s Dictionary Third Edition in br As of January no updates have been made to the official Jargon File since A volunteer editor produced two updates reflecting later influences mostly excoriated from text messaging language LOLspeak and Internet slang in general the last was produced in January br br br Impact and reception br br br Influence br Despite its tongue in cheek approach multiple other style guides and similar works have cited The New Hacker s Dictionary as a reference and even recommended following some of its hackish best practices The Oxford English Dictionary has used the NHD as a source for computer related neologisms The Chicago Manual of Style the leading American academic and book publishing style guide beginning with its th edition explicitly defers for computer writing to the quotation punctuation style logical quotation recommended by the essay Hacker Writing Style in The New Hacker s Dictionary and cites NHD for nothing else The th edition and the current issue as of does likewise The National Geographic Style Manual lists NHD among only specialized dictionaries out of total sources on which it is based That manual is the house style of NGS publications and has been available online for public browsing since The NGSM does not specify what in particular it drew from the NHD or any other source br Aside from these guides and the Encyclopedia of New Media the Jargon file especially in print form is frequently cited for both its definitions and its essays by books and other works on hacker history cyberpunk subculture computer jargon and online style and the rise of the Internet as a public medium in works as diverse as the th edition of A Bibliography of Literary Theory Criticism and Philology edited by Jos ngel Garc a Landa Wired Style Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age by Constance Hale and Jessie Scanlon of Wired magazine Transhumanism The History of a Dangerous Idea by David Livingstone Mark Dery s Flame Wars The Discourse of Cyberculture and Escape Velocity Cyberculture at the End of the Century Beyond Cyberpunk A Do it yourself Guide to the Future by Gareth Branwyn and Peter Sugarman and numerous others br Time magazine used The New Hacker s Dictionary Raymond as the basis for an article about online culture in the November inaugural edition of the Time Digital department NHD was cited by name on the front page of The Wall Street Journal Upon the release of the second edition Newsweek used it as a primary source and quoted entries in a sidebar for a major article on the Internet and its history The MTV show This Week in Rock used excerpts from the Jargon File in its CyberStuff segments Computing Reviews used one of the Jargon File s definitions on its December cover br On October The New Hacker s Dictionary was used in a legal case SCO Group cited the edition definition of FUD fear uncertainty and doubt which dwelt on questionable IBM business practices in a legal filing in the civil lawsuit SCO Group Inc v International Business Machines Corp In response Raymond added SCO to the entry in a revised copy of the Jargon File feeling that SCO s own practices deserved similar criticism br br br Defense of the term hacker br The book is particularly noted for helping or at least trying to preserve the distinction between a hacker a consummate programmer and a cracker a computer criminal even though not reviewing the book in detail both the London Review of Books and MIT Technology Review remarked on it in this regard In a substantial entry on the work the Encyclopedia of New Media by Steve Jones observed that this defense of the term hacker was a motivating factor for both Steele s and Raymond s print editions br br The Hacker s Dictionary and The New Hacker s Dictionary sought to celebrate hacker culture provide a repository of hacking history for younger and future hackers and perhaps most importantly to represent hacker culture in a positive light to the general public In the early s in particular many news stories emerged portraying hackers as law breakers with no respect for the personal privacy or property of others Raymond wanted to show some of the positive values of hacker culture particularly the hacker sense of humor Because love of humorous wordplay is a strong element of hacker culture a slang dictionary works quite well for such purposes br br br Reviews and reactions br PC Magazine in stated that The Hacker s Dictionary was superior to most other computer humor books and noted its authenticity to hard core programmers conversations especially slang from MIT and Stanford Reviews quoted by the publisher include William Safire of The New York Times referring to the Raymond NHD as a sprightly lexicon and recommending it as a nerdy gift that holiday season this reappeared in his On Language column again in mid October Hugh Kenner in Byte suggesting that it was so engaging that one s reading of it should be severely timed if you hope to get any work done and Mondo describing it as slippery elastic fun with language as well as not only a useful guidebook to very much un official technical terms and street tech slang but also a de facto ethnography of the early years of the hacker culture Positive reviews were also published in academic as well as computer industry publications including IEEE Spectrum New Scientist PC Magazine PC World Science and repeatedly Wired br US game designer Steve Jackson writing for Boing Boing magazine in its pre blog print days described NHD s essay A Portrait of J Random Hacker as a wonderfully accurate pseudo demographic description of the people who make up the hacker culture He was nevertheless critical of Raymond s tendency to editorialize even flame and of the Steele cartoons which Jackson described as sophomoric and embarrassingly out of place beside the dry and sophisticated humor of the text He wound down his review with some rhetorical questions br br W here else will you find for instance that one attoparsec per microfortnight is approximately equal to one inch per second Or an example of the canonical use of canonical Or a definition like A cuspy but bogus raving story about N random broken people br The third print edition garnered additional coverage in the usual places like Wired August and even in mainstream venues including People magazine October br br br br br br Further
