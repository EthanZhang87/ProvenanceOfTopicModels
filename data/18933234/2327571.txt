Advantage line which features recessed keys in two bucket like hollows to allow the user s fingers to reach keys with less effort Moreover the keys are laid out in perfect vertical rows to avoid the need for lateral movements during typing In addition the modifiers such as enter alt backspace control etc are moved to a central location so they can be pressed with the stronger thumbs rather than
