Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet editor developed by Microsoft for Windows macOS Android iOS and iPadOS It features calculation or computation capabilities graphing tools pivot tables and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications VBA Excel forms part of the Microsoft suite of software br br br Features br br br Basic operation br br Microsoft Excel has the basic features of all spreadsheets using a grid of cells arranged in numbered rows and letter named columns to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations It has a battery of supplied functions to answer statistical engineering and financial needs In addition it can display data as line graphs histograms and charts and with a very limited three dimensional graphical display It allows sectioning of data to view its dependencies on various factors for different perspectives using pivot tables and the scenario manager A PivotTable is a tool for data analysis It does this by simplifying large data sets via PivotTable fields It has a programming aspect Visual Basic for Applications allowing the user to employ a wide variety of numerical methods for example for solving differential equations of mathematical physics and then reporting the results back to the spreadsheet It also has a variety of interactive features allowing user interfaces that can completely hide the spreadsheet from the user so the spreadsheet presents itself as a so called application or decision support system DSS via a custom designed user interface for example a stock analyzer or in general as a design tool that asks the user questions and provides answers and reports In a more elaborate realization an Excel application can automatically poll external databases and measuring instruments using an update schedule analyze the results make a Word report or PowerPoint slide show and e mail these presentations on a regular basis to a list of participants Excel was not designed to be used as a database br Microsoft allows for a number of optional command line switches to control the manner in which Excel starts br br br Functions br br Excel has functions Of these existed prior to Excel Microsoft classifies these functions into categories Of the current functions may be called from VBA as methods of the object WorksheetFunction and have the same names as VBA functions br With the introduction of LAMBDA Excel became Turing complete br br br Macro programming br br br VBA programming br br The Windows version of Excel supports programming through Microsoft s Visual Basic for Applications VBA which is a dialect of Visual Basic Programming with VBA allows spreadsheet manipulation that is awkward or impossible with standard spreadsheet techniques Programmers may write code directly using the Visual Basic Editor VBE which includes a window for writing code debugging code and code module organization environment The user can implement numerical methods as well as automating tasks such as formatting or data organization in VBA and guide the calculation using any desired intermediate results reported back to the spreadsheet br VBA was removed from Mac Excel as the developers did not believe that a timely release would allow porting the VBA engine natively to Mac OS X VBA was restored in the next version Mac Excel although the build lacks support for ActiveX objects impacting some high level developer tools br A common and easy way to generate VBA code is by using the Macro Recorder The Macro Recorder records actions of the user and generates VBA code in the form of a macro These actions can then be repeated automatically by running the macro The macros can also be linked to different trigger types like keyboard shortcuts a command button or a graphic The actions in the macro can be executed from these trigger types or from the generic toolbar options The VBA code of the macro can also be edited in the VBE Certain features such as loop functions and screen prompt by their own properties and some graphical display items cannot be recorded but must be entered into the VBA module directly by the programmer Advanced users can employ user prompts to create an interactive program or react to events such as sheets being loaded or changed br Macro Recorded code may not be compatible with Excel versions Some code that is used in Excel cannot be used in Excel Making a Macro that changes the cell colors and making changes to other aspects of cells may not be backward compatible br VBA code interacts with the spreadsheet through the Excel Object Model a vocabulary identifying spreadsheet objects and a set of supplied functions or methods that enable reading and writing to the spreadsheet and interaction with its users for example through custom toolbars or command bars and message boxes User created VBA subroutines execute these actions and operate like macros generated using the macro recorder but are more flexible and efficient br br br History br From its first version Excel supported end user programming of macros automation of repetitive tasks and user defined functions extension of Excel s built in function library In early versions of Excel these programs were written in a macro language whose statements had formula syntax and resided in the cells of special purpose macro sheets stored with file extension XLM in Windows XLM was the default macro language for Excel through Excel Beginning with version Excel recorded macros in VBA by default but with version XLM recording was still allowed as an option After version that option was discontinued All versions of Excel including Excel are capable of running an XLM macro though Microsoft discourages their use br br br Python programming br In Microsoft announced Excel would support the Python programming language directly As of January Python in Excel is available in the Microsoft Insider Program br br br Charts br br Excel supports charts graphs or histograms generated from specified groups of cells It also supports Pivot Charts that allow for a chart to be linked directly to a Pivot table This allows the chart to be refreshed with the Pivot Table The generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet or added as a separate object br These displays are dynamically updated if the content of cells changes For example suppose that the important design requirements are displayed visually then in response to a user s change in trial values for parameters the curves describing the design change shape and their points of intersection shift assisting the selection of the best design br br br Add ins br Additional features are available using add ins Several are provided with Excel including br br Analysis ToolPak Provides data analysis tools for statistical and engineering analysis includes analysis of variance and regression analysis br Analysis ToolPak VBA VBA functions for Analysis ToolPak br Euro Currency Tools Conversion and formatting for euro currency br Solver Add In Tools for optimization and equation solving br br br Data storage and communication br br br Number of rows and columns br Versions of Excel up to had a limitation in the size of their data sets of K rows Versions through could handle K rows and columns as label IV Version onwards including the current Version x can handle over M rows and labeled as column XFD columns br br br File formats br br Up until the version Microsoft Excel used a proprietary binary file format called Excel Binary File Format XLS as its primary format Excel uses Office Open XML as its primary file format an XML based format that followed after a previous XML based format called XML Spreadsheet XMLSS first introduced in Excel br Although supporting and encouraging the use of new XML based formats as replacements Excel remained backwards compatible with the traditional binary formats In addition most versions of Microsoft Excel can read CSV DBF SYLK DIF and other legacy formats Support for some older file formats was removed in Excel The file formats were mainly from DOS based programs br br br Binary br OpenOffice org has created documentation of the Excel format Two epochs of the format exist the OLE format and the older stream format Microsoft has made the Excel binary format specification available to freely download br br br XML Spreadsheet br br The XML Spreadsheet format introduced in Excel is a simple XML based format missing some more advanced features like storage of VBA macros Though the intended file extension for this format is xml the program also correctly handles XML files with xls extension This feature is widely used by third party applications e g MySQL Query Browser to offer export to Excel capabilities without implementing binary file format The following example will be correctly opened by Excel if saved either as Book xml or Book xls br br br Current file extensions br br Microsoft Excel along with the other products in the Microsoft Office suite introduced new file formats The first of these xlsx is defined in the Office Open XML OOXML specification br br br Old file extensions br br br Using other Windows applications br Windows applications such as Microsoft Access and Microsoft Word as well as Excel can communicate with each other and use each other s capabilities The most common is Dynamic Data Exchange although strongly deprecated by Microsoft this is a common method to send data between applications running on Windows with official MS publications referring to it as the protocol from hell As the name suggests it allows applications to supply data to others for calculation and display It is very common in financial markets being used to connect to important financial data services such as Bloomberg and Reuters br OLE Object Linking and Embedding allows a Windows application to control another to enable it to format or calculate data This may take on the form of embedding where an application uses another to handle a task that it is more suited to for example a PowerPoint presentation may be embedded in an Excel spreadsheet or vice versa br br br Using external data br Excel users can access external data sources via Microsoft Office features such as for example odc connections built with the Office Data Connection file format Excel files themselves may be updated using a Microsoft supplied ODBC driver br Excel can accept data in real time through several programming interfaces which allow it to communicate with many data sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters through addins such as Power Plus Pro br br DDE Dynamic Data Exchange uses the message passing mechanism in Windows to allow data to flow between Excel and other applications Although it is easy for users to create such links programming such links reliably is so difficult that Microsoft the creators of the system officially refer to it as the protocol from hell In spite of its many issues DDE remains the most common way for data to reach traders in financial markets br Network DDE Extended the protocol to allow spreadsheets on different computers to exchange data Starting with Windows Vista Microsoft no longer supports the facility br Real Time Data RTD although in many ways technically superior to DDE has been slow to gain acceptance since it requires non trivial programming skills and when first released was neither adequately documented nor supported by the major data vendors br Alternatively Microsoft Query provides ODBC based browsing within Microsoft Excel br br br Export and migration of spreadsheets br Programmers have produced APIs to open Excel spreadsheets in a variety of applications and environments other than Microsoft Excel These include opening Excel documents on the web using either ActiveX controls or plugins like the Adobe Flash Player The Apache POI opensource project provides Java libraries for reading and writing Excel spreadsheet files br br br Password protection br br Microsoft Excel protection offers several types of passwords br br Password to open a document br Password to modify a document br Password to unprotect the worksheet br Password to protect workbook br Password to protect the sharing workbook br All passwords except password to open a document can be removed instantly regardless of the Microsoft Excel version used to create the document These types of passwords are used primarily for shared work on a document Such password protected documents are not encrypted and data sources from a set password are saved in a document s header Password to protect workbook is an exception when it is set a document is encrypted with the standard password VelvetSweatshop but since it is known to the public it actually does not add any extra protection to the document The only type of password that can prevent a trespasser from gaining access to a document is the password to open a document The cryptographic strength of this kind of protection depends strongly on the Microsoft Excel version that was used to create the document br In Microsoft Excel and earlier versions the password to open is converted to a bit key that can be instantly cracked In Excel the password is converted to a bit key which can also be cracked very quickly using modern equipment As regards services that use rainbow tables e g Password Find it takes up to several seconds to remove protection In addition password cracking programs can brute force attack passwords at a rate of hundreds of thousands of passwords a second which not only lets them decrypt a document but also find the original password br In Excel XP the encryption is slightly better a user can choose any encryption algorithm that is available in the system see Cryptographic Service Provider Due to the CSP an Excel file cannot be decrypted and thus the password to open cannot be removed though the brute force attack speed remains quite high Nevertheless the older Excel algorithm is set by the default Therefore users who do not change the default settings lack reliable protection of their documents br The situation changed fundamentally in Excel where the modern AES algorithm with a key of bits started being used for decryption and a fold use of the hash function SHA reduced the speed of brute force attacks down to hundreds of passwords per second In Excel the strength of the protection by the default was increased two times due to the use of a fold SHA to convert a password to a key br br br Other platforms br br br Excel for mobile br Excel Mobile is a spreadsheet program that can edit XLSX files It can edit and format text in cells calculate formulas search within the spreadsheet sort rows and columns freeze panes filter the columns add comments and create charts It cannot add columns or rows except at the edge of the document rearrange columns or rows delete rows or columns or add spreadsheet tabs The version has the ability to use a full screen mode to deal with limited screen resolution as well as split panes to view different parts of a worksheet at one time Protection settings zoom settings autofilter settings certain chart formatting hidden sheets and other features are not supported on Excel Mobile and will be modified upon opening and saving a workbook In Excel Mobile became available for Windows and Windows Mobile on Windows Store br br br Excel for the web br br Excel for the web is a free lightweight version of Microsoft Excel available as part of Office on the web which also includes web versions of Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint br Excel for the web can display most of the features available in the desktop versions of Excel although it may not be able to insert or edit them Certain data connections are not accessible on Excel for the web including with charts that may use these external connections Excel for the web also cannot display legacy features such as Excel macros or Excel dialog sheets There are also small differences between how some of the Excel functions work br br br Microsoft Excel Viewer br Microsoft Excel Viewer was a freeware program for Microsoft Windows for viewing and printing spreadsheet documents created by Excel Microsoft retired the viewer in April with the last security update released in February for Excel Viewer SP br The first version released by Microsoft was Excel Viewer Excel Viewer was supported in Windows CE for Handheld PCs In October Microsoft released Excel Viewer In September Microsoft released Excel Viewer Service Pack SP In January Microsoft released Excel Viewer featuring a non collapsible Ribbon interface In April Microsoft released Excel Viewer Service Pack SP In October Microsoft released Excel Viewer Service Pack SP br Microsoft advises to view and print Excel files for free to use the Excel Mobile application for Windows and for Windows and Windows to upload the file to OneDrive and use Excel for the web with a Microsoft account to open them in a browser br br br Quirks br In addition to issues with spreadsheets in general other problems specific to Excel include numeric precision misleading statistics functions mod function errors date limitations and more br br br Numeric precision br br Despite the use of figure precision Excel can display many more figures up to thirty upon user request But the displayed figures are not those actually used in its computations and so for example the difference of two numbers may differ from the difference of their displayed values Although such departures are usually beyond the th decimal exceptions do occur especially for very large or very small numbers Serious errors can occur if decisions are made based upon automated comparisons of numbers for example using the Excel If function as equality of two numbers can be unpredictable br In the figure the fraction is displayed in Excel Although this number has a decimal representation that is an infinite string of ones Excel displays only the leading figures In the second line the number one is added to the fraction and again Excel displays only figures In the third line one is subtracted from the sum using Excel Because the sum in the second line has only eleven s after the decimal the difference when is subtracted from this displayed value is three s followed by a string of eleven s However the difference reported by Excel in the third line is three s followed by a string of thirteen s and two extra erroneous digits This is because Excel calculates with about half a digit more than it displays br Excel works with a modified version of the IEEE specification Excel s implementation involves conversions between binary and decimal representations leading to accuracy that is on average better than one would expect from simple fifteen digit precision but that can be worse See the main article for details br Besides accuracy in user computations the question of accuracy in Excel provided functions may be raised Particularly in the arena of statistical functions Excel has been criticized for sacrificing accuracy for speed of calculation br As many calculations in Excel are executed using VBA an additional issue is the accuracy of VBA which varies with variable type and user requested precision br br br Statistical functions br The accuracy and convenience of statistical tools in Excel has been criticized as mishandling situations when data is missing as returning incorrect values due to inept handling of round off and large numbers as only selectively updating calculations on a spreadsheet when some cell values are changed and as having a limited set of statistical tools Microsoft has announced that some of these issues are addressed in Excel br br br Excel MOD function error br Excel has issues with modulo operations In the case of excessively large results Excel will return the error warning NUM instead of an answer br br br Fictional leap day in the year br Excel includes February incorrectly treating as a leap year even though e g is correctly treated as a non leap year The bug originated from Lotus deliberately implemented to save computer memory and was also purposely implemented in Excel for the purpose of bug compatibility This legacy has later been carried over into Office Open XML file format br Thus a not necessarily whole number greater than or equal to interpreted as a date and time are the real number of days after December a non negative number less than is the number of days after December and numbers with whole part represent the fictional day br br br Date range br Excel supports dates with years in the range except that December can be entered as and is displayed as jan br Converting a fraction of a day into hours minutes and days by treating it as a moment on the day January does not work for a negative fraction br br br Conversion problems br If text is entered that happens to be in a form that Excel interprets as a date the text can be unintentionally changed to a standard date format A similar problem occurs when a text happens to be in the form of a floating point notation of a number In these cases the original exact text cannot be recovered from the result Formatting the cell as TEXT before entering ambiguous text prevents Excel from converting it br This issue has caused a well known problem in the analysis of DNA for example in bioinformatics As first reported in genetic scientists found that Excel automatically and incorrectly converts certain gene names into dates A follow up study in found many peer reviewed scientific journal papers had been affected and that Of the selected journals the proportion of published articles with Excel files containing gene lists that are affected by gene name errors is Excel parses the copied and pasted data and sometimes changes them depending on what it thinks they are For example MARCH Membrane Associated Ring CH type finger gets converted to the date March Mar and SEPT Septin is converted into September Sep etc While some secondary news sources reported this as a fault with Excel the original authors of the paper placed the blame with the researchers misusing Excel br In August the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee HGNC published new guidelines in the journal Nature regarding gene naming in order to avoid issues with symbols that affect data handling and retrieval So far genes have been renamed including changing MARCH to MARCHF and SEPT to SEPTIN in order to avoid accidental conversion of the gene names into dates br In October Microsoft fixed the long standing issue br br br Errors with large strings br The following functions return incorrect results when passed a string longer than characters br br type incorrectly returns meaning Error value br IsText when called as a method of the VBA object WorksheetFunction i e WorksheetFunction IsText in VBA incorrectly returns false br br br Filenames br Microsoft Excel will not open two documents with the same name and instead will display the following error br br A document with the name s is already open You cannot open two documents with the same name even if the documents are in different folders To open the second document either close the document that is currently open or rename one of the documents br The reason is for calculation ambiguity with linked cells If there is a cell Book xlsx Sheet G and there are two books named Book open there is no way to tell which one the user means br br br Versions br br br Early history br Microsoft originally marketed a spreadsheet program called Multiplan in Multiplan became very popular on CP M systems but on MS DOS systems it lost popularity to Lotus Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Macintosh on September and the first Windows version was to synchronize with the Macintosh version on November Lotus was slow to bring to Windows and by the early s Excel had started to outsell and helped Microsoft achieve its position as a leading PC software developer This accomplishment solidified Microsoft as a valid competitor and showed its future in developing GUI software Microsoft maintained its advantage with regular new releases every two years or so br br br Microsoft Windows br Excel is the first version of Excel for the Intel platform Versions prior to were only available on the Apple Macintosh br br br Excel br The first Windows version was labeled to correspond to the Mac version It was announced on October and released on November This included a run time version of Windows br BYTE in listed Excel for Windows as among the Distinction winners of the BYTE Awards The magazine stated that the port of the extraordinary Macintosh version shines with a user interface as good as or better than the original br br br Excel br Included toolbars drawing capabilities outlining add in support D charts and many more new features br br br Excel br Introduced auto fill br Also an easter egg in Excel reveals a hidden animation of a dancing set of numbers through representing Lotus which is then crushed by an Excel logo br br br Excel br With version Excel included Visual Basic for Applications VBA a programming language based on Visual Basic which adds the ability to automate tasks in Excel and to provide user defined functions UDF for use in worksheets VBA includes a fully featured integrated development environment IDE Macro recording can produce VBA code replicating user actions thus allowing simple automation of regular tasks VBA allows the creation of forms and in worksheet controls to communicate with the user The language supports use but not creation of ActiveX COM DLL s later versions add support for class modules allowing the use of basic object oriented programming techniques br The automation functionality provided by VBA made Excel a target for macro viruses This caused serious problems until antivirus products began to detect these viruses Microsoft belatedly took steps to prevent the misuse by adding the ability to disable macros completely to enable macros when opening a workbook or to trust all macros signed using a trusted certificate br Versions to of Excel contain various Easter eggs including a Hall of Tortured Souls a Doom like minigame although since version Microsoft has taken measures to eliminate such undocumented features from their products br was released in a bit x version for Windows and later in a bit version for NT x Alpha PowerPC br br br Excel v br br Released in with Microsoft Office for Windows this is the first major version after Excel as there is no Excel with all of the Office applications standardizing on the same major version number br Internal rewrite to bits Almost no external changes but faster and more stable br Excel contained a hidden Doom like mini game called The Hall of Tortured Souls a series of rooms featuring the names and faces of the developers as an Easter egg br br br Excel v br Included in Office for x and Alpha This was a major upgrade that introduced the paper clip office assistant and featured standard VBA used instead of internal Excel Basic It introduced the now removed Natural Language labels br This version of Excel includes a flight simulator as an Easter egg br br br Excel v br br Included in Office This was a minor upgrade but introduced an upgrade to the clipboard where it can hold multiple objects at once The Office Assistant whose frequent unsolicited appearance in Excel had annoyed many users became less intrusive br A small D game called Dev Hunter inspired by Spy Hunter was included as an Easter egg br br br Excel v br Included in Office XP Very minor enhancements br br br Excel v br Included in Office Minor enhancements br br br Excel v br br Included in Office This release was a major upgrade from the previous version Similar to other updated Office products Excel in used the new Ribbon menu system This was different from what users were used to and was met with mixed reactions One study reported fairly good acceptance by users except for highly experienced users and users of word processing applications with a classical WIMP interface but was less convinced in terms of efficiency and organization However an online survey reported that a majority of respondents had a negative opinion of the change with advanced users being somewhat more negative than intermediate users and users reporting a self estimated reduction in productivity br Added functionality included Tables and the SmartArt set of editable business diagrams Also added was an improved management of named variables through the Name Manager and much improved flexibility in formatting graphs which allow x y coordinate labeling and lines of arbitrary weight Several improvements to pivot tables were introduced br Also like other office products the Office Open XML file formats were introduced including xlsm for a workbook with macros and xlsx for a workbook without macros br Specifically many of the size limitations of previous versions were greatly increased To illustrate the number of rows was now and the columns was the far right column is XFD This changes what is a valid A reference versus a named range This version made more extensive use of multiple cores for the calculation of spreadsheets however VBA macros are not handled in parallel and XLL add ins were only executed in parallel if they were thread safe and this was indicated at registration br br br Excel v br br Included in Office this is the next major version after v as version number was skipped br Minor enhancements and bit support including the following br br Multi threading recalculation MTR for commonly used functions br Improved pivot tables br More conditional formatting options br Additional image editing capabilities br In cell charts called sparklines br Ability to preview before pasting br Office backstage feature for document related tasks br Ability to customize the Ribbon

releases Office or Excel in discrete versions Instead features are introduced automatically over time using Windows Update The version number remains Thereafter only the approximate dates when features appear can now be given br br Dynamic Arrays These are essentially Array Formulas but they Spill automatically into neighboring cells and do not need the ctrl shift enter to create them Further dynamic arrays are the default format with new and operators to provide compatibility with previous versions This is perhaps the biggest structural change since and is in response to a similar feature in Google Sheets Dynamic arrays started appearing in pre releases about and as of March are available in published versions of Office provided a user selected Office Insiders br br br Apple

harmonizing many of the reporting and high level developer functions while bringing the ribbon and styling into line with its PC counterpart br br br OS br Excel br Excel br Excel br br br Summary br br br Impact br Excel offers many user interface tweaks over the earliest electronic spreadsheets however the essence remains the same as in the original spreadsheet software VisiCalc the program displays cells organized in rows and columns and each cell may contain data or a formula with relative or absolute references to other cells br Excel for Windows which was modeled after its Mac GUI based counterpart indirectly expanded the installed base of the then nascent Windows environment Excel was released a month before Windows and the installed base of Windows was so low at that point in that Microsoft had to bundle a runtime version of Windows with Excel Unlike Microsoft Word there never was a DOS version of Excel br Excel became the first spreadsheet to allow the user to define the appearance of spreadsheets fonts character attributes and cell appearance It also introduced intelligent cell re computation where only cells dependent on the cell being modified are updated previous spreadsheet programs recomputed everything all the time or waited for a specific user command Excel introduced auto fill the ability to drag and expand the selection box to automatically copy a cell or row contents to adjacent cells or rows adjusting the copies intelligently by automatically incrementing cell references or contents Excel also introduced extensive graphing capabilities br br br Security br Because Excel is widely used it has been attacked by hackers While Excel is not directly exposed to the Internet if an attacker can get a victim to open a file in Excel and there is an appropriate security bug in Excel then the attacker can gain control of the victim s computer UK s GCHQ has a tool named TORNADO ALLEY with this purpose br br br Games br Besides the easter eggs numerous games have been created or recreated in Excel such as Tetris Scrabble Yahtzee Angry Birds Pac Man Civilization Monopoly Battleship Blackjack Space Invaders and others br In Excel became an
