Defective by Design DBD is a grassroots anti digital rights management DRM initiative by the Free Software Foundation FSF and CivicActions Launched in DBD believes that DRM which they call digital restrictions management makes technology deliberately defective negatively affects digital freedoms and is a threat to innovation in media the privacy of readers and freedom for computer users The initiative regularly campaigns against the use of DRM by the media industry and software industry to increase awareness of the anti DRM movement and pressure industries into no longer using DRM They are known for their use of hazmat suits in their demonstrations br DBD represents one of the first efforts of the FSF to find common cause with mainstream social activists and encourage free software advocates to become socially involved As of late the campaign was claiming over registered members br br br Position br According to their website DBD believes that DRM is used to control how consumers use the technology they are meant to own as well as who can produce and distribute media which the DBD equates to book burning while conducting mass surveillance of media consumption habits They argue that DRM is designed to take away every possible use of digital media regardless of legal rights and sell some of these functionalities back as severely limited services br DBD argues that DRM does not help but rather hurts authors publishers studios labels and similar media producers and suppliers especially those in independent media by forcing them to work with distribution services that are difficult to switch away from They also argue that DRM is not meant to prevent copyright infringement as claimed by proponents and is in fact completely separate from copyright as if DRM really was used for those purposes every distribution method for that particular piece of media would have to be distributed by an uncrackable DRM encumbered distribution platform which is impossible on its own br Rather DBD states DRM only helps technology companies and media conglomerates that profit from these by forcing producers and suppliers to remain working under them while also forcing users to continue using their services regardless of the associated hassles and costs such as having to maintain an internet connection with always on DRM or having to pay for otherwise basic features by enforcing significant negatives of attempting to switch to other services share media on DRM protected services or modify DRM protected technology DBD suggests that this way DRM is a form of monopolization DBD also argues that DRM allows these companies to micromanage media and control how they are distributed even to the point of arbitrarily making media unavailable or deleting digital copies of said media from those who own it br br br History br Defective By Design is a joint effort by the Free Software Foundation and CivicActions a company that develops online advocacy campaigns The chief organizers are Gregory Heller of CivicActions Peter T Brown executive director of the FSF and Henry Poole a CivicActions member who is also a director of the FSF br The campaign was launched in May with an anti DRM protest at WinHEC The protest featured FSF members in yellow hazmat suits handing out pamphlets explaining that Microsoft products are in the words of the key slogan for the campaign defective by design because of the DRM technologies included in them br Since then the campaign has launched a number of actions with varying degrees of success The campaign claims that its phone in campaign against the Recording Industry Association of America and related organizations around the world resulted in thousands of calls from people questioning the industry s position on DRM On the other hand efforts to meet with Bono of U a prominent supporter of Apple s DRM regulated iTunes have so far met with no success However four major record labels dropped their pending lawsuits and joined with Apple and Microsoft to eliminate DRM from music sales br DBD proclaimed October to be a Day Against DRM and organized several events outside key Apple stores in the US and the UK Hazmat suits were again worn by protesters and leaflets were handed out to the public explaining Apple s use of DRM in their iTunes music store and on their iPod media players br On January the campaign organized along with the BadVista campaign at the Times Square Protesters in hazmat suits then handed literature to attendants about the dangers of Windows Vista s DRM and Trusted Computing features as well as handing out CDs containing a free software replacement for Windows Vista br br br Campaigns br br br Tagging campaign br Since the Defective by Design site encourages users to use
