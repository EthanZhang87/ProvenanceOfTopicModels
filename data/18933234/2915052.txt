Richard P Gabriel born is an American computer scientist known for his work in computing related to the programming language Lisp and especially Common Lisp His best known work was a essay Lisp Good News Bad News How to Win Big which introduced the phrase Worse is Better and his set of benchmarks for Lisp termed Gabriel Benchmarks published in as Performance and evaluation of Lisp systems These became a standard way to benchmark Lisp implementations br br br Biography br He was born in in the town of Merrimac in northeastern Massachusetts to two dairy farmers He studied at Northeastern University Boston where he earned a B A in mathematics As of he resides in Redwood City California with his wife Jo He has a son named Joseph and a daughter named Mariko a Doctor of Physical Therapy in Los Altos California br br br Studying br Subsequently he pursued graduate studies in mathematics at MIT from to he was tapped by Patrick Winston to become a permanent member of the artificial intelligence AI Lab at MIT but funding difficulties made it impossible to retain him Gabriel tried to start up with Dave Waltz an AI Lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign but after two years the lab fell through due to general apathy During this time from to Gabriel managed to earn an MS in mathematics br Because of some of his mathematical work Gabriel was then admitted to Stanford University during that time he served as a teaching assistant to John McCarthy the founder of Lisp he ported Maclisp from its native operating system the Incompatible Timesharing System ITS to WAITS He earned a PhD in computer science on the topic of natural language generation and he and his wife Kathy had a son Around this time he became a spokesperson for the League for Programming Freedom br br br Postdoctoral work br After earning a PhD he continued to work on AI projects for McCarthy although his thesis advisor was Terry Winograd He eventually began working for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where he recruited several of the researchers and programmers for a company Lucid Incorporated he founded in and would leave in It survived until br Gabriel was at various times the President and Chairman of Lucid Inc The product the company shipped was a Lisp integrated development environment IDE for Sun Microsystems reduced instruction set computer RISC hardware architecture named SPARC This sidestepped the main failure of Lisp machines by in essence rewriting the Lisp machine IDE for use on a more cost effective and less moribund architecture During this time Gabriel married his second wife and had a daughter he later divorced his second wife in br Eventually Lucid s focus shifted during the AI Winter to an IDE for C A core component of the IDE was Richard Stallman s version of Emacs GNU Emacs GNU Emacs was not up to Lucid s needs however and several Lucid programmers were assigned to help develop GNU Emacs Friction arose between the programmers and Stallman over how to handle graphical user interface GUI issues and Lucid forked Emacs and thus became mainly responsible for the birth of what would come to be called XEmacs One of his hires was another notable programmer Jamie W Zawinski br br br Own business and open source software br After Gabriel left Lucid Inc for good he became a Vice President of Development for ParcPlace Systems and then a consultant for among others Aspen Smallworks before joining Sun Microsystems as a Distinguished Engineer There Gabriel was an influential contributor to the evolution of the open source software strategy culminating in publication of the book Innovation Happens Elsewhere In he joined IBM Research as a Distinguished Engineer br br br Association for Computing Machinery br Gabriel has received the Association for Computing Machinery s ACM Fellows Award and its ACM AAAI Allen Newell Award The citation reads For innovations in programming languages and software design and promoting the interaction between computer science and other disciplines notably architecture and poetry br He was chairman of the Object Oriented Programming Systems Languages Applications OOPSLA conference in br br br Poetry br In he received his MFA in Poetry from Warren Wilson College He has published poems in some literary journals His chapbook Drive On was published by Hollyridge Press in br br br Works br Gabriel Richard P May Performance and Evaluation of Lisp Systems PDF Cambridge Mass MIT Press Computer Systems Series ISBN LCCN br Gabriel Richard P Patterns of Software Tales from the Software Community PDF Oxford University Press ISBN br Gabriel Richard P Writers Workshops the Work of Making Things Patterns Poetry PDF Addison Wesley ISBN br Gabriel Richard P Drive On Hollyridge Press ISBN br br br br br br External links br Official website br The ACM Newell Award citation br Richard Gabriel interview on Lisp
