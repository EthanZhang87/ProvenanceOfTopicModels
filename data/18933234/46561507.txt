functionality br In the Stack Overflow Developer Survey Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool among respondents with reporting that they use it br br br History br Visual Studio Code was first announced on April by Microsoft at the Build conference A preview build was released shortly thereafter br On November the source code of Visual Studio Code was released under the MIT License and made available on GitHub Extension support was also announced On April Visual Studio Code graduated from the public preview stage and was released to the web Microsoft has released most of Visual Studio Code s source code on GitHub under the permissive MIT License while the editor itself is distributed by Microsoft as proprietary freeware br br br Features br Visual Studio Code is a source code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages including C C C Fortran Go Java JavaScript Node js Python Rust and Julia Visual Studio Code employs the same editor component codenamed Monaco used in Azure DevOps formerly called Visual Studio Online and Visual Studio Team Services br The downloadable version of Visual Studio Code is built on the Electron framework which is used to develop Node js web applications that run on the Blink layout engine Visual Studio Code for the Web is a browser based version of the editor that can be used to edit both local files and remote repositories on GitHub and Microsoft Azure without installing the full program It is officially supported and hosted by Microsoft and can be accessed at https vscode dev br Out of the box Visual Studio Code includes basic support for most common programming languages This basic support includes syntax highlighting bracket matching code folding and configurable snippets Visual Studio Code also ships with IntelliSense for JavaScript TypeScript JSON CSS and HTML as well as debugging support for Node js Support for additional languages can be provided by freely available extensions on the VS Code Marketplace br Instead of a project system it allows users to open one or more directories which can then be saved in workspaces for future reuse This allows it to operate as a language agnostic code editor for any language It supports many programming languages and a set of features that differs per language Unwanted files and folders can be excluded from the project tree via settings Many Visual Studio Code features are not exposed through menus or the user interface but can be accessed via the command palette The command palette is able to execute virtually every feature the graphical interface supports making it very keyboard accessible br Visual Studio Code can be extended via extensions available through a central repository This includes additions to the editor and language support A notable feature is the ability to create extensions that add support for new languages themes debuggers time travel debuggers perform static code analysis and add code linters using the Language Server Protocol br Source control is a built in feature of Visual Studio Code It has a dedicated tab inside of the menu bar where users can access version control settings and view changes made to the current project To use the feature Visual Studio Code must be linked to any supported version control system Git Apache Subversion Perforce etc This allows users to create repositories as well as to make push and pull requests directly from the Visual Studio Code program br Visual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve the product This telemetry feature can be disabled The information contained in this telemetry data can be inspected by the public since the product is open source br br br Insiders br br A nightly build called Visual Studio Code Insiders is also available Its configuration including any settings extensions themes are completely separate from the standard build This enables side by side installation of both builds without any interference br br br Reception br In the Developers Survey of Stack Overflow Visual Studio Code ranked No among the top popular development tools with only of the respondents using it Two years later however Visual Studio Code achieved the No spot with of the respondents using it In the Developers Survey Visual Studio Code was also ranked No with of

of the responses in the survey and of the responses in the survey br br br Relevant incidents br br br CEC IDE controversy br On June during the Guangdong Province s Digital Government Innovation Development Forum held in Guangzhou CEC IDE was released and described as the first Chinese produced integrated development tool However CEC IDE was subsequently found to be a rebranded release of Visual Studio Code that among other things failed to include a copy of the MIT license as required for redistributions On June Digital Guangdong published a statement admitting that CEC IDE is based on Visual Studio Code br br br See also br br Comparison of integrated development environments br GitHub Copilot br List of formerly proprietary software br Visual Studio br Eclipse Theia br br br
