Jamie Werner Zawinski born November commonly known as jwz is an American computer programmer blogger and impresario He is best known for his role in the creation of Netscape Navigator Netscape Mail Lucid Emacs Mozilla org and XScreenSaver He is also the proprietor of DNA Lounge a nightclub and live music venue in San Francisco br br br Biography br Zawinski s programming career began at age with Scott Fahlman s Spice Lisp project at Carnegie Mellon University He then worked at AI startup Expert Technologies Inc followed by Robert Wilensky and Peter Norvig s AI research group at UC Berkeley working on natural language processing br In he began working at Lucid Inc first working on Lucid Common Lisp and then on Lucid s Energize C IDE Lucid decided to use GNU Emacs as the text editor for their IDE due to its free license popularity and extensibility and Zawinski led that project As Zawinski and the other programmers made fundamental changes to GNU Emacs to add new functionality tensions over how to merge these patches into the main tree eventually led to the fork of the project into GNU Emacs and Lucid Emacs now XEmacs br In he released the first version of XScreenSaver a free and open source collection now containing more than br screensavers Initially released for Unix it now supports macOS iOS and Android as well On Unix systems it also provides the framework for blanking and locking the screen He still maintains it with new releases coming out several times a year br br br Netscape and Mozilla br Following Lucid s bankruptcy in Zawinski was one of the initial employees of Mosaic Communications later known as Netscape At Netscape he developed the Unix release of Netscape Navigator br and later Netscape Mail the first mail reader or Usenet reader to natively support HTML br Zawinski came up with the name Mozilla originally the internal code name of the web browser during a staff meeting as a reference to Godzilla and a portmanteau of Mosaic killer br An easter egg he coded in the Netscape browser became quite well known during the early days of the World Wide Web typing about jwz into the address box would take the user to his home page and would change the browser s logo animation to a fire breathing dragon br Through his long time support and advocacy for free software both inside and outside the company Zawinski is credited with having been the inspiration for Netscape s decision to open source the source code of the browser in br He was a founder of Mozilla org personally registering its domain name on the day of Netscape s open source announcement and helping design and run the organization through its first year br When Netscape was acquired by AOL in he wrote a bulletin explaining that Mozilla s work would continue with or without Netscape And a year after the initial source code release he resigned from Netscape and Mozilla citing his disappointment that others involved in the project had decided to rewrite the code instead of incrementally improving it br br br DNA Lounge br Shortly after leaving Mozilla he announced his purchase of DNA Lounge a nightclub in San Francisco Zawinski purchased the nightclub in for approximately million dollars and it was re opened in July a process which he documented extensively in a blog named DNA Sequencing br In he explored alternative funding ideas to keep the venue afloat during a downturn in attendance br br br Interviews and appearances br In Zawinski starred in the minute long PBS documentary Code Rush which chronicles the creation of Mozilla org and the release of the browser source code over the course of br Zawinski features extensively in Josh Quittner s book Speeding the Net The Inside Story of Netscape and How It Challenged Microsoft br and in Glyn Moody s book Rebel Code Linux and the Open Source Revolution br There is a chapter on Zawinski in Peter Seibel s book Coders at Work Reflections on the Craft of Programming br And in he was featured in California Dreamin The Gold Rush a documentary for German public television br br Zawinski appears in several video installations at the Computer History Museum s exhibit Revolution The First Years of Computing br He was also featured in Sleep Mode The Art of the Screensaver a gallery exhibition curated by Rafa l Rozendaal at Rotterdam s Het Nieuwe Instituut in br br br Zawinski s Law br br Zawinski s Law of Software Envelopment also known as Zawinski s Law states br br Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can br Some have interpreted this as commenting on the phenomenon of software bloating with popular features br br Zawinski himself has stated My point was not about copycats it was about platformization Apps that you live in all day have pressure to become everything and do everything An app for editing text becomes an IDE then an OS An app for displaying hypertext documents becomes a mail reader then an OS br br br Principles br Zawinski first attained prominence as a Lisp programmer but most of his larger projects are written in C Despite that he has long been critical of languages lacking memory safety and automatic memory management He has particularly proselytized against C In Peter Seibel s book Coders at Work Reflections on the Craft of Programming Zawinski calls C an abomination the PDP assembler that thinks it s an object system br Though he has written and published many utilities in Perl he is not without his criticisms characterizing Perl as combining all the worst aspects of C and Lisp a billion different sublanguages in one monolithic executable It combines the power of C with the readability of PostScript br He has criticized several language and library deficiencies he encountered while programming in Java specifically the overhead of certain fundamental classes but especially the marketing and politics behind it that led Sun to conflate the language the class library the virtual machine and the security model all under the same name Java to he says the detriment of them all Despite the positive aspects ultimately Zawinski returned to programming in C since it s still the only way to ship portable programs br br br br br br External links br Official website br Quotations related to Jamie Zawinski at Wikiquote
