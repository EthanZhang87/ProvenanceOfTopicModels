Stanford University has many centers and institutes dedicated to the study of various specific topics These centers and institutes may be within a department within a school but across departments an independent laboratory institute or center reporting directly to the dean of research and outside any school or semi independent of the university itself br br br Independent laboratories institutes and centers br These report directly to the vice provost and dean of research and are outside any school though any faculty involved in them must belong to a department in one of the schools These include Bio X and Spectrum in the area of Biological and Life Sciences Precourt Institute for Energy and Woods Institute for the Environment in the Environmental Sciences area the Center for Advanced

Stanford Lester D Les Earnest also previously of MIT served as executive officer self deprecatingly Chief Bureaucrat at SAIL from to During almost all of this period SAIL was housed in the D C Power building named not for Direct Current but rather for Donald Clinton Power who held the positions of president C E O and chairman of General Telephone Electronics Corporation later GTE Corporation between and GT E donated the unfinished building to Stanford University after abandoning plans to establish a research center there During this period SAIL was one of the leading centers for AI research and an early ARPANET site br br D C Power was on a hill overlooking Felt Lake in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains behind Stanford br It was about miles km from the main campus at Arastradero Road midway between Page Mill Road and Alpine Road br This area was and remains quite rural in nature Combined with the rather extreme s architecture of the place this remote setting led to a certain isolation Some people who worked there reported feeling as if they were already in the future The building was demolished in as of the site is home to Portola Pastures an equestrian center adjacent to the Arastradero Open Space Preserve br SAIL created the WAITS operating system on a computer called SAIL WAITS ran on various models of Digital Equipment Corporation PDP computers starting with the PDP then the KA and KL WAITS also ran on Foonly systems at CCRMA and LLL The SAIL system was shut down in br SAIL the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language was developed by Dan Swinehart and Bob Sproull of the Stanford AI Lab in br Alumni of the original SAIL played a major role in many Silicon Valley firms becoming founders of now large firms such as Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems as well as smaller companies such as Vicarm Inc acquired by Unimation Foonly Elxsi Imagen Xidex Valid Logic Systems and D E Shaw Co Research accomplishments at SAIL were many including in the fields of speech recognition and robotics Notable people that worked at the original SAIL include Raj Reddy Hans Moravec Alan Kay Victor Scheinman Larry Tesler Don Knuth and Edward Feigenbaum br br br Demise and rebirth br In SAIL s activities were merged into the university s Computer Science Department and it moved into Margaret Jacks Hall on the main Stanford campus br SAIL was reopened in now in the Gates Computer Science Building with Sebastian Thrun becoming its new director SAIL s st century mission is to change the way we understand the world its researchers contribute to fields such as bioinformatics cognition computational geometry computer vision decision theory distributed systems game theory general game playing image processing information retrieval knowledge systems
