The PDP short for Programmed Data Processor model is a computer developed by Digital Equipment Corporation DEC during and first delivered in the summer of It was an expansion of DEC s existing bit systems to use a bit data word which was at that time a common word size for large machines like IBM mainframes The system was constructed using the same germanium transistor based System Module layout as DEC s earlier machines like the PDP and PDP br The system was designed with real time computing use in mind not just batch processing as was typical for most mainframes This made it popular in university settings and its support for the Lisp language made it particularly useful in artificial intelligence labs like Project MAC at MIT It was also complex expensive and unreliable as a result of its use of so many early model transistors Only were sold at prices ranging from to br The lasting influence of the PDP was its re implementation using modern silicon transistors and the newer Flip Chip module packaging to produce the PDP The instruction sets of the two machines are almost identical The PDP was less expensive and more reliable and about were sold during its lifetime br br br History br DEC s first products were not computers but a series of plug in circuits known as Digital Laboratory Modules that performed digital logic Users could wire the modules together to perform specific tasks DEC soon introduced the PDP which was built out of large numbers of these modules now known as System Building Blocks or System Modules br The PDP used an bit word Word lengths in the early s were generally some multiple of six bits as the character codes of the era were bits long and it was also a useful size for storing binary coded decimal digits with an optional sign as commonly used on IBM machines of the era Large machines generally used a bit word length but there were many variations The PDP s bit length allowed the machine to be simpler and less expensive than these at US equivalent to in Proposals for a PDP and PDP were turned down and DEC s next machine the PDP was essentially a smaller and less expensive PDP that sold for roughly half the cost The PDP was built from the same components but used a bit word for even greater savings and sold for about US equivalent to in br The PDP was DEC s first big machine It used bit words in common with other large computers at the time from companies like IBM Honeywell and General Electric Unlike those machines the PDP was supplied with a timesharing system out of the box Timesharing had been available for other machines most famously the PDP at Project MAC but the PDP was the first such system to be supported by the manufacturer br Worldwide only PDP s were sold the smallest number of any DEC machine It was complex and expensive to build as well as difficult to install and get operational at the customer s site Additionally the sales force found the PDP to be a hard sell Nevertheless the company later considered the PDP to be a success br br Because the PDP was the first computer to offer elegant powerful capabilities at a low price a great many of the PDP s built found their way into university and scientific environments giving DEC a strong foothold in that market and providing both educated customer input for future models and a source of bright young future employees to assist in the hardware and software development for those future models br The sales were so slow that DEC eventually decided to abandon the system and announced that they would not build any more bit machines Fortunately this decision was reversed and a new bit system was designed using the new Flip Chip modules and much smaller system boards to improve density and reliability The resulting design was released in as the PDP DEC describes this machine as the successor to the PDP Although it was program compatible with the PDP it ran roughly twice as fast had both timesharing and batch processing features and offered a wide variety of expansions and input output options It was far more successful and eventually sold about machines br br br Description br br br Architecture br Addressing remained bit as in earlier DEC machines allowing for a kword main memory about MB in modern terms Memory was implemented using magnetic cores a typical system included words equivalent to kB on modern machines The use of a bit word allowed two bit addresses to be stored in a single memory location this made it suited to the storage of a cons a widely used structure in the Lisp language meaning the PDP could store a cons in a single word and read and write one in a single operation br The instruction set architecture could be categorized as one and a half address The opcode was stored in the most significant bits of the bit word using bits The next four bits indicate which of sixteen registers to apply the instruction to The last bits indicated an address Thus a typical instruction might be add the value in memory location to the value in register Thus the format contains one and a half addresses the half being the register br This left another five bits in the instruction word bits through Bit indicated the address was indirect instead of the value stored in address being added to the selected register the value in was interpreted as another address the value in that location used For instance if the value in is the resulting instruction would add the value in to register This sort of access pattern was common as it allowed tables to be scanned over using a single instruction and then changing the value in memory to point to another location The remaining four bits offered a similar functionality by selecting a second register as an index register allowing memory to be stepped through by changing the value in the register rather than in main memory which is generally faster br The registers in the PDP were simply the first memory locations of main memory Most if not all PDP systems were equipped with the optional Type Fast Memory which constructed these memory locations from discrete transistor flip flops These operated four times as fast as the core memory br br br Hardware br The PDP weighed about pounds kg pounds kg with Fast Memory br The PDP was infamous because of the board a large inches board which contained bit of arithmetic register AR memory buffer MB and multiplier quotient register MQ The CPU was built from such cards It had transistors a two sided PC etch two pin and two pin connectors two on each side of the module Because of all these connectors swapping this module was a major undertaking and the mechanical coupling made it highly likely that fixing one fault would cause another There was also a great fear of powering off a PDP since it would generally result in at least one board failing br The experience with the led the designers of the first models of PDP the KA and KI to use only small boards It was not until the KL that large boards were used again br br br Operating system br The PDP supported time sharing through the use of a status bit selecting between two operating modes Executive and User with access to input output I O etc being restricted in the latter and a single relocation protection register which allowed a user s address space to be limited to a set section of main memory a second relocation protection register for shareable high segments was added on the PDP The main operating system used on the machine was an early version of what later became TOPS and several sites made custom versions of the system which was available in source code form MIT s Incompatible Timesharing System ITS operating system also began on the PDP br Although it was possible to time share a PDP without a disk drive configuring it with four dual DECtape drives could effectively support about simultaneous users The same system with a single disk drive resulted in real time sharing and could easily handle users br br br Museum br Stanford s PDP was shown at DECUS in The machine was transferred to a DEC warehouse after that event There are no records of this machine being given to the Computer Museum which was not part of DEC in In the late s Compaq donated the contents of the DEC internal archives to The Computer Museum History Center The Fast Memory cabinet from the Stanford PDP was part of that donation There is no evidence that the modules sold at the Boston computer museum gift shop were from the Stanford PDP nor is there any evidence that the museum had ever had this
