Ignatius of Antioch Greek translit Ign tios Antiokhe as died c AD also known as Ignatius Theophorus Ign tios ho Theoph ros the God bearing was an early Christian writer and Patriarch of Antioch While en route to Rome where he met his martyrdom Ignatius wrote a series of letters This correspondence forms a central part of a later collection of works by the Apostolic Fathers He is considered one of the three most important of these together with Clement of Rome and Polycarp His letters also serve as an example of early Christian theology and address important topics including ecclesiology the sacraments and the role of bishops br br br Life br br Nothing is known of Ignatius life apart from the words of his letters and later traditions It is said Ignatius converted to Christianity at a young age Tradition identifies him and his friend Polycarp as disciples of John the Apostle Later Ignatius was chosen to serve as Bishop of Antioch the fourth century Church historian Eusebius writes that Ignatius succeeded Evodius Theodoret of Cyrrhus claimed that St Peter himself left directions that Ignatius be appointed to this episcopal see Ignatius was called Theophorus God Bearer A tradition arose that he was one of the children whom Jesus Christ took in his arms and blessed br br br Veneration br Ignatius feast day was kept in his own Antioch on October the day on which he is now celebrated in the Catholic Church and generally in western Christianity although from the th century until it was put at February in the General Roman Calendar br In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is observed on December The Synaxarium of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria places it on the th of the Coptic Month of Koiak which is also the th day of the fourth month of Tahisas in the Synaxarium of The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church corresponding in three years out of every four to December in the Julian Calendar which currently falls on January of the Gregorian Calendar br Ignatius is honored in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on October br br br Martyrdom br br br Circumstances of martyrdom br Ignatius was condemned to death for his faith but instead of being executed in his home town of Antioch the bishop was taken to Rome by a company of ten soldiers br br From Syria even unto Rome I fight with beasts both by land and sea both by night and day being bound to ten leopards I mean a band of soldiers br Scholars consider Ignatius transport to Rome unusual since those persecuted as Christians would be expected to be punished locally Stevan Davies has pointed out that no other examples exist from the Flavian age of any prisoners except citizens or prisoners of war being brought to Rome for execution br If Ignatius had been a Roman citizen he could have appealed to the emperor with the common result of execution by beheading rather than torture However Ignatius s letters state that he was put in chains during the journey but it was against Roman law for a citizen to be put in bonds during an appeal to the emperor br Allen Brent argues that Ignatius was transferred to Rome for the emperor to provide a spectacle as a victim in the Colosseum Brent insists contrary to some that it was normal practice to transport condemned criminals from the provinces in order to offer spectator sport in the Colosseum at Rome br Stevan Davies rejects this idea reasoning that if Ignatius was in some way a donation by the Imperial Governor of Syria to the games at Rome a single prisoner seems a rather miserly gift Instead Davies proposes that Ignatius may have been indicted by a legate or representative of the governor of Syria while the governor was away temporarily and sent to Rome for trial and execution Under Roman law only the governor of a province or the emperor himself could impose capital punishment so the legate would have faced the choice of imprisoning Ignatius in Antioch or sending him to Rome Transporting the bishop might have avoided further agitation by the Antiochene Christians br Christine Trevett calls Davies suggestion entirely hypothetical and concludes that no fully satisfactory solution to the problem can be found I tend to take the bishop at his word when he says he is a condemned man But the question remains why is he going to Rome The truth is that we do not know br br br Route of travel to Rome br During the journey to Rome Ignatius and his entourage of soldiers made a number of lengthy stops in Asia Minor deviating from the most direct land route from Antioch to Rome Scholars generally agree on the following reconstruction of Ignatius route of travel br br Ignatius first traveled from Antioch in the province of Syria to Asia Minor It is uncertain whether he traveled by sea or by land br He was then taken to Smyrna via a route that bypassed the cities of Magnesia Tralles and Ephesus but likely passed through Philadelphia cf Ign Phil br Ignatius then traveled to Troas where he boarded a ship bound for Neapolis in Macedonia cf Ign Pol br He then passed through the city of Philippi cf Pol Phil br After this he took some land or sea route to Rome br During the journey the soldiers seem to have allowed the chained Ignatius to meet with entire congregations of Christians at least at Philadelphia cf Ign Phil and numerous Christian visitors and messengers were allowed to meet with him individually These messengers allowed Ignatius to send six letters to nearby churches and one to Polycarp the bishop of Smyrna br These aspects of Ignatius martyrdom are also unusual in that a prisoner would normally be transported on the most direct route to his destination Travel by land in the Roman Empire was far more expensive than by sea especially since Antioch was a major sea port Davies argues that Ignatius circuitous route can only be explained by positing that he was not the main purpose of the soldiers trip and that the various stops in Asia Minor were for other state business He suggests that such a scenario would also explain the relative freedom that Ignatius was given to meet with other Christians during the journey br br br Date of martyrdom br Tradition places Ignatius s martyrdom in the reign of Trajan c AD The earliest source for this is the th century church historian Eusebius of Caesarea Richard Pervo argues that Eusebius may have had an ideological interest in dating church leaders as early as possible and asserting a continuous succession between the original apostles of Jesus and the leaders of the church in his day However Jonathon Lookadoo argues that John Malalas and the Acts of Martyrdom s accounts of Ignatius are independent from Eusebius and they still place his death under Trajan br While many scholars accept this traditional dating others have argued for a somewhat later date Richard Pervo dated Ignatius death to AD British classicist Timothy Barnes has argued for a date in the s AD on the grounds that Ignatius seems to have quoted a work of the Gnostic Ptolemy who became active only in the s tienne Decrept has argued from the testimony of John Malalas and the Acts of Drosis that Ignatius was martyred under the reign of Trajan during Apollo s festival in July AD and in response to the earthquake at Antioch in late AD br br br Death and aftermath br Ignatius wrote that he would be thrown to the beasts in the fourth century Eusebius reports a tradition that this did happen while Jerome is the first to explicitly mention lions John Chrysostom is the first to place of Ignatius martyrdom at the Colosseum Modern scholars are uncertain whether any of these authors had sources other than Ignatius own writings br According to a medieval Christian text titled Martyrium Ignatii Ignatius remains were carried back to Antioch by his companions after his martyrdom The sixth century writings of Evagrius Scholasticus state that the reputed remains of Ignatius were moved by the Emperor Theodosius II to the Tychaeum or Temple of Tyche and converted it into a church dedicated to Ignatius In when Antioch was captured by the Rashidun Caliphate the relics were transferred to the Basilica di San Clemente in Rome br br br The Martyrium Ignatii br The Martyrium Ignatii is an account of the saint s martyrdom It is presented as an eye witness account for the church of Antioch attributed to Ignatius companions Phil of Cilicia deacon at Tarsus and Rheus Agathopus a Syrian br Its most reliable manuscript is the th century collection Codex Colbertinus Paris in which it is the final item The Martyrium presents the confrontation of Bishop Ignatius with Emperor Trajan at Antioch a familiar trope of Acta of the martyrs and many details of the long journey to Rome The Synaxarium of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria says that he was thrown to the wild beasts that devoured him br br br Epistles br br The following seven epistles preserved under the name of Ignatius are generally considered authentic since they were mentioned by the historian Eusebius in the first half of the fourth century br Seven original epistles br br The Epistle to the Ephesians br The Epistle to the Magnesians br The Epistle to the Trallians br The Epistle to the Romans br The Epistle to the Philadelphians br The Epistle to the Smyrnaeans br The Epistle to Polycarp a bishop of Smyrna br br br Recensions br The text of these epistles is known in three different recensions or editions the Short Recension found in a Syriac manuscript the Middle Recension found in Greek Latin Armenian Slavonic Coptic Arabic Ethiopic and Syriac manuscripts and the Long Recension found in Greek Latin and Georgian manuscripts br For some time it was believed that the Long Recension was the only extant version of the Ignatian epistles but around a Latin translation of the Middle Recension was discovered by Archbishop James Ussher who published it in For around a quarter of a century after this it was debated which recension represented the original text of the epistles But ever since John Pearson s strong defense of the authenticity of the Middle Recension in the late th century there has been a scholarly consensus that the Middle Recension is the original version of the text The Long Recension is the product of a fourth century Arian Christian who interpolated the Middle Recension epistles in order posthumously to enlist Ignatius as an unwitting witness in theological disputes of that age This individual also forged the six spurious epistles attributed to Ignatius see Pseudo Ignatius below br Manuscripts representing the Short Recension of the Ignatian epistles were discovered and published by William Cureton in the mid th century For a brief period there was a scholarly debate on the question of whether the Short Recension was earlier and more original than the Middle Recension But by the end of the th century Theodor Zahn and J B Lightfoot had established a scholarly consensus that the Short Recension is merely a summary of the text of the Middle Recension and was therefore composed later br br br Authenticity br Though the Catholic Church has always supported the authenticity of the letters some Protestants have tended to deny the authenticity of all the epistles because they seem to attest to a monarchical episcopate in the second century John Calvin called the epistles rubbish published under Ignatius name br In Presbyterian minister and church historian William Dool Killen published a long essay attacking the authenticity of the epistles attributed to Ignatius He argued that Callixtus bishop of Rome forged the letters around AD to garner support for a monarchical episcopate modeling the renowned Saint Ignatius after his own life to give precedent for his own authority Killen contrasted this episcopal polity with the presbyterian polity in the writings of Polycarp br Some doubts about the letters authenticity continued into the th century In the s and s the scholars Robert Joly Reinhard H bner Markus Vinzent and Thomas Lechner argued forcefully that the epistles of the Middle Recension were forgeries from the reign of Marcus Aurelius AD Joseph Ruis Camps published a study arguing that the Middle Recension letters were pseudepigraphically composed based on an original smaller authentic corpus of four letters Romans Magnesians Trallians and Ephesians In Otto Zwierlein support the thesis of a forgery written around AD br These publications stirred up heated scholarly controversy but by most patristic scholars accepted the authenticity of the seven original epistles ff However J Lookadoo said in that the debate has received renewed energy since the late s and shows few signs of slowing br The original texts of six of the seven original letters are found in the Codex Mediceo Laurentianus written in Greek in the th century which also contains the pseudepigraphical letters of the Long Recension except that to the Philippians while the letter to the Romans is found in the Codex Colbertinus br br br Style and structure br Ignatius s letters bear signs of being written in great haste such as run on sentences and an unsystematic succession of thought Ignatius modelled them after the biblical epistles of Paul Peter and John quoting or paraphrasing these apostles works freely For example in his letter to the Ephesians he quoted Corinthians br br Let my spirit be counted as nothing for the sake of the cross which is a stumbling block to those that do not believe but to us salvation and life eternal br br br Theology br br br Christology br Ignatius is known to have taught the deity of Christ There is one Physician who is possessed both of flesh and spirit both made and not made God existing in flesh true life in death both of Mary and of God first passible and then impassible even Jesus Christ our Lord br The same section in text of the Long Recension says the following br br But our Physician is the Only true God the unbegotten and unapproachable the Lord of all the Father and Begetter of the only begotten Son We have also as a Physician the Lord our God Jesus the Christ the only begotten Son and Word before time began but who afterwards became also man of Mary the virgin For the Word was made flesh Being incorporeal He was in the body being impassible He was in a passible body being immortal He was in a mortal body being life He became subject to corruption that He might free our souls from death and corruption and heal them and might restore them to health when they were diseased with ungodliness and wicked lusts br He stressed the value of the Eucharist calling it a medicine of immortality Ignatius to the Ephesians The very strong desire for bloody martyrdom in the arena which Ignatius expresses rather graphically in places may seem quite odd to the modern reader An examination of his theology of soteriology shows that he regarded salvation as one being free from the powerful fear of death and thus to face martyrdom bravely br Ignatius is claimed to be the first known Christian writer to argue in favor of Christianity s replacement of the Sabbath with the Lord s Day br br Be not seduced by strange doctrines nor by antiquated fables which are profitless For if even unto this day we live after the manner of Judaism we avow that we have not received grace If then those who had walked in ancient practices attained unto newness of hope no longer observing Sabbaths but fashioning their lives after the Lord s day on which our life also arose through Him how shall we be able to live apart from Him br If therefore those who were brought up in the ancient order of things have come to the possession of a new hope no longer observing the Sabbath but living in the observance of the Lord s day on which also our life has sprung up again by Him and by His death whom some deny by which mystery we have obtained faith and therefore endure that we may be found the disciples of Jesus Christ our only Master how shall we be able to live apart from Him whose disciples the prophets themselves in the Spirit did wait for Him as their Teacher And therefore He whom they rightly waited for being come raised them from the dead br This passage has provoked textual debate since the only Greek manuscript extant read which could be translated living according to the Lord s life Most scholars however have followed the Latin text secundum dominicam omitting and translating living according to Lord s Day br br br Ecclesiology br Ignatius is the earliest known Christian writer to emphasize loyalty to a single bishop in each city or diocese who is assisted by both presbyters elders and deacons Earlier writings only mention either bishops or presbyters br For instance his writings on bishops presbyters and deacons br br Take care to do all things in harmony with God with the bishop presiding in the place of God and with the presbyters in the place of the council of the apostles and with the deacons who are most dear to me entrusted with the business of Jesus Christ who was with the Father from the beginning and is at last made manifest br He is also responsible for the first known use of the Greek word katholikos or catholic meaning universal complete general and or whole to describe the Church writing br br Wherever the bishop appears there let the people be as wherever Jesus Christ is there is the Catholic Church It is not lawful to baptize or give communion without the consent of the bishop On the other hand whatever has his approval is pleasing to God Thus whatever is done will be safe and valid br Anglican bishop and theologian Joseph Lightfoot states the word catholic simply means universal cf Roman Catholic in the anachronistic modern sense of the particular religion having a wide range of applications in the English language thus requiring context to properly translate this word each time it is used rather than to merely leave it transliterated and can be found not only before and after Ignatius amongst ecclesiastical and classical writers but centuries before the Christian era Ignatius of Antioch is also attributed the earliest recorded use of the term Christianity Greek c AD br br br Parallels with Peregrinus Proteus br Several scholars have noted that there are striking similarities between Ignatius and the Christian turned Cynic philosopher Peregrinus Proteus who is satirized by Lucian in The Passing of Peregrinus br br Both Ignatius and Peregrinus show a morbid eagerness to die br Both are or have been Christians br Both are imprisoned by Roman authorities br Upon the arrest of both prisoners Christians from all over Asia Minor come to visit them and bring them gifts cf Peregr br Both prisoners send letters to several Greek cities shortly before their deaths as testaments counsels and laws appointing couriers and ambassadors for the purpose br It is generally believed that these parallels are the result of Lucian intentionally copying traits from Ignatius and applying them to his satire of Peregrinus If the dependence of Lucian on the Ignatian epistles is accepted then this places an upper limit on the date of the epistles during the s AD just before The Passing of Peregrinus was written br In Daniel V lter sought to explain the parallels by proposing that the Ignatian epistles were in fact written by Peregrinus and later attributed to the saint but this speculative theory has failed to make a significant impact on the academic community br br br Pseudo Ignatius br Epistles attributed to Saint Ignatius but of spurious origin their author is often called Pseudo Ignatius in English include br br Epistle to the Tarsians br Epistle to the Antiochians br Epistle to Hero a
