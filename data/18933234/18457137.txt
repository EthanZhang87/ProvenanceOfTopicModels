id: 18457137
A personal computer often referred to as a PC is a computer designed for individual use It is typically used for tasks such as word processing internet browsing email multimedia playback and gaming Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user rather than by a computer expert or technician Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes time sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers The term home computer has also been used primarily in the late s and s The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people br Institutional or corporate computer owners in the s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with computers While personal computer users may develop their applications usually these systems run commercial software free of charge software freeware which is most often proprietary or free and open source software which is provided in ready to run or binary form Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers Many personal computer users no longer need to write their programs to make any use of a personal computer although end user programming is still feasible This contrasts with mobile systems where software is often available only through a manufacturer supported channel and end user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer br Since the early s Microsoft operating systems first with MS DOS and then with Windows and Intel hardware collectively called Wintel have dominated the personal computer market and today the term PC normally refers to the ubiquitous Wintel platform Alternatives to Windows occupy a minority share of the market these include the Mac platform from Apple running the macOS operating system and free and open source Unix like operating systems such as Linux Other notable platforms until the s were the Amiga from Commodore and the PC from NEC br br br Terminology br The term PC is an initialism for personal computer While the IBM Personal Computer incorporated the designation into its model name the term originally described personal computers of any brand In some contexts PC is used to contrast with Mac an Apple Macintosh computer br Since none of these Apple products were mainframes or time sharing systems they were all personal computers and not PC brand computers In a CBS segment on the growing popularity of PC reported For many newcomers PC stands for Pain and Confusion br br br History br br The brain computer may one day come down to our level of the common people and help with our income tax and book keeping calculations But this is speculation and there is no sign of it so far br In the history of computing early experimental machines could be operated by a single attendant For example ENIAC which became operational in could be run by a single albeit highly trained person This mode pre dated the batch programming or time sharing modes with multiple users connected through terminals to mainframe computers Computers intended for laboratory instrumentation or engineering purposes were built and could be operated by one person in an interactive fashion Examples include such systems as the Bendix G and LGP of and the Soviet MIR series of computers developed from to By the early s people in academic or research institutions had the opportunity for single person use of a computer system in interactive mode for extended durations although these systems would still have been too expensive to be owned by a single person br The personal computer was made possible by major advances in semiconductor technology In the silicon integrated circuit IC chip was developed by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor and the metal oxide semiconductor MOS transistor was developed by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs The MOS integrated circuit was commercialized by RCA in and then the silicon gate MOS integrated circuit was developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild in Faggin later used silicon gate MOS technology to develop the first single chip microprocessor the Intel in The first microcomputers based on microprocessors were developed during the early s Widespread commercial availability of microprocessors from the mid s onwards made computers cheap enough for small businesses and individuals to own br In what was later to be called the Mother of All Demos SRI researcher Douglas Engelbart in gave a preview of features that would later become staples of personal computers e mail hypertext word processing video conferencing and the mouse The demonstration required technical support staff and a mainframe time sharing computer that were far too costly for individual business use at the time br Early personal computers generally called microcomputers were often sold in a kit form and in limited volumes and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians Minimal programming was done with toggle switches to enter instructions and output was provided by front panel lamps Practical use required adding peripherals such as keyboards computer displays disk drives and printers br Micral N was the earliest commercial non kit microcomputer based on a microprocessor the Intel It was built starting in and a few hundred units were sold This had been preceded by the Datapoint in for which the Intel had been commissioned though not accepted for use The CPU design implemented in the Datapoint became the basis for x architecture used in the original IBM PC and its descendants br In the IBM Los Gatos Scientific Center developed a portable computer prototype called SCAMP Special Computer APL Machine Portable based on the IBM PALM processor with a Philips compact cassette drive small CRT and full function keyboard SCAMP emulated an IBM minicomputer in order to run APL In APL was generally available only on mainframe computers and most desktop sized microcomputers such as the Wang or HP offered only BASIC Because SCAMP was the first to emulate APL performance on a portable single user computer PC Magazine in designated SCAMP a revolutionary concept and the world s first personal computer This seminal single user portable computer now resides in the Smithsonian Institution Washington D C Successful demonstrations of the SCAMP prototype led to the IBM portable microcomputer launched in with the ability to be programmed in both APL and BASIC for engineers analysts statisticians and other business problem solvers In the late s such a machine would have been nearly as large as two desks and would have weighed about half a ton br Another desktop portable APL machine the MCM was demonstrated in and shipped in It used the Intel processor br A seminal step in personal computing was the Xerox Alto developed at Xerox s Palo Alto Research Center PARC It had a graphical user interface GUI which later served as inspiration for Apple s Macintosh and Microsoft s Windows operating system The Alto was a demonstration project not commercialized as the parts were too expensive to be affordable br Also in Hewlett Packard introduced fully BASIC programmable microcomputers that fit entirely on top of a desk including a keyboard a small one line display and printer The Wang microcomputer of had a full size cathode ray tube CRT and cassette tape storage These were generally expensive specialized computers sold for business or scientific uses br br saw the introduction of what is considered by many to be the first true personal computer the Altair created by Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems MITS Based on the bit Intel Microprocessor the Altair is widely recognized as the spark that ignited the microcomputer revolution as the first commercially successful personal computer The computer bus designed for the Altair was to become a de facto standard in the form of the S bus and the first programming language for the machine was Microsoft s founding product Altair BASIC br In Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak sold the Apple I computer circuit board which was fully prepared and contained about chips The Apple I computer differed from the other kit style hobby computers of era At the request of Paul Terrell owner of the Byte Shop Jobs and Wozniak were given their first purchase order for Apple I computers only if the computers were assembled and tested and not a kit computer Terrell wanted to have computers to sell to a wide range of users not just experienced electronics hobbyists who had the soldering skills to assemble a computer kit The Apple I as delivered was still technically a kit computer as it did not have a power supply case or keyboard when it was delivered to the Byte Shop br br The first successfully mass marketed personal computer to be announced was the Commodore PET after being revealed in January However it was back ordered and not available until later that year Three months later April the Apple II usually referred to as the Apple was announced with the first units being shipped June and the TRS from Tandy Corporation Tandy Radio Shack following in August which sold over units during its lifetime Together these machines were referred to as the trinity Mass market ready assembled computers had arrived and allowed a wider range of people to use computers focusing more on software applications and less on development of the processor hardware br In the Heath company introduced personal computer kits known as Heathkits starting with the Heathkit H followed by the Heathkit H in late With the purchase of the Heathkit H you would obtain the chassis and CPU card to assemble yourself additional hardware such as the H memory board that contained k of RAM could also be purchased in order to run software The Heathkit H model was released in and was one of the first bit personal computers however due to its high retail cost of was discontinued in br br During the early s home computers were further developed for household use with software for personal productivity programming and games They typically could be used with a television already in the home as the computer display with low detail blocky graphics and a limited color range and text about characters wide by characters tall Sinclair Research a UK company produced the ZX Series the ZX ZX and the ZX Spectrum the latter was introduced in and totaled million unit sold Following came the Commodore totaled million units sold the Galaksija introduced in Yugoslavia and the Amstrad CPC series br In the same year the NEC PC was introduced which was a very popular personal computer that sold in more than million units Another famous personal computer the revolutionary Amiga was unveiled by Commodore on July The Amiga featured a multitasking windowing operating system color graphics with a color palette stereo sound Motorola CPU KB RAM and KB inch disk drive for US br IBM s first PC was introduced on August setting what became a mass market standard for PC architecture br In The Computer was named Machine of the Year by Time magazine br Somewhat larger and more expensive systems were aimed at office and small business use These often featured column text displays but might not have had graphics or sound capabilities These microprocessor based systems were still less costly than time shared mainframes or minicomputers br Workstations were characterized by high performance processors and graphics displays with large capacity local disk storage networking capability and running under a multitasking operating system Eventually due to the influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market personal computers and home computers lost any technical distinction Business computers acquired color graphics capability and sound and home computers and game systems users used the same processors and operating systems as office workers Mass market computers had graphics capabilities and memory comparable to dedicated workstations of a few years before Even local area networking originally a way to allow business computers to share expensive mass storage and peripherals became a standard feature of personal computers used at home br An increasingly important set of uses for personal computers relied on the ability of the computer to communicate with other computer systems allowing interchange of information Experimental public access to a shared mainframe computer system was demonstrated as early as in the Community Memory project but bulletin board systems and online service providers became more commonly available after Commercial Internet service providers emerged in the late s giving public access to the rapidly growing network br In the World Wide Web was made available for public use The combination of powerful personal computers with high resolution graphics and sound with the infrastructure provided by the Internet and the standardization of access methods of the Web browsers established the foundation for a significant fraction of modern life from bus time tables through unlimited distribution of free videos through to online user edited encyclopedias br br br Types br br br Stationary br br br Workstation br br A workstation is a high end personal computer designed for technical mathematical or scientific applications Intended primarily to be used by one person at a time they are commonly connected to a local area network and run multi user operating systems Workstations are used for tasks such as computer aided design drafting and modeling computation intensive scientific and engineering calculations image processing architectural modeling and computer graphics for animation and motion picture visual effects br br br Desktop computer br br Before the widespread use of PCs a computer that could fit on a desk was remarkably small leading to the desktop nomenclature More recently the phrase usually indicates a particular style of computer case Desktop computers come in a variety of styles ranging from large vertical tower cases to small models which can be tucked behind or rest directly beneath and support LCD monitors br While the term desktop often refers to a computer with a vertically aligned computer tower case these varieties often rest on the ground or underneath desks Despite this seeming contradiction the term desktop does typically refer to these vertical tower cases as well as the horizontally aligned models which are designed to literally rest on top of desks and are therefore more appropriate to the desktop term although both types qualify for this desktop label in most practical situations aside from certain physical arrangement differences Both styles of these computer cases hold the systems hardware components such as the motherboard processor chip and other internal operating parts Desktop computers have an external monitor with a display screen and an external keyboard which are plugged into ports on the back of the computer case Desktop computers are popular for home and business computing applications as they leave space on the desk for multiple monitors br A gaming computer is a desktop computer that generally comprises a high performance video card processor and RAM to improve the speed and responsiveness of demanding video games br An all in one computer also known as single unit PCs is a desktop computer that combines the monitor and processor within a single unit A separate keyboard and mouse are standard input devices with some monitors including touchscreen capability The processor and other working components are typically reduced in size relative to standard desktops located behind the monitor and configured similarly to laptops br A nettop computer was introduced by Intel in February characterized by low cost and lean functionality These were intended to be used with an Internet connection to run Web browsers and Internet applications br A Home theater PC HTPC combines the functions of a personal computer and a digital video recorder It is connected to a TV set or an appropriately sized computer display and is often used as a digital photo viewer music and video player TV receiver and digital video recorder HTPCs are also referred to as media center systems or media servers The goal is to combine many or all components of a home theater setup into one box HTPCs can also connect to services providing on demand movies and TV shows HTPCs can be purchased pre configured with the required hardware and software needed to add television programming to the PC or can be assembled from components br Keyboard computers are computers inside of keyboards generally still designed to be connected to an external computer monitor or television Examples include the Atari ST Amstrad CPC BBC Micro Commodore MSX Raspberry Pi and the ZX Spectrum br br br Portable br br br Luggable br br The potential utility of portable computers was apparent early on Alan Kay described the Dynabook in but no hardware was developed The Xerox NoteTaker was produced in a very small experimental batch around In the IBM could be fit into a transport case making it a portable computer but it weighed about pounds Such early portable computers were termed luggables by journalists owing to their heft br Before the introduction of the IBM PC portable computers consisting of a processor display disk drives and keyboard in a suit case style portable housing allowed users to bring a computer home from the office or to take notes at a classroom Examples include the Osborne and Kaypro and the Commodore SX These machines were AC powered and included a small CRT display screen The form factor was intended to allow these systems to be taken on board an airplane as carry on baggage though their high power demand meant that they could not be used in flight The integrated CRT display made for a relatively heavy package but these machines were more portable than their contemporary desktop equals Some models had standard or optional connections to drive an external video monitor allowing a larger screen or use with video projectors br IBM PC compatible suitcase format computers became available soon after the introduction of the PC with the Compaq Portable being a leading example of the type Later models included a hard drive to give roughly equivalent performance to contemporary desktop computers br The development of thin plasma display and LCD screens permitted a somewhat smaller form factor called the lunchbox computer The screen formed one side of the enclosure with a detachable keyboard and one or two half height floppy disk drives mounted facing the ends of the computer Some variations included a battery allowing operation away from AC outlets br br br Laptop br br A laptop computer is designed for portability with clamshell design where the keyboard and computer components are on one panel with a hinged second panel containing a flat display screen Closing the laptop protects the screen and keyboard during transportation Laptops generally have a rechargeable battery enhancing their portability To save power weight and space laptop graphics chips are in many cases integrated into the CPU or chipset and use system RAM resulting in reduced graphics performance when compared to desktop machines that more typically have a graphics card installed For this reason desktop computers are usually preferred over laptops for gaming purposes br Unlike desktop computers only minor internal upgrades such as memory and hard disk drive are feasible owing to the limited space and power available Laptops have the same input and output ports as desktops for connecting to external displays mice cameras storage devices and keyboards Laptops are also a little more expensive compared to desktops as the miniaturized components for laptops themselves are expensive br Notebook computers such as the TRS Model and Epson HX had roughly the plan dimensions of a sheet of typing paper ANSI A or ISO A These machines had a keyboard with slightly reduced dimensions compared to a desktop system and a fixed LCD display screen coplanar with the keyboard These displays were usually small with to lines of text sometimes only columns line length However these machines could operate for extended times on disposable or rechargeable batteries Although they did not usually include internal disk drives this form factor often included a modem for telephone communication and often had provisions for external cassette or disk storage Later clamshell format laptop computers with similar small plan dimensions were also called notebooks br A desktop replacement computer is a portable computer that provides the full capabilities of a desktop computer Such computers are currently large laptops This class of computers usually includes more powerful components and a larger display than generally found in smaller portable computers and may have limited battery capacity or no battery br br Netbooks also called mini notebooks or subnotebooks were a subgroup of laptops suited for general computing tasks and accessing web based applications Initially the primary defining characteristic of netbooks was the lack of an optical disc drive smaller size and lower performance than full size laptops By mid netbooks had been offered to users free of charge with an extended service contract purchase of a cellular data plan Ultrabooks and Chromebooks have since filled the gap left by Netbooks Unlike the generic Netbook name Ultrabook and Chromebook are technically both specifications by Intel and Google respectively br br br Tablet br br A tablet uses a touchscreen display which can be controlled using either a stylus pen or finger Some tablets may use a hybrid or convertible design offering a keyboard that can either be removed as an attachment or a screen that can be rotated and folded directly over top the keyboard Some tablets may use desktop PC operating system such as Windows or Linux or may run an operating system designed primarily for tablets Many tablet computers have USB ports to which a keyboard or mouse can be connected br br br Smartphone br br Smartphones are often similar to tablet computers the difference being that smartphones always have cellular integration They are generally smaller than tablets and may not have a slate form factor br br br Ultra mobile PC br br The ultra mobile PC UMPC is a small tablet computer It was developed by Microsoft Intel and Samsung among others Current UMPCs typically feature the Windows XP Windows Vista Windows or Linux operating system and low voltage Intel Atom or VIA C M processors br br br Pocket PC br br A pocket PC is a hardware specification for a handheld sized computer personal digital assistant PDA that runs the Microsoft Windows Mobile operating system It may have the capability to run an alternative operating system like NetBSD or Linux Pocket PCs have many of the capabilities of desktop PCs Numerous applications are available for handhelds adhering to the Microsoft Pocket PC specification many of which are freeware Microsoft compliant Pocket PCs can also be used with many other add ons like GPS receivers barcode readers RFID readers and cameras br In with the release of Windows Mobile Microsoft dropped the name Pocket PC in favor of a new naming scheme devices without an integrated phone are called Windows Mobile Classic instead of Pocket PC while devices with an integrated phone and a touch screen are called Windows Mobile Professional br br br Palmtop and handheld PCs br br Palmtop PCs were miniature pocket sized computers running DOS that first came about in the late s typically in a clamshell form factor with a keyboard Non x based devices were often called palmtop computers examples being Psion Series In later years a hardware specification called Handheld PC was later released by Microsoft that run the Windows CE operating system br br br Hardware br br Computer hardware is a comprehensive term for all physical and tangible parts of a computer as distinguished from the data it contains or operates on and the software that provides instructions for the hardware to accomplish tasks Some sub systems of a personal computer may contain processors that run a fixed program or firmware such as a keyboard controller Firmware usually is not changed by the end user of the personal computer br Most s and s era personal computers require users only to plug in the power supply monitor and other cables A typical desktop computer consists of a computer case or tower a metal chassis that holds the power supply motherboard a storage device such as a hard disk drive or solid state drive and often an optical disc drive Most towers have empty space where users can add additional components External devices such as a computer monitor or visual display unit keyboard and a pointing device mouse are usually found in a personal computer br The motherboard connects all processor memory and peripheral devices together The RAM graphics card and processor are in most cases mounted directly onto the motherboard The central processing unit microprocessor chip plugs into a CPU socket while the ram modules plug into corresponding ram sockets Some motherboards have the video display adapter sound and other peripherals integrated onto the motherboard while others use expansion slots for graphics cards network cards or other I O devices The graphics card or sound card may employ a break out box to keep the analog parts away from the electromagnetic radiation inside the computer case Disk drives which provide mass storage are connected to the motherboard with one cable and to the power supply through another cable Usually disk drives are mounted in the same case as the motherboard expansion chassis are also made for additional disk storage br For large amounts of data a tape drive can be used or extra hard disks can be put together in an external case The keyboard and the mouse are external devices plugged into the computer through connectors on an I O panel on the back of the computer case The monitor is also connected to the input output I O panel either through an onboard port on the motherboard or a port on the graphics card Capabilities of the personal computer s hardware can sometimes be extended by the addition of expansion cards connected via an expansion bus Standard peripheral buses often used for adding expansion cards in personal computers include PCI PCI Express PCIe and AGP a high speed PCI bus dedicated to graphics adapters found in older computers Most modern personal computers have multiple physical PCI Express expansion slots with some having PCI slots as well br A peripheral is a device connected to a computer to provide communication such as input and output or auxiliary functions such as additional storage Peripherals generally connect to the computer through the use of USB ports or inputs located on the I O panel USB flash drives provide portable storage using flash memory which allows users to access the files stored on the drive on any computer Memory cards also provide portable storage for users commonly used on other electronics such as mobile phones and digital cameras the information stored on these cards can be accessed using a memory card reader to transfer data between devices Webcams which are either built into computer hardware or connected via USB are video cameras that records video in real time to either be saved to the computer or streamed somewhere else over the internet Game controllers can be plugged in via USB and can be used as an input device for video games as an alternative to using keyboard and mouse Headphones and speakers can be connected via USB or through an auxiliary port found on I O panel and allow users to listen to audio accessed on their computer however speakers may also require an additional power source to operate Microphones can be connected through an audio input port on the I O panel and allow the computer to convert sound into an electrical signal to be used or transmitted by the computer br br br Software br br Computer software is any kind of computer program procedure or documentation that performs some task on a computer system The term includes application software such as word processors that perform productive tasks for users system software such as operating systems that interface with computer hardware to provide the necessary services for application software and middleware that controls and co ordinates distributed systems br br Software applications are common for word processing Internet browsing Internet faxing e mail and other digital messaging multimedia playback playing of computer game and computer programming The user may have significant knowledge of the operating environment and application programs but is not necessarily interested in programming nor even able to write programs for the computer Therefore most software written primarily for personal computers tends to be designed with simplicity of use or user friendliness in mind However the software industry continuously provide a wide range of new products for use in personal computers targeted at both the expert and the non expert user br br br Operating system br br An operating system OS manages computer resources and provides programmers with an interface used to access those resources An operating system processes system data and user input and responds by allocating and managing tasks and internal system resources as a service to users and programs of the system An operating system performs basic tasks such as controlling and allocating memory prioritizing system requests controlling input and output devices facilitating computer networking and managing files br Common contemporary desktop operating systems are Microsoft Windows macOS Linux Solaris and FreeBSD Windows macOS and Linux all have server and personal variants With the exception of Microsoft Windows the designs of each of them were inspired by or directly inherited from the Unix operating system br Early personal computers used operating systems that supported command line interaction using an alphanumeric display and keyboard The user had to remember a large range of commands to for example open a file for editing or to move text from one place to another Starting in the early s the advantages of a graphical user interface began to be explored but widespread adoption required lower cost graphical display equipment By mass market computer systems using graphical user interfaces were available by the turn of the st century text mode operating systems were no longer a significant fraction of the personal computer market br br br Applications br br Generally a computer user uses application software to carry out a specific task System software supports applications and provides common services such as memory management network connectivity and device drivers all of which may be used by applications but are not directly of interest to the end user A simplified analogy in the world of hardware would be the relationship of an electric light bulb an application to an electric power generation plant a system the power plant merely generates electricity not itself of any real use until harnessed to an application like the electric light that performs a service that benefits the user br Typical examples of software applications are word processors spreadsheets and media players Multiple applications bundled together as a package are sometimes referred to as an application suite Microsoft Office and LibreOffice which bundle together a word processor a spreadsheet and several other discrete applications are typical examples The separate applications in a suite usually have a user interface that has some commonality making it easier for the user to learn and use each application Often they may have some capability to interact with each other in ways beneficial to the user for example a spreadsheet might be able to be embedded in a word processor document even though it had been created in the separate spreadsheet application br End user development tailors systems to meet the user s specific needs User written software include spreadsheet templates word processor macros scientific simulations graphics and animation scripts even email filters are a kind of user software Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is br br br Gaming br br PC gaming is popular among the high end PC market According to an April market analysis done by Newzoo PC gaming was the third largest gaming sector behind console and mobile gaming in terms of market share sitting at a share of the entire market The market for PC gaming continues to grow and is expected to generate billion in revenue in the year PC gaming is at the forefront of competitive gaming known as esports with games such as League of Legends Valorant and Counter Strike Global Offensive leading the industry that is suspected to surpass a billion dollars in revenue in According to a December market analysis done by Visual Capitalist the PC gaming sector was the second largest category across all platforms as of valued at US billion surpassing console market revenue by br There are multiple different game distributors players are able to purchase games in person at retail stores and digitally Some large names for digital game distributors are Epic Games Valve Corporation Electronic Arts and Ubisoft Distributors such as the ones listed allow many games to be purchasable and accessible to users Though some distributors may only sell games that have been created by their own company many games and franchises are available on multiple distributor platforms Some multiplayer pc games can also be cross platform allowing players the ability the play with other platforms such as pc and different consoles There are games on distributor platforms that may allow players to play other known games using the game application as an emulator these games originally may not be supported by the player s current device whether it be platform locked or no longer supported by the operating system of the pc The number of different video game genres can range across each distributor platform first person shooters MMO games adventure games etc Many games frequently free to play games have microtransactions available for players These transactions can help enhance gameplay or to personalize their characters There are games such as The Sims that allow players to purchase additional game packs in order to gain access to additional new gameplay br br br Sales br br br Market share br br In million personal computers were shipped in comparison to in More than million personal computers were in use in and one billion personal computers had been sold worldwide from the mid s up to this time Of the latter figure were professional or work related while the rest were sold for personal or home use About of personal computers shipped had been desktop computers laptops and servers The United States had received million of the computers shipped Europe and had gone to the Asia Pacific region the fastest growing market as of The second billion was expected to be sold by Almost half of all households in Western Europe had a personal computer and a computer could be found in of homes in United Kingdom compared with only in br The global personal computer shipments were million units in br million units in br and million units in br The shipments were million units in the year according to iSuppli up from million in In the global shipments were million units an increase over In million computers were shipped at an estimated value of billion In million PCs were shipped at an estimated value of billion In million personal computers were shipped at an estimated value of billion Worldwide shipments of personal computers surpassed the million mark in growing to million units from million units in In Asia had million units shipped br As of June the number of personal computers in use worldwide hit one billion while another billion is expected to be reached by Mature markets like the United States Western Europe and Japan accounted for of the worldwide installed PCs The emerging markets were expected to double their installed PCs by and to take of the second billion PCs About million computers of the existing installed base were expected to be replaced and million to be dumped into landfill in The whole installed base grew annually br Based on International Data Corporation IDC data for Q for the first time China surpassed US in PC shipments by million and million respectively This trend reflects the rising of emerging markets as well as the relative stagnation of mature regions br In the developed world there has been a vendor tradition to keep adding functions to maintain high prices of personal computers However since the introduction of the One Laptop per Child foundation and its low cost XO laptop the computing industry started to pursue the price too Although introduced only one year earlier there were million netbooks sold in Besides the regular computer manufacturers companies making especially rugged versions of computers have sprung up offering alternatives for people operating their machines in extreme weather or environments br In Deloitte consulting firm predicted that smartphones and tablet computers as computing devices would surpass the PCs sales as has happened since As of worldwide sales of PCs had begun to fall as many consumers moved to tablets and smartphones Sales of million units in the fourth quarter of represented a decline from sales in the fourth quarter of Global PC sales fell sharply in the first quarter of according to IDC data The year over year decline was the largest on record since the firm began tracking in and double what analysts had been expecting The decline of Q PC shipments marked the fifth straight quarter of falling sales This is horrific news for PCs remarked an analyst It s all about mobile computing now We have definitely reached the tipping point Data from Gartner showed a similar decline for the same time period China s Lenovo Group bucked the general trend as strong sales to first time buyers in the developing world allowed the company s sales to stay flat overall Windows which was designed to look similar to tablet smartphone software was cited as a contributing factor in the decline of new PC sales Unfortunately it seems clear that the Windows launch not only didn t provide a positive boost to the PC market but appears to have slowed the market said IDC Vice President Bob O Donnell br In August Credit Suisse published research findings that attributed around of the operating profit share of the PC industry to Microsoft operating system and Intel semiconductors According to IDC in PC shipments dropped by as the greatest drop ever in line with consumers trends to use mobile devices br In the second quarter of PC sales grew for the first time since the first quarter of According to research firm Gartner the growth mainly came from the business market while the consumer market experienced decline br In as the result of the COVID Pandemic with more people working at home and learning remotely PC sales grew by compared to previous years according to IDC According to Canalys was the highest growth rate for the PC market since br br br Average selling price br Selling prices of personal computers steadily declined due to lower costs of production and manufacture while the capabilities of computers increased In an Altair kit sold for around only US but required customers to solder components into circuit boards peripherals required to interact with the system in alphanumeric form instead of blinking lights would add another and the resultant system was of use only to hobbyists br At their introduction in the US price of the Osborne and its competitor Kaypro was considered an attractive price point these systems had text only displays and only floppy disks for storage By Michael Dell observed that a personal computer system selling at retail for about US was made of components that cost the dealer about typical gross margin on a computer unit was around The total value of personal computer purchases in the US in was about billion comparable to total sales of pet food By late the average selling price of personal computer systems in the United States had dropped below br For Microsoft Windows systems the average selling price ASP showed a decline in possibly due to low cost netbooks drawing for desktop computers and for laptops at U S retail in August In ASP had further fallen to for desktops and to for notebooks by January and to and in February According to research firm NPD the average selling price of all Windows portable PCs has fallen from in October to in October br br br Environmental impact br br External costs of environmental impact are not fully included in the selling price of personal computers br Personal computers have become a large contributor to the million tons of discarded electronic waste generated annually according to the United Nations Environment Programme To address the electronic waste issue affecting developing countries and the environment extended producer responsibility EPR acts have been implemented in various countries and states In the absence of comprehensive national legislation or regulation on the export and import of electronic waste the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition and BAN Basel Action Network teamed up with electronic recyclers in the US and Canada to create an e steward program for the orderly disposal of electronic waste Some organizations oppose EPR regulation
