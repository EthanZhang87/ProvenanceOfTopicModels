A minicomputer or colloquially mini is a type of smaller general purpose computer developed in the mid s and sold at a much lower price than mainframe and mid size computers from IBM and its direct competitors In a survey The New York Times suggested a consensus definition of a minicomputer as a machine costing less than US equivalent to in with an input output device such as a teleprinter and at least four thousand words of memory that is capable of running programs in a higher level language such as Fortran or BASIC br The class formed a distinct group with its own software architectures and operating systems Minis were designed for control instrumentation human interaction and communication switching as distinct from calculation and record keeping Many were sold indirectly to original equipment manufacturers OEMs for final end use application During the two decade lifetime of the minicomputer class almost companies formed and only a half dozen remained br When single chip CPU microprocessors appeared beginning with the Intel in the term minicomputer came to mean a machine that lies in the middle range of the computing spectrum in between the smallest mainframe computers and the microcomputers The term minicomputer is seldom used today the contemporary term for this class of system is midrange computer such as the higher end SPARC from Oracle Power ISA from IBM and Itanium based systems from Hewlett Packard br br br History br br br Definition br The term minicomputer developed in the s to describe the smaller computers that became possible with the use of transistors and core memory technologies minimal instructions sets and less expensive peripherals such as the ubiquitous Teletype Model ASR They usually took up one or a few inch rack cabinets compared with the large mainframes that could fill a room br In terms of relative computing power compared to contemporary mainframes small systems that were similar to minicomputers had been available from the s In particular there was an entire class of drum machines like the UNIVAC and LGP that share some features of the minicomputer class Similar models using magnetic delay line memory followed in the early s These machines however were essentially designed as small mainframes using a custom chassis and often supporting only peripherals from the same company In contrast the machines that became known as minicomputers were often designed to fit into a standard chassis and deliberately designed to use common devices like the ASR br Another common difference was that most earlier small machines were not general purpose in that they were designed for a specific role like process control or accounting On these machines programming was generally carried out in their custom machine language or even hard coded into a plugboard although some used a form of BASIC DEC wrote regarding their PDP that it was the world s first commercially produced minicomputer It meets most definitions of mini in terms of power and size but was designed and built to be used as an instrumentation system in labs not as a general purpose computer Many similar examples of small special purpose machines exist from the early s including the UK Ferranti Argus and Soviet UM NKh br The CDC circa is sometimes pointed to as an early example of a minicomputer as it was small transistorized and relatively inexpensive However its basic price of equivalent to in and custom desk like chassis places it within the small system or midrange computer category as opposed to the more modern use of the term minicomputer Nevertheless it retains a strong contender for the term first minicomputer br br br s and s success br Most computing histories point to the introduction of Digital Equipment Corporation s DEC bit PDP as the first minicomputer Some of this is no doubt due to DEC s widespread use of the term starting in the mid s Smaller systems including those from DEC like the PDP and LINC had existed prior to this point but it was the PDP combination of small size general purpose orientation and low price that puts it firmly within the modern definition Its introductory price of equivalent to in places it in an entirely different market segment than earlier examples like the CDC br In contemporary terms the PDP was a runaway success ultimately selling examples Follow on versions using small scale integrated circuits further lowered the cost and size of the system Its success led to widespread imitation and the creation of an entire industry of minicomputer companies along Massachusetts Route including Data General Wang Laboratories and Prime Computer Other popular minis from the era were the HP Honeywell and TI br br Early minis had a variety of word sizes with DEC s and bit systems being typical examples The introduction and standardization of the bit ASCII character set led to the move to bit systems with the late Data General Nova being a notable entry in this space By the early s most minis were bit including DEC s PDP For a time minicomputer was almost synonymous with bit as the larger mainframe machines almost always used bit or larger word sizes br br As integrated circuit design improved especially with the introduction of the series integrated circuits minicomputers became smaller easier to manufacture and as a result less expensive They were used in manufacturing process control telephone switching and to control laboratory equipment In the s they were the hardware that was used to launch the computer aided design CAD industry and other similar industries where a small dedicated system was needed br The boom in worldwide seismic exploration for oil and gas in the early s saw the widespread use of minicomputers in dedicated processing centres close to the data collection crews Raytheon Data Systems RDS and later RDS were predominantly the systems of choice for nearly all the geophysical exploration as well as oil companies br At the launch of the MITS Altair in Radio Electronics magazine referred to the system as a minicomputer although the term microcomputer soon became usual for personal computers based on single chip microprocessors At the time microcomputers were bit single user relatively simple machines running simple program launcher operating systems like CP M or MS DOS while minis were much more powerful systems that ran full multi user multitasking operating systems such as VMS and Unix br The Tandem Computers NonStop product line shipped its first fully fault tolerant cluster computer in br Around the same time minis began to move upward in size Although several and bit minis had entered the market earlier it was DEC s VAX which they referred to as a superminicomputer or supermini that caused the mini market to move en masse to bit architectures This provided ample headroom even as single chip bit microprocessors like the TMS and Zilog Z appeared in the later s Most mini vendors introduced their own single chip processors based on their own architecture and used these mostly in low cost offerings while concentrating on their bit systems Examples include the Intersil single chip PDP DEC T PDP microNOVA and Fairchild Nova and TMS TI br br br Mid s and s decline br By the early s the bit market had all but disappeared as newer bit microprocessors began to improve in performance Those customers who required more performance than these offered had generally already moved to bit systems by this time But it was not long before this market also began to come under threat the Motorola offered a significant percentage of the performance of a typical mini in a desktop platform True bit processors like the National Semiconductor NS Motorola and Intel soon followed By the mid s high end microcomputers offered computer performance equal to low end and mid range minis and the new RISC approach promised performance levels well beyond the fastest minis and even high end mainframes br All that really separated micros from the mini market was storage and memory capacity Both of these began to be addressed through the later s MB of RAM became typical by around desktop hard drives rapidly pushed past the MB range by and the introduction of inexpensive and easily deployable local area network LAN systems provide solutions for those looking for multi user systems The introduction of the workstation machines opened new markets for graphics based systems that the terminal oriented minis could not even address Minis retained a force for those using existing software products or those who required high performance multitasking but the introduction of newer operating systems based on Unix began to become highly practical replacements for these roles as well br Mini vendors began to rapidly disappear through this period Data General responded to the changing market by focusing entirely on the high performance file server market embracing a role within large LANs that appeared resilient This did not last Novell NetWare rapidly pushed such solutions into niche roles and later versions of Microsoft Windows did the same to Novell DEC decided to move into the large computer space instead introducing the VAX mainframe in but it was a flop in the market and disappeared after almost no sales The company then attempted to enter the workstation and server markets with the DEC Alpha but was too late to save the company and they eventually sold their remains to Compaq in By the end of the decade all of the classic vendors were gone Data General Prime Computervision Honeywell and Wang failed merged or were bought out br Today only a few proprietary minicomputer architectures survive The IBM System operating system which introduced many advanced concepts lives on with IBM s AS Great efforts were made by IBM to enable programs originally written for the IBM System and System to be moved to the AS After being rebranded multiple times the AS platform was replaced by IBM Power Systems running IBM i In contrast competing proprietary computing architectures from the early s such as DEC s VAX Wang VS and Hewlett Packard s HP have long been discontinued without a compatible upgrade path OpenVMS runs on HP Alpha and Intel IA Itanium CPU architectures br Tandem Computers which specialized in reliable large scale computing was acquired by Compaq in and in the combined entity merged with Hewlett Packard The NonStop Kernel based NonStop product line was re ported from MIPS processors to Itanium based processors branded as HP Integrity NonStop Servers As in the earlier migration from stack machines to MIPS microprocessors all customer software was carried forward without source changes Integrity NonStop continues to be HP s answer for the extreme scaling needs of its very largest customers The NSK operating system now termed NonStop OS continues as the base software environment for the NonStop Servers and has been extended to include support for Java and integration with popular development tools like Visual Studio and Eclipse Later Hewlett Packard would split into HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise The NonStop products and the DEC products would then be sold by HPE br br br Industrial impact and heritage br A variety of companies emerged that built turnkey systems around minicomputers with specialized software and in many cases custom peripherals that addressed specialized problems such as computer aided design computer aided manufacturing process control manufacturing resource planning and so on Many if not most minicomputers were sold through these original equipment manufacturers and value added resellers br Several pioneering computer companies first built minicomputers such as DEC Data General and Hewlett Packard HP who now refers to its HP minicomputers as servers rather than minicomputers And although today s PCs and servers are clearly microcomputers physically architecturally their CPUs and operating systems have developed largely by integrating features from minicomputers br In the software context the relatively simple OSs for early microcomputers were usually inspired by minicomputer OSs such as CP M s similarity to Digital s single user OS and RT and multi user RSTS time sharing system Also the multiuser OSs of today are often either inspired by or directly descended from minicomputer OSs UNIX was originally a minicomputer OS while the Windows NT kernel the foundation for all current versions of Microsoft Windows borrowed design ideas liberally from VMS Many of the first generation of PC programmers were educated on minicomputer systems br br br Examples br CII Mitra br Control Data s CDC A and CDC br DEC PDP and VAX series br Data General Nova and Eclipse
