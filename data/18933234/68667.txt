id: 68667
The word anathema has two main meanings One is to describe that something or someone is being hated or avoided The other refers to a formal excommunication by a church These meanings come from the New Testament where an Anathema was a person or thing cursed or condemned by God In the Old Testament an Anathema was something or someone dedicated to God as a sacrifice or cursed and separated from God because of sin These represent two types of settings one for devotion the other for destruction br br br Etymology br br Anathema derives from Ancient Greek an thema meaning an offering or anything dedicated itself derived from the verb anat th mi meaning to offer up In the Old Testament ch rem referred to both objects consecrated to divine use and those dedicated to destruction in the Lord s name such as enemies and their weapons during religious wars Since weapons of the enemy were considered unholy the meaning became anything dedicated to evil or a curse br In New Testament usage a different meaning developed St Paul used the word anathema to signify a curse and the forced expulsion of one from the community of Christians By the th century the liturgical meaning evolved again to mean a formal ecclesiastical curse of excommunication and the condemnation of heretical doctrines the severest form of separation from the Christian church issued against a heretic or group of heretics by a Pope or other church official The phrase Latin anathema sit let him be anathema echoing Galatians was thus used in decrees of councils defining Christian faith br Examples include br br It s no wonder then that Paul calls down God s curse God s anathema His ban on those behind their potential defection from Christ br He shrank from the venerable saint as if to avoid an anathema br In an anathema was issued by Rome against the Eastern Patriarch who then issued another one against the cardinal who delivered it br br In the word anathema appeared in modern English for the first time and was used in the sense of something accursed The consecrated object meaning was also adopted a short time later but is no longer widely used Its most common modern usage is in secular contexts where it is used to mean something or someone that is detested or shunned br Examples include br br Racial hatred was anathema to her br The idea that one would voluntarily inject poison into one s body was anathema to me br This notion was anathema to most of his countrymen br br br Religious usage br The Old Testament applied the word to anything set aside for sacrifice and thus banned from profane use and dedicated to destruction as in the case of religious wars the enemy and their cities and possessions The New Testament uses the word to mean a curse and forced expulsion of someone from the Christian community br br br Judaism br The Septuagint uses the Greek word anathema meaning something offered to a divinity to render the Hebrew word herem The word appears in verses such as Leviticus to refer to things that are offered to God and so banned for common non religious use The Hebrew word was also used for what was devoted by virtue of a simple vow not to the Lord but to the priest According to the Jewish Encyclopedia with the rise of the synagogue as the organizing principle of Jewish life circa the Maccabean period the sense of the word herem changed from an instrument of communal purification to an instrument for the promotion of personal conduct as well as the enforcement of public morality an instrument of ecclesiastical discipline see Herem censure br br br New Testament br The noun anathema occurs in the Greek New Testament six times and frequently in the Septuagint Greek Old Testament Its meaning in the New Testament is disfavour of God and is used both of the sentence of disfavour as in Acts and to the object of God s disfavour as in the other cited places br br br Early Church br br Since the time of the apostles the term anathema has come to mean a form of extreme religious sanction known as excommunication The earliest recorded instance of the form is in the Council of Elvira c and thereafter it became the common method of cutting off heretics for example the Synod of Gangra c pronounced that Manicheanism was anathema Cyril of Alexandria issued twelve anathemas against Nestorius in In the fifth century a formal distinction between anathema and minor excommunication evolved where minor excommunication entailed cutting off a person or group from the rite of Eucharist and attendance at worship while anathema meant a complete separation of the subject from the Church br br br Catholicism br br In the dogmatic canons of all the ecumenical councils recognized by the Catholic Church the word anathema signifies exclusion from the society of the faithful because of heresy Documents of the th and th centuries distinguish anathema from excommunication a distinction later clarified by using the term major excommunication for exclusion from the society of the faithful and minor excommunication for ordinary excommunication or exclusion from reception of the sacraments br Although in the canons of ecumenical councils the word anathema continued to be used to mean exclusion for heresy from the society of the faithful the word was also used to signify a major excommunication inflicted with particular solemnity Anathema in this sense was a major excommunication pronounced with the ceremonies described in the article bell book and candle which were reserved for the gravest crimes br The Roman Code of Canon Law abandoned the distinction between major and minor excommunication which continues in use among the Eastern Catholic Churches and abolished all penalties of whatever kind envisaged in previous canonical legislation but not included in the Code It defined excommunication as exclusion from the communion of the faithful and said that excommunication is also called anathema especially if inflicted with the solemnities described in the Pontificale Romanum br The Code of Canon Law which is now in force does not contain the word anathema and the Pontificale Romanum as revised after the Second Vatican Council no longer mentions any particular solemnities associated with the infliction of excommunication br br br Eastern Orthodoxy br br The Eastern Orthodox Church distinguishes between epitemia penances laid on a person one form of which is separation from the communion of the Church excommunication and anathema While undergoing epitemia the person remains an Orthodox Christian even though their participation in the mystical life of the church is restricted but those given over to anathema are considered completely torn from the Church until they repent Epitemia or excommunication is normally limited to a specified period of time though it always depends on evidence of repentance by the one serving the penance The lifting of anathema however depends solely on the repentance of the one condemned The two causes for which a person may be anathematized are heresy and schism Anathematization is only a last resort and must always be preceded by pastoral attempts to reason with the offender and bring about their restoration br For the Orthodox anathema is not final damnation God alone is the judge of the living and the dead and up until the moment of death repentance is always possible The purpose of public anathema is twofold to warn the one condemned and bring about his repentance and to warn others away from his error Everything is done for the purpose of the salvation of souls br On the First Sunday of Great Lent the Sunday of Orthodoxy the church celebrates the Rite of Orthodoxy at which anathemas are pronounced against numerous heresies This rite commemorates the end of Byzantine Iconoclasm the last great heresy to trouble the church all subsequent heresies so far merely being restatements in one form or another of previous errors at the Council of Constantinople in The Synodicon or decree of the council was publicly proclaimed on this day including an anathema against not only Iconoclasm but also of previous heresies The Synodicon continues to be proclaimed annually together with additional prayers and petitions in cathedrals and major monasteries throughout the Eastern Orthodox Churches During the rite which is also known as the Triumph of Orthodoxy lections are read from Romans which directs the church to mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine you have learned and avoid them For they by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple and Matthew which recounts the parable of the Good Shepherd and provides the procedure to follow in dealing with those who err br br if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother But if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established And if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he shall neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican Verily I say unto you whatever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven br br After an ektenia litany during which petitions are offered that God will have mercy on those who err and bring them back to the truth and that he will make hatred enmity strife vengeance falsehood and all other abominations to cease and cause true love to reign in our hearts the bishop or abbot says a prayer during which he beseeches God to look down now upon Thy Church and behold how that though we have joyously received the Gospel of salvation we are but stony ground For the thorns of vanity and the tares of the passions make it to bear but little fruit in certain places and none in others and with the increase in iniquity some opposing the truth of Thy Gospel by heresy and others by schism do fall away from Thy dignity and rejecting Thy grace they subject themselves to the judgment of Thy most holy word O most merciful and almighty Lord be merciful unto us strengthen us in the right Faith by Thy power and with Thy divine light illumine the eyes of those in error that they may come to know Thy truth Soften the hardness of their hearts and open their ears that they may hear Thy voice and turn to Thee our Saviour O Lord set aside their division and correct their life which doth not accord with Christian piety Endue the pastors of Thy Church with holy zeal and so direct their care for the salvation and conversion of those in error with the spirit of the Gospel that guided by Thee we may all attain to that place where is the perfect faith fulfillment of hope and true love The protodeacon then proclaims the Synodicon anathematizing various heresies and lauding those who have remained constant in the dogma and Holy Tradition of the Church br br br See also br Cherem br Christian excommunication br Shunning br Disconnection br Ostracism present day br Bell book and candle br br br
