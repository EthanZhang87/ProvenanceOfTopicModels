id: 2163756
Sprint is a text based word processor for MS DOS first published by Borland in br br br History br br Sprint originally known as The FinalWord application is developed by Jason Linhart Craig Finseth Scott Layson Burson Brian Hess and Bill Spitzak at Mark of the Unicorn MOTU a company headquartered in Cambridge MA which is now better known for its music software products At the time MOTU sold MINCE and SCRIBBLE a text editor package based on Emacs As The FinalWord the package met with some success in the sense that the manuals of the Lotus software package were written on it as was Marvin Minsky s book The Society of Mind br FinalWord II was renamed to Sprint when it was acquired by Borland which added a new user interface new manuals and features to the application The editor speed was considered blazing at the time running with no delays on machines as slow as megahertz br This was the time of European development for Borland Sidekick and Turbo Pascal had been founded in Denmark and the management of the European subsidiary comprised former Micropro France managers Micropro was at the time the world leader in Word processing software with the famous WordStar line up They had success with the launch of WordStar the first word processor package with a spelling dictionary in French br As a result the development and advertising of the product was carried out in France Sprint is one of the very few major projects from an American software program publisher that had a French version shipped earlier than the American version br Sprint v shipped in France with notable initial success capturing a percent market share and getting the jump on competing word processors MicroPro was weakening with old Wordstar products and still new WordStar WordPerfect was having problems with the translation and the user interface and MS Word was a decent but less polished or powerful product and was also DOS and text based br The lack of beta test mixed with pressure to ship for back to school time resulted in a Sprint which had a range of minor glitches and bugs that had to be corrected with model and a whole new set of diskettes for each registered user br Version equivalent of French shipped a few months later in the US and rest of world with a mixed reception from customers Traditional Borland fans who bought Sprint were happy with the editor but wondered why the package included a sophisticated formatter while business users who wanted a word processor just to write their memos and letters wondered what to do with the heavy manual and powerful features of the formatter language In any event word processing was shifting to WYSIWYG br Version shipped with a number of new features and real stability in France but never made it elsewhere although a number of localized versions had been built for various European countries At the time Borland Scandinavia had gone bankrupt while Borland France had to be saved by massive financial help from the US The developers who had once worked in Europe had to move to the Scotts Valley CA premises Version was a reasonable success in France for some years but Microsoft Word and Windows gained momentum and obscured all the other products br In North America Sprint never really gained traction in the marketplace as it was overshadowed by WordPerfect and then Microsoft Word It built up a small but loyal and often enthusiastic following among professional writers researchers academics and programmers who appreciated its power speed and ability to handle large documents Borland did not believe that there was enough of a market to warrant updating the product and it eventually stopped supporting it br br br Features br Crash recovery Sprint had incremental back up with its swap file updated every seconds enabling full recovery from crashes At trade shows demos were made with one person pulling out the power cord and the typist resuming work as soon as the machine restarted br Spell as you type With this feature Sprint could beep at you in real time when detecting a typo br Multilingual editing Sprint included dictionary switching support for hyphenation and spelling and thesaurus dictionaries that have yet to be matched by the competitors br Separate formatter and programmable editor These have been useful features for corporate environments aiming at standardizing documents or building boilerplate contracts In France for example applications were built for Banques Populaires loan contracts or Conseil d Etat while some local government agencies created specific applications for tenders and contracts br Powerful programming language Programming in Sprint was done with the internal language of the word processor a language that is much like C Programmers have the ability to get under the hood and add modifications and extensions to an extent not possible with other word processors Once written Sprint programs are compiled into the interface and run at full speed br Interface switching Modifications and extensions to Sprint can be saved into separate interfaces which can be easily and quickly switched This is useful for people working in different languages as the keys can be mapped to the accents and characters of each language depending on the interface br File handling Users could work in up to files at once All open files could be saved on exit or not and nevertheless automatically reopened as left including each file s cursor position cut and paste buffer contents and spell check status Because this behavior was accomplished using the crash recovery swap file see above it allowed an instant on behavior using the saved state from the previous run this was unusual for its time br Handling large documents Sprint has the ability to publish large documents hundreds of pages with strict formatting consistency and automatic table of contents index generation tables of figures and tables of authorities These features made Sprint a leader in the production of technical documents and Borland itself did all its manuals on Sprint for years br PostScript capabilities Sprint could print in line EPS images with dimensioning and also had the ability to add in line PostScript procedures This made the product rather popular in the printing industry For example making a page novel fit into pages was simply a matter of changing the point size from to Sprint could size by increment and scale the line spacing and kerning accordingly The pages size is important in the printing industry where the number of pages often has to be divisible by A page book would have to be printed using pages the extra pages being empty br Consistency with familiar environments The default editor key bindings were a subset of those provided by EMACS and the mark up language was a subset of Scribe making it easy for people familiar with those tools to use Sprint br br br Reception br BYTE in praised FinalWord s low memory requirements and many powerful features Criticisms included great difficulty in learning how to use it and instability including a serious bug that destroyed four days of work The magazine in listed Sprint as among the Distinction winners of the BYTE Awards stating that if you can live without WYSIWYG Sprint may be all you need in word processing software br br br
