ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program developed from to at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum Created to explore communication between humans and machines ELIZA simulated conversation by using a pattern matching and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program but had no representation that could be considered really understanding what was being said by either party Whereas the ELIZA program itself was written originally in MAD SLIP the pattern matching directives that contained most of its language capability were provided in separate scripts represented in a lisp like representation The most famous script DOCTOR simulated a psychotherapist of the Rogerian school in which the therapist often reflects back the patient s words to the patient and used rules dictated in the script to respond with non directional questions to user inputs As such ELIZA was one of the first chatterbots chatbot modernly and one of the first programs capable of attempting the Turing test br ELIZA s creator Weizenbaum intended the program as a method to explore communication between humans and machines He was surprised and shocked that some people including Weizenbaum s secretary attributed human like feelings to the computer program Many academics believed that the program would be able to positively influence the lives of many people particularly those with psychological issues and that it could aid doctors working on such patients treatment While ELIZA was capable of engaging in discourse it could not converse with true understanding However many early users were convinced of ELIZA s intelligence and understanding despite Weizenbaum s insistence to the contrary The original ELIZA source code had been missing since its creation in the s as it was not common to publish articles that included source code at that time However more recently the MAD SLIP source code has now been discovered in the MIT archives and published on various platforms such as archive org The source code is of high historical interest as it demonstrates not only the specificity of programming languages and techniques at that time but also the beginning of software layering and abstraction as a means of achieving sophisticated software programming br br br Overview br br Joseph Weizenbaum s ELIZA running the DOCTOR script created a conversational interaction somewhat similar to what might take place in the office of a non directive psychotherapist in an initial psychiatric interview and to demonstrate that the communication between man and machine was superficial While ELIZA is best known for acting in the manner of a psychotherapist the speech patterns are due to the data and instructions supplied by the DOCTOR script ELIZA itself examined the text for keywords applied values to said keywords and transformed the input into an output the script that ELIZA ran determined the keywords set the values of keywords and set the rules of transformation for the output Weizenbaum chose to make the DOCTOR script in the context of psychotherapy to sidestep the problem of giving the program a data base of real world knowledge allowing it to reflect back the patient s statements in order to carry the conversation forward The result was a somewhat intelligent seeming response that reportedly deceived some early users of the program br Weizenbaum named his program ELIZA after Eliza Doolittle a working class character in George Bernard Shaw s Pygmalion According to Weizenbaum ELIZA s ability to be incrementally improved by various users made it similar to Eliza Doolittle since Eliza Doolittle was taught to speak with an upper class accent in Shaw s play However unlike the human character in Shaw s play ELIZA is incapable of learning new patterns of speech or new words through interaction alone Edits must be made directly to ELIZA s active script in order to change the manner by which the program operates br Weizenbaum first implemented ELIZA in his own SLIP list processing language where depending upon the initial entries by the user the illusion of human intelligence could appear or be dispelled through several interchanges Some of ELIZA s responses were so convincing that Weizenbaum and several others have anecdotes of users becoming emotionally attached to the program occasionally forgetting that they were conversing with a computer Weizenbaum s own secretary reportedly asked Weizenbaum to leave the room so that she and ELIZA could have a real conversation Weizenbaum was surprised by this later writing I had not realized that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people br In interactive computing via a teletype was new It was years before the personal computer became familiar to the general public and three decades before most people encountered attempts at natural language processing in Internet services like Ask com or PC help systems such as Microsoft Office Clippit Although those programs included years of research and work ELIZA remains a milestone simply because it was the first time a programmer had attempted such a human machine interaction with the goal of creating the illusion however brief of human human interaction br At the ICCC ELIZA was brought together with another early artificial intelligence program named PARRY for a computer only conversation While ELIZA was built to speak as a doctor PARRY was intended to simulate a patient with schizophrenia br br br Design br Weizenbaum originally wrote ELIZA in MAD SLIP for CTSS on an IBM as a program to make natural language conversation possible with a computer To accomplish this Weizenbaum identified five fundamental technical problems for ELIZA to overcome the identification of key words the discovery of a minimal context the choice of appropriate transformations the generation of responses in the absence of key words and the provision of an editing capability for ELIZA scripts Weizenbaum solved these problems and made ELIZA such that it had no built in contextual framework or universe of discourse However this required ELIZA to have a script of instructions on how to respond to inputs from users br ELIZA starts its process of responding to an input by a user by first examining the text input for a keyword A keyword is a word designated as important by the acting ELIZA script which assigns to each keyword a precedence number or a RANK designed by the programmer If such words are found they are put into a keystack with the keyword of the highest RANK at the top The input sentence is then manipulated and transformed as the rule associated with the keyword of the highest RANK directs For example when the DOCTOR script encounters words such as alike or same it would output a message pertaining to similarity in this case In what way as these words had high precedence number This also demonstrates how certain words as dictated by the script can be manipulated regardless of contextual considerations such as switching first person pronouns and second person pronouns and vice versa as these too had high precedence numbers Such words with high precedence numbers are deemed superior to conversational patterns and are treated independently of contextual patterns br Following the first examination the next step of the process is to apply an appropriate transformation rule which includes two parts the decomposition rule and the reassembly rule First the input is reviewed for syntactical patterns in order to establish the minimal context necessary to respond Using the keywords and other nearby words from the input different disassembly rules are tested until an appropriate pattern is found Using the script s rules the sentence is then dismantled and arranged into sections of the component parts as the decomposition rule for the highest ranking keyword dictates The example that Weizenbaum gives is the input You are very helpful which is transformed to I are very helpful This is then broken into empty I are very helpful The decomposition rule has broken the phrase into four small segments that contain both the keywords and the information in the sentence br The decomposition rule then designates a particular reassembly rule or set of reassembly rules to follow when reconstructing the sentence The reassembly rule takes the fragments of the input that the decomposition rule had created rearranges them and adds in programmed words to create a response Using Weizenbaum s example previously stated such a reassembly rule would take the fragments and apply them to the phrase What makes you think I am which would result in What makes you think I am very helpful This example is rather simple since depending upon the disassembly rule the output could be significantly more complex and use more of the input from the user However from this reassembly ELIZA then sends the constructed sentence to the user in the form of text on the screen br These steps represent the bulk of the procedures that ELIZA follows in order to create a response from a typical input though there are several specialized situations that ELIZA DOCTOR can respond to One Weizenbaum specifically wrote about was when there is no keyword One solution was to have ELIZA respond with a remark that lacked content such as I see or Please go on The second method was to use a MEMORY structure which recorded prior recent inputs and would use these inputs to create a response referencing a part of the earlier conversation when encountered with no keywords This was possible due to Slip s ability to tag words for other usage which simultaneously allowed ELIZA to examine store and repurpose words for usage in outputs br While these functions were all framed in ELIZA s programming the exact manner by which the program dismantled examined and reassembled inputs is determined by the operating script The script is not static and can be edited or a new one created as is necessary for the operation in the context needed This would allow the program to be applied in multiple situations including the well known DOCTOR script which simulates a Rogerian psychotherapist br A Lisp version of ELIZA based on Weizenbaum s CACM paper was written shortly after that paper s publication by Bernie Cosell A BASIC version appeared in Creative Computing in although it was written in by Jeff Shrager This version which was ported to many of the earliest personal computers appears to have been subsequently translated into many other versions in many other languages Shrager claims not to have seen either Weizenbaum s or Cosell s versions br In Jeff Shrager searched MIT s Weizenbaum archives along with MIT archivist Myles Crowley and found files labeled Computer Conversations These included the complete source code listing of ELIZA in MAD SLIP with the DOCTOR script attached The Weizenbaum estate has given permission to open source this code under a Creative Commons CC public domain license The code and other information can be found on the ELIZAGEN site br Another version of Eliza popular among software engineers is the version that comes with the default release of GNU Emacs and which can be accessed by typing M x doctor

write his book Computer Power and Human Reason From Judgment to Calculation in which he explains the limits of computers as he wants to make clear his opinion that the anthropomorphic views of computers are just a reduction of human beings or any life form for that matter In the independent documentary film Plug Pray Weizenbaum said that only people who misunderstood ELIZA called it a sensation br The Israeli poet David Avidan who was fascinated with future technologies and their relation to art desired to explore the use of computers for writing literature He conducted several conversations with an APL implementation of ELIZA and published them in English and in his own translation to Hebrew under the title My Electronic Psychiatrist Eight Authentic Talks with a Computer In the foreword he presented it as a form of constrained writing br There are many programs based on ELIZA in different programming languages For MS DOS computers some Sound Blaster cards came bundled with Dr Sbaitso which functions like the DOCTOR script Other versions adapted ELIZA around a religious theme such as ones featuring Jesus both serious and comedic and another Apple II variant called I Am Buddha The game The Prisoner incorporated ELIZA style interaction within its gameplay In the British artist and friend of Weizenbaum Brian Reffin Smith created two art oriented ELIZA style programs written in BASIC one called Critic and the other Artist running on two separate Amiga computers and showed them at the exhibition Salamandre in the Mus e du Berry Bourges France The visitor was supposed to help them converse by typing in to Artist what Critic said and vice versa The secret was that the two programs were identical GNU Emacs formerly had a psychoanalyze pinhead command that simulates a session between ELIZA and Zippy the Pinhead The Zippyisms were removed due to copyright issues but the DOCTOR program remains br ELIZA has been referenced in popular culture and continues to be a source of inspiration for programmers and developers focused on artificial intelligence It was also featured in a exhibit at Harvard University titled Go Ask A L I C E as part of a celebration of mathematician Alan Turing s th birthday The exhibit explores Turing s lifelong fascination with the interaction between humans and computers pointing to ELIZA as one of the earliest realizations of Turing s ideas br ELIZA won a Legacy Peabody Award and in it beat OpenAI s GPT in a Turing test study br br br In popular culture br In George Lucas and Walter Murch incorporated an Eliza like dialogue interface in their screenplay for the feature film THX Inhabitants of the underground future world of THX when stressed would retreat to confession booths and initiate a one sided Eliza formula conversation with a Jesus faced computer who claimed to be OMM br ELIZA influenced a number of early computer games by demonstrating additional kinds of interface designs Don Daglow claims he wrote an enhanced version of the program called Ecala on a DEC PDP minicomputer at Pomona College in br The video game Deus Ex Human Revolution and the sequel Deus Ex Mankind Divided features an artificial intelligence Picus TV Network newsreader named Eliza Cassan br In Adam Curtis s documentary HyperNormalisation ELIZA was referenced in relationship to post truth br The twelfth episode of the American sitcom Young Sheldon aired in January included the protagonist conversing with ELIZA hoping to resolve a domestic issue br On August independent game developer Zachtronics published a visual novel called Eliza about an AI based counseling service inspired by ELIZA br In A Murder at the End of the World the anthropomorphic LLM powered character Ray cites ELIZA as an example of how
