French fran ais French f s or langue fran aise French l f s z or by some speakers French l f s is a Romance language of the Indo European family It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire as did all Romance languages French evolved from Gallo Romance the Latin spoken in Gaul and more specifically in Northern Gaul Its closest relatives are the other langues d o l languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium which French Francien largely supplanted French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the Germanic Frankish language of the post Roman Frankish invaders Today owing to the French colonial empire there are numerous French based creole languages most notably Haitian Creole A French speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French br French is an official language in countries as well as one of the most geographically widespread languages in the world with about countries and territories having it as a de jure or de facto official administrative or cultural language Most of these countries are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie OIF the community of member states which share the official use or teaching of French It is spoken as a first language in descending order of the number of speakers in France Canada especially in the provinces of Quebec Ontario and New Brunswick Belgium Wallonia and the Brussels Capital Region western Switzerland specifically the cantons forming the Romandy region parts of Luxembourg parts of the United States the states of Louisiana Maine New Hampshire and Vermont Monaco the Aosta Valley region of Italy and various communities elsewhere br French is estimated to have about million speakers of which about million are native speakers According to the OIF approximately million people worldwide are able to speak the language as of without specifying the criteria for this estimation or whom it encompasses br In approximately of the francophone population including L and partial speakers lived in Europe rapid population growth in sub Saharan Africa in North Africa and the Middle East in the Americas and in Asia and Oceania French is the second most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union Of Europeans who speak other languages natively approximately one fifth are able to speak French as a second language French is the second most taught foreign language in the EU All institutions of the EU use French as a working language along with English and German in certain institutions French is the sole working language e g at the Court of Justice of the European Union French is also the th most natively spoken language in the world fifth most spoken language by total number of speakers and is on the top five of the most studied languages worldwide with about million learners as of As a result of French and Belgian colonialism from the th century onward French was introduced to new territories in the Americas Africa and Asia Most second language speakers reside in Francophone Africa particularly Gabon Algeria Morocco Tunisia Mauritius Senegal and Ivory Coast br French has a long history as an international language of literature and scientific standards and is a primary or second language of many international organisations including the United Nations the European Union the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the World Trade Organization the International Olympic Committee the General Conference on Weights and Measures and the International Committee of the Red Cross br br br History br br French is a Romance language meaning that it is descended primarily from Vulgar Latin that evolved out of the Gallo Romance dialects spoken in northern France The language s early forms include Old French and Middle French br br br Vulgar Latin in Gaul br br Due to Roman rule Latin was gradually adopted by the inhabitants of Gaul and as the language was learned by the common people it developed a distinct local character with grammatical differences from Latin as spoken elsewhere some of which being attested on graffiti This local variety evolved into the Gallo Romance tongues which include French and its closest relatives such as Arpitan br The evolution of Latin in Gaul was shaped by its coexistence for over half a millennium beside the native Celtic Gaulish language which did not go extinct until the late sixth century long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire The population remained indigenous in origin the Romanizing class were the local native elite not Roman settlers whose children learned Latin in Roman schools At the time of the collapse of the Empire this local elite had been slowly abandoning Gaulish entirely but the rural and lower class populations remained Gaulish speakers who could sometimes also speak Latin or Greek The final language shift from Gaulish to Vulgar Latin among rural and lower class populations occurred later when both they and the incoming Frankish ruler military class adopted the Gallo Roman Vulgar Latin speech of the urban intellectual elite br The Gaulish language likely survived into the sixth century in France despite considerable Romanization Coexisting with Latin Gaulish helped shape the Vulgar Latin dialects that developed into French contributing loanwords and calques including oui the word for yes sound changes shaped by Gaulish influence and influences in conjugation and word order Recent computational studies suggest that early gender shifts may have been motivated by the gender of the corresponding word in Gaulish br The estimated number of French words that can be attributed to Gaulish is placed at by the Petit Robert which is often viewed as representing standardized French while if non standard dialects are included the number increases to Known Gaulish loans are skewed toward certain semantic fields such as plant life ch ne bille etc animals mouton cheval etc nature boue etc domestic activities ex berceau farming and rural units of measure arpent lieue borne boisseau weapons and products traded regionally rather than further afield This semantic distribution has been attributed to peasants being the last to hold onto Gaulish br br br Old French br The beginning of French in Gaul was greatly influenced by Germanic invasions into the country These invasions had the greatest impact on the northern part of the country and on the language there A language divide began to grow across the country The population in the north spoke langue d o l while the population in the south spoke langue d oc Langue d o l grew into what is known as Old French The period of Old French spanned between the th and th centuries Old French shared many characteristics with Latin For example Old French made use of different possible word orders just as Latin did because it had a case system that retained the difference between nominative subjects and oblique non subjects The period is marked by a heavy superstrate influence from the Germanic Frankish language which non exhaustively included the use in upper class speech and higher registers of V word order a large percentage of the vocabulary now at around of modern French vocabulary including the impersonal singular pronoun on a calque of Germanic man and the name of the language itself br Up until its later stages Old French alongside Old Occitan maintained a relic of the old nominal case system of Latin longer than most other Romance languages with the notable exception of Romanian which still currently maintains a case distinction differentiating between an oblique case and a nominative case The phonology was characterized by heavy syllabic stress which led to the emergence of various complicated diphthongs such as eau which would later be leveled to monophthongs br The earliest evidence of what became Old French can be seen in the Oaths of Strasbourg and the Sequence of Saint Eulalia while Old French literature began to be produced in the eleventh century with major early works often focusing on the lives of saints such as the Vie de Saint Alexis or wars and royal courts notably including the Chanson de Roland epic cycles focused on King Arthur and his court as well as a cycle focused on William of Orange br br br Middle French br br Within Old French many dialects emerged but the Francien dialect is one that not only continued but also thrived during the Middle French period th th centuries Modern French grew out of this Francien dialect Grammatically during the period of Middle French noun declensions were lost and there began to be standardized rules Robert Estienne published the first Latin French dictionary which included information about phonetics etymology and grammar Politically the first government authority to adopt Modern French as official was the Aosta Valley in while the Ordinance of Villers Cotter ts named French the language of law in the Kingdom of France br br br Modern French br During the th century French replaced Latin as the most important language of diplomacy and international relations lingua franca It retained this role until approximately the middle of the th century when it was replaced by English as the United States became the dominant global power following the Second World War Stanley Meisler of the Los Angeles Times said that the fact that the Treaty of Versailles was written in English as well as French was the first diplomatic blow against the language br During the Grand Si cle th century France under the rule of powerful leaders such as Cardinal Richelieu and Louis XIV enjoyed a period of prosperity and prominence among European nations Richelieu established the Acad mie fran aise to protect the French language By the early s Parisian French had become the primary language of the aristocracy in France br Near the beginning of the th century the French government began to pursue policies with the end goal of eradicating the many minorities and regional languages patois spoken in France This began in with Henri Gr goire s Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalize the use of the French language When public education was made compulsory only French was taught and the use of any other patois language was punished The goals of the public school system were made especially clear to the French speaking teachers sent to teach students in regions such as Occitania and Brittany Instructions given by a French official to teachers in the department of Finist re in western Brittany included the following And remember Gents you were given your position in order to kill the Breton language The prefect of Basses Pyr n es in the French Basque Country wrote in Our schools in the Basque Country are particularly meant to replace the Basque language with French Students were taught that their ancestral languages were inferior and they should be ashamed of them this process was known in the Occitan speaking region as Vergonha br br br Geographic distribution br br br Europe br br Spoken by of the European Union s population French is the third most widely spoken language in the EU after English and German and the second most widely taught language after English br Under the Constitution of France French has been the official language of the Republic since although the Ordinance of Villers Cotter ts made it mandatory for legal documents in France mandates the use of French in official government publications public education except in specific cases and legal contracts advertisements must bear a translation of foreign words br In Belgium French is an official language at the federal level along with Dutch and German At the regional level French is the sole official language of Wallonia excluding a part of the East Cantons which are German speaking and one of the two official languages along with Dutch of the Brussels Capital Region where it is spoken by the majority of the population approx often as their primary language br French is one of the four official languages of Switzerland along with German Italian and Romansh and is spoken in the western part of Switzerland called Romandy of which Geneva is the largest city The language divisions in Switzerland do not coincide with political subdivisions and some cantons have bilingual status for example cities such as Biel Bienne and cantons such as Valais Fribourg and Bern French is the native language of about of the Swiss population and is spoken by of the population br Along with Luxembourgish and German French is one of the three official languages of Luxembourg where it is generally the preferred language of business as well as of the different public administrations It is also the official language of Monaco br At a regional level French is acknowledged as an official language in the Aosta Valley region of Italy where it is the first language of approximately of the population while French dialects remain spoken by minorities on the Channel Islands It is also spoken in Andorra and is the main language after Catalan in El Pas de la Casa The language is taught as the primary second language in the German state of Saarland with French being taught from pre school and over of citizens being able to speak French br br br Africa br br The majority of the world s French speaking population lives in Africa According to a estimate from the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie an estimated million African people spread across countries and territories can speak French as either a first or a second language This number does not include the people living in non Francophone African countries who have learned French as a foreign language Due to the rise of French in Africa the total French speaking population worldwide is expected to reach million people in French is the fastest growing language on the continent in terms of either official or foreign languages br French is mostly a second language in Africa but it has become a first language in some urban areas such as the region of Abidjan Ivory Coast Libreville Gabon and Antananarivo br There is not a single African French but multiple forms that diverged through contact with various indigenous African languages br Sub Saharan Africa is the region where the French language is most likely to expand because of the expansion of education and rapid population growth It is also where the language has evolved the most in recent years Some vernacular forms of French in Africa can be difficult to understand for French speakers from other countries but written forms of the language are very closely related to those of the rest of the French speaking world br br br Americas br br br Canada br br French is the second most common language in Canada after English and both are official languages at the federal level It is the first language of million people or and the second language for million or of the entire population of Canada French is the sole official language in the province of Quebec being the mother tongue for some million people or almost Census of the province About of the people of Quebec speak French as either their first or second language and for some as their third language Quebec is also home to the city of Montreal which is the world s fourth largest French speaking city by number of first language speakers New Brunswick and Manitoba are the only officially bilingual provinces though full bilingualism is enacted only in New Brunswick where about one third of the population is Francophone French is also an official language of all of the territories Northwest Territories Nunavut and Yukon Out of the three Yukon has the most French speakers making up just under of the population Furthermore while French is not an official language in Ontario the French Language Services Act ensures that provincial services are to be available in the language The Act applies to areas of the province where there are significant Francophone communities namely Eastern Ontario and Northern Ontario Elsewhere sizable French speaking minorities are found in southern Manitoba Nova Scotia Prince Edward Island and the Port au Port Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador where the unique Newfoundland French dialect was historically spoken Smaller pockets of French speakers exist in all other provinces The Ontarian city of Ottawa the Canadian capital is also effectively bilingual as it has a large population of federal government workers who are required to offer services in both French and English and is across a river from Quebec opposite the major city of Gatineau with which it forms a single metropolitan area br br br United States br br According to the United States Census Bureau French is the fourth most spoken language in the United States after English Spanish and Chinese when all forms of French are considered together and all dialects of Chinese are similarly combined French is the second most spoken language after English in the states of Maine and New Hampshire In Louisiana it is tied with Spanish for second most spoken if Louisiana French and all creoles such as Haitian are included French is the third most spoken language after English and Spanish in the states of Connecticut Rhode Island and New Hampshire Louisiana is home to many distinct French dialects collectively known as Louisiana French New England French essentially a variant of Canadian French is spoken in parts of New England Missouri French was historically spoken in Missouri and Illinois formerly known as Upper Louisiana but is nearly extinct today French also survived in isolated pockets along the Gulf Coast of what was previously French Lower Louisiana such as Mon Louis Island Alabama and DeLisle Mississippi the latter only being discovered by linguists in the s but these varieties are severely endangered or presumed extinct br br br Caribbean br French is one of two official languages in Haiti alongside Haitian Creole It is the principal language of education administration business and public signage and is spoken by all educated Haitians It is also used for ceremonial events such as weddings graduations and church masses The vast majority of the population speaks Haitian Creole as their first language the rest largely speak French as a first language As a French Creole language Haitian Creole draws the large majority of its vocabulary from French with influences from West African languages as well as several European languages It is closely related to Louisiana Creole and the creole from the Lesser Antilles br French is the sole official language of all the overseas territories of France in the Caribbean that are collectively referred to as the French West Indies namely Guadeloupe Saint Barth lemy Saint Martin and Martinique br br br Other territories br French is the official language of both French Guiana on the South American continent and of Saint Pierre and Miquelon an archipelago off the coast of Newfoundland in North America br br br Asia br br br Southeast Asia br br French was the official language of the colony of French Indochina comprising modern day Vietnam Laos and Cambodia It continues to be an administrative language in Laos and Cambodia although its influence has waned in recent decades In colonial Vietnam the elites primarily spoke French while many servants who worked in French households spoke a French pidgin known as T y B i now extinct After French rule ended South Vietnam continued to use French in administration education and trade However since the Fall of Saigon and the opening of a unified Vietnam s economy French has gradually been effectively displaced as the first foreign language of choice by English in Vietnam Nevertheless it continues to be taught as the other main foreign language in the Vietnamese educational system and is regarded as a cultural language br All three countries are full members of La Francophonie OIF br br br India br br French was the official language of French India consisting of the geographically separate enclaves referred to as Puducherry It continued to be an official language of the territory even after its cession to India in until A small number of older locals still retain knowledge of the language although it has now given way to Tamil and English br br br Lebanon br br A former French mandate Lebanon designates Arabic as the sole official language while a special law regulates cases when French can be publicly used Article of Lebanon s Constitution states that Arabic is the official national language A law determines the cases in which the French language is to be used The French language in Lebanon is a widespread second language among the Lebanese people and is taught in many schools along with Arabic and English French is used on Lebanese pound banknotes on road signs on Lebanese license plates and on official buildings alongside Arabic br Today French and English are secondary languages of Lebanon with about of the population being Francophone and Anglophone The use of English is growing in the business and media environment Out of about students about are enrolled in Francophone schools public or private in which the teaching of mathematics and scientific subjects is provided in French Actual usage of French varies depending on the region and social status One third of high school students educated in French go on to pursue higher education in English speaking institutions English is the language of business and communication with French being an element of social distinction chosen for its emotional value br br br Oceania and Australasia br br French is an official language of the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu where of the population was estimated to speak it in In the French special collectivity of New Caledonia of the population can speak read and write French while in French Polynesia this figure is and in the French collectivity of Wallis and Futuna it is br In French Polynesia and to a lesser extent Wallis and Futuna where oral and written knowledge of the French language has become almost universal and respectively French increasingly tends to displace the native Polynesian languages as the language most spoken at home In French Polynesia the percentage of the population who reported that French was the language they use the most at home rose from at the census to at the census In Wallis and Futuna the percentage of the population who reported that French was the language they use the most at home rose from at the census to at the census br br br Future br According to a demographic projection led by the Universit Laval and the R seau D mographie de l Agence universitaire de la Francophonie the total number of French speakers will reach approximately million in and million by largely due to rapid population growth in sub Saharan Africa OIF estimates million French speakers by of whom will be in Africa br In a study published in March by Forbes the investment bank Natixis said that French could become the world s most spoken language by br In the European Union French was the dominant language within all institutions until the s After several enlargements of the EU French significantly lost ground in favour of English which is more widely spoken and taught in most EU countries French currently remains one of the three working languages or procedural languages of the EU along with English and German It is the second most widely used language within EU institutions after English but remains the preferred language of certain institutions or administrations such as the Court of Justice of the European Union where it is the sole internal working language or the Directorate General for Agriculture Since Brexit has rekindled discussions on whether or not French should again hold greater role within the institutions of the European Union br br br Varieties br br br Current status and importance br A leading world language French is taught in universities around the world and is one of the world s most influential languages because of its wide use in the worlds of journalism jurisprudence education and diplomacy br In diplomacy French is one of the six official languages of the United Nations and one of the UN Secretariat s only two working languages one of twenty official and three procedural languages of the European Union an official language of NATO the International Olympic Committee the Council of Europe the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development Organization of American States alongside Spanish Portuguese and English the Eurovision Song Contest one of eighteen official languages of the European Space Agency World Trade Organization and the least used of the three official languages in the North American Free Trade Agreement countries It is also a working language in nonprofit organisations such as the Red Cross alongside English German Spanish Portuguese Arabic and Russian Amnesty International alongside other languages of which English is the most used followed by Spanish Portuguese German and Italian M decins sans Fronti res used alongside English Spanish Portuguese and Arabic and M decins du Monde used alongside English Given the demographic prospects of the French speaking nations of Africa researcher Pascal Emmanuel Gobry wrote in that French could be the language of the future br Significant as a judicial language French is one of the official languages of such major international and regional courts tribunals and dispute settlement bodies as the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights the Caribbean Court of Justice the Court of Justice for the Economic Community of West African States the Inter American Court of Human Rights the International Court of Justice the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea the International Criminal Court and the World Trade Organization Appellate Body It is the sole internal working language of the Court of Justice of the European Union and makes with English the European Court of Human Rights s two working languages br In George Weber published in Language Today a comprehensive academic study entitled The World s most influential languages In the article Weber ranked French as after English the second most influential language of the world ahead of Spanish His criteria were the numbers of native speakers the number of secondary speakers especially high for French among fellow world languages the number of countries using the language and their respective populations the economic power of the countries using the language the number of major areas in which the language is used and the linguistic prestige associated with the mastery of the language Weber highlighted that French in particular enjoys considerable linguistic prestige In a reassessment of his article Weber concluded that his findings were still correct since the situation among the top ten remains unchanged br Knowledge of French is often considered to be a useful skill by business owners in the United Kingdom a study found that of British managers considered French to be a valuable asset for their business thus ranking French as the most sought after foreign language there ahead of German and Spanish MIT economist Albert Saiz calculated a premium for those who have French as a foreign language in the workplace br In Bloomberg Businessweek ranked French the third most useful language for business after English and Standard Mandarin Chinese br In English speaking Canada the United Kingdom and Ireland French is the first foreign language taught and in number of pupils is far ahead of other languages In the United States French is the second most commonly taught foreign language in schools and universities although well behind Spanish In some areas of the country near French speaking Quebec however it is the foreign language more commonly taught br br br Phonology br br Vowel phonemes in French br br Although there are many French regional accents foreign learners normally use only one variety of the language br br There are a maximum of vowels in French not all of which are used in every dialect a e i o y u plus the nasalized vowels and In France the vowels and are tending to be replaced by a and in many people s speech but the distinction of and is present in Meridional French In Quebec and Belgian French the vowels and are present br Voiced stops i e b d are typically produced fully voiced throughout br Voiceless stops i e p t k are unaspirated br The velar nasal can occur in final position in borrowed usually English words parking camping swing br The palatal nasal which is written gn can occur in word initial position e g gnon but it is most frequently found in intervocalic onset position or word finally e g montagne br French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing i e labiodental f v dental s z and palato alveolar s z are dental like the plosives t d and the nasal n br French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts In general it is described as a voiced uvular fricative as in u roue wheel Vowels are often lengthened before this segment It can be reduced to an approximant particularly in final position e g fort or reduced to zero in some word final positions For other speakers a uvular trill is also common and an apical trill r occurs in some dialects The cluster w is generally pronounced as a labialised voiced uvular fricative such as in a roi king or k a croire to believe br Lateral and central approximants The lateral approximant l is unvelarised in both onset lire and coda position il In the onset the central approximants w and j each correspond to a high vowel u y and i respectively There are a few minimal pairs where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast but there are also many cases where they are in free variation Contrasts between j and i occur in final position as in p j paye pay vs p i pays country br The lateral approximant l can be delateralised when word or morpheme final and preceded by i such as in t avaj travail work or when a word ending in al is pluralised giving aux o br French pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects but the standard rules are br br Final single consonants in particular s x z t d n p and g are normally silent A consonant is considered final when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it The final letters f k q and l however are normally pronounced The final c is sometimes pronounced like in bac sac roc but can also be silent like in blanc or estomac The final r is usually silent when it follows an e in a word of two or more syllables but it is pronounced in some words hiver super cancer etc br When the following word begins with a vowel however a silent consonant may once again be pronounced to provide a liaison or link between the two words Some liaisons are mandatory for example the s in les amants or vous avez some are optional depending on dialect and register for example the first s in deux cents euros or euros irlandais and some are forbidden for example the s in beaucoup d hommes aiment The t of et is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in set phrases like pied terre br Doubling a final n and adding a silent e at the end of a word e g chien chienne makes it clearly pronounced Doubling a final l and adding a silent e e g gentil gentille adds a j sound if the l is preceded by the letter i br Some monosyllabic function words ending in a or e such as je and que drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound thus avoiding a hiatus The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe e g je ai is instead pronounced and spelled j ai This gives for example the same pronunciation for l homme qu il a vu the man whom he saw and l homme qui l a vu the man who saw him However for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently in the first sentence the syllable break is as qu il a while the second breaks as qui l a It can also be noted that in Quebec French the second example l homme qui l a vu is more emphasized on l a vu br br br Writing system br br br Alphabet br br French is written with the letters of the basic Latin script with four diacritics appearing on vowels circumflex accent acute accent grave accent diaeresis and the cedilla appearing in br There are two ligatures and but they are often replaced in contemporary French with oe and ae because the ligatures do not appear on the AZERTY keyboard layout used in French speaking countries However this is nonstandard in formal and literary texts br br br Orthography br br French spelling like English spelling tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period without a corresponding change in spelling Moreover some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography as with some English words such as debt br br Old French doit French doigt finger Latin digitus br Old French pie French pied foot Latin pes stem ped br French orthography is morphophonemic While it contains graphemes that denote only phonemes many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound In particular a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme However there is not a one to one relation of a phoneme and a single related grapheme which can be seen in how tomber and tomb both end with the e phoneme Additionally there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words demonstrated by how the x in paix is not pronounced though at the end of Aix it is br As a result it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound Final consonants are generally silent except when the following word begins with a vowel see Liaison French For example the following words end in a vowel sound pied aller les finit beaux The same words followed by a vowel however may sound the consonants as they do in these examples beaux arts les amis pied terre br French writing as with any language is affected by the spoken language In Old French the plural for animal was animals The als sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong aus This change was then reflected in the orthography animaus The us ending very common in Latin was then abbreviated by copyists monks by the letter x resulting in a written form animax As the French language further evolved the pronunciation of au turned into o so that the u was reestablished in orthography for consistency resulting in modern French animaux pronounced first animos before the final s was dropped in contemporary French The same is true for cheval pluralized as chevaux and many others In addition castel pl castels became ch teau pl ch teaux br br Nasal n and m When n or m follows a vowel or diphthong the n or m becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized i e pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils Exceptions are when the n or m is doubled or immediately followed by a vowel The prefixes en and em are always nasalized The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects br Digraphs French uses not only diacritics to specify its large range of vowel sounds and diphthongs but also specific combinations of vowels sometimes with following consonants to show which sound is intended br Gemination Within words double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the s and in very refined elocution they may still occur For example illusion is pronounced ilyzj and not il yzj However gemination does occur between words for example une info a news item or a piece of information is pronounced yn fo whereas une nympho a nymphomaniac is pronounced yn fo br Accents are used sometimes for pronunciation sometimes to distinguish similar words and sometimes based on etymology alone br Accents that affect pronunciation br The acute accent l accent aigu e g cole school means that the vowel is pronounced e instead of the default br The grave accent l accent grave e g l ve pupil means that the vowel is pronounced instead of the default br The circumflex l accent circonflexe e g for t forest shows that an e is pronounced and that an is pronounced o In standard French it also signifies a pronunciation of for the letter but this differentiation is disappearing In the mid th century the circumflex was used in place of s after a vowel where that letter s was not pronounced Thus forest became for t hospital became h pital and hostel became h tel br Diaeresis or tr ma over e i u or y indicates that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding one na ve No l br The combination of e with diaeresis following o No l is nasalized in the regular way if followed by n Samo ns w br The combination of e with diaeresis following a is either pronounced Rapha l Isra l a or not pronounced leaving only the a Sta l a and the a is nasalized in the regular way if a is followed by n Saint Sa ns br A diaeresis on y only occurs in some proper names and in modern editions of old French texts Some proper names in which appears include A a commune in Marne formerly A Champagne Rue des Clo s an alley in Paris Cro family name and hotel on the Boulevard Raspail Paris Ch teau du Fa near Pontoise Gh s name of Flemish origin spelt Gh s where in handwriting looked like to French clerks L Ha les Roses commune near Paris Pierre Lou s author Mo de l Aisne commune in Aisne and a family name and Le Blanc de Nicola an insurance company in eastern France br The diaeresis on u appears in the Biblical proper names Arch la s Capharna m Emma s sa and Sa l as well as French names such as Ha y Nevertheless since the orthographic changes the diaeresis in words containing gu such as aigu or cigu may be moved onto the u aig e cig e and by analogy may be used in verbs such as j arg e br In addition words coming from German retain their umlaut and if applicable but use often French pronunciation such as K rcher trademark of a pressure washer br The cedilla la c dille e g gar on boy means that the letter is pronounced s in front of the back vowels a o and u c is otherwise k before a back vowel C is always pronounced s in front of the front vowels e i and y thus is never found in front of front vowels This letter is used when a front vowel after c such as in France or placer is replaced with a back vowel To retain the pronunciation of the c it is given a cedilla as in fran ais or pla ons br Accents with no pronunciation effect br The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters i or u nor in most dialects a It usually indicates that an s came after it long ago as in le from former isle compare with English word isle The explanation is that some words share the same orthography so the circumflex is put here to mark the difference between the two words For example dites you say d tes you said or even du of the d past participle for the verb devoir must have to owe in this case the circumflex disappears in the plural and the feminine br All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs l and o there where from the article la the feminine singular and the conjunction ou or respectively br Some proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system but they still fail to gather interest br In a reform accepted some changes to French orthography At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions In schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct br br br Grammar br br French is a moderately inflected language Nouns and most pronouns are inflected for number singular or plural though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently adjectives for number and gender masculine or feminine of their nouns personal pronouns and a few other pronouns for person number gender and case and verbs for tense aspect mood and the person and number of their subjects Case is primarily marked using word order and prepositions while certain verb features are marked using auxiliary verbs According to the French lexicogrammatical system French has a rank scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank which is followed by group rank word rank and morpheme rank A French clause is made up of groups groups are made up of words and lastly words are made up of morphemes br French grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages including br br the loss of Latin declensions br the loss of the neuter gender br the development of grammatical articles from Latin demonstratives br the loss of certain Latin tenses and the creation of new tenses from auxiliaries br br br Nouns br Every French noun is either masculine or feminine Because French nouns are not inflected for gender a noun s form cannot specify its gender For nouns regarding the living their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to For example a male teacher is an enseignant while a female teacher is an enseignante However plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine So a group of two male teachers would be enseignants A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be enseignants However a group of two female teachers would be enseignantes In many situations including in the case of enseignant both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech For example the singular le professeur or la professeure the male or female teacher professor can be distinguished from the plural les professeur e s because le l la la and les le s are all pronounced differently With enseignant however for both singular forms the le la becomes l and so the only difference in pronunciation is that the t on the end of masculine form is silent whereas it is pronounced in the feminine If the word was to be followed by a word starting with a vowel then liaison would cause the t to be pronounced in both forms resulting in identical pronunciation There are also some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference For example le dentiste refers to a male dentist while la dentiste refers to a female dentist Furthermore a few nouns meanings depend on their gender For example un livre masculine refers to a book while une livre a feminine is a pound br br br Verbs br br br Moods and tense aspect forms br The French language consists of both finite and non finite moods The finite moods include the indicative mood indicatif the subjunctive mood subjonctif the imperative mood imp ratif and the conditional mood conditionnel The non finite moods include the infinitive mood infinitif the present participle participe pr sent and the past participle participe pass br br br Finite moods br br br Indicative indicatif br The indicative mood makes use of eight tense aspect forms These include the present pr sent the simple past pass compos and pass simple the past imperfective imparfait the pluperfect plus que parfait the simple future futur simple the future perfect futur ant rieur and the past perfect pass ant rieur Some forms are less commonly used today In today s spoken French the pass compos is used while the pass simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes Similarly the plus que parfait is used for speaking rather than the older pass ant rieur seen in literary works br Within the indicative mood the pass compos plus que parfait futur ant rieur and pass ant rieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms br br br Subjunctive subjonctif br The subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense aspect forms found in the indicative present pr sent simple past pass compos past imperfective imparfait and pluperfect plus que parfait br Within the subjunctive mood the pass compos and plus que parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms br br br Imperative imperatif br The imperative is used in the present tense with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense The imperative is used to give commands to you tu we us nous and plural you vous br br br Conditional conditionnel br The conditional makes use of the present pr sent and the past pass br The pass uses auxiliary verbs in its forms br br br Voice br French uses both the active voice and the passive voice The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb tre to be and the past participle br Example of the active voice br br Elle aime le chien She loves the dog br Marc a conduit la voiture Marc drove the car br Example of the passive voice br br Le chien est aim par elle The dog is loved by her br La voiture a t conduite par Marc The car was driven by Marc br However unless the subject of the sentence is specified generally the pronoun on one is used br br On aime le chien The dog is loved Literally one loves the dog br On conduit la voiture The car is being driven Literally one drives the car br Word order is subject verb object although a pronoun object precedes the verb Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders in particular inversion of the subject and verb as in Parlez vous fran ais when asking a question rather than Vous parlez fran ais Both formulations are used and carry a rising inflection on the last word The literal English translations are Do you speak French and You speak French respectively To avoid inversion while asking a question Est ce que literally is it that may be placed at the beginning of the sentence Parlez vous fran ais may become Est ce que vous parlez fran ais French also uses verb object subject VOS and object subject verb OSV word order OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings br br br Vocabulary br br The majority of French words derive from Vulgar Latin or were constructed from Latin or Greek roots In many cases a single etymological root appears in French in a popular or native form inherited from Vulgar Latin and a learned form borrowed later from Classical Latin The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective br br brother fr re fraternel from Latin frater fraternalis br finger doigt digital from Latin digitus digitalis br faith foi fid le from Latin fides fidelis br eye il oculaire from Latin oculus ocularis br However a historical tendency to Gallicise Latin roots can be identified whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin br br rayonnement radiation from Latin radiatio br teindre extinguish from Latin exstinguere br noyau nucleus from Latin nucleus br ensoleillement insolation from Latin insolatio br There are also noun noun and adjective adjective pairs br br thing cause chose cause from Latin causa br cold froid frigide from Latin frigidum br It can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words because in the evolution from Vulgar Latin unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications br More recently the linguistic policy Toubon Law of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents to mainly English imported words either by using existing vocabulary extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules The result is often two or more co existing terms for describing the same phenomenon br br mercatique marketing br finance fant me shadow banking br bloc notes notepad br aili re wingsuit br tiers lieu coworking br It is estimated that of common French words found in a typical dictionary such as the Petit Larousse or Micro Robert Plus words are of foreign origin where Greek and Latin learned words are not seen as foreign About of these foreign words come from English and are fairly recent borrowings The others are some words from Italian from ancient Germanic languages from other Gallo Romance languages from Arabic from German from Celtic languages from Spanish from Dutch from Persian and Sanskrit from Native American languages from other Asian languages from other Afro Asiatic languages from Balto Slavic languages from Basque and about from other languages br One study analyzing the degree of differentiation of Romance languages in comparison to Latin estimated that among the languages analyzed French has the greatest distance from Latin Lexical similarity is with Italian with Sardinian with Rhaeto Romance and with Romanian Spanish and Portuguese br br br Numerals br The numeral system used in the majority of Francophone countries employs both decimal and vigesimal counting After the use of unique names for the numbers those from to are counted by tens while twenty vingt is used as a base number in the names of numbers from to The French word for is quatre vingts literally four twenties and the word for is soixante quinze literally sixty fifteen The vigesimal method of counting is analogous to the archaic English use of score as in fourscore and seven or threescore and ten br Belgian Swiss and Aostan French as well as that used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Rwanda and Burundi use different names for and namely septante and nonante In Switzerland depending on the local dialect can be quatre vingts Geneva Neuch tel Jura or huitante Vaud Valais Fribourg The Aosta Valley similarly uses huitante for Conversely Belgium and in its former African colonies use quatre vingts for br In Old French during the Middle Ages all numbers from to could be said in either base or base e g vint et doze twenty and twelve for dous vinz et diz two twenties and ten for uitante for or nonante for br The term octante was historically used in Switzerland for but is now considered archaic br French like most European languages uses a space to separate thousands The comma French virgule is used in French numbers as a decimal point i e instead of In the case of currencies the currency markers are substituted for decimal point i e for dollars and cents br br br Example text br Article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in French br br Tous les tres humains naissent libres et gaux en dignit et en droits Ils sont dou s de raison et de conscience et doivent agir les uns envers les autres dans un esprit de fraternit br Article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in English br br All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit
