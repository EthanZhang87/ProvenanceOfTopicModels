Semantic Scholar is a research tool for scientific literature powered by artificial intelligence It is developed at the Allen Institute for AI and was publicly released in November Semantic Scholar uses modern techniques in natural language processing to support the research process for example by providing automatically generated summaries of scholarly papers The Semantic Scholar team is actively researching the use of artificial intelligence in natural language processing machine learning human computer interaction and information retrieval br Semantic Scholar began as a database for the topics of computer science geoscience and neuroscience In the system began including biomedical literature in its corpus As of September it includes over million publications from all fields of science br br br Technology br Semantic Scholar provides a one sentence summary of scientific literature One of its aims was to address the challenge of reading numerous titles and lengthy abstracts on mobile devices It also seeks to ensure that the three million scientific papers published yearly reach readers since it is estimated that only half of this literature is ever read br Artificial intelligence is used to capture the essence of a paper generating it through an abstractive technique The project uses a combination of machine learning natural language processing and machine vision to add a layer of semantic analysis to the traditional methods of citation analysis and to extract relevant figures tables entities and venues from papers br Another key AI powered feature is Research Feeds an adaptive research recommender that uses AI to quickly learn what papers users care about reading and recommends the latest research to help scholars stay up to date It uses a state of the art paper embedding model trained using contrastive learning to find papers similar to those in each Library folder br Semantic Scholar also offers Semantic Reader an augmented reader with the potential to revolutionize scientific reading by making it more accessible and richly contextual Semantic Reader provides in line citation cards that allow users to see citations with TLDR summaries as they read and skimming highlights that capture key points of a paper so users can digest faster br In contrast with Google Scholar and PubMed Semantic Scholar is designed to highlight the most important and influential elements of a paper The AI technology is designed to identify hidden connections and links between research topics Like the previously cited search engines Semantic Scholar also exploits graph structures which include the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph Springer Nature s SciGraph and the Semantic Scholar Corpus br br br Article identifier br Each paper hosted by Semantic Scholar is assigned a unique identifier called the Semantic Scholar Corpus ID abbreviated S CID The following entry is an example br br Liu Ying Gayle Albert A Wilder Smith Annelies Rockl v Joacim March The reproductive number of COVID is higher compared to SARS coronavirus Journal of Travel Medicine doi jtm taaa PMID S CID br br br Indexing br Semantic Scholar is free to use and unlike similar search engines i e Google Scholar does not search for material that is behind a paywall br One study compared the index scope of Semantic Scholar to Google Scholar and found that for the papers cited by secondary studies in computer science the two indices had comparable coverage each only missing a handful of the papers br br br Number of users and publications br As of January following a project that added biomedical papers and topic summaries the Semantic Scholar corpus included more than million papers from computer science and biomedicine In March Doug Raymond who developed machine learning initiatives for the Amazon Alexa platform was hired to lead the Semantic Scholar project As of August the number of included papers metadata not the actual PDFs had grown to more than million after the addition of the Microsoft Academic Graph records In a partnership between Semantic Scholar and the University of Chicago Press Journals made all articles published under the University of Chicago Press available in the Semantic Scholar corpus At the end of Semantic Scholar had indexed million papers In Semantic Scholar reached seven million users per month br br br See also br Citation analysis Examination of the frequency patterns and graphs of citations in documents br Citation index Index of citations between publications br Knowledge extraction Creation of knowledge from structured and unstructured sources br List of academic databases and search engines br Scientometrics Quantitative study of scholarly literature br br br br br br External links br br Official website
