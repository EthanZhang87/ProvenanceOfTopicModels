Roaming packages br In February introduced Like Home a service that in theory allows subscribers to use any branded network with the exception of Indonesia without having to pay additional roaming charges instead paying the same amount for voice data and messaging services as they would do on their home network This also allows users to use their free or inclusive bundles and allowances while abroad However pre pay customers do not benefit fully as they cannot use each branded network for Like Home br This arrangement is possible because of the roaming agreements between the networks which provide service to other partners customers free of internal roaming charges This means that the marginal cost of a roaming call is much the same as a call on the home network br br At the end of
