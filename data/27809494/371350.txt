Party The following day the newspaper published another cover wrap advert this time from the Remain campaign Editor Ted Young said both adverts which each cost more than to place generated around complaints each accusing the newspaper of both pro and anti Brexit bias Concerns were subsequently raised over why the Democratic Unionist Party placed an advert in Metro because the newspaper does not publish in Northern Ireland br In May the paper was condemned by the National Union of Journalists and the Public and Commercial Services Union after an internal document leaked to The Guardian showed evidence that Amber Rudd Secretary of State for Work and Pensions had authorised the use of at least of public money for a ten week run of advertorials to be placed in Metro newspapers to challenge the myths around the government s controversial Universal Credit programme The Trussell Trust also ran a counter campaign called Universal Credit Uncovered In June the Daily Mirror reported that UK charities had filed a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority over misleading Universal Credit adverts in Metro In July the Advertising Standards Authority announced it was launching an investigation into the DWP ads The move came after the Morning Star said that the Metro had not run the controversial ads in its July print edition On November the Advertising Standards Authority
