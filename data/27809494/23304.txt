A personal digital assistant PDA is a multi purpose mobile device which functions as a personal information manager By PDAs have been mostly displaced by the widespread adoption of more highly capable smartphones in particular those based on iOS and Android and thus saw a rapid decline afterwards br A PDA has an electronic visual display Most models also have audio capabilities allowing usage as a portable media player and also enabling many of them to be used as telephones By the early s nearly all PDA models had the ability to access the Internet intranets or extranets via Wi Fi or Wireless WANs and since that time PDAs generally include a web browser Sometimes instead of buttons PDAs employ touchscreen technology br br br History br br The first PDA the Organiser was released in by Psion followed by Psion s Series in The latter began to resemble the more familiar PDA style including a full keyboard The term PDA was first used on January by Apple Inc CEO John Sculley at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Nevada referring to the Apple Newton br br In IBM introduced the first PDA with analog cellular phone functionality the IBM Simon which can also be considered the first smartphone Then in Nokia introduced a PDA with digital cellphone functionality the Communicator br Another early entrant in this market was Palm with a line of PDA products which began in March Palm would eventually be the dominant vendor of PDAs until the rising popularity of Pocket PC devices in the early s By the mid s most PDAs had morphed into smartphones as classic PDAs without cellular radios were increasingly becoming uncommon br br br Typical features br A typical PDA has a touchscreen for navigation a memory card slot for data storage and IrDA Bluetooth and or Wi Fi However some PDAs may not have a touchscreen using soft keys a directional pad and a numeric keypad or a thumb keyboard for input To have the functions expected of a PDA a device s software typically includes an appointment calendar a to do list an address book for contacts a calculator and some sort of memo or note program PDAs with wireless data connections also typically include an email client and a Web browser and may or may not include telephony functionality br br br Touchscreen br br Many of the original PDAs such as the Apple Newton and Palm Pilot featured a touchscreen for user interaction having only a few buttons usually reserved for shortcuts to often used programs Some touchscreen PDAs including Windows Mobile devices had a detachable stylus to facilitate making selections The user interacts with the device by tapping the screen to select buttons or issue commands or by dragging a finger or the stylus on the screen to make selections or scroll br Typical methods of entering text on touchscreen PDAs include br br A virtual keyboard where a keyboard is shown on the touchscreen Text is entered by tapping the on screen keyboard with a finger or stylus br An external keyboard connected via USB Infrared port or Bluetooth Some users may choose a chorded keyboard for one handed use br Handwriting recognition where letters or words are written on the touchscreen often with a stylus and the PDA converts the input to text Recognition and computation of handwritten horizontal and vertical formulas such as may also be a feature br Stroke recognition allows the user to make a predefined set of strokes on the touchscreen sometimes in a special input area representing the various characters to be input The strokes are often simplified character shapes making them easier for the device to recognize One widely known stroke recognition system is Palm s Graffiti br Despite research and development projects end users experience mixed results with handwriting recognition systems Some find it frustrating and inaccurate while others are satisfied with the quality of the recognition br Touchscreen PDAs intended for business use such as the BlackBerry and Palm Treo usually also offer full keyboards and scroll wheels or thumbwheels to facilitate data entry and navigation Many touchscreen PDAs support some form of external keyboard as well Specialized folding keyboards which offer a full sized keyboard but collapse into a compact size for transport are available for many models External keyboards may attach to the PDA directly using a cable or may use wireless technology such as infrared or Bluetooth to connect to the PDA Newer PDAs such as the HTC HD Apple iPhone Apple iPod Touch and Palm Pre Pre Plus Pixi and Pixi Plus as well as devices running the Android operating system include more advanced forms of touchscreen that can register multiple touches simultaneously These multi touch displays allow for more sophisticated interfaces using various gestures entered with one or more fingers br br br Memory cards br Although many early PDAs did not have memory card slots now most have either some form of Secure Digital SD slot a CompactFlash slot or a combination of the two Although designed for memory Secure Digital Input Output SDIO and CompactFlash cards are available that provide accessories like Wi Fi or digital cameras if the device can support them Some PDAs also have a USB port mainly for USB flash drives Some PDAs use microSD cards which are electronically compatible with SD cards but have a much smaller physical size br br br Wired connectivity br While early PDAs connected to a user s personal computer via serial ports or another proprietary connection many today connect via a USB cable Older PDAs were unable to connect to each other via USB as their implementations of USB did not support acting as the host Some early PDAs were able to connect to the Internet indirectly by means of an external modem connected via the PDA s serial port or sync connector or directly by using an expansion card that provided an Ethernet port br br br Wireless connectivity br Most PDAs utilize Bluetooth a popular wireless protocol for mobile devices Bluetooth can be used to connect keyboards headsets GPS receivers and other nearby accessories It is also possible to transfer files between PDAs that have Bluetooth Many PDAs have Wi Fi wireless network connectivity and can connect to Wi Fi hotspots All smartphones and some other PDAs can connect to Wireless Wide Area Networks such as those provided by cellular telecommunications companies Older PDAs from the s to typically had an IrDA infrared port allowing short range line of sight wireless communication Few current models use this technology as it has been supplanted by Bluetooth and Wi Fi IrDA allows communication between two PDAs or between a PDA and any device with an IrDA port or adapter Some printers have IrDA receivers allowing IrDA equipped PDAs to print to them if the PDA s operating system supports it Universal PDA keyboards designed for these older PDAs use infrared technology Infrared technology is low cost and has the advantage of being allowed aboard br br br Synchronization br Most PDAs can synchronize their data with applications on a user s computer This allows the user to update contact schedule or other information on their computer using software such as Microsoft Outlook or ACT and have that same data transferred to the PDA or transfer updated information from the PDA back to the computer This eliminates the need for the user to update their data in two places Synchronization also prevents the loss of information stored on the device if it is lost stolen or destroyed When the PDA is repaired or replaced it can be re synced with the computer restoring the user s data Some users find that data input is quicker on their computer than on their PDA since text input via a touchscreen or small scale keyboard is slower than a full size keyboard Transferring data to a PDA via the computer is therefore a lot quicker than having to manually input all data on the handheld device br Most PDAs come with the ability to synchronize to a computer This is done through synchronization software provided with the handheld or sometimes with the computer s operating system Examples of synchronization software include br br HotSync Manager for Palm OS PDAs br Microsoft ActiveSync used by Windows XP and older Windows operating systems to synchronize with Windows Mobile Pocket PC and Windows CE PDAs as well as PDAs running iOS Palm OS and Symbian br Microsoft Windows Mobile Device Center for Windows Vista which supports Microsoft Windows Mobile and Pocket PC devices br Apple iTunes used on Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows to sync iOS devices such as the iPhone and iPod touch br iSync included with Mac OS X can synchronize many SyncML enabled PDAs br BlackBerry Desktop Software used to sync BlackBerry devices br These programs allow the PDA to be synchronized with a personal information manager which may be part of the computer s operating system provided with the PDA or sold separately by a third party For example the RIM BlackBerry comes with RIM s Desktop Manager program which can synchronize to both Microsoft Outlook and ACT Other PDAs come only with their own proprietary software For example some early Palm OS PDAs came only with Palm Desktop while later Palm PDAs such as the Treo have the ability to sync to Palm Desktop or Microsoft Outlook Microsoft s ActiveSync and Windows Mobile Device Center only synchronize with Microsoft Outlook or a Microsoft Exchange server Third party synchronization software is also available for some PDAs from companies like CommonTime and CompanionLink Third party software can be used to synchronize PDAs to other personal information managers that are not supported by the PDA manufacturers for example GoldMine and IBM Lotus Notes br br br Wireless synchronization br Some PDAs can synchronize some or all of their data using their wireless networking capabilities rather than having to be directly connected to a personal computer via a cable Devices running Palm s webOS or Google s Android operating system primarily sync with the cloud For example if Gmail is used information in contacts email and calendars can be synchronized between the PDA and Google s servers RIM sells BlackBerry Enterprise Server to corporations so that corporate BlackBerry users can wirelessly synchronize their PDAs with the company s Microsoft Exchange Server IBM Lotus Domino or Novell GroupWise servers Email calendar entries contacts tasks and memos kept on the company s server are automatically synchronized with the BlackBerry br br br Operating systems of PDAs br The most common operating systems pre installed on PDAs are br br Palm OS br Microsoft Windows Mobile Pocket PC with a Windows CE kernel br Other rarely used operating systems br br EPOC then Symbian OS in mobile phone PDA combos br Linux e g VR iPAQ Sharp Zaurus PDA Opie GPE Familiar Linux etc br Newton br QNX also on iPAQ br br br Automobile navigation br Some PDAs include Global Positioning System GPS receivers this is particularly true of smartphones Other PDAs are compatible with external GPS receiver add ons that use the PDA s processor and screen to display location information PDAs with GPS functionality can be used for automotive navigation PDAs are increasingly being fitted as standard on new cars PDA based GPS can also display traffic conditions perform dynamic routing and show known locations of roadside mobile radar guns TomTom Garmin and iGO offer GPS navigation software for PDAs br br br Ruggedized br Some businesses and government organizations rely upon rugged PDAs sometimes known as enterprise digital assistants EDAs or mobile computers for mobile data applications These PDAs have features that make them more robust and able to handle inclement weather jolts and moisture EDAs often have extra features for data capture such as barcode readers radio frequency identification RFID readers magnetic stripe card readers or smart card readers These features are designed to facilitate the use of these devices to scan product or item codes br Typical applications include br br Access control and security br Capital asset maintenance br Facilities maintenance and management br Infection control audit and surveillance within healthcare environments br Medical treatment and recordkeeping in hospitals br Meter reading by utilities br Military U S Army Pakistan Army br Package delivery br Park and wildlife rangers br Parking enforcement br Route accounting br Supply chain management in warehouses br Taxicab allocation and routing br Waiter and waitress applications in restaurants and hospitality venues br Wildlife biologists br br br Educational uses br br PDAs and handheld devices are allowed in many classrooms for digital note taking Students can spell check modify and amend their class notes on a PDA Some educators distribute course material through the Internet or infrared file sharing functions of the PDA Textbook publishers have begun to release e books which can be uploaded directly to a PDA reducing the number of textbooks students must carry Brighton and SUSSEX Medical School in the UK was the first medical school to provide wide scale use of PDAs to its undergraduate students The learning opportunities provided by having PDAs complete with a suite of key medical texts were studied with results showing that learning occurred in context with timely access to key facts and through consolidation of knowledge via repetition The PDA was an important addition to the learning ecology rather than a replacement Software companies have developed PDA programs to meet the instructional needs of educational institutions such as dictionaries thesauri word processing software encyclopedias webinars and digital lesson planners br br br Recreational uses br PDAs may be used by music enthusiasts to play a variety of music file formats Many PDAs include the functionality of an MP player Road rally enthusiasts can use PDAs to calculate distance speed and time This information may be used for navigation or the PDA s GPS functions can be used for navigation Underwater divers can use PDAs to plan breathing gas mixtures and decompression schedules using software such as V Planner br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br Annotated
