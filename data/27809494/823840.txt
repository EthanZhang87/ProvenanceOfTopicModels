with support from Nintendo s first Fun Club President Howard Phillips himself an avid gamer While the Fun Club News focused solely on games made in house by Nintendo Nintendo Power was created to allow for reviews of games produced by those licensed by Nintendo such as Konami Capcom and the like Nintendo Power s mascot in the late s and early s was Nester character created by the staff at Work House Japan who first appeared in the magazine s Howard and Nester comic strip After Phillips left the company Nester became the magazine s sole mascot Early issues of the magazine featured a two page Howard and Nester comic which was later replaced with the two page Nester s Adventures later reduced to one page and eventually dropped altogether Subsequently Mario replaced Nester as the mascot of the magazine Later during the early s the magazine made another mascot out of its Senior Writer Alan Averill Apparently very camera shy Averill himself never appeared in any photos rather he was represented by a plush toy of a Blue Slime from Dragon Quest Fans often clamored to see what Averill actually looked like but the magazine continued to substitute with photos of the toy and even claimed that Alan was in fact a Blue Slime Eventually Averill retired from Nintendo Power joining Nintendo of America s localization department To this day most fans have never seen a real image of Averill The inclusion of a photo of Mr T in the Player s Pulse section became a running gag in the early half of Late in the magazine s life running gags centered on Chuck Norris references and jokes at the expense of writer Chris Shepperd br During the early s the magazine undertook a unique and powerful promotion giving away a free copy of the NES game Dragon Warrior Dragon Quest in Japan to every new subscriber The Dragon Quest series had been a huge hit in Japan and Nintendo had hoped the localized North American release would also be a success and promote the RPG genre However the game had not sold nearly as well as Nintendo had anticipated leaving the company with a large number of unsold cartridges The promotion both helped the company get rid of the unsold merchandise and won the magazine thousands of new subscribers br Following the release of the Super NES the magazine featured lengthy continuous comic strips based on Super Mario World and The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past After these stories ended they were replaced by similar multi issue stories based on Star Fox Super Metroid and later Nintendo games such as Star Wars Shadows of the Empire and Blast Corps It had several comics based on the animated series of Pok mon and Kirby Right Back at Ya Toward the end it included short excerpts based on Custom Robo and Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes It included a very short Metroid Prime comic and another story based on the Pok mon Mystery Dungeon games translated from the original Japanese version br br br Official Guides from Nintendo Power br br Nintendo Power produced a series of strategy magazines called Official Guides from Nintendo Power beginning with The Official Nintendo Player s Guide After Nintendo Power switched from a bi monthly magazine to a
