patents to a number of companies and offered to license the patents to them NTP brought a patent infringement lawsuit against one of the companies Research In Motion in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia This court is well known for its strict adherence to timetables and deadlines sometimes referred to as the rocket docket and is particularly efficient at trying patent cases br The jury eventually found that the NTP patents were valid furthermore the jury established that RIM had infringed the patents in a willful manner and the infringement had cost NTP US million in damages the greater of a reasonable royalty or lost profits The judge James R Spencer increased the damages to US million as a punitive measure due to the willful nature of the infringement He also instructed RIM to pay NTP s legal fees of US million and issued an injunction ordering RIM to cease and desist infringing the patents this decision would have resulted in the closure of BlackBerry s systems in the US RIM appealed all of the findings of the court The injunction and other remedies were stayed pending the outcome of the appeals br In March during appeal RIM and NTP tried to negotiate a settlement of their dispute the settlement was to be for million Negotiations broke down due to other issues On June the matter returned to the courts In early November

Supreme Court refused to hear RIM s appeal of the holding of liability for patent infringement and the matter was returned to a lower court The prior granted injunction preventing all RIM sales in the US and use of the BlackBerry device might have been enforced by the presiding district court judge had the two parties been unable to reach a settlement br On February the US Department of Defense DOD filed a brief stating that an injunction shutting down the BlackBerry service while excluding government users was unworkable The DOD also stated that the BlackBerry was crucial for national security given the large number of government users br On February RIM announced that it had developed software workarounds that would not infringe the NTP patents and would implement those if the injunction was enforced br On March after a stern warning from Judge Spencer RIM and NTP announced that they had settled their dispute Under the terms of the settlement RIM has agreed to pay NTP million USD in a full and final settlement of all claims In a statement RIM said that all terms of the agreement have been finalized and the litigation against RIM has been dismissed by a court order this afternoon The agreement eliminates the need for any further court proceedings or decisions relating to damages or injunctive relief The settlement amount is believed low by some analysts because of the absence of any future royalties on the technology in question br On May BlackBerry announced that it had reached an agreement with Qualcomm Incorporated resolving all amounts payable in connection with the interim arbitration decision announced on April Following a joint stipulation by the parties the arbitration panel has issued a final award providing for the payment by Qualcomm to BlackBerry of a total amount of U S including interest and attorneys fees net of certain royalties due from BlackBerry for calendar and the first quarter of calendar br In summer the Texas based startup OnwardMobility signed a new licensing agreement with BlackBerry Limited to develop a new G BlackBerry smartphone OnwardMobility was cooperating with BlackBerry Limited and FIH Mobile a subsidiary of

perceived centralized system br In the company had an outage reportedly covering the whole of North America br At UTC began a multi day outage in Europe the Middle East and Africa affecting millions of BlackBerry users There was another outage the following day By October the BlackBerry Internet Service went down in North America Research In Motion attributed data overload due to switch failures in their two data centres in Waterloo in Canada and Slough in England as the cause of the service disruptions The outage intensified calls by shareholders for a shake up in the company s leadership br

PXA clocked at MHz br Some previous BlackBerry devices such as the Bold were equipped with Intel XScale MHz processors The Bold featured a newer version of the Bold s processor but is clocked at the same speed The Curve featured a MHz processor while BlackBerry series smartphones such as the and the Pearl are based on the MHz ARM XScale ARMv TE PXA An exception to this is the BlackBerry which is based on the MHz Qualcomm chipset this was due to the PXA chipset not supporting G networks The MHz processor in the BlackBerry meant the device was often slower to download and render web pages over G than the was over EDGE networks Early BlackBerry devices such as the BlackBerry used Intel based processors br BlackBerry s latest Flagship phone the BlackBerry Z based on a inch Super AMOLED resolution at ppi bit color depth and powered by Quad Graphics and Qualcomm s Dual Core GHz MSM T Pro br The first BlackBerry with an Android operating system was released in late November the grams

composite an intelligent predictive and adapting keyboard and a gesture based user interface designed around the idea of peek and flow Apps are available for BlackBerry devices through the BlackBerry World storefront br The previous operating system developed for older BlackBerry devices was BlackBerry OS a proprietary multitasking environment developed by RIM The operating system is designed for use of input devices such as the track wheel track ball and track pad The OS provides support for Java MIDP and WAP Previous versions allowed wireless synchronisation with Microsoft Exchange Server email and calendar as well as with Lotus Domino email OS provides a subset of MIDP and allows complete wireless activation and synchronisation with Exchange email calendar tasks notes and contacts and adds support for Novell GroupWise and Lotus Notes The BlackBerry Curve BlackBerry Torch Bold Curve and Torch featured the BlackBerry OS Apps are available for these devices through BlackBerry World which before was called BlackBerry App World br br Third party developers can write software using these APIs and proprietary BlackBerry APIs as well Any application that makes use of certain restricted functionality must be digitally signed so that it can be associated to a developer account at RIM This signing procedure guarantees the authorship of an application but does not guarantee the quality or security of the code RIM provides tools for developing applications and themes for BlackBerry Applications and themes can be loaded onto BlackBerry devices through BlackBerry World Over The Air OTA through the BlackBerry mobile browser or through BlackBerry Desktop Manager br BlackBerry devices as well as Android iOS and Windows Phone platforms have the ability to use the proprietary BlackBerry Messenger also known as BBM software for sending and receiving encrypted instant messages voice notes images and videos via BlackBerry PIN As long as your cell phone has a data plan these messages are all free of charge Some of the features of BBM include groups bar code scanning lists shared calendars BBM Music and integration with apps and games using the BBM social platform br In

devices includes full featured database management systems which can be used to support customer relationship management clients and other applications that must manage large volumes of potentially complex data br In March RIM announced an optional Android player that could play applications developed for the Android system would be available for the BlackBerry PlayBook RIM s first entry in the tablet market br On August Bloomberg News reported unofficial rumors that BlackBerry devices would be able to run Android applications when RIM brings QNX and the Android App Player to BlackBerry br On October RIM officially announced that Android applications could run unmodified on the BlackBerry tablet and the newest BlackBerry phones using the newest version of its operating system br br br Connectivity br br BlackBerry smartphones can be integrated into an organization s email system through a software package called BlackBerry Enterprise Server BES through version and BlackBerry Enterprise Service BES as of version There were no versions through Versions of BES are available for Microsoft Exchange Lotus Domino Novell GroupWise and Google Apps While individual users may be able to use a wireless provider s email services without having to install BES themselves organizations with multiple users usually run BES on their own network BlackBerry devices running BlackBerry OS or later can also be managed directly by a Microsoft Exchange Server using Exchange ActiveSync EAS policies in the same way that an iOS or Android device can EAS supports fewer management controls than BES does Some third party companies provide hosted BES solutions Every BlackBerry has a unique ID called a BlackBerry PIN which is used to identify the device to the BES BlackBerry at one time provided a free BES software called BES Express BESX br The primary BES feature is to relay email from a corporate mailbox to a BlackBerry phone The BES monitors the user s mailbox relaying new messages to the phone via BlackBerry s Network Operations Center NOC and user s wireless provider This feature is known as push email because all new emails contacts task entries memopad entries and calendar entries are pushed out to the BlackBerry device immediately as opposed to the user synchronising the data manually or having the device poll the server at intervals br BlackBerry also supports polling email through third party applications The messaging system built into the BlackBerry only understands how to receive messages from a BES or the BIS these services handle the connections to the user s mail providers Device storage also enables the mobile user to access all data off line in areas without wireless service When the user reconnects to wireless service the BES sends the latest data br A feature of the newer models of the BlackBerry is their ability to quickly track the user s current location through trilateration without the use of GPS thus saving battery life and time Trilateration can be used as a quick less battery intensive way to provide location aware applications with the co ordinates of the user However the accuracy of BlackBerry trilateration is less than that of GPS due to a number of factors including cell tower blockage by large buildings mountains or distance br BES also provides phones with TCP IP connectivity accessed through a component called MDS Mobile Data System Connection Service This allows custom application development using data streams on BlackBerry devices based on the Sun Microsystems Java ME platform br In addition BES provides network security in the form of Triple DES or more recently AES encryption of all data both email and MDS traffic that travels between the BlackBerry phone and a BlackBerry Enterprise Server br Most providers offer flat monthly pricing via special BlackBerry tariffs for unlimited data between BlackBerry units and BES In addition to receiving email organizations can make intranets or custom internal applications with unmetered traffic br With more recent versions of the BlackBerry platform the MDS is no longer a requirement for wireless data access Starting with OS or BlackBerry phones can access the Internet i e TCP IP access without an MDS formerly only email and WAP access was possible without a BES MDS The BES MDS is still required for secure email data access and applications that require WAP from carriers that do not allow WAP access br The primary alternative to using BlackBerry Enterprise Server is to use the BlackBerry Internet Service BIS BlackBerry Internet Service is available in countries internationally BlackBerry Internet Service was developed primarily for the average consumer rather than for the business consumer The service allows users to access POP IMAP and Outlook Web App not via Exchange ActiveSync email accounts without connecting through a BlackBerry Enterprise Server BES BlackBerry Internet Service allows up to email accounts to be accessed including proprietary as well as public email accounts such as Gmail Outlook Yahoo and AOL BlackBerry Internet Service also supports the push capabilities of various other BlackBerry Applications Various applications developed by RIM for BlackBerry utilise the push capabilities of BIS such as the Instant Messaging clients like Google Talk Windows Live Messenger and Yahoo Messenger The MMS PIN interactive gaming mapping and trading applications require data plans like BIS not just Wi Fi for use The service is usually provisioned through a mobile phone service provider though BlackBerry actually runs the service br br br BlackBerry PIN br br The BlackBerry PIN Personal Identification Number is an eight character hexadecimal identification number assigned to each BlackBerry device PINs cannot be changed manually on the device though BlackBerry technicians are able to reset or update a PIN server side and are locked to each specific BlackBerry BlackBerry devices can message each other using the PIN directly or by using the BlackBerry Messenger application BlackBerry PINs are tracked by BlackBerry Enterprise Servers and the BlackBerry Internet Service and are used to direct messages to a BlackBerry device Emails and any other messages such as those from the BlackBerry Push Service are typically directed to a BlackBerry device s PIN The message can then be routed by a RIM Network Operations Center and sent to a carrier which will deliver the message the last mile to the device In September RIM announced that the BlackBerry PIN would be replaced by users BlackBerry ID starting in with the launch of the BlackBerry platform br br br Competition and financial results br The BlackBerry grew swiftly in popularity during the early s and by had become highly popular and influential in North America It then gained the nickname Crackberry due to its seemingly addictive nature br As of some of the BlackBerry s main competitors included offerings from Motorola namely Motorola Q Palm Inc the iPAQ and other Pocket PCs and Nokia namely Nokia E br As of RIM held percent of the American smartphone market While the iPhone from Apple Inc quickly became popular after its launch RIM remained market leaders and was growing too with sales tripling between and In Fortune s list of the Fastest Growing Companies of RIM ranked first while the BlackBerry Curve became the best selling smartphone in the U S in br Despite market share loss on a global basis the number of active BlackBerry subscribers increased substantially through the years For example for the fiscal period during which the Apple iPhone was first released RIM reported that they had a subscriber base of million BlackBerry subscribers At the end of when Android first hit the market RIM reported that the number of BlackBerry subscribers had increased to million After the release of the Apple iPhone in September RIM CEO Thorsten Heins announced that the current global subscribers was up to million which sparked a jump in shares price br In the year RIM and Apple continued to dominate the U S smartphone market although the BlackBerry Curve had lost its spot as the single highest selling product to the iPhone GS br In the early s BlackBerry struggled to compete against both the iPhone and the Android platform after device sales peaking in its share plunged in the years after leading to speculation that it would be unable to survive as an independent going concern However it managed to maintain significant positions in some markets BlackBerry s global user base meaning active accounts declined dramatically since its peak of million in June dropping to million users in September Its market share globally had also declined to less than percent br During the report of its third quarter results on December the company said that approximately handsets had been sold down from million in the same quarter in and down from in Q of The average sale price per unit was up from to however This should continue to increase with sales of the new Android Priv device which was selling at a premium price in Canada for example In Q of BlackBerry had a net loss of million U S or cents per share but only a million net loss or three cents per share when excluding restructuring charges and other one time items br Revenue was up slightly from a year earlier at million U S vs million primarily because of software sales Chief executive officer John Chen said that he expects the company s software business to grow at percent or above the market At the time the company was not ready to provide sales figures for the Android based Priv handset which had been released only weeks earlier and in only four countries at that time but Chen offered this comment to analysts Depending on how Priv does there is a chance we could achieve or get closer to break even operating profitability for our overall device business in the fourth quarter br Due to a continuous reduction in BlackBerry users in February the BlackBerry headquarters in Waterloo Ontario Canada slashed percent of its workforce By early BlackBerry market share dropped to In Q reports indicate BlackBerry sold only units equivalent to a market share br br br Indonesian market br In BlackBerry shipped of all smartphones to Indonesia By April this had fallen to The decline in the Indonesian market share mirrors a global trend for the company of North America The retail price of Indonesian Rupiah failed to give BlackBerry the boost it needed in Indonesia The company launched the device with a discounted offer to the first purchasers which resulted in a stampede in the capital in which several people were injured BlackBerry lost market share in Indonesia despite the launch of the Z on May The new device was given a worldwide launch in the city of Jakarta and came on the back of the news that Research in Motion RIM was to cut hardware production costs by outsourcing this to Taiwan based Foxconn Group br br br Worldwide user base numbers br The number of active BlackBerry users since globally br br br Security agencies access br Research in Motion agreed to give access to private communications to the governments of United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in and India in The Saudi and UAE governments had threatened to ban certain services because their law enforcement agencies could not decrypt messages between people of interest br It was revealed as a part of the mass surveillance disclosures that the American and British intelligence agencies the National Security Agency NSA and the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ respectively have access to the user data on BlackBerry devices The agencies are able to read almost all smartphone information including SMS location e mails and notes through BlackBerry Internet Service which operates outside corporate networks and which in contrast to the data passing through internal BlackBerry services BES only compresses but does not encrypt data br Documents stated that the NSA was able to access the BlackBerry e mail system and that they could see and read SMS traffic There was a brief period in when the NSA was unable to access BlackBerry devices after BlackBerry changed the way they compress their data Access to the devices was re established by GCHQ GCHQ has a tool named SCRAPHEAP CHALLENGE with the capability of Perfect spoofing of emails from Blackberry targets br In response to the revelations BlackBerry officials stated that It is not for us to comment on media reports regarding alleged government surveillance of telecommunications traffic and added that a back door pipeline to their platform had not been established and did not exist br Similar access by the intelligence agencies to many other mobile devices exists using similar techniques to hack into them br The BlackBerry software includes support for the Dual EC DRBG CSPRNG algorithm which due to being probably backdoored by the NSA the US National Institute of Standards and Technology strongly recommends no longer be used BlackBerry Ltd has however not issued an advisory to its customers because they do not consider the probable backdoor a vulnerability BlackBerry Ltd also owns US patent which covers the technical design of the backdoor br br br Usage br br Initially the BlackBerry was mostly popular by corporate and business users By the late s however a growing number of other consumers were using it br The formerly advanced encryption capabilities of the BlackBerry Smartphone made it eligible for use by government agencies and state forces On January BlackBerry announced that older phones running BlackBerry OS and earlier will no longer work br br br Barack Obama br Former United States president Barack Obama became known for his dependence on a BlackBerry device for communication during his Presidential campaign Despite the security issues he insisted on using it even after inauguration This was seen by some as akin to a celebrity endorsement which marketing experts have estimated to be worth between million and million His usage of BlackBerry continued until around the end of his presidency br br br Hillary Clinton br The Hillary Clinton email controversy is associated with Hillary Clinton continuing to use her black colored BlackBerry after assuming the office of Secretary of State br br br Use by government forces br An example is the West Yorkshire Police which allowed the increase in the presence of police officers along the streets and a reduction in public spending given that each officer could perform desk work directly via the mobile device as well as in several other areas and situations The US Federal Government was slow to move away from the BlackBerry platform a State Department spokesperson saying in that BlackBerry devices were still the only mobile devices approved for U S missions abroad by the State Department The high encryption standard that made BlackBerry smartphones and the PlayBook tablet unique have since been implemented in other devices including most Apple devices released after the iPhone br The Bangalore City Police is one of the few police departments in India along with the Pune Police and Kochi Police to use BlackBerry devices br br br Use by transportation staff br In the United Kingdom South West Trains and Northern Rail issued BlackBerry devices to guards in order to improve the communication between control guards and passengers br In Canada Toronto and many other municipalities within Canada issued BlackBerry devices to most of its employees including but not limited to transportation technical water and operations inspection staff and all management staff in order to improve the communication between contracted construction companies its winter maintenance operations and to assist and successfully organize multimillion dollar contracts The devices were the standard mobile device to receive e mail redirected from GroupWise br As part of their Internet of Things endeavours the company announced plans of moving into the shipping industry by adapting the smartphones
