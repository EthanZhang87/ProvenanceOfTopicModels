MeeGo is a discontinued Linux distribution hosted by the Linux Foundation using source code from the operating systems Moblin produced by Intel and Maemo produced by Nokia MeeGo was primarily targeted at mobile devices and information appliances in the consumer electronics market It was designed to act as an operating system for hardware platforms such as netbooks entry level desktops nettops tablet computers mobile computing and communications devices in vehicle infotainment devices SmartTV ConnectedTV IPTV boxes smart phones and other embedded systems br Nokia wanted to make MeeGo its primary smartphone operating system in but after a change in direction it was stopped in February leaving Intel alone in the project The Linux Foundation canceled MeeGo in September in favor of Tizen which Intel then joined in collaboration with Samsung A community driven successor called Mer was formed that year A Finnish start up Jolla picked up Mer to develop a new operating system Sailfish OS and launched the Jolla Phone smartphone at the end of Another Mer derivative called Nemo Mobile was also developed br MeeGo was intended to run on a variety of hardware platforms including hand helds in car devices netbooks and televisions All platforms shared the MeeGo core with different User Experience UX layers for each type of device MeeGo was designed by combining the best of both Intel s Fedora based Moblin and Nokia s Debian based Maemo When it was first announced the then President and CEO of Nokia Olli Pekka Kallsvuo said that MeeGo would create an ecosystem which would be the best among other operating systems and would represent players from different countries br br br History br MeeGo T was first announced at Mobile World Congress in February by Intel and Nokia in a joint press conference The stated aim is to merge the efforts of Intel s Moblin and Nokia s Maemo former projects into one new common project that would drive a broad third party application ecosystem According to Intel MeeGo was developed because Microsoft did not offer comprehensive Windows support for the Atom processor On February a tech talk notice was posted about the former Maemo development project founded in and code named Harmattan that originally slated to become Maemo Those notice stated that Harmattan is now considered to be a MeeGo instance though not a MeeGo product and Nokia is giving up the Maemo branding for Harmattan on the Nokia N and beyond Any previous Maemo versions up to Maemo a k a Fremantle will still be referred to as Maemo In addition it was made clear that only the naming was given up whilst development on that Harmattan will continue so that any schedules will be met br Aminocom and Novell also played a large part in the MeeGo effort working with the Linux Foundation on their build infrastructure and official MeeGo products Amino was responsible for extending MeeGo to TV devices while Novell was increasingly introducing technology that was originally developed for openSUSE including Open Build Service ZYpp for package management and other system management tools In November AMD also joined the alliance of companies that were actively developing MeeGo br Quite noticeable changes in the project setup happened on February when Nokia officially announced to switch over to Windows Phone and thus abandoning MeeGo and the partnership Nokia CEO Stephen Elop said in an interview with Engadget What we re doing is not thinking of MeeGo as the Plan B We re thinking about MeeGo and related development work as what s the next generation Nokia did eventually release one MeeGo smartphone that year running Harmattan the Nokia N br On September it was announced by Intel employee Imad Sousou that in collaboration with Samsung Solstice MeeGo will be replaced by Tizen during br Community developers from the Mer project however started to continue MeeGo without Intel and Nokia At a later time some of the former MeeGo developers from Nokia headed for founding the company Jolla that after some time popped up with a MeeGo and its free successor Mer based OS platform they called Sailfish OS br br br System requirements br MeeGo provided support for both ARM and Intel x processors with SSSE enabled and used btrfs as the default file system br br br User interfaces br br Within the MeeGo project there are several graphical user interfaces internally called User Experiences UX br br br Netbook br The Netbook UX is a continuation of the Moblin interface It is written using the Clutter based Mx toolkit and uses the Mutter window manager br Samsung Netbook NP N use MeeGo for its operating system br MeeGo s netbook version uses several Linux applications in the background such as Evolution Email calendar Empathy instant messaging Gwibber microblogging Chromium web browser and Banshee multimedia player all integrated into the graphical user interface br br br Handset br br The Handset UX is based on Qt with GTK and Clutter included to provide compatibility for Moblin applications To support the hundreds of Hildon based Maemo applications users have to install the Hildon library ported by the maemo org community Depending on the device applications will be provided from either the Intel AppUp or the Nokia Ovi digital software distribution systems br The MeeGo Handset UX s Day prerelease was on June The preview was initially available for the Aava Mobile Intel Moorestown platform and a kickstart file provided for developers to build an image for the Nokia N br br br Smartphone br MeeGo OS v Harmattan is used in Nokia N and N phones br br br Tablet br br Intel demonstrated the Tablet UX on a Moorestown based tablet PC at COMPUTEX Taipei in early June br Since then some information appeared on MeeGo website indicating there will be a Tablet UX part of the MeeGo project but it is not known if this UX will be the one demonstrated by Intel This Tablet UX will be fully free like the rest of the MeeGo project and will be coded with Qt and the MeeGo Touch Framework Intel has revealed interest in combining Qt with Wayland instead of X in MeeGo Touch to use the latest graphics technologies supported by Linux kernel which should improve user experiences and reduce system complexity br Minimum hardware requirements are currently unknown br The WeTab runs MeeGo T with a custom user interface and was made available in September br br br In Vehicle infotainment br br The GENIVI Alliance a consortium of several car makers and their industry partners uses Moblin with Qt as base for its GENIVI Reference Platform for In Vehicle Infotainment IVI and automotive navigation system as a uniformed mobile computing platform Graham Smethurst of GENIVI Alliance and BMW Group announced in April the switch from Moblin to MeeGo br br br Smart TV br Intel planned to develop a version of MeeGo for IPTV set top boxes but had since cancelled br br br Licensing br The MeeGo framework consists of a wide variety of original and upstream components all of which are licensed under licenses certified by the Free Initiative such as the GNU General Public License To allow hardware vendors to personalize their device s user experiences the project s license policy requires that MeeGo s reference User Experience subsystems be licensed under a Permissive free software license except for libraries that extend MeeGo API s which were licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License to help discourage fragmentation or applications which can be licensed separately br br br Technical foundations br The MeeGo Core integrates elements of two other Linux distributions Maemo a distribution which Nokia derived from Debian and Moblin which Intel derived from Fedora br MeeGo uses RPM software repositories It is one of the first Linux distributions to deploy Btrfs as the default file system br Although most of the software in MeeGo s Jolla interface use the Qt widget toolkit it also supports GTK The final revision of MeeGo Qt v Qt Mobility v OpenGL ES v MeeGo also supports the Accounts SSO Maliit oFono software frameworks br MeeGo compiles software with the openSUSE Build Service br br br Derivatives br br As with Moblin before MeeGo also serves as a technology pool from which software vendors can derive new products br br br MeeGo Harmattan br Even though MeeGo was initiated as collaboration between Nokia and Intel the collaboration was formed when Nokia was already developing the next incarnation of its Maemo Linux distribution As a result the Maemo base operating system was kept intact while the Handset UX was shared with the name changed to MeeGo Harmattan br On June Nokia announced its first MeeGo Harmattan smartphone device Nokia N br br br Mer br The original Mer project was a free re implementation of Maemo ported to the Nokia Internet Tablet N When MeeGo first appeared this work was discontinued and the development effort went to MeeGo br After both Nokia and then Intel abandoned MeeGo the Mer project was revived and continued to develop the MeeGo codebase and tools It is now being developed in the open by a meritocratic community Mer provides a Core capable of running various UXs developed by various other projects and will include maintained application development APIs such as Qt EFL and HTML WAC br Some of the former MeeGo user interface were already ported to run on top of Mer such as the handset reference UX now called Nemo Mobile There are also a couple of new tablet UXes available such as Cordia and Plasma Active Mer is considered to be the legitimate successor of Meego as the other follow up project Tizen see below changed the APIs fundamentally br br br Nemo Mobile br Nemo Mobile is a community driven operating system incorporating Mer targeted at mobile phones and tablet br br br Sailfish OS br Sailfish OS is an operating system developed by the Finnish startup Jolla It also incorporates Mer After Nokia abandoned their participation in the MeeGo project the directors and core professionals from Nokia s N team left the company and together formed Jolla to bring MeeGo back into the market mainstream This effort eventually resulted in the creation of the Sailfish OS br The Sailfish OS and the Sailfish OS SDK are based on the core and the tools of the Mer core distribution which is a revival of the core of the MeeGo project a meritocracy governed and managed successor of the MeeGo OS but without its own Graphical User Interface and system kernel Sailfish includes a multi tasking user interface that Jolla intends to use to differentiate its smartphones from others and as a competitive advantage against devices that run Google s Android or Apple s iOS br Among other things the Sailfish OS is characterised by br br can be used with a wide range of devices in the same way as MeeGo br Jolla continues to use the MeeGo APIs via Mer which consists of br Qt Qt br Qt Mobility QtMob br OpenGL ES OGLES br updated version like Qt are or will be used in via Mer core br an in house Jolla GUI successor of swipe UI for smartphone devices br uses QML Qt and HTML br thanks to Mer the core can run on various hardware like Intel ARM and any other which has a kernel able to work with the Mer core br open source except for some of Jolla s UI elements Those interested in further development can become involved through the Mer project or the Sailfish Alliance or Jolla br Jolla i e the Sailfish team is an active contributor to the Mer project br br br Tizen br Although Tizen was initially announced as a continuation of the MeeGo effort there is little shared effort and architecture between these projects since Tizen inherited much more from Samsung s LiMo than from MeeGo As most of the Tizen work is happening behind closed doors and is done by Intel and Samsung engineers the people involved in the former MeeGo open source project continued their work under Mer and projects associated with it Because Tizen does not use the Qt framework which is the core part of Meego s API see above Tizen cannot technically be considered to be a derivate of MeeGo br br br SUSE and Smeegol Linux br On June Novell announced that they would ship a SUSE Linux incarnation with MeeGo s Netbook UX MeeGo User Experience graphical user interface br A MeeGo based Linux distribution with this user interface is already available from openSUSE s Goblin Team under the name Smeegol Linux this project combines MeeGo with openSUSE to get a new netbook designed Linux distribution What makes Smeegol Linux unique when compared to the upstream MeeGo or openSUSE is that this distribution is at its core based on openSUSE but has the MeeGo User Experience as well as a few other changes such as adding the Mono based Banshee media player NetworkManager powered network configuration a newer version of Evolution Express and more Any end users can also build their own customized Smeegol Linux OS using SUSE Studio br br br Fedora br Fedora contains a selection of software from the MeeGo project br br br Linpus br Linpus Technologies is working on bringing their services on top of MeeGo Netbook and MeeGo Tablet br br br Splashtop br The latest version of the instant on OS Splashtop platform by Splashtop Inc which was previously named DeviceVM Inc is compliant with MeeGo and future version of Splashtop will be based on MeeGo and will be available for commercial use in the first half of br br br Release schedule br It was announced at the Intel Developer Forum that MeeGo would follow a six month release schedule Version for Atom netbooks and a code drop for the Nokia N became available for download as of Wednesday May br br Project planning br br br Launch br In February Nokia announced a partnership with Microsoft for mobile handsets and the departure of Nokia s MeeGo team manager Alberto Torres leading to speculation as to Nokia s future participation in MeeGo development or using Windows Phone by Nokia br In September Nokia began shipping the first MeeGo smartphone Nokia N ahead of the Windows Phone launch expected later this year The first MeeGo based tablet WeTab was
