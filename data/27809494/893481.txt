magazine cover br Next Wave previews of upcoming games br Launch Point short previews of upcoming games br Review Crew review section br Review Recap recapitulation of the review scores from the preceding issue br Game Over Commentary articles on video gaming related topics br br br The Review Crew br EGM s current review scale is based on a letter grade system in which each game receives a grade based on its perceived quality Games are reviewed by one member originally a team of four until the year then a team of three and finally knocked down to one in except for the big games which were reviewed by one of a pool of editors known as The Review Crew They each assign a grade to the game and write a few paragraphs about their opinion of the game The magazine makes a strong stance that a grade of C is average Towards the top of the scale awards are given to games that average a B or higher from the three individual grade Silver awards for games averaging a grade of B to B Gold awards for games averaging a grade of A or A and Platinum awards for games with three A grades The current letter grade system replaced a long standing scale in the April issue In that system Silver went to a game with an average rating from to Gold to a game reviewed at to and Platinum to a game that received nothing but ratings Until as a matter of editorial policy the reviewers rarely gave scores of and never gave a Platinum Award That policy changed when the reviewers gave Metal Gear Solid four ratings in with an editorial published half a year before announcing the shift br In addition they gave the game or multiple games in the event of a tie as with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for Xbox and NCAA Football with the highest average score for that issue a Game of the Month award If a Game of the Month title receives a port to another console that version is disqualified from that month s award such as with Resident Evil which won the award for the Nintendo GameCube version and subsequently received the highest scores for the PlayStation port months later and Tony Hawk s Pro Skater which won the Platinum award for two separate versions of the game br In EGM began giving games that earned unanimously bad scores a Shame of the Month award As there is not always such a game in each issue this award is only given out when a game qualifies br Originally a team of four editors reviewed all the games This process was eventually dropped in favor of a system that added more reviewers to the staff so that no one person reviewed all the games for the month br Though the scores ranged from on the previous numerical scale the score of zero was almost never utilized with exceptions being Mortal Kombat Advance The Guy Game and Ping Pals br At the very end of every single magazine made during the Hsu period there is a funny random message after the absolute last text copyright disclaimer text on the last page br br br International expansion br EGM en Espa ol
