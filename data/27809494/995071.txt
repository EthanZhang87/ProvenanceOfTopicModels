realized in spring that no magazine was dedicated to computer games Although Sipe had no publishing experience he formed Golden Empire Publications in June and found investors He chose the name Computer Gaming World CGW instead of alternatives such as Computer Games or Kilobaud Warrior because he hoped that the magazine would both review games and serve as a trade publication for the industry The first issue appeared in November about the same as rivals Electronic Games and Softline Sipe s religious background led to Psalm appearing in each issue His successor as editor Johnny L Wilson was an evangelical Christian minister br br The first issues of Computer Gaming World were published from Anaheim California and sold for individually or for a year s subscription of six issues These early bimonthly issues were typically pages in length written in a newsletter style including submissions by game designers such as Joel Billings SSI Dan Bunten Ozark Software and Chris Crawford

for Windows initiative In their press release Ziff Davis indicated that much of CGW s core content and the entire staff will be transferred to the new magazine Because of these announcements Ziff Davis actions appeared more on the order of a rebranding of CGW rather than an actual cancellation The final CGW labeled issue was November for a total of published editions br On April UP Network announced the print edition of Games for Windows The Official Magazine had ceased and that all content would be moved online At the GFW Radio Penny Arcade Expo reunion Jeff Green claimed that the deal

letters strategy and columns dealing with computer games While console games are occasionally touched on these are primarily the territory of CGW s sister magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly br In two

logged their gameplay experience as each tried to best the other at a given game Tom vs Bruce sometimes featured a guest appearance by Erik Wolpaw formerly of Old Man Murray br For many years CGW never assigned scores to reviews preferring to let readers rate their favorite games through a monthly poll Scores were finally introduced in but beginning in April CGW stopped assigning quantifiable scores to its reviews In May of the same year CGW changed the name of its review section to Viewpoint and began evaluating games on a more diverse combination of factors than a its content Elements considered include the communities reaction to a game developers continued support through patches and whether a game s online component continued to grow br The reviews were formerly based on a simple five star structure with five stars marking a truly outstanding game and one star signalling virtual worthlessness Three games Postal by Robert Coffey Mistmare by Jeff Green and Dungeon Lords

PC Gaming World in the United Kingdom It was the region s third largest computer game magazine by August In journalist Stuart Campbell described PC Gaming World as a publication with a predominantly American bent thanks to its sober serious text heavy style He considered it to be out of step with the British game audience Campbell later called the magazine an oddity that was clearly aimed primarily at a something audience and beyond in comparison to more youthful rivals such as PC Gamer UK and PC Zone br In July Ziff Davis sold its publishing arm in Europe to Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen VNU including three magazines in Germany three in France and four in the United Kingdom PC Gaming World migrated with these publications At the time The Register reported that VNU saw PC Gaming World as a poor match for its business model which left the magazine s future uncertain The publisher sold PC Gaming World to Computec Media a month after the purchase citing its lack of
