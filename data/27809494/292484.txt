well suited for gaming The original N Gage was described as resembling a taco which led to its mocking nickname taco phone br Nokia introduced the N Gage QD in as a redesign of the original Classic N Gage fixing widely criticized issues and design problems However the new model was unable to make an impact and with only million units sold in its two years the N Gage and its QD model were a

the N Gage platform or N Gage in carrying on the N Gage name br br br Design br br The N Gage is used in a wide physical form with a inch TFT display in the centre with a D pad to the left and

tracking firm ChartTrack dropped the N Gage from its regular ELSPA chart commenting that The N Gage chart though still produced is of little interest to anyone Sales of the machine and its software have failed to make any impact on the market at all Although only directly reflective of the UK market this was interpreted by some as a serious blow to the N Gage as a viable gaming platform Despite this Nokia reaffirmed their commitment to the N Gage as a platform to the point where a new version of the hardware was rumored after GDC br br In November Nokia admitted that the N Gage failed selling only one third of the company s expectations The product was discontinued from Western markets in February but would continue to be marketed in India and parts of Asia Nokia did continue N
