models the iPod Touch can be used as a portable media player and a handheld gaming device but can also be used as a digital camera a web browser for email and messaging It is nearly identical in design to the iPhone and can run most iPhone third party apps from the App Store but it connects to the Internet only through Wi Fi and uses no cellular network data as it lacks a cellular modem br The iPod Touch was introduced in September and around million units were sold by May The final iPod Touch model released on May is the seventh generation model br iPod Touch models were distinguished by storage space and color all models of the same generation typically offered identical features performance and operating system upgrades An exception is the fifth generation in which the low end GB

icon animations while both the third and fourth generation iPod Touches fully support all of the main seven and other hidden features covered in the Special Event br iOS updates to iPod Touch models prior to iOS were required to be purchased by their owners Apple received criticism for this decision and for excluding certain iPhone features from the iPod Touch software Apple s position was that they could add features for free to the iPhone because it realizes revenue via subscription rather than as a one time payment as iPhones were typically sold with a carrier contract At WWDC in June as of iOS Steve Jobs announced that Apple had found a way to make subsequent OS upgrades available free to iPod Touch owners br In June iOS the fifth major release of iOS software was announced at Apple s WWDC adding notification messaging and reminder features Apple limited some features such as the voice control system Siri which was only exclusive to the iPhone S on launch and like the iPhone and

cards can be used to pay for apps instead of using a credit card br br br Third party applications br The only official way to obtain third party applications for the iPod Touch is through Apple s App Store which is a branch of iTunes Store The App Store application available in all versions of iOS from onwards allows users to browse and download applications from a single online repository hosted by Apple with the iTunes Store br Sideloading apps outside the App Store is done through the Xcode application and is intended for developers and enterprises though tools for sideloading outside of Xcode exist and are mainly used for applications not allowed in the App Store br br br Design and hardware br The iPod Touch is generally similar to the iPhone models prior to the iPhone X excluding the second and third generation iPhone SE Compared to a same generation iPhone an iPod Touch is thinner lighter and less expensive while lacking some hardware and software features Steve Jobs once referred to the iPod Touch as training wheels for the iPhone br All iPod Touch models lack biometric authentication D Touch NFC GPS an earpiece speaker and a noise cancelling microphone Depending on the generation the iPod Touch may have a smaller or inferior display and camera s compared to the iPhone Newer models fifth sixth and seventh generation lack the ambient light sensor that makes

fifth generation iPod Touch and later can forward and receive standard phone calls through a separate iPhone a feature introduced in iOS with the Wi Fi Calling feature The two devices must be linked to the same Apple ID and the iPhone s carrier must support this feature br br br Connectivity br br The iPod Touch can communicate with a computer through Wi Fi or USB using a cable and a dock connector br iPod models released before feature a pin dock connector known colloquially as the iPod dock connector which carried analog signals br The fifth sixth and seventh generations of the iPod Touch feature a new digital dock connector called Lightning which was introduced alongside the iPhone fourth generation iPad and first generation iPad Mini and the seventh generation iPod Nano models This new connector is smaller than the previous one allowing for a slimmer form factor and is reversible Various accessories are available to connect the Apple Lightning connector to the older pin dock connector or USB although not all old accessories will work because the Lightning connector cannot handle analog signals br br br User made modifications br br Like all of Apple s iOS devices the iPod Touch is a tightly controlled or closed platform Communication between apps is limited and controlled and Apple is the only authorized software vendor for firmware and applications Hackers have attempted to jailbreak all iOS devices to enable forbidden or unsupported features such as multitasking in iOS versions before themes for the home screen and enabling the battery percentage indicator limited to the iPhone prior to the seventh generation iPod Touch Jailbreaks for the iPod Touch first surfaced a month after the original model was released in September when hackers released
