billion related to the acquisition Based on Vodafone s accounts experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over billion br The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests beginning in October outside Vodafone shops across the UK organised under the banner of UK Uncut The protests caused the closure of various stores across the UK br In

Luxembourg s laws which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax and Swiss laws which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies According to the expose this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill of a little over billion It said Vodafone publishes a single combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches For the one
