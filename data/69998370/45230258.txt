Broadway musical However in a interview composer Alan Menken stated the planned film version of the Beauty and the Beast stage musical was canned br By April Walt Disney Pictures had already begun developing a new live action version of Beauty and the Beast after making other live action fantasy films such as Alice in Wonderland Maleficent Cinderella and The Jungle Book Two months later Bill Condon signed on to direct the film from a script by Evan Spiliotopoulos Later in September of that same year Stephen Chbosky who directed Emma Watson in The Perks of Being a Wallflower was hired to re write the script br Before Condon was hired to direct the film Disney approached him with a proposal to remake the film in a more radical way as Universal Studios had remade Snow White and the Huntsman Condon later explained that after Frozen opened the studio saw that there was this big international audience for an old school musical approach But initially they said We re interested in a musical to a degree but only half full of songs My interest was taking that film and doing it in this new medium live action as a full on musical movie So I backed out for a minute and they came back and said No no no we get it let s pursue it that way Walt Disney Pictures President of Production Sean Bailey credited Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F Horn with the decision to make the film as a musical We worked on this for five or six years and for months to two years Beauty was a serious dramatic project and the scripts were written to reflect that It wasn t a musical at that time But we just couldn t get it to click and it was Alan Horn who championed the idea of owning the Disney of it all We realized there was a competitive advantage in the songs What is wrong with making adults feel like kids again The film s ending originally featured Gaston being cursed by the Enchantress though the idea was scrapped br br br Casting br In January it was announced that Emma Watson had been cast as Belle the female lead She was the first and only choice of Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F Horn who had previously run Warner Bros which released the eight Harry Potter films that starred Watson as Hermione Granger Watson had previously been attached to star in Guillermo del Toro s film adaptation of the original fairy tale for Warner Bros but the project never materialized Susan Egan who originated the role of Belle in the Broadway musical commented on the casting of Watson as perfect while Paige O Hara who voiced Belle in the original animated film said I think that if I were producing that movie Emma Watson would ve been my first choice for Belle I was just really happy they went with Emma She s got the intelligence she s got the humor I think she s going to be really really special Watson was paid million upfront with an agreement that her final take home pay could rise as high as million if the film generated gross box office income similar to the million worldwide gross of Maleficent br Two months later Luke Evans and Dan Stevens were reported to be in talks to play Gaston and the Beast respectively and Watson confirmed their casting the next day on Twitter Idris Elba also auditioned for the role of Gaston The rest of the principal cast including Josh Gad Emma Thompson Kevin Kline Audra McDonald Ian McKellen Gugu Mbatha Raw Ewan McGregor and Stanley Tucci were announced between March and April to play LeFou Mrs Potts Maurice Madame de Garderobe Cogsworth Plumette Lumi re and Cadenza respectively br br br Filming br Principal photography began on May taking place at Shepperton Studios in Surrey England nearby in the village of Cranleigh and in Lacock Wiltshire The massive movie set of the fictional provincial town of Villeneuve named after the author of the original fairy tale Gabrielle Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve was inspired by the town of Conques in southern France and measured square feet m br Filming with the principal actors concluded on August Six days later co producer Jack Morrissey confirmed that production had officially wrapped The castle in the film was inspired by the Ch teau de Chambord in France br The Beast was portrayed with a more traditional motion capture puppeteering for the body and the physical orientation where actor Dan Stevens was in a forty pound gray suit on stilts for much of the film The facial capture for the Beast was done separately in order to communicate the subtleties of the human face and capture the thought that occurs to him which gets through to the eyes which are the last human element in the Beast The castle servants who are transformed into household objects were created with CGI animation br One concern was that one wrong step could lead to one of Stevens s steel stilts crushing one of Watson s feet which could have severely disrupted production To minimize that risk the actors spent three months in pre production and rigorously rehearsed their scenes For the film s iconic dance scene they initially practiced waltz steps on the ground then Stevens learned how to walk on stilts and then he learned how to waltz on stilts br Prior to the film s release Bill Condon refilmed one certain sequence in the Days in the Sun number due to confusion among test audiences caused by actress Harriet Jones who looked similar to Hattie Morahan who portrayed Agathe In the original version of the scene it was Jones character the Prince s mother who sings the first verse of the song with Rudi Goodman playing the young Prince and Henry Garrett playing his father but in the reshot version of the scene the singing part is given to the Prince now played by Adam Mitchell The King was also recast to Tom Turner although Harriet Jones was still the Queen albeit with dark hair Both Goodman and Garrett s names were mistakenly featured in the original theatrical release s credits but was later corrected in home releases br br br Music br br When released in Beauty and the Beast marked a turning point for Walt Disney Pictures by appealing to millions of fans with its Academy Award winning musical score by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken In Bill Condon s opinion that original score was the key reason he agreed to direct a live action version of the film That score had more to reveal he says You look at the songs and there s not a clunker in the group In fact Frank Rich described it as the best Broadway musical of The animated version was already darker and more modern than the previous Disney fairy tales Take that vision put it into a new medium make it a radical reinvention something not just for the stage because it s not just being literal now other elements come into play It s not just having real actors do it br Condon initially prepared on only drawing inspiration from the original film but he also planned to include most of the songs composed by Menken Ashman and Tim Rice from the Broadway musical with the intention of making the film as a straight forward live action large budget movie musical Menken returned to score the film s music which features songs from the original film by him and Ashman plus new material written by him and Rice Menken said the film would not include songs that were written for the Broadway musical and instead created four new songs However an instrumental version of the song Home which was written for the musical is used during the scene where Belle first enters her room in the castle br On January both Disney and Celine Dion singer of the original Beauty and the Beast duet song with singer Peabo Bryson confirmed that Dion would be performing one of the new original songs How Does a Moment Last Forever to play over the end titles She originally had doubts about whether or not to record the song due to the recent death of her husband and manager Ren Ang lil who had previously helped her secure the pop duet While ultimately accepting the opportunity she said The first Beauty and the Beast decision was made with my husband Now I m making decisions on my own It s a little bit harder I couldn t say yes right away because I felt like I was kind of cheating in a way She eventually felt compelled to record the song because of the impact Beauty and the Beast has had on her career According to Dion I was at the beginning of my career it put me on the map it put me where I am today Also Josh Groban was announced to be performing the new original song Evermore six days later br The film features a remake of the original song recorded as a duet by Ariana Grande and John Legend Grande and Legend s updated version of the title song is faithful to the original Grammy winning duet performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson for the Disney film br

and Kline as well the special effects costume designs and the sets while commending the inclusion of Gad s character of LeFou as the first LGBT character in Disney Owen Gleiberman of Variety in his positive review of the film wrote It s a lovingly crafted movie and in many ways a good one but before that it s an enraptured piece of old is new nostalgia Gleiberman compared Stevens portrayal of the Beast to a royal version of the titular character in The Elephant Man and the version of the Beast in Jean Cocteau s original adaptation A O Scott of The New York Times praised the performance of Stevens and wrote It looks good moves gracefully and leaves a clean and invigorating aftertaste I almost didn t recognize the flavor I think the name for it is joy br However The Washington Post s Ann Hornaday gave Watson s performance a mixed review describing it as alert and solemn while deeming her singing abilities serviceable enough to get the job done Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times awarded the film three and a half out of five and lauded the performances of Watson and Thompson which he drew a comparison to Paige O Hara s and Angela Lansbury s performances in the animated version while appreciating the performances of the other cast He also commented on the advantage of its using both motion capture and CGI technology writing Almost overwhelmingly lavish beautifully staged and performed with exquisite timing and grace by the outstanding cast Mike Ryan of Uproxx praised the cast production design and the new songs while noting the film doesn t try anything different saying There s certainly nothing that new about this version of Beauty and the Beast well except it isn t a cartoon anymore but it s a good recreation of a classic animated film that should leave most die hards satisfied In her A review Nancy Churnin of The Dallas Morning News praised the film s emotional and thematic depth remarking There s an emotional authenticity in director Bill Condon s live action Beauty and the Beast film that helps you rediscover Disney s beloved animated film and stage show in fresh stirring ways James Berardinelli of ReelViews described the version as enthralling br Brian Truitt of USA Today commended the performances of Evans Gad McGregor and Thompson alongside Condon s affinity with musicals the production design visual effects featured in some of the song numbers including new songs made by the composers Alan Menken and Tim Rice particularly Evermore which he described the new song with a potential for an Academy Award for Best Original Song Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film three out of four deeming it an exhilarating gift while he remarked that Beauty and the Beast does justice to Disney s animated classic even if some of the magic is M I A Missing in Action Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine gave a positive review with a description as Wild Vivid and Crazy Beautiful as she wrote Nearly everything about Beauty and the Beast is larger than life to the point that watching it can be a little overwhelming and added that it s loaded with feeling almost like a brash interpretive dance expressing the passion and elation little girls and some boys too must have felt upon seeing the earlier version The San Francisco Chronicle s Mick LaSalle struck an affirmative tone calling it one of the joys of stating that Beauty and the Beast creates an air of enchantment from its first moments one that lingers and builds and takes on qualities of warmth and generosity as it goes along while referring the film as beautiful and also praised the film for its emotional and psychological tone as well Stevens motion capture performance br Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph gave the film four out of five and wrote that It dazzles on this chocolate box of a picture that feels almost greedy yet to make this film work down to a sugar rush finale to grasp the nettle and make an out an out bells and whistles musical while he praised the performances of Watson McKellen Thompson McGregor Evans and Gad Mark Hughes of Forbes also praised the film which he wrote could revive the story in a faithful but entirely new and unique way elevating the material beyond expectations establishing itself as a cinematic equal to the original He also complimented the importance of undertaking a renowned yet problematic masterpiece as well addressing changes in the elements of the story while acknowledging the film s effectiveness in resonating to the audiences br Several critics regarded the film as inferior to its animated predecessor David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that the film feels particularly egregious in part because it s so slavishly devoted to the original every time it falls short of its predecessor which is quite often it s hard not to notice Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said that the film takes our knowledge and our interest in the material for granted It zips from one number to another throwing a ton of frenetically edited eye candy at the screen charmlessly Phillips wrote that the film featured some less conspicuously talented performers Watson primarily who are stuck doing karaoke or motion capture work of middling quality though he praised Kline s performance as the best sweetest thing in the movie he brings a sense of calm droll authority Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that the film was lit in that fascinatingly artificial honey glow light and it runs smoothly on rails the kind of rails that bring in and out the stage sets for the lucrative Broadway touring version

writing that the new songs were not transporting He felt the film needed more life and depth Dana Schwartz of The New York Observer felt that some of the characters such as Gaston and the Beast had been watered down from the film and that the additional backstory elements failed to advance the plot or theme in any meaningful way while adding considerable bloat Schwartz considered the singing of the cast to be adequate but felt that their voices should have been dubbed over especially for the complex songs br Robert W Butler of The Charlotte Observer called it big well designed tuneful and finally romantic but said it was not as good as the original Chris Hunneysett of the Daily Mirror called the film irresistible and said There is excellence everywhere from the superb cast to sumptuous costumes and detailed design br In a interview with The Hollywood Reporter s historical podcast It Happened in Hollywood Linda Woolverton who wrote the animated film revealed that she was not totally thrilled with the remake She said I didn t think it was exactly true to the mythology of the storytelling and I m not happy that I don t get to participate Who would be Woolverton also questioned the change that saw The Beast come and go from his castle via a magic mirror She said The castle is supposed to be impenetrable After that the mythology didn t work for me br br br Accolades br br br Controversies br br br Gay character br Controversy arose after director Bill Condon said there was a gay moment in the film when LeFou briefly waltzes with Stanley one of Gaston s friends In a later interview with Vulture Condon stated Can I just say I m sort of sick of this Because you ve seen the movie it s such a tiny thing and it s been overblown Condon also added that Beauty and the Beast features much more diversity than just the highly talked about LeFou That was so important We have interracial couples this is a celebration of everybody s individuality and that s what s exciting about it GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis praised the move stating It is a small moment in the film but it is a huge leap forward for the film industry br In Russia Vitaly Milonov agitated the culture minister for banning the film but instead it was given a rating children under the age of can only be admitted to see it in theaters with accompanying adults Additionally a theater in Henagar Alabama did not screen the film because of the subplot In Malaysia the Film Censorship Board insisted the gay moment scene be cut prompting an indefinite postponement of its release by Disney followed by their decision to withdraw it completely if it could not be released uncensored The studio moved the release date to March to allow more time for Malaysia s censor board to make a decision on whether or not to release the film without changes The distributors and producers then submitted an appeal to the Film Appeal Committee of Malaysia which allowed the film to be released without any

which owns most of the cinemas in the country A board member of the company stated that the Ministry of Information s censorship department had requested it to stop its screening and edit it for things the Ministry deemed offensive br The film also received criticism over its portrayal of LeFou as some felt that it was used as a way of teasing LGBTQ audiences without providing adequate representation with his exclusively gay moment being his three seconds dancing with another man at the end of the film br In response to the decision of making LeFou gay Linda Woolverton the screenwriter behind the animated film told The Hollywood Reporter in that Was he in love with Gaston No He was just a toady and besotted with a person he could never be br br br Belle and the Beast s relationship br Disney has sought to portray Belle as an empowered young woman but a debate over whether it is possible for a captor to fall in love with their prisoner and whether this is a problematic theme has resulted As was the case with the original animated film one argument is that Belle has Stockholm syndrome a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity Before signing on to the film Emma Watson did study whether Belle is trapped in an abusive relationship with the Beast and concluded that she does not think the criticism fits this version of the fairy tale Watson described Stockholm syndrome as where a prisoner will take on the characteristics of and fall in love with the captor She went on to assert that Belle actively argues and disagrees with the Beast constantly She has none of the characteristics of someone with Stockholm syndrome because she keeps her independence she keeps that freedom of thought further adding that Belle defiantly gives as good as she gets before forming a friendship and eventual romance with the Beast br Psychiatrist Frank Ochberg who was responsible for defining the term Stockholm syndrome said he does not think Belle exhibits the trauma symptoms of prisoners with the syndrome because she does not experience a period of feeling that she is going to die Some therapists while acknowledging that the pairing s relationship does not meet the clinical definition of Stockholm syndrome argue that the relationship depicted is dysfunctional and abusive and does not model healthy romantic relationships for young viewers Following this viewpoint Constance Grady of Vox stated that Jeanne Marie Leprince de Beaumont s Beauty and the Beast was a fairy tale originally written to prepare young girls in eighteenth century France for arranged marriages and that the power disparity is amplified in the Disney version Additionally Anna Menta of Elite
