The Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States and its principal federal law enforcement agency An agency of the United States Department of Justice the FBI is a member of the U S Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence A leading U S counterterrorism counterintelligence and criminal investigative organization the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than categories of federal crimes br Although many of the FBI s functions are unique its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI and NCA the New Zealand GCSB and the Russian FSB Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency CIA which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad the FBI is primarily a domestic agency maintaining field offices in major cities throughout the United States and more than resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation At an FBI field office a senior level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the director of National Intelligence br Despite its domestic focus the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint operating Legal Attache LEGAT offices and sub offices in U S embassies and consulates across the globe These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas just as the CIA has a limited domestic function These activities generally require coordination across government agencies br The FBI was established in as the Bureau of Investigation the BOI or BI for short Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI in The FBI headquarters is the J Edgar Hoover Building in Washington D C The FBI has a List of the Top criminals br br br Mission priorities and budget br br br Mission br The mission of the FBI is to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States br br br Priorities br Currently the FBI s top priorities are br br Protect the United States from terrorist attacks br Protect the United States against foreign intelligence operations espionage and cyber operations br Combat significant cybercriminal activity br Combat public corruption at all levels br Protect civil rights br Combat transnational criminal enterprises br Combat major white collar crime br Combat significant violent crime br br br Budget br In the fiscal year the Bureau s total budget was approximately billion br In the Authorization and Budget Request to Congress for fiscal year the FBI asked for Of that money would be used for Salaries and Expenses S E and for Construction The S E program saw an increase of br br br History br br br Background br In the National Bureau of Criminal Identification was founded providing agencies across the country with information to identify known criminals The assassination of President William McKinley created a perception that the United States was under threat from anarchists The Departments of Justice and Labor had been keeping records on anarchists for years but President Theodore Roosevelt wanted more power to monitor them br The Justice Department had been tasked with the regulation of interstate commerce since though it lacked the staff to do so It had made little effort to relieve its staff shortage until the Oregon land fraud scandal at the turn of the th century President Roosevelt instructed Attorney General Charles Bonaparte to organize an autonomous investigative service that would report only to the Attorney General br Bonaparte reached out to other agencies including the U S Secret Service for personnel investigators in particular On May Congress forbade this use of Treasury employees by the Justice Department citing fears that the new agency would serve as a secret police department Again at Roosevelt s urging Bonaparte moved to organize a formal Bureau of Investigation which would then have its own staff of special agents br br br Creation of BOI br The Bureau of Investigation BOI was created on July Attorney General Bonaparte using Department of Justice expense funds hired thirty four people including some veterans of the Secret Service to work for a new investigative agency Its first chief the title is now director was Stanley Finch Bonaparte notified the Congress of these actions in December br The bureau s first official task was visiting and making surveys of the houses of prostitution in preparation for enforcing the White Slave Traffic Act or Mann Act passed on June In the bureau was renamed the United States Bureau of Investigation br br br Creation of FBI br The following year the BOI was linked to the Bureau of Prohibition and rechristened the Division of Investigation DOI it became an independent service within the Department of Justice in In the same year its name was officially changed from the Division of Investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI br br br J Edgar Hoover as FBI director br br J Edgar Hoover served as FBI director from to a combined years with the BOI DOI and FBI He was chiefly responsible for creating the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory or the FBI Laboratory which officially opened in as part of his work to professionalize investigations by the government Hoover was substantially involved in most major cases and projects that the FBI handled during his tenure But as detailed below his tenure as Bureau director proved to be highly controversial especially in its later years After Hoover s death Congress passed legislation that limited the tenure of future FBI directors to ten years br Early homicide investigations of the new agency included the Osage Indian murders During the War on Crime of the s FBI agents apprehended or killed a number of notorious criminals who committed kidnappings bank robberies and murders throughout the nation including John Dillinger Baby Face Nelson Kate Ma Barker Alvin Creepy Karpis and George Machine Gun Kelly br Other activities of its early decades focused on the scope and influence of the white supremacist group Ku Klux Klan a group with which the FBI was evidenced to be working in the Viola Liuzzo lynching case Earlier through the work of Edwin Atherton the BOI claimed to have successfully apprehended an entire army of Mexican neo revolutionaries under the leadership of General Enrique Estrada in the mid s east of San Diego California br Hoover began using wiretapping in the s during Prohibition to arrest bootleggers In the case Olmstead v United States in which a bootlegger was caught through telephone tapping the United States Supreme Court ruled that FBI wiretaps did not violate the Fourth Amendment as unlawful search and seizure as long as the FBI did not break into a person s home to complete the tapping After Prohibition s repeal Congress passed the Communications Act of which outlawed non consensual phone tapping but did allow bugging In the case Nardone v United States the court ruled that due to the law evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court After Katz v United States overturned Olmstead Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control Act allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations as long as they obtained warrants beforehand br br br National security br Beginning in the s and continuing into the s the bureau investigated cases of espionage against the United States and its allies Eight Nazi agents who had planned sabotage operations against American targets were arrested and six were executed Ex parte Quirin under their sentences Also during this time a joint US UK code breaking effort called The Venona Project with which the FBI was heavily involved broke Soviet diplomatic and intelligence communications codes allowing the US and British governments to read Soviet communications This effort confirmed the existence of Americans working in the United States for Soviet intelligence Hoover was administering this project but he failed to notify the Central Intelligence Agency CIA of it until Another notable case was the arrest of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in The discovery of Soviet spies operating in the US motivated Hoover to pursue his longstanding concern with the threat he perceived from the American Left br br br Japanese American internment br In the Bureau began compiling a custodial detention list with the names of those who would be taken into custody in the event of war with Axis nations The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders as the FBI investigation built on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the FBI Index list Robert Shivers head of the Honolulu office obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor Mass arrests and searches of homes in most cases conducted without warrants began a few hours after the attack and over the next several weeks more than Issei men were taken into FBI custody br On February President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order authorizing the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast FBI Director Hoover opposed the subsequent mass removal and confinement of Japanese Americans authorized under Executive Order but Roosevelt prevailed The vast majority went along with the subsequent exclusion orders but in a handful of cases where Japanese Americans refused to obey the new military regulations FBI agents handled their arrests The Bureau continued surveillance on Japanese Americans throughout the war conducting background checks on applicants for resettlement outside camp and entering the camps usually without the permission of War Relocation Authority officials and grooming informants to monitor dissidents and troublemakers After the war the FBI was assigned to protect returning Japanese Americans from attacks by hostile white communities br br br Sex deviates program br According to Douglas M Charles the FBI s sex deviates program began on April when J Edgar Hoover forwarded to the White House to the U S Civil Service Commission and to branches of the armed services a list of alleged federal employees who had allegedly been arrested in Washington D C since on charges of sexual irregularities On June Hoover expanded the program by issuing a memo establishing a uniform policy for the handling of the increasing number of reports and allegations concerning present and past employees of the United States Government who assertedly sic are sex deviates The program was expanded to include non government jobs According to Athan Theoharis In he Hoover had unilaterally instituted a Sex Deviates program to purge alleged homosexuals from any position in the federal government from the lowliest clerk to the more powerful position of White house aide On May Executive Order went into effect The program was expanded further by this executive order by making all federal employment of homosexuals illegal On July the FBI forwarded to the U S Civil Service Commission information from the sex deviates program Between and pages in the sex deviates program collected between and the mid s were destroyed by FBI officials br br br Civil rights movement br During the s and s FBI officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders whom they believed either had communist ties or were unduly influenced by communists or fellow travelers In for example Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr T R M Howard a civil rights leader surgeon and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of George W Lee Emmett Till and other blacks in the South The FBI carried out controversial domestic surveillance in an operation it called the COINTELPRO from COunter INTELligence PROgram It was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the United States including both militant and non violent organizations Among its targets was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference a leading civil rights organization whose clergy leadership included the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr br br The FBI frequently investigated King In the mid s King began to criticize the Bureau for giving insufficient attention to the use of terrorism by white supremacists Hoover responded by publicly calling King the most notorious liar in the United States In his memoir Washington Post journalist Carl Rowan asserted that the FBI had sent at least one anonymous letter to King encouraging him to commit suicide Historian Taylor Branch documents an anonymous November suicide package sent by the Bureau that combined a letter to the civil rights leader telling him You are done There is only one way out for you with audio recordings of King s sexual indiscretions br In March the residential office of an FBI agent in Media Pennsylvania was burgled by a group calling itself the Citizens Commission to Investigate the FBI Numerous files were taken and distributed to a range of newspapers including The Harvard Crimson The files detailed the FBI s extensive COINTELPRO program which included investigations into lives of ordinary citizens including a black student group at a Pennsylvania military college and the daughter of Congressman Henry S Reuss of Wisconsin The country was jolted by the revelations which included assassinations of political activists and the actions were denounced by members of the Congress including House Majority Leader Hale Boggs The phones of some members of the Congress including Boggs had allegedly been tapped br br br Kennedy s assassination br When President John F Kennedy was shot and killed the jurisdiction fell to the local police departments until President Lyndon B Johnson directed the FBI to take over the investigation To ensure clarity about the responsibility for investigation of homicides of federal officials Congress passed a law in that included investigations of such deaths of federal officials especially by homicide within FBI jurisdiction br br br Organized crime br br In response to organized crime on August the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program The national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to Washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers After the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act or RICO Act took effect the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition organized groups which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns All the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations using the provisions provided in the RICO Act Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups Although Hoover initially denied the existence of a National Crime Syndicate in the United States the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families including those headed by Sam Giancana and John Gotti The RICO Act is still used today for all organized crime and any individuals who may fall under the Act s provisions br In a congressional committee called the FBI s organized crime informant program one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement The FBI allowed four innocent men to be convicted of the March gangland murder of Edward Teddy Deegan in order to protect Vincent Flemmi an FBI informant Three of the men were sentenced to death which was later reduced to life in prison and the fourth defendant was sentenced to life in prison Two of the four men died in prison after serving almost years and two others were released after serving and years In July U S District Judge Nancy Gertner in Boston found that the Bureau had helped convict the four men using false witness accounts given by mobster Joseph Barboza The U S Government was ordered to pay million in damages to the four defendants br br br Special FBI teams br br In the FBI formed an elite unit to help with problems that might arise at the Summer Olympics to be held in Los Angeles particularly terrorism and major crime This was a result of the Summer Olympics in Munich Germany when terrorists murdered the Israeli athletes Named the Hostage Rescue Team or HRT it acts as a dedicated FBI SWAT team dealing primarily with counter terrorism scenarios Unlike the special agents serving on local FBI SWAT teams HRT does not conduct investigations Instead HRT focuses solely on additional tactical proficiency and capabilities Also formed in was the Computer Analysis and Response Team or CART br From the end of the s to the early s the FBI reassigned more than agents from foreign counter intelligence duties to violent crime and made violent crime the sixth national priority With cuts to other well established departments and because terrorism was no longer considered a threat after the end of the Cold War the FBI assisted local and state police forces in tracking fugitives who had crossed state lines which is a federal offense The FBI Laboratory helped develop DNA testing continuing its pioneering role in identification that began with its fingerprinting system in br br br Notable efforts in the s br br On May FBI SWAT and HRT personnel in Los Angeles County California aided local officials in securing peace within the area during the Los Angeles riots HRT operators for instance spent days conducting vehicle mounted patrols throughout Los Angeles before returning to Virginia br Between and the FBI increased its counter terrorism role following the first World Trade Center bombing in New York City the Oklahoma City bombing and the arrest of the Unabomber in Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted However Justice Department investigations into the FBI s roles in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents were found to have been obstructed by agents within the Bureau During the Summer Olympics in Atlanta Georgia the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing It has settled a dispute with Richard Jewell who was a private security guard at the venue along with some media organizations in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation this had briefly led to his being wrongly suspected of the bombing br After Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act CALEA the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA and the Economic Espionage Act EEA the FBI followed suit and underwent a technological upgrade in just as it did with its CART team in Computer Investigations and Infrastructure Threat Assessment Center CITAC and the National Infrastructure Protection Center NIPC were created to deal with the increase in Internet related problems such as computer viruses worms and other malicious programs that threatened U S operations With these developments the FBI increased its electronic surveillance in public safety and national security investigations adapting to the telecommunications advancements that changed the nature of such problems br br br September attacks br br During the September attacks on the World Trade Center FBI agent Leonard W Hatton Jr was killed during the rescue effort while helping the rescue personnel evacuate the occupants of the South Tower and he stayed when it collapsed Within months after the attacks FBI Director Robert Mueller who had been sworn in a week before the attacks called for a re engineering of FBI structure and operations He made countering every federal crime a top priority including the prevention of terrorism countering foreign intelligence operations addressing cybersecurity threats other high tech crimes protecting civil rights combating public corruption organized crime white collar crime and major acts of violent crime br In February Robert Hanssen was caught selling information to the Russian government It was later learned that Hanssen who had reached a high position within the FBI had been selling intelligence since as early as He pleaded guilty to espionage and received a life sentence in but the incident led many to question the security practices employed by the FBI There was also a claim that Hanssen might have contributed information that led to the September attacks br The Commission s final report on July stated that the FBI and Central Intelligence Agency CIA were both partially to blame for not pursuing intelligence reports that could have prevented the September attacks In its most damning assessment the report concluded that the country had not been well served by either agency and listed numerous recommendations for changes within the FBI While the FBI did accede to most of the recommendations including oversight by the new director of National Intelligence some former members of the Commission publicly criticized the FBI in October claiming it was resisting any meaningful changes br On July The Washington Post published excerpts from UCLA Professor Amy Zegart s book Spying Blind The CIA the FBI and the Origins of The Post reported from Zegart s book that government documents showed that both the CIA and the FBI had missed potential chances to disrupt the terrorist attacks of September The primary reasons for the failures included agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas inappropriate incentives for promotion and a lack of cooperation between the FBI CIA and the rest of the United States Intelligence Community The book blamed the FBI s decentralized structure which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices The book suggested that the FBI had not evolved into an effective counter terrorism or counter intelligence agency due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change For example FBI personnel practices continued to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff classifying intelligence analysts alongside the FBI s auto mechanics and janitors br br br Faulty bullet analysis br For over years the FBI crime lab in Quantico had believed that lead alloys used in bullets had unique chemical signatures It was analyzing the bullets with the goal of matching them chemically not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory but also to a single box of bullets The National Academy of Sciences conducted an month independent review of comparative bullet lead analysis In its National Research Council published a report whose conclusions called into question years of FBI testimony It found the analytic model used by the FBI for interpreting results was deeply flawed and the conclusion that bullet fragments could be matched to a box of ammunition was so overstated that it was misleading under the rules of evidence One year later the FBI decided to stop conducting bullet lead analyses br After a Minutes The Washington Post investigation in November two years later the Bureau agreed to identify review and release all pertinent cases and notify prosecutors about cases in which faulty testimony was given br br br Technology br In the FBI formed the National Domestic Communications Assistance Center to develop technology for assisting law enforcement with technical knowledge regarding communication services technologies and electronic surveillance br br br January th United States Capitol attack br An FBI informant who participated in the January attack on democratic institutions in Washington D C later testified in support of the Proud boys who were part of the plot Revelations about the informant raised fresh questions about intelligence failures by the FBI before the riot According to the Brennan Center and Senate committees the FBI s response to white supremacist violence was woefully inadequate The FBI has long been suspected to have turned a blind eye towards right wing extremists while disseminating conspiracy theories on the origin of COVID br br br Organization br br br Organizational structure br br The FBI is organized into functional branches and the Office of the Director which contains most administrative offices An executive assistant director manages each branch Each branch is then divided into offices and divisions each headed by an assistant director The various divisions are further divided into sub branches led by deputy assistant directors Within these sub branches there are various sections headed by section chiefs Section chiefs are ranked analogous to special agents in charge Four of the branches report to the deputy director while two

Attorney General to appoint officials to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States Other federal statutes give the FBI the authority and responsibility to investigate specific crimes br The FBI s chief tool against organized crime is the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations RICO Act The FBI is also charged with the responsibility of enforcing compliance of the United States Civil Rights Act of and investigating violations of the act in addition to prosecuting such violations with the United States Department of Justice DOJ The FBI also shares concurrent jurisdiction with the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA in the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act of br The USA PATRIOT Act increased the powers allotted to the FBI especially in wiretapping and monitoring of Internet activity One of the most controversial provisions of the act is the so called sneak and peek provision granting the FBI powers to search a house while the residents are away and not requiring them to notify the residents for several weeks afterward Under the PATRIOT Act s provisions the FBI also resumed inquiring into the library records of those who are suspected of terrorism something it had supposedly not done since the s br In the early s Senate hearings were held to examine FBI undercover operations in the wake of the Abscam controversy which had allegations of entrapment of elected officials As a result in the following years a number of guidelines were issued to constrain FBI activities br Information obtained through an FBI investigation is presented to the appropriate U S Attorney or Department of Justice official who decides if prosecution or other action is warranted br The FBI often works in conjunction with other federal agencies including the U S Coast Guard USCG and U S Customs and Border Protection CBP in seaport and airport security and the National Transportation Safety Board in investigating airplane crashes and other critical incidents Immigration and Customs Enforcement s Homeland Security Investigations HSI has nearly the same amount of investigative manpower as the FBI and investigates the largest range of crimes In the wake of the September attacks then Attorney General Ashcroft assigned the FBI as the designated lead organization in terrorism investigations after the creation of the U S Department of Homeland Security HSI and the FBI are both integral members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force br br br Indian reservations br br The federal government has the primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting serious crime on Indian reservations br br The FBI does not specifically list crimes in Native American land as one of its priorities Often serious crimes have been either poorly investigated or prosecution has been declined Tribal courts can impose sentences of up to three years under certain restrictions br br br Infrastructure br br The FBI is headquartered at the J Edgar Hoover Building in Washington D C with field offices in major cities across the United States The FBI also maintains over resident agencies across the United States as well as over legal attach s at United States embassies and consulates Many specialized FBI functions are located at facilities in Quantico Virginia as well as a data campus in Clarksburg West Virginia where million sets of fingerprints from across the United States are stored along with others collected by American authorities from prisoners in Saudi Arabia and Yemen Iraq and Afghanistan The FBI is in process of moving its Records Management Division which processes Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests to Winchester Virginia br According to The Washington Post the FBI is building a vast repository controlled by people who work in a top secret vault on the fourth floor of the J Edgar Hoover Building in Washington This one stores the profiles of tens of thousands of Americans and legal residents who are not accused of any crime What they have done is appear to be acting suspiciously to a town sheriff a traffic cop or even a neighbor br The FBI Laboratory established with the formation of the BOI did not appear in the J Edgar Hoover Building until its completion in The lab serves as the primary lab for most DNA biological and physical work Public tours of FBI headquarters ran through the FBI laboratory workspace before the move to the J Edgar Hoover Building The services the lab conducts include Chemistry Combined DNA Index System CODIS Computer Analysis and Response DNA Analysis Evidence Response Explosives Firearms and Tool marks Forensic Audio Forensic Video Image Analysis Forensic Science Research Forensic Science Training Hazardous Materials Response Investigative and Prospective Graphics Latent Prints Materials Analysis Questioned Documents Racketeering Records Special Photographic Analysis Structural Design and Trace Evidence The services of the FBI Laboratory are used by many state local and international agencies free of charge The lab also maintains a second lab at the FBI Academy br The FBI Academy located in Quantico Virginia is home to the communications and computer laboratory the FBI utilizes It is also where new agents are sent for training to become FBI special agents Going through the week course is required for every special agent First opened for use in the facility is located on acres hectares of woodland The Academy trains state and local law enforcement agencies which are invited to the law enforcement training center The FBI units that reside at Quantico are the Field and Police Training Unit Firearms Training Unit Forensic Science Research and Training Center Technology Services Unit TSU Investigative Training Unit Law Enforcement Communication Unit Leadership and Management Science Units LSMU Physical Training Unit New Agents Training Unit NATU Practical Applications Unit PAU the Investigative Computer Training Unit and the College of Analytical Studies br br In the FBI began the Trilogy project to upgrade its outdated information technology IT infrastructure This project originally scheduled to take three years and cost around million ended up over budget and behind schedule Efforts to deploy modern computers and networking equipment were generally successful but attempts to develop new investigation software outsourced to Science Applications International Corporation SAIC were not Virtual Case File or VCF as the software was known was plagued by poorly defined goals and repeated changes in management br In January more than two years after the software was originally planned for completion the FBI abandoned the project At least million and much more by some estimates was spent on the project which never became operational The FBI has been forced to continue using its decade old Automated Case Support system which IT experts consider woefully inadequate In March the FBI announced it was beginning a new more ambitious software project code named Sentinel which they expected to complete by br br Carnivore was an electronic eavesdropping software system implemented by the FBI during the Clinton administration it was designed to monitor email and electronic communications After prolonged negative coverage in the press the FBI changed the name of its system from Carnivore to DCS DCS is reported to stand for Digital Collection System the system has the same functions as before The Associated Press reported in mid January that the FBI essentially abandoned the use of Carnivore in in favor of commercially available software such as NarusInsight br The Criminal Justice Information Services CJIS Division is located in Clarksburg West Virginia Organized beginning in the office opened in as the youngest agency division The complex is the length of three football fields It provides a main repository for information in various data systems Under the roof of the CJIS are the programs for the National Crime Information Center NCIC Uniform Crime Reporting UCR Fingerprint Identification Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System IAFIS NCIC and the National Incident Based Reporting System NIBRS Many state and local agencies use these data systems as a source for their own investigations and contribute to the database using secure communications FBI provides these tools of sophisticated identification and information services to local state federal and international law enforcement agencies br The FBI heads the National Virtual Translation Center which provides timely and accurate translations of foreign intelligence for all elements of the Intelligence Community br In June the FBI held a groundbreaking for its planned FBI Innovation Center set to be built in Huntsville Alabama The Innovation Center is to be part of a large college like campus costing a total of billion in Redstone Arsenal and will act as a center for cyber threat intelligence data analytics and emerging threat training br br br Personnel br br As of December the FBI had a total of employees That includes special agents and support professionals such as intelligence analysts language specialists scientists information technology specialists and other professionals br The Officer Down Memorial Page provides the biographies of FBI agents who have died in the line of duty from to February br br br Hiring process br To apply to become an FBI agent one must be between the ages of and unless one is a preference eligible veteran in which case one may apply after age The applicant must also hold U S citizenship be of high moral character have a clean record and hold at least a four year bachelor s degree At least three years of professional work experience prior to application is also required All FBI employees require a Top Secret TS security clearance and in many instances employees need a TS SCI Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance br To obtain a security clearance all potential FBI personnel must pass a series of Single Scope Background Investigations SSBI which are conducted by the Office of Personnel Management Special agent candidates also have to pass a Physical Fitness Test PFT which includes a meter run one minute sit ups maximum push ups and a mile km run Personnel must pass a polygraph test with questions including possible drug use Applicants who fail polygraphs may not gain employment with the FBI Up until the FBI had a minimum height requirement of feet inches cm br br br BOI and FBI directors br br FBI directors are appointed nominated by the President of the United States and must be confirmed by the United States Senate to serve a term of office of ten years subject to resignation or removal by the President at his her discretion before their term ends Additional terms are allowed following the same procedure br J Edgar Hoover appointed by President Calvin Coolidge in was by far the longest serving director serving until his death in In Congress passed legislation as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of requiring Senate confirmation of appointments of future directors As the incumbent this legislation did not apply to Hoover The last FBI director was Andrew McCabe The current FBI director is Christopher A Wray appointed by President Donald Trump br The FBI director is responsible for the day to day operations at the FBI Along with the deputy director the director makes sure cases and operations are handled correctly The director also is in charge of making sure the leadership in the FBI field offices is staffed with qualified agents Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act was passed in the wake of the September attacks the FBI director would directly brief the President of the United States on any issues that arise from within the FBI Since then the director now reports to the Director of National Intelligence DNI who in turn reports to the President br br br Firearms br br Upon qualification an FBI special agent is issued a full size Glock or compact Glock semi automatic pistol both of which are chambered in the S W cartridge In May the FBI officially adopted the Glock in S W for general agent use and first issued it to New Agent Class in October At present the Glock FG R finger groove and rail either rd generation or Gen is the issue sidearm br New agents are issued firearms on which they must qualify on successful completion of their training at the FBI Academy The Glock subcompact mm Parabellum Glock and Glock S W compact and subcompact respectively are authorized as secondary weapons Special agents are also authorized to purchase and qualify with the Glock in ACP br Special agents of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team HRT and regional SWAT teams are issued the Springfield Armory Professional Model pistol in ACP br In June the FBI awarded Glock a contract for new handguns Unlike the currently issued S W chambered Glock pistols the new Glocks will be chambered for mm Parabellum The contract is for the full size Glock M and the compact Glock M The M means the Glocks have been modified to meet government standards specified by a government request for proposal br br br Publications br br The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin is published monthly by the FBI Law Enforcement Communication Unit with articles of interest to state and local law enforcement personnel First published in as Fugitives Wanted by Police the FBI Law Bulletin covers topics including law enforcement technology and issues such as crime mapping and use of force as well as recent criminal justice research and ViCAP alerts on wanted suspects and key cases br The FBI also publishes some reports for both law enforcement personnel as well as regular citizens covering topics including law enforcement terrorism cybercrime white collar crime violent crime and statistics The vast majority of federal government publications covering these topics are published by the Office of Justice Programs agencies of the United States Department of Justice and disseminated through the National Criminal Justice Reference Service br br br Crime statistics br During the s the FBI began issuing crime reports by gathering numbers from local police departments Due to limitations of this system that were discovered during the s and s victims often simply did not report crimes to the police in the first place the Department of Justice developed an alternative method of tallying crime the victimization survey br br br Uniform Crime Reports br br The Uniform Crime Reports UCR compile data from over law enforcement agencies across the country They provide detailed data regarding the volume of crimes to include arrest clearance or closing a case and law enforcement officer information The UCR focuses its data collection on violent crimes hate crimes and property crimes Created in the s the UCR system has not proven to be as uniform as its name implies The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape Since about of the data submitted to the FBI is in this format the UCR stands out as the publication of choice as most states require law enforcement agencies to submit this data br Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report for was released on June The report shows violent crime offenses rose but the number of property crime offenses decreased compared to br br br National Incident Based Reporting System br br The National Incident Based Reporting System NIBRS crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data The system is used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes Local state and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category The Group A offenses are specific crimes grouped in offense categories Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system In addition to the Group A offenses eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary based UCR system As of law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data That amount
