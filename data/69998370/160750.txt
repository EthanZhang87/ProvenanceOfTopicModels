id: 160750
A slasher film is a subgenre of horror films involving a killer or a group of killers stalking and murdering a group of people usually by use of bladed or sharp tools Although the term slasher may occasionally be used informally as a generic term for any horror film involving murder film analysts cite an established set of characteristics which set slasher films apart from other horror subgenres such as monster movies splatter films supernatural and psychological horror films br Critics cite the Italian giallo films and psychological horror films such as Peeping Tom and Psycho as early influences The genre hit its peak between and in an era referred to as the Golden Age of slasher films Notable slasher films include The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Black Christmas Halloween Friday the th A Nightmare on Elm Street Child s Play Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer Many slasher films released decades ago continue to attract cult followings The slasher canon can be divided into three eras the classical the self referential and the neoslasher cycle br br br Definition br Slasher films typically adhere to a specific formula a past wrongful action causes severe trauma that is reinforced by a commemoration or anniversary that reactivates or re inspires the killer Built around stalk and murder sequences the films draw upon the audience s feelings of catharsis recreation and displacement as related to sexual pleasure Paste magazine s definition notes that slasher villains are human beings or were human beings at some point Slasher villains are human killers whose actions are objectively evil because they re meant to be bound by human morality That s part of the fear that the genre is meant to prey upon the idea that killers walk among us Films with similar structures that have non human antagonists lacking a conscience such as Alien or The Terminator are not traditionally considered slasher films though many slasher antagonists are superhuman have supernatural traits or possess slightly warped or abstract anthropomorphic forms both physically and metaphysically br br br Common tropes br The final girl trope is discussed in film studies as being a young woman occasionally a young man left alone to face the killer s advances in the movie s end Laurie Strode Jamie Lee Curtis the heroine in Halloween is an example of a typical final girl Final girls are often like Laurie Strode virgins among sexually active teens Others have called the trope self mythologising based on a handful of especially high profile examples asserting that its prominence has been overstated particularly the innocent virginal qualities ascribed to putative final girls and that in the st century the trope has been filtered through the lens of parody subversion and self aware humour e g Final Girl rather than deployed sincerely br When slasher films become franchises they typically take on villain protagonist characteristics with the series following the continued efforts of their antagonists rather than any of the killer s disposable victims including any individual entry s heroes or final survivor s who in so far as they continue to appear within the series are often killed off immediately after their next on screen appearance which has become its own trope Examples of antiheroes around whom the respective series have become centered include Michael Myers Freddy Krueger Jason Voorhees Chucky and Leatherface The antagonist is envisioned and embedded into the public psyche as the main and most marketable recognisable character even if his screentime is dwarfed in any specific film by the nominal protagonists The Scream film series is a rarity that follows its heroine Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell rather than masked killer Ghostface whose identity changes from film to film and is only revealed in each entry s finale br Another alleged trope frequently associated with slasher discourse and horror more broadly is that of the black character s dying first often formulated as always dying first Actual analyses of the films such as a investigative piece in Complex have found that the trope is largely self mythologising as opposed to being a statistical reality per Complex in only of the fifty analysed movies all containing one or more speaking black characters did any of them die first br br br Origins br br The appeal of watching people inflict violence upon each other dates back thousands of years to Ancient Rome though fictionalized accounts became marketable with late th century horror plays produced at the Grand Guignol Maurice Tourneur s The Lunatics used visceral violence to attract the Guignol s audience In the United States public outcry over films like this eventually led to the passage of the Hays Code in The Hays Code is one of the entertainment industry s earliest set of guidelines restricting sexuality and violence deemed unacceptable br Crime writer Mary Roberts Rinehart influenced horror literature with her novel The Circular Staircase adapted into the silent film The Bat about guests in a remote mansion menaced by a killer in a grotesque mask Its success led to a series of old dark house films including The Cat and the Canary based on John Willard s stage play and Universal Pictures The Old Dark House based on the novel by J B Priestley In both films the town dwellers are pitted against strange country folk a recurring theme in later horror films Along with the madman on the loose plotline these films employed several influences upon the slasher genre such as lengthy point of view shots and a sins of the father catalyst to propel the plot s mayhem br br br Early film influences br br George Archainbaud s Thirteen Women tells the story of a sorority whose former members are set against one another by a vengeful peer who crosses out their yearbook photos a device used in subsequent films Prom Night and Graduation Day Early examples include a maniac seeking revenge in The Terror based on the play by Edgar Wallace br B movie mogul Val Lewton produced The Leopard Man about a murderer framing his crimes against women on an escaped show leopard Basil Rathbone s The Scarlet Claw sees Sherlock Holmes investigate murders committed with a five pronged garden weeder that the killer would raise in the air and bring down on the victim repeatedly an editing technique that became familiar in the genre Robert Siodmak s The Spiral Staircase based on Ethel White s novel Some Must Watch stars Ethel Barrymore as a sympathetic woman trying to survive black gloved killers The Spiral Staircase also features an early use of jump scares br British writer Agatha Christie s particularly influential novel Ten Little Indians adapted in as And Then There Were None centers on a group of people with secret pasts who are killed one by one on an isolated island Each of the murders mirrors a verse from a nursery rhyme merging the themes of childhood innocence and vengeful murder House of Wax The Bad Seed Screaming Mimi Jack the Ripper and Cover Girl Killer all incorporated Christie s literary themes br br br s horror thrillers br br Alfred Hitchcock s Psycho used visuals that had been deemed unacceptable by movie studios including scenes of violence sexuality and the shot of a toilet flushing The film featured an iconic score by Bernard Herrmann that has been frequently imitated in slasher and horror films That same year Michael Powell released Peeping Tom showing the killer s perspective as he murders women to photograph their dying expressions br Psycho was nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Supporting Actress for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins garnering universal acclaim for his role as Norman Bates This notice drew bankable movie stars to horror films Joan Crawford starred in William Castle s Strait Jacket and in Jim O Connolly s Berserk while Albert Finney starred in MGM s Night Must Fall a remake of the British film and Peter Cushing starred in Corruption br Hammer Studios a London based company followed Psycho s success with Taste of Fear Maniac Paranoiac Nightmare Fanatic The Nanny and Hysteria Hammer s rival Amicus had Robert Bloch author of Psycho novel write the script for Psychopath br Francis Ford Coppola s debut Dementia takes place in an Irish castle where relatives gather to commemorate a family death but are murdered one by one William Castle s Homicidal features gore in its murder scenes something both Psycho and Peeping Tom had edited out Richard Hillard s Violent Midnight showed a black gloved killer s point of view as they pull down a branch to watch a victim and also featured a skinny dipping scene Crown International s Terrified features a masked killer Spain s The House That Screamed features violent murders and preempted later campus based slashers br br br Splatter Krimi and giallo films br br Subgenres that influenced slasher films include splatter films Krimi films and giallo films br Splatter films focus on gratuitous gore Herschell Gordon Lewis s Blood Feast was a hit at drive in theaters and is often considered the first splatter film Lewis followed with gory films Two Thousand Maniacs Color Me Blood Red The Gruesome Twosome and The Wizard of Gore This grotesque style translated to Andy Milligan s The Ghastly Ones Twisted Nerve Night After Night After Night as well as The Haunted House of Horror br Post World War II Germany adapted British writer Edgar Wallace s crime novels into a subgenre of their own called Krimi films The Krimi films were released in the late s through the early s and featured villains in bold costumes accompanied by jazz scores from composers such as Martin B ttcher and Peter Thomas Fellowship of the Frog about a murderer terrorizing London was successful in America leading to similar adaptations like The Green Archer and Dead Eyes of London The Rialto Studio produced Krimi films between and br br Italy s giallo thrillers are crime procedurals or murder mysteries interlaced with eroticism and psychological horror Giallo films feature unidentified killers murdering in grand fashions Unlike most American slasher films the protagonists of gialli are frequently but not always jet setting adults sporting the most stylish Milan fashions These protagonists are often outsiders reluctantly brought into the mystery through extenuating circumstances like witnessing a murder or being suspected of the crimes themselves Much like Krimi films gialli plots tended to be outlandish and improbable occasionally employing supernatural elements Mario Bava s A Bay of Blood is a whodunit featuring a subplot depicting creative death sequences on a secluded lakeside setting which greatly inspired Friday the th its sequel and subsequent slashers Sergio Martino s Torso featured a masked killer preying upon beautiful and promiscuous young women in retribution for a past misdeed Torso s edge of your seat climax finds a sensible final girl facing off with the killer in an isolated villa Umberto Lenzi s Eyeball which unfolds in an Agatha Christie manner is noted by some as a slasher precursor as American tourists are targeted by a killer wearing a red raincoat br The influence of Hitchcock s Psycho extended also to gialli with films such as The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh The Case of the Scorpion s Tail and The Crimes of the Black Cat paying homage to Hitchcock s film Gialli were popular in American cinemas and drive in theaters Thriller Assault and Spanish mystery A Dragonfly for Each Corpse share many traits with Italian gialli Death Steps in the Dark spoofed the familiar conventions found in giallo films Despite successes from Deep Red and The Blood Stained Shadow giallo films gradually fell out of fashion by the mid s as diminishing returns forced budget cuts Films such as Play Motel and Giallo a Venezia exploited their low budgets with shocking hardcore pornography br br br Exploitation films br br The early s saw an increase in exploitation films that lured audiences to grindhouses and drive ins by advertising of sex and violence Robert Fuest s And Soon the Darkness set off the s exploitation wave by maximizing its small budget and taking place in daylight The Jekyll and Hyde Portfolio follows an insane killer who stalks and murders victims at a nursing academy Hands of the Ripper depicts the psychological trauma suffered by Jack the Ripper s daughter who continues the murderous reign of her father Fright is based on the babysitter and the man upstairs urban legend while Tower of Evil features careless partying teens murdered in a remote island lighthouse Pete Walker broke taboos by advertising his films negative reviews to attract viewers looking for the depraved using a no press is bad press mantra with The Flesh and Blood Show Frightmare House of Mortal Sin Schizo and The Comeback Other filmmakers followed Walker s lead as posters dubbed Blood and Lace as sickest PG rated movie ever made while Scream Bloody Murder called itself gore nography br By the exploitation film battled political correctness and their popularity waned and while films like The Love Butcher and The Redeemer Son of Satan were accused of promoting bigotry the low budget independent film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre became a major hit and the most commercially successful horror film since The Exorcist The story concerns a violent clash of cultures and ideals between the counter culture and traditional conservative values with the film s squealing antagonist Leatherface carrying a chainsaw and wearing the faces of victims he and his family eat The Texas Chain Saw Massacre spawned imitators and its false based on a true story advertisements gave way to reenactments of true crime The Town That Dreaded Sundown based on the Phantom Killer case and Another Son of Sam based on the Son of Sam slayings cashed in on headlines and public fascination Wes Craven modernized the Sawney Bean legend in The Hills Have Eyes by building upon themes presented in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre The Hills Have Eyes was another huge financial success relaunching Craven s career after it had been damaged by controversy surrounding his previous film The Last House on the Left br Following holiday themed exploitation films Home for the Holidays All Through the House and Silent Night Bloody Night Christmas horror film Black Christmas uses horror as a board to debate social topics of its time including feminism abortion and alcoholism Using the killer calling from inside the house gimmick Black Christmas is visually and thematically a precursor to John Carpenter s Halloween as young women are terrorized in a previously safe environment during an iconic holiday Like Halloween Clark s film opens with a lengthy point of view but it differs in the treatment of the killer s identity Despite making on a budget Black Christmas was initially criticized with Variety complaining that it was a bloody senseless kill for kicks flick that exploited unnecessary violence Despite its modest initial box office run the film has garnered critical reappraisal with film historians noting its importance in the horror film genre and some even citing it as the original slasher film br br br Golden Age br Jumpstarted by the massive success of John Carpenter s Halloween the era commonly cited as the Golden Age of slasher films is with some scholars citing over similar films released over the six year period Despite most films receiving negative reviews many Golden Age slasher films were extremely profitable and have established cult followings Many films reused Halloween s template of a murderous figure stalking teens though they escalated the gore and nudity from Carpenter s restrained film Golden Age slasher films exploited dangers lurking in American institutions such as high schools colleges summer camps and hospitals br br br br Cashing in on the drive in success of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre The Toolbox Murders was quickly and cheaply shot but did not generate the interest of the former films

s point of view as he kills his older sister a scene emulated in numerous films such as Blow Out and The Funhouse Carpenter and Hill deny writing sexually active teens to be victims in favor of a virginal final girl survivor though subsequent filmmakers copied what appeared to be a sex equals death mantra br When shown an early cut of Halloween without a musical score all major American studios declined to distribute it one executive even remarking that it was not scary Carpenter added music himself and the film was distributed locally in four Kansas City theaters through Akkad s Compass International Pictures in October Word of mouth made the movie a sleeper hit that was selected to screen at the November Chicago Film Festival where the country s major critics acclaimed it Halloween grew into a major box office success grossing over million worldwide and selling over million tickets in North America becoming the most profitable independent film until being surpassed by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles br br br br Though the telekinesis themed slasher Tourist Trap was initially unsuccessful it has undergone a reappraisal by fans s most successful slasher was Fred Walton s When a Stranger Calls which sold million tickets in North America Its success has largely been credited to its opening scene in which a babysitter Carol Kane is taunted by a caller who repeatedly asks Have you checked the children Less successful were Ray Dennis Steckler s burlesque slasher The Hollywood Strangler Meets the Skid Row Slasher and Abel Ferrara s The Driller Killer both of which featured gratuitous on screen violence against vagrant people br br br br The election of Ronald Reagan as the th president of the United States drew in a new age of conservatism that ushered concern

of the film s killer in an attempt to hurt its box office and provided the address of the chairman of Paramount Pictures for viewers to complain The MPAA was criticized for allowing Friday the th an R rating but its violence would inspire gorier films to follow as it set a new bar for acceptable levels of on screen violence The criticisms that began with Friday the th would lead to the genre s

Acclaimed filmmaker Brian De Palma s Psycho homage Dressed to Kill drew a wave of protest from the National Organization for Women NOW who picketed the film s screening on the University of Iowa

with slasher films before in Deadly Blessing though he was frustrated that the genre he had helped create with The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes had not benefited him financially Developing A Nightmare on Elm Street since Craven recognized time running out due to declining revenues from theatrical slasher film releases A Nightmare on Elm Street and especially its villain Freddy Krueger Robert Englund became cultural phenomenons On a budget of just million the film was a commercial success grossing more than million million admissions in North America and launched one of the most successful film series in history A Nightmare on Elm Street provided the success that New Line Cinema needed to become a major Hollywood company To this day New Line is referred to as The

of their true personas targeted by a movie inspired demon Despite solid critical reviews New Nightmare failed to attract moviegoers and sold only million tickets the North American box office the lowest of any Elm Street film The slasher genre s surprising meta resurgence came in the form of Craven s sleeper hit Scream Directed by Craven and written by Kevin Williamson Scream juggled postmodern humor with visceral horror The film played on nostalgia for the golden age of slasher films but appealed to a younger audience with contemporary stars and popular music Williamson a self confessed fan of slasher films wrote the characters as well versed in horror film lore and knowing all the clich s that the audience were aware of With million admissions Scream became both the highest grossing slasher film of all time and the first of the genre to cross million at the domestic box office making it the most successful horror film since The Silence of the Lambs The marketing for Scream distanced itself from the slasher genre as it passed itself as a new thriller that showcased the celebrity of its stars Drew Barrymore Courteney Cox and Neve Campbell over its horror elements br Williamson s follow up I Know What You Did Last Summer was inspired by Prom Night and The House on Sorority Row Released less than a year after Scream to critic proof success the film sold nearly million tickets at the North American box office Two months later Dimension Films released Scream to the highest grossing opening weekend of any R rated film at the time the sequel sold million tickets and was a critical hit Taking note of the marketing success of Scream the promotional materials for I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream relied heavily on the recognizability of cast

Pool Bollywood produced two unofficial remakes of I Know What You Did Last Summer the first was a musical slasher hybrid called Kucch To Hai while the second was a more straightforward slasher called Dhund The Fog br Scream marked a high point of public interest in the s slasher revival with a massive marketing campaign and a cultural zeitgeist This anticipation greenlit the production of several other slasher films to be released the following year Urban Legend was a reasonable hit selling million tickets though its decline from the Scream films and I Know What You Did Last Summer showed that slasher film sales were already starting to decline Three sequels were each significant successes at the domestic box office Halloween H Years Later had million admissions Bride of Chucky had million admissions and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer had million admissions Again the marketing for these sequels relied on the appeal their casts which included Adam Arkin Jack Black LL Cool J Jamie Lee Curtis Joseph Gordon Levitt Josh Hartnett Katherine Heigl Brandy Norwood Jodi Lynn O Keefe Mekhi Phifer John Ritter Jennifer Tilly and Michelle Williams Low budget slasher films The Clown at Midnight and Cherry Falls had trouble competing with big budget horror films that could afford bankable actors br Scream the first entry in the Scream series not written by Kevin Williamson was another huge success with million tickets sold though poor word of mouth prevented it from reaching the heights of the first two Scream films Urban Legends Final Cut sold a meager million tickets less than half of what its predecessor had sold just two years earlier The third films in the I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend sequels were relegated to the direct to video market with a lack of bankable stars br After the turn of the millennium the post Scream wave of slasher films were both critically and financially disappointing leading to the genre s sharp decline These films
