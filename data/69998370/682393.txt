when he joined the Nation of Islam in late MC Eiht replaced MC Ren s role as A Wax Rappers Spice and Tupac Shakur were initially set to play Caine and Sharif respectively but they were later fired with director Allen Hughes stating that Shakur was causing trouble on the set Shakur was angry for not being told why Sharif would turn Muslim When Shakur was cast in the role of Sharif who as described in the film was an ex knucklehead turned Muslim he did not agree with how the character was written While many of his rap music contemporaries were portraying roles similar to their gangsta rap personas Sharif would have required Shakur to portray the character as a stoic pious Muslim According to MC Eiht who played A Wax in the film br br My take on it was everytime we got ready to rehearse he had an opinion about his character He wanted them to write in the script WHY he turned Muslim Show me why I turned Muslim and they wouldn t do it and that s what angered him You re not
