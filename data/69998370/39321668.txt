designs br br For the role of Teresa Kaya Scodelario was Ball s first choice as she was fantastic and because he loved her in the TV show Skins Dylan O Brien the lead role was initially rejected by Ball Ball recounts Dylan was actually I saw him early on very early on and I overlooked him It was a big learning experience there because I overlooked him because of his hair He had Teen Wolf hair and I couldn t see past that and so we were looking for our Thomas and it s a tough role to make because he comes in as a boy and he leaves as a man so it can t be like this badass action star that comes into this movie It s about vulnerability upfront and then he comes out of it and comes into his own and then the next movies are about the leader that emerges from the group So finally Fox says We just did this movie The Internship There s this kid that s in this thing He s like years old We think he s kind of got something So I watched his tape and was like Wait a minute I ve seen this kid before I looked him up online and there was one picture of him with a totally shaved head and it s this sweet vulnerable looking kid and I was like Whoa interesting I said Wait a minute he s just so familiar and I looked back at my old audition tapes which we had thousands of and there s Dylan That guy I said No definitely not him So we brought him back in and we started to talk with him and I m like he s the coolest dude ever Blake Cooper entered the film via Twitter Ball revealed a lot on Twitter and many kids wanted to be Chuck Cooper constantly bugged Ball until Ball told him to give his
