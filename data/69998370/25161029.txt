last minute decision from director Wes Craven changed things going back to film an ending where Dewey is shown giving a thumbs up when being lifted into the ambulance in case test audiences reacted positively to the character The decision was rationalized by Craven who credited Arquette s performance as the deciding factor on which ending to go with He said During the course of the movie we realized how his performance was just so witty Also we loved him He played it with such heart such commitment and everyone kept thinking that Scream also featured an alternate ending where both Gale and Dewey are killed this time by Cotton Weary who had snapped in that moment Arquette was originally brought in to audition for the role of Billy Loomis in Scream but preferred the character of Dewey and requested to audition for that instead Despite resistance from the production team who were concerned that the role was described as hunky rather than the younger goofier approach of Arquette

br Death br In Scream Dewey s death is depicted Directors Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli Olpin and executive producer Chad Villella decided to ultimately kill him off for plot purposes as it was

decision a year later Bettinelli Olphin and Gillett believed the decision paid off as they felt Scream VI was more compelling as so many characters had been impacted by it Upon reading the script
