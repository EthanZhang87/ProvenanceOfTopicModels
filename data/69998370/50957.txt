before she reveals his identity The Jedi Council instructs Obi Wan to find the bounty hunter while Anakin is tasked to protect Padm and escort her to Naboo Despite the Jedi Code that forbids attachments the two start to fall in love br Obi Wan s search leads to Kamino an ocean planet There he discovers a clone army is being produced for the Republic under the name of Sifo Dyas a deceased Jedi Master The bounty hunter Jango Fett serves as their genetic template Obi Wan deduces Jango is the bounty hunter he is seeking and places a homing beacon on Jango s ship Slave I He then follows Jango and his clone son Boba to the planet Geonosis Meanwhile Anakin is troubled by visions of his mother Shmi in pain and returns to his homeworld of Tatooine with Padm to save her His former owner Watto reveals that he sold Shmi to a moisture farmer named Cliegg Lars who then freed and married her Cliegg says Tusken Raiders abducted Shmi one month earlier and she is likely dead Anakin finds her at the Tusken campsite barely alive After she dies in his arms an enraged Anakin massacres the entire tribe He later confesses his actions to Padm and vows to prevent the deaths of those he loves br On Geonosis Obi Wan discovers a Separatist gathering led by Count Dooku who is developing a droid army with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray who ordered the assassination attempts on Padm Obi Wan transmits his findings to the Jedi Council but is captured by Separatist droids Dooku meets Obi Wan in his cell and explains that the Republic is under the control of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious He invites Obi Wan to help him stop Sidious but Obi Wan refuses Senate Representative Jar Jar Binks proposes a successful vote to grant emergency powers to Chancellor Palpatine allowing the clone army to be officially brought into action as the defence force of the Republic br Anakin and Padm head to Geonosis to rescue Obi Wan While in the Geonosian droid factory Anakin loses his lightsaber before Jango captures them Dooku sentences the trio to be killed by alien beasts in the arena A battalion of clone troopers led by Yoda Mace Windu and other Jedi suddenly arrive Windu beheads Jango during the ensuing battle Obi Wan and Anakin intercept Dooku and engage in a lightsaber duel Dooku injures Obi Wan and severs Anakin s right arm Yoda intervenes and defends them To distract Yoda Dooku uses the Force in an attempt to kill Anakin and Obi Wan Dooku escapes via his Solar Sailer to Coruscant and delivers the schematics for a superweapon to Sidious As the Jedi acknowledge the beginning of the Clone Wars Anakin is fitted with a cybernetic arm and secretly marries Padm on Naboo with R D and C PO as their only witnesses br br br Cast br br Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi A Jedi Knight and

back A large search for an actor to portray Anakin Skywalker was performed Lucas auditioned various actors mostly unknown before casting Christensen Among the many established actors who auditioned or considered were Jonathan Brandis Chris Klein Devon Sawa Charlie Hunnam Topher Grace Eric Christian Olsen Joshua Jackson Erik von Detten James Van Der Beek Ryan Phillippe Colin Hanks and Paul Walker

in later Star Wars media briefly offering a seductive look to Anakin Skywalker at the Outlander Club br br br Production br br br Writing br After the mixed critical response to The Phantom Menace George Lucas was hesitant to return to the writing desk In March just three months before the start of principal photography Lucas finally completed his rough draft for Episode II Lucas continued to iterate on his rough draft producing a proper first and second draft For help with the third draft which would later become the shooting script Lucas brought on Jonathan Hales who had written several episodes of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles for him but had limited experience writing theatrical films The final script was completed just three days before the start of principal photography br As an in joke the film s working title was Jar Jar s Great Adventure a sarcastic reference to the negative fan response to the Episode I character br In writing The Empire Strikes Back Lucas initially decided that Lando Calrissian was a clone and came from a planet of clones which caused the Clone Wars mentioned by Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope he later came up with an alternate concept of an army of clone shocktroopers from a remote planet which were used by the Republic as an army in the war that followed br br br Filming br br Principal photography occurred between June and September at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney Location shooting took place in the Tunisian desert at the Plaza de Espa a in Seville London China Vancouver San Diego and Italy Villa del Balbianello on Lake Como and in the former royal Palace of Caserta Reshoots were performed in March During this time a new action sequence was developed featuring the droid factory after Lucas had decided that the film lacked a quick enough pace in the corresponding time frame The sequence s previsualization was rushed and the live action footage was shot within four and a half hours br Because of Lucas method of creating shots through various departments and sources that are sometimes miles and years apart from each other Attack of the Clones became the first film ever to be produced through what Rick McCallum called virtual filmmaking Back at Fox Studios the stages from McGregor s other film Moulin Rouge were reused during filming While filming his scenes Christensen would sometimes make lightsaber noises from his mouth which caused Lucas to stop filming and tell Christensen Hayden that looks really great but I can see your mouth moving You don t have to do that we add the sound effects in afterward At his own personal request Samuel L Jackson s character Mace Windu received a lightsaber that emits a purple glow as opposed to traditional blue or green for good guys and red for bad guys br Like The Phantom Menace Attack of the Clones furthered technological development effectively moving Hollywood into the digital age with the use of the HDW F developed by Sony and Panavision a digital camera using an HD digital frame system This spawned controversy over the benefits and disadvantages of digital cinematography that continues as more filmmakers convert to digital filmmaking while many filmmakers oppose it In contrast to previous installments for which scenes were shot in the Tunisian desert in temperatures up to F C the camera would still run without complications Lucas had stated that he wished to film The Phantom Menace on this format but Sony was unable to build the cameras quickly enough Sony s cameras arrived one week before principal photography on Attack of the Clones was about to start In Attack of the Clones became the third film to be released that was shot entirely on a p digital camera preceded by s Jackpot and Vidocq The cameras record in the HDCAM format p although the image was cropped to a widescreen ratio The area above and below the extraction area was available for Lucas to reframe the picture as necessary in post production br Despite Lucas efforts to persuade movie theaters to switch to digital projectors for viewing of Episode II few theaters did br br br Visual effects br There were over visual effects shots in the film The film relied almost solely on digital animatics as opposed to storyboards in order to previsualize sequences for editing early on in the film s production While Lucas had used other ways of producing motion based storyboards in the past after The Phantom Menace the decision was made to take advantage of the growing digital technology The process began with Ben Burtt s creation of what the department dubbed as videomatics so called because they were shot on a household videocamera In these videomatics production assistants and relatives of the department workers acted out scenes in front of greenscreen Using computer generated imagery CGI the previsualization department later filled in the green screen with rough background footage Burtt then cut together this footage and sent it off to Lucas for changes and approval The result was a rough example of what the final product was intended to be The previsualization department then created a finer version of the videomatic by creating an animatic in which the videomatic actors props and sets were replaced by digital counterparts to give a more precise but still rough look at what would eventually be seen The animatic was later brought on set and shown to the actors so that they could understand the concept of the scene they were filming in the midst of the large amount of bluescreen used Unlike most of the action sequences the Battle of Geonosis was not story boarded or created through videomatics but was sent straight to animatics after the department received a small vague page on the sequence The intent was to create a number of small events that would be edited together for pacing inside the finished film The animatics department was given a free hand regarding events to be created within the animatic Lucas only asked for good action shots that he could choose from and approve later Jackson would fight invisible creatures while filming his scenes br In addition to introducing the digital camera Attack of the Clones emphasized digital doubles as computer generated models that doubled for actors in the same way that traditional stunt doubles did It also furthered the authenticity of computer generated characters by introducing a new completely CGI created version of the character Yoda Rob Coleman and John Knoll prepared two tests featuring a CGI animated Yoda using audio from The Empire Strikes Back Yoda s appearance in Episode V also served as the reference point for the creation of the CGI Yoda Lucas repeatedly stated to the animation department that the trick to the animation of the CGI Yoda was to make him like the puppet from which he was based in order to maintain a flow of continuity Frank Oz voice and puppeteer for Yoda in the original trilogy and The Phantom Menace was consulted his main piece of advice was that Yoda should look extremely old sore and frigid Although Lucas admitted that he was scared to death about how they would pull off the scene Coleman later explained the process of making the digital Yoda like the puppet version by saying When Frank Oz would move the head the ears would jiggle If we hadn t put that in it wouldn t look like Yoda Because of the acrobatics of the lightsaber fight between Count Dooku and Yoda the then year old Christopher Lee relied on a stunt double to perform the most demanding scenes instead Lee s face was superimposed onto the double s body in all shots other than close ups which he performed himself Lucas often called the duel crucial to the animation department as it had the potential to be humorous rather than dramatic br Lucas did not use VistaVision for the miniature effects as he wanted the film to be consistently digital Carl Miller shot test footage of models using digital cameras but the models did not look realistic enough More detailed models had to be made as the digital cameras lacked the film grain that would have added detail and realism The amphitheater on Geonosis was initially a miniature made out of foam blocks but the cameras were able to show flaws in it br br br Music br br The soundtrack to the film was released on April by Sony Classical Records The music was composed and conducted by John Williams and performed by the London Voices and London Symphony Orchestra The soundtrack recreates The Imperial March from the film The Empire Strikes Back for its first chronological appearance in Attack of the Clones even though a hint of it appeared in the previous movie in one of the final scenes A music video for the main theme Across the Stars was produced specifically for the DVD br On March a limited edition vinyl version of the soundtrack was released Only copies were pressed initially br br br Themes br br Lucas has noted that Palpatine s rise to power is very similar to that of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany as Chancellor of Germany the latter was granted emergency powers as is Palpatine Comparisons have been made to Octavian who became Augustus the first emperor of Rome and to Napoleon Bonaparte who rose to power in France from to Octavian was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of political opponents well before he was granted tribunician powers Bonaparte was appointed First Consul for life and later Emperor by the French Consulate after a failed attempt on his life and the subsequent coup of Brumaire in References to the American Civil War can also be discerned War journalism combat films and footage of World War II combat influenced the documentary style camera work of the Battle of Geonosis even to the point that hand held shakes were digitally added to computer generated sequences br English scholar Anne Lancashire describes Attack of the Clones as thoroughly political in its narrative to the point that interpersonal relations are made subordinate to the political drama that unfolds and a critique of the increasing role played by economic and political appetite in contemporary First World international politics in general In this political drama the Trade Federation the former idealist Dooku and Palpatine represent the economic and political greed and ambition of the political and business classes while the intuition of the Jedi has been clouded by the dark side of the Force The cityscape of Coruscant the location of the Jedi Temple is a dystopian environment that refers to s Blade Runner Nevertheless the Jedi endure as the heroes Obi Wan s role has been noted as similar to that of James Bond and Zam Wesell s attempt on Padm s life is similar to a scene in the first film Dr No Furthermore the Geonosis arena fight scene is a reference to the Ridley Scott film Gladiator br The prequel trilogy films often refer to the original trilogy in order to help connect the films together Lucas has often referred to the films as a long poem that rhymes Such examples include the line I have a bad feeling about this a phrase used in each film and lightsaber duels which almost always occur over a pit As with Attack of the Clones The Empire Strikes Back was the middle film in a trilogy and of the original trilogy films The Empire Strikes Back is the object of the most references in Attack of the Clones In both films an asteroid field is the backdrop of a major star battle in the middle of the film Obi Wan escapes Jango Fett by attaching his spacecraft to an asteroid in order to disappear from the enemy sensors Han Solo uses a similar tactic by attaching the Millennium Falcon to a Star Destroyer in The Empire Strikes Back As a retcon John Knoll confirms on the film s DVD commentary that Boba Fett who would later catch Solo in the act in The Empire Strikes Back learned his lesson from the events of Attack of the Clones The Galactic Republic s clone troopers also establish the origin of the stormtroopers that play an important role in the original trilogy The titles of both films refer to the response of the primary galactic government to a threat of rebellion br br br Release br br br Marketing br In November three teaser trailers for Attack of the Clones were released which were shown on the Internet as well as the DVD ROM selection of The Phantom Menace DVD release The first one was released on November with the Disney Pixar film Monsters Inc in theaters A second teaser debuted online three days later on November This was followed

Clones was then screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival before getting a worldwide theatrical release on May The film was also later released in IMAX theaters the film had not been filmed for IMAX but was up converted with the digital remastering process Because of the technical limitations of the IMAX projector at the time an edited minute version of the film was presented br Before the film s release there was a string of controversies regarding copyright infringement In an underground organization calling itself the Atlas Group based in Perth Western Australia offered a copy of the screenplay with an asking price of US to various fan sites and media organizations including TheForce Net The scheme was subsequently reported to Lucasfilm Ltd by the fan site br An unauthorized copy was allegedly made at a private showing using a digital recorder that was pointed at the screen This copy spread over the internet and analysts predicted up to a million fans would

or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale the same score as the previous film br Numerous critics characterized the dialogue as stiff and flat The acting was also disparaged by some critics Conversely other critics felt fans would be pleased to see that Jar Jar Binks has only a minor role Additionally Jar Jar s attempts at comic relief seen in The Phantom Menace were toned down instead C PO reprised some of his bumbling traditions in that role McGregor referred to the swordplay in the film as unsatisfactory when comparing it to the climactic duel in Revenge of the Sith as it neared release ReelViews net s James Berardinelli gave a positive review saying in a time when more often than not sequels disappoint it s refreshing to uncover something this high profile that fulfills the promise of its name and adds another title to a storied legacy br Roger Ebert who had praised the previous Star Wars films gave Episode II only two out of four stars noting As someone who admired the freshness and energy of the earlier films I was amazed at the end of Episode II to realize that I had not heard one line of quotable memorable dialogue About Anakin and Padm s relationship Ebert stated There is not a romantic word they exchange that has not long since been reduced to clich Leonard Maltin who also liked all of the previous installments awarded two stars out of four to this endeavor as well as seen in his Movie and Video Guide from the edition onward Maltin cited an overlong story as reason for his dissatisfaction and added Wooden characterizations and dialogue don t help br br br Box office br During its opening day Attack of the Clones made million combined with million from midnight screenings At that point it had the highest Thursday gross of any film taking the former record held by Independence Day It would go on to make million within its first four days making it the second fastest film to approach the million mark behind Spider Man Plus it had grossed over million over the weekend becoming the third highest three day opening weekend of all time after Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone and Spider Man Attack of the Clones had the highest opening weekend for a th Century Fox film until when it was taken by X That year The Matrix Reloaded beat Attack of the Clones for having the biggest Thursday opening of any film The film would stay at the top of the box office for two weeks until it was dethroned by The Sum of All Fears br Attack of the Clones grossed in North America and overseas for a worldwide total of Though a box office success it was nevertheless overshadowed by the even greater box office success of The Phantom Menace three years earlier It was not the top grossing film of the year either in North America where it finished in third place or worldwide where it was fourth the first time that a Star Wars film did not have this distinction In North America it was outgrossed by Spider Man and The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers both of which were more favorably received by critics Worldwide it was also outgrossed by Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Adjusted for

Supporting Actor Hayden Christensen Worst Supporting Actress Natalie Portman Worst Screen Couple Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman and Worst Remake or Sequel It took home two awards for Worst Screenplay George Lucas and Worst Supporting Actor Hayden Christensen br br br Legacy and influence br In a interview cartoonist and animation producer ND Stevenson said that he was compelled by the shapeshifting character Zam Wesell causing him to think more about shapeshifting and said the film was where his love of shapeshifters specifically started In other interviews Stevenson expressed his affinity for Wesell even stating that Double Trouble in She Ra and the Princesses of Power is meant as an homage to Wesell Stevenson also said that at an early age Wesell created a huge impression on him noting he latched onto Zam because she was a shapeshifter causing him to come up with a version of the story when Zam lived became the main character in a whole parallel world that Stevenson constructed br In the archivist field the film has been critically approached for its depiction of a librarian stereotype in the character Jocasta Nu the Jedi archivist librarian of the Jedi Temple library Some have noted that the archives depicted in the film resembles a library while Nu wears clothing which represents her devotion to knowledge and learning and provides reference assistance to Obi Wan Kenobi For instance scholar Eric Ketelaar argued that Nu is an example of an archivist that mediates shares or obstructs power of the archives as dictated by the film s plot In contrast former Society of American Archivists president Randall C Jimerson stated that the film provides a more confident view of archives than other media showing the powerful and confident role of an archivist despite archival sabotage Otherwise Richard Pearce Moses stated the Nu s notion that information not within the archives doesn t exist is a na ve and is believed by some in regard to information not on the internet br Other scholars have critically approached the film with different perspectives Anna Lancashire stated that the film has the impact of turning the other films into an epic commentary on American and international politics and economics and on political empires based on aggressiveness human greed hatred and fear Timothy P Chartier argued how the film can be used in classrooms for topics such as linear algebra calculus and numerical analysis Scholar Bradley Schauer said that the film is a unified classical text and argued that it has different meanings for both general and specialized audiences br br br Novelizations br br Two novels based on the film were published a tie in junior novel by Scholastic and a novelization written by R A Salvatore which includes some
