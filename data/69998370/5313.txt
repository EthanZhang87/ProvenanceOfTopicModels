the bridge falling into the mists below br br br Cast br br Credits from British Film Institute br br br Themes and interpretations br br br Title br The title Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a literal translation of the Chinese idiom which describes a place or situation that is full of unnoticed masters It is from a poem of the ancient Chinese poet Yu Xin that reads which means behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon The title also has several other layers of meaning On one level the Chinese characters in the title connect to the narrative that the last character in Xiaohu and Jiaolong s names mean tiger and dragon respectively On another level the Chinese idiomatic phrase is an expression referring to the undercurrents of emotion passion and secret desire that lie beneath the surface of polite society and civil behavior which alludes to the film s storyline br br br Gender roles br The success of the Disney animated feature Mulan popularized the image of the Chinese woman warrior in the west The storyline of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is mostly driven by the three female characters In particular Jen is driven by her desire to be free from the gender role imposed on her while Shu Lien herself oppressed by the gender role tries to lead Jen back into the role deemed appropriate for her Some prominent martial arts disciplines are traditionally held to have been originated by women e g Wing Chun The film s title refers to masters one does not notice which necessarily includes mostly women and therefore suggests the advantage of a female bodyguard br br br Poison br Poison is also a significant theme in the film The Chinese word d means not only physical poison but also cruelty and sinfulness In the world of martial arts the use of poison is considered an act of one who is too cowardly and dishonorable to fight and indeed the only character who explicitly fits these characteristics is Jade Fox The poison is a weapon of her bitterness and quest for vengeance she poisons the master of Wudang attempts to poison Jen and succeeds in killing Mu Bai using a poisoned needle In further play on this theme by the director Jade Fox as she dies refers to the poison from a young child the deceit of an eight year old girl referring to what she considers her own spiritual poisoning by her young apprentice Jen Li Mu Bai himself warns that without guidance Jen could become a poison dragon br br br China of the imagination br The story is set during the Qing dynasty but it does not specify an exact time Lee sought to present a China of the imagination rather than an accurate vision of Chinese history At the same time Lee also wanted to make a film that Western audiences would want to see Thus the film is shot for a balance between Eastern and Western aesthetics There are some scenes showing uncommon artistry for the typical martial arts film such as an airborne battle among wispy bamboo plants br br br Production br The film was adapted from the novel Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon by Wang Dulu serialized between and in Qingdao Xinmin News The novel is the fourth in a sequence of five In the contract reached between Columbia Pictures and Ang Lee and Hsu Li kong they agreed to invest US million in filming but the stipulated recovery amount must be more than six times before the two parties will start to pay dividends br br br Casting br Shu Qi was Ang Lee s first choice for the role of Jen but she turned it down br br br Filming br br Although its Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was presented to Taiwan Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was in fact an international co production between companies in four regions the Chinese company

Provinces Taklamakan Plateau br Shanghai and Anji of China The first phase of shooting was in the Gobi Desert where it consistently rained Director Ang Lee noted I didn t take one break in eight months not even for half a day I was miserable I just didn t have the extra energy to be happy Near the end I could hardly breathe I thought I was about to have a stroke The stunt work was mostly performed by the actors themselves and Ang Lee stated in an interview that computers were used only to remove the safety wires that held the actors aloft Most of the time you can see their faces he added That s really them in the trees br Another compounding issue was the difference between accents of the four lead actors Chow Yun fat is from Hong Kong and speaks Cantonese natively Michelle Yeoh is from Malaysia and grew up speaking English and Malay so she learned the Standard Chinese lines phonetically Chang Chen is from Taiwan and he speaks Standard Chinese in a Taiwanese accent Only Zhang Ziyi spoke with a native Mandarin accent that Ang Lee wanted Chow Yun Fat said on the first day of shooting I had to do takes just because of the language That s never happened before in my life br The film specifically targeted Western audiences rather than the domestic audiences who were already used to Wuxia films As a result high quality English subtitles were needed Ang Lee who was educated in the West personally edited the subtitles to ensure they were satisfactory for Western audiences br br br Soundtrack br br The score was composed by Dun Tan in It was played for the movie by the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra the Shanghai National Orchestra and the Shanghai Percussion Ensemble It features solo passages for cello played by Yo Yo Ma The last track A Love Before Time features Coco

the leading actors Neither Chow a native Cantonese speaker nor Yeoh who was born and raised in Malaysia spoke Mandarin Chinese as a mother tongue All four main actors spoke Standard Chinese with vastly different accents Chow speaks with a Cantonese accent Yeoh with a Malaysian accent Chang Chen with a Taiwanese accent and Zhang Ziyi with a Beijing accent Yeoh responded to this complaint in a December interview with Cinescape She argued My character lived outside of Beijing and so I didn t have to do the Beijing accent When the interviewer Craig Reid remarked My mother in law has this strange Sichuan Mandarin accent that s hard for me to understand Yeoh responded Yes provinces all have their very own strong accents When we first started the movie Cheng Pei Pei was going to have her accent and Chang Zhen was going to have his accent and this person would have that accent And in the end nobody could understand what they were saying Forget about us even the crew from Beijing thought this was all weird br The film led to a boost in popularity of Chinese wuxia films in the western world where they were previously little known and led to films such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers both directed by Zhang Yimou being marketed towards Western audiences The film also provided the breakthrough role for Zhang Ziyi s career who noted br br Because of movies like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Hero and Memoirs of a Geisha a lot of people in the United States have become interested not only in me but in Chinese and Asian actors in general Because of these movies
