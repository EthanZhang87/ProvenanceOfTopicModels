Paramount Pictures Corporation doing business as Paramount Pictures also known simply as Paramount is an American film and television production and distribution company and the namesake subsidiary of Paramount Global It is the sixth oldest film studio in the world the second oldest film studio in the United States behind Universal Pictures and the sole member of the Big Five film studios located within the city limits of Los Angeles br In film producer Adolph Zukor put actors and actresses under contract and honored each with a star on the logo In the number of stars was reduced to and their hidden meaning was dropped In Paramount Pictures became the first major Hollywood studio to distribute all of its films in digital form only The company s headquarters and studios are located at Melrose Avenue Hollywood California br Paramount Pictures is a member of the Motion Picture Association MPA br br br History br br br Famous Players Film Company br br Paramount is the sixth oldest surviving film studio in the world after Gaumont Film Company Path Titanus Nordisk Film and Universal Studios It is the last major film studio still headquartered in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles br br Paramount Pictures dates its existence from the founding date of the Famous Players Film Company Hungarian born founder Adolph Zukor who had been an early investor in nickelodeons saw that movies appealed mainly to working class immigrants With partners Daniel Frohman and Charles Frohman he planned to offer feature length films that would appeal to the middle class by featuring the leading theatrical players of the time leading to the slogan Famous Players in Famous Plays By mid Famous Players had completed five films and Zukor was on his way to success Its first film was Les Amours de la reine lisabeth which starred Sarah Bernhardt br That same year another aspiring producer Jesse L Lasky opened his Lasky Feature Play Company with money borrowed from his brother in law Samuel Goldfish later known as Samuel Goldwyn The Lasky company hired as their first employee a stage director with virtually no film experience Cecil B DeMille who would find a suitable site in Hollywood This place was a rented old horse barn converted into a production facility with an enlarged open air stage located between Vine Street Selma Avenue Argyle Avenue and Sunset Boulevard It was later known as the Lasky DeMille Barn In their first feature film The Squaw Man was released br On May Paramount Pictures Corporation previously known as Progressive Pictures was founded by a Utah theatre owner W W Hodkinson who had bought and merged five smaller firms On May Hodkinson signed a five year contract with the Famous Players Film Company the Lasky Company and Bosworth Inc to distribute their films Actor director and producer Hobart Bosworth had started production of a series of Jack London movies Paramount was the first successful nationwide distributor until this time films were sold on a statewide or regional basis which had proved costly to film producers Also Famous Players and Lasky were privately owned while Paramount was a corporation br br br Famous Players Lasky br br In Zukor engineered a three way merger of his Famous Players the Lasky Company and Paramount Zukor and Lasky bought Hodkinson out of Paramount and merged the three companies into one The new company Lasky and Zukor founded on June Famous Players Lasky Corporation although it continued to use the name Paramount as well As a result it became the largest film company at the time with a value of US million equivalent to million in The corporation was able to grow quickly with Lasky and his partners Goldwyn and DeMille running the production side Hiram Abrams in charge of distribution and Zukor making great plans With only the exhibitor owned First National as a rival Famous Players Lasky and its Paramount Pictures soon dominated the business The fusion was finalized on November br br Because Zukor believed in stars he signed and developed many of the leading early stars including Mary Pickford Marguerite Clark Pauline Frederick Douglas Fairbanks Gloria Swanson Rudolph Valentino and Wallace Reid With so many important players Paramount was able to introduce block booking which meant that an exhibitor who wanted a particular star s films had to buy a year s worth of other Paramount productions It was this system that gave Paramount a leading position in the s and s but which led the government to pursue it on antitrust grounds for more than twenty years br By the mid s the old Lasky DeMille barn property was not big enough to handle all of the studios West Coast productions On January Lasky reached an agreement to buy the Robert Brunton Studios a acre facility owned by United Pictures and located at Marathon Street for million equivalent to million in On March the company began an eight month building program to renovate the existing facilities and erect new ones On May Lasky finally moved operations from the Sunset and Vine lot to the new building At present those facilities are still part of the Paramount Pictures headquarters Zukor hired independent producer B P Schulberg an unerring eye for new talent to run the new West Coast operations br br On April the company name was changed to Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation In September the Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation studio in Astoria New York City was temporarily closed with the objective of equipping it with the technology for the production of sound films In the same year Paramount began releasing Inkwell Imps animated cartoons produced by Max and Dave Fleischer s Fleischer Studios in New York City The Fleischers veterans in the animation industry were among the few animation producers capable of challenging the prominence of Walt Disney The Paramount newsreel series Paramount News ran from to Paramount was also one of the first Hollywood studios to release what were known at that time as talkies and in released their first musical Innocents of Paris Richard A Whiting and Leo Robin composed the score for the film Maurice Chevalier starred and sang the most famous song from the film Louise br br br Publix Balaban and Katz Loew s competition and wonder theaters br The driving force behind Paramount s rise was Zukor He built a chain of nearly screens ran two production studios in Astoria New York now the Kaufman Astoria Studios and Hollywood California and became an early investor in radio acquiring for the corporation a interest in the new Columbia Broadcasting System in selling it within a few years this would not be the last time Paramount and CBS crossed paths br By acquiring the successful Balaban Katz chain in Zukor gained the services of Barney Balaban who would eventually become Paramount s president in his brother A J Balaban who would eventually supervise all stage production nationwide and produce talkie shorts and their partner Sam Katz who would run the Paramount Publix theatre chain in New York City from the thirty five story Paramount Theatre Building on Times Square br br Balaban and Katz had developed the Wonder Theater concept first publicized around in Chicago The Chicago Theater was created as a very ornate theater and advertised as a wonder theater When Publix acquired Balaban they embarked on a project to expand the wonder theaters and starting building in New York City in While Balaban and Public were dominant in Chicago Loew s was the big player in New York City and did not want the Publix theaters to overshadow theirs The two companies brokered a non competition deal for New York City and Chicago and Loew s took over the New York City area projects developing five wonder theaters Publix continued Balaban s wonder theater development in its home area br On April Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation became the Paramount Publix Corporation br br br s and Receivership and reorganization br br Eventually Zukor shed most of his early partners the Frohman brothers Hodkinson and Goldwyn were out by while Lasky hung on until when blamed for the near collapse of Paramount in the Great Depression years he was also tossed out In to solve the financial problems of the company Zukor hired taxi rental car magnate John D Hertz as chairman of the finance committee in order to assist vice president and treasurer Ralph A Kohn However on January Hertz resigned from his position when it become evident that his measures to lift the company had failed The over expansion and use of overvalued Paramount stock for purchases created a million debt which led the company into receivership on January and later filing bankruptcy on March On April bankruptcy trustees were appointed and Zukor lost control of the company The company remained under the control of trustees for more than a year in order to restructure the debt and pursue a reorganization plan On December the reorganization plan was formally proposed After prolonged hearings in court final confirmation was obtained on April when Federal Judge Alfred C Coxe Jr approved the reorganization of the Paramount Publix Corporation under Section B of the Bankruptcy Act br On June John E Otterson became president of the re emerged and newly renamed Paramount Pictures Inc Zukor returned to the company and was named production chief but after Barney Balaban was appointed president on July he was soon replaced by Y Frank Freeman and symbolically named chairman of the board On August Paramount Pictures was re listed on the New York Stock Exchange and when the company was under Balaban s leadership the studio was successfully relaunched br br As always Paramount films continued to emphasize stars in the s there were Gloria Swanson Wallace Reid Rudolph Valentino Florence Vidor Thomas Meighan Pola Negri Bebe Daniels Antonio Moreno Richard Dix Esther Ralston Emil Jannings George Bancroft Betty Compson Clara Bow Adolphe Menjou and Charles Buddy Rogers By the late s and the early s talkies brought in a range of powerful draws Richard Arlen Nancy Carroll Maurice Chevalier Gary Cooper Marlene Dietrich Charles Ruggles Ruth Chatterton William Powell Mae West Sylvia Sidney Bing Crosby Claudette Colbert the Marx Brothers W C Fields Fredric March Jack Oakie Jeanette MacDonald whose first two films were shot at Paramount s Astoria New York studio Carole Lombard George Raft Miriam Hopkins Cary Grant and Stuart Erwin among them In this period Paramount can truly be described as a movie factory turning out sixty to seventy pictures a year Such were the benefits of having a huge theater chain to fill and of block booking to persuade other chains to go along In Mae West would also add greatly to Paramount s success with her suggestive movies She Done Him Wrong and I m No Angel However the sex appeal West gave in these movies would also lead to the enforcement of the Production Code as the newly formed organization the Catholic Legion of Decency threatened a boycott if it was not enforced br Paramount cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios continued to be successful with characters such as Betty Boop and Popeye the Sailor becoming widely successful One Fleischer series Screen Songs featured live action music stars under contract to Paramount hosting sing alongs of popular songs The animation studio would rebound with Popeye and in polls showed that Popeye was even more popular than Mickey Mouse After an unsuccessful expansion into feature films as well as the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer were no longer speaking to one another Fleischer Studios was acquired by Paramount which renamed the operation Famous Studios That incarnation of the animation studio continued cartoon production until but has been historically dismissed as having largely failed to maintain the artistic acclaim the Fleischer brothers achieved under their management br br br United States v Paramount Pictures Inc br In Paramount agreed to a government instituted consent decree block booking and pre selling the practice of collecting up front money for films not yet in production would end Immediately Paramount cut back on production from films to a more modest annually in the war years Still with more new stars like Bob Hope Alan Ladd Veronica Lake Paulette Goddard and Betty Hutton and with war time attendance at astronomical numbers Paramount and the other integrated studio theatre combines made more money than ever At this the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department decided to reopen their case against the five integrated studios Paramount also had a monopoly over Detroit movie theaters through subsidiary company United Detroit Theaters This led to the Supreme Court decision United States v Paramount Pictures Inc holding that movie studios could not also own movie theater chains This decision broke up Adolph Zukor s creation with the theater chain being split into a new company United Paramount Theaters and effectively brought an end to the classic Hollywood studio system br br br Split and after br With the separation of production and exhibition forced by the U S Supreme Court Paramount Pictures Inc was split in two Paramount Pictures Corporation was formed to be the production distribution company with the screen theater chain handed to the new United Paramount Theaters on December Leonard Goldenson who had headed the chain since remained as the new company s president The Balaban and Katz theatre division was spun off with UPT its trademark eventually became the property of the Balaban and Katz Historical Foundation The foundation later acquired ownership of the Famous Players trademark Cash rich and controlling prime downtown real estate Goldenson began looking for investments Barred from film making by prior antitrust rulings he acquired the struggling ABC television network in February leading it first to financial health and eventually in the mid s to first place in the national Nielsen ratings before selling out to Capital Cities in Capital Cities would eventually sell out in turn to The Walt Disney Company in United Paramount Theaters was renamed ABC Theaters in and was sold to businessman Henry Plitt in The movie theater chain was renamed Plitt Theaters In Cineplex Odeon Corporation merged with Plitt In later years Paramount s TV division would develop a strong relationship with ABC providing many hit series to the network br Paramount Pictures had been an early backer of television launching experimental stations in in Los Angeles and Chicago The Los Angeles station eventually became KTLA the first commercial station on the West Coast The Chicago station got a commercial license as WBKB in but was sold to UPT along with Balaban Katz in and was eventually resold to CBS as WBBM TV br In Paramount bought a stake in television manufacturer DuMont Laboratories Through this stake it became a minority owner of the DuMont Television Network Paramount also launched its own network Paramount Television Network in through its television unit Television Productions Inc br Paramount management planned to acquire additional owned and operated stations O Os the company applied to the FCC for additional stations in San Francisco Detroit and Boston The FCC however denied Paramount s applications A few years earlier the federal regulator had placed a five station cap on all television networks no network was allowed to own more than five VHF television stations Paramount was hampered by its minority stake in the DuMont Television Network Although both DuMont and Paramount executives stated that the companies were separate the FCC ruled that Paramount s partial ownership of DuMont meant that DuMont and Paramount were in theory branches of the same company Since DuMont owned three television stations and Paramount owned two the federal agency ruled neither network could acquire additional television stations The FCC requested that Paramount relinquish its stake in DuMont but Paramount refused According to television historian William Boddy Paramount s checkered antitrust history helped convince the FCC that Paramount controlled DuMont Both DuMont and Paramount Television Network suffered as a result with neither company able to acquire five O Os Meanwhile CBS ABC and NBC had each acquired the maximum of five stations by the mid s br When ABC accepted a merger offer from UPT in DuMont quickly realized that ABC now had more resources than it could possibly hope to match It quickly reached an agreement in principle to merge with ABC However Paramount vetoed the offer due to antitrust concerns For all intents and purposes this was the end of DuMont though it lingered on until br In Paramount bought a stake in International Telemeter an experimental pay TV service which operated with a coin inserted into a box The service began operating in Palm Springs California on November but due to pressure from the FCC the service ended on May br With the loss of the theater chain Paramount Pictures went into a decline cutting studio backed production releasing its contract players and making production deals with independents By the mid s all the great names were gone only Cecil B DeMille associated with Paramount since kept making pictures in the grand old style Despite Paramount s losses DeMille would however give the studio some relief and create his most successful film at Paramount a remake of his film The Ten Commandments DeMille died in Like some other studios Paramount saw little value in its film library and sold of its pre films to MCA Inc EMKA Ltd known today as Universal Television in February br br br Early Gulf Western era br By the early s Paramount s future was doubtful The high risk movie business was wobbly the theater chain was long gone investments in DuMont and in early pay television came to nothing and the Golden Age of Hollywood had just ended even the flagship Paramount Building in Times Square was sold to raise cash as was KTLA sold to Gene Autry in for a then phenomenal million Their only remaining successful property at that point was Dot Records which Paramount had acquired in and even its profits started declining by the middle of the s Founding father Adolph Zukor born in was still chairman emeritus he referred to chairman Barney Balaban born as the boy Such aged leadership was incapable of keeping up with the changing times and in a sinking Paramount was sold to Charles Bluhdorn s industrial conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries Bluhdorn immediately put his stamp on the studio installing a virtually unknown producer named Robert Evans as head of production Despite some rough times Evans held the job for eight years restoring Paramount s reputation for commercial success with The Odd Couple Rosemary s Baby Love Story The Godfather Chinatown and Days of the Condor br Gulf and Western also bought the neighboring Desilu Productions television studio once the lot of RKO Pictures from Lucille Ball in Using some of Desilu s established shows such as Star Trek Mission Impossible and Mannix as a foot in the door at the networks the newly reincorporated Paramount Television eventually became known as a specialist in half hour situation comedies br In Paramount formed Films Distributing Corp to distribute sensitive film product including Sin With a Stranger which was one of the first films to receive an X rating in the United States when the MPAA introduced their new rating system br br br CIC formation and high concept era br In Paramount teamed with Universal Studios to form Cinema International Corporation a new company that would distribute films by the two studios outside the United States Metro Goldwyn Mayer would become a partner in the mid s Both Paramount and CIC entered the video market with Paramount Home Video now Paramount Home Entertainment and CIC Video respectively br Robert Evans abandoned his position as head of production in his successor Richard Sylbert proved to be too literary and too tasteful for Gulf and Western s Bluhdorn By a new television trained team was in place headed by Barry Diller and his Killer Dillers as they were called by admirers or Dillettes as they were called by detractors These associates made up of Michael Eisner Jeffrey Katzenberg Dawn Steel and Don Simpson would each go on and head up major movie studios of their own later in their careers br The Paramount specialty was now simpler High concept pictures such as Saturday Night Fever and Grease hit big hard and fast all over the world while its fortuitous earlier acquisition of the Star Trek property which had grown into a cult favorite enabled Paramount to have a long running science fiction film and television franchise to compete with the outstanding popular success of Star Wars Diller s television background led him to propose one of his longest standing ideas to the board Paramount Television Service a fourth commercial network Paramount Pictures purchased the Hughes Television Network HTN including its satellite time in planning for PTVS in Paramount sold HTN to Madison Square Garden Corporation in But Diller believed strongly in the concept and so took his fourth network idea with him when he moved to th Century Fox in where Fox s then freshly installed proprietor Rupert Murdoch was a more interested listener br However the television division would be playing catch up for over a decade after Diller s departure in before launching its own television network UPN in Lasting eleven years before being merged with The WB network to become The CW in UPN would feature many of the shows it originally produced for other networks and would take numerous gambles on series such as Star Trek Voyager and Star Trek Enterprise that would have otherwise either gone direct to cable or become first run syndication to independent stations across the country as Star Trek Deep Space Nine and Star Trek The Next Generation were br Paramount Pictures was not connected to either Paramount Records s or ABC Paramount Records until it purchased the rights to use the name but not the latter s catalog in the late s The Paramount name was used for soundtrack albums and some pop re issues from the Dot Records catalog which Paramount had acquired in By Dot had become an all country label and in Paramount sold all of its record holdings to ABC Records which in turn was sold to MCA now Universal Music Group in br br br Continual success br Paramount s successful run of pictures extended into the s and s generating hits like Airplane American Gigolo Ordinary People An Officer and a Gentleman Flashdance Terms of Endearment Footloose Pretty in Pink Top Gun Crocodile Dundee Fatal Attraction Ghost the Friday the th slasher series as well as joining forces with Lucasfilm and Steven Spielberg to create the Indiana Jones franchise Other examples are the Star Trek film series and a string of films starring comedian Eddie Murphy like Trading Places Coming to America and Beverly Hills Cop and its sequels While the emphasis was decidedly on the commercial there were occasional less commercial but more artistic and intellectual efforts like I m Dancing as Fast as I Can Atlantic City Reds Witness Children of a Lesser God and The Accused During this period responsibility for running the studio passed from Eisner and Katzenberg to Frank Mancuso Sr and Ned Tanen to Stanley R Jaffe and Sherry Lansing More so than most Paramount s slate of films included many remakes and television spin offs while sometimes commercially successful there have been few compelling films of the kind that once made Paramount the industry leader br Around the end of Paramount Pictures took over fellow Gulf and Western subsidiary Sega from the company s manufacturing division in an effort to get into the video game business Paramount would go on to sell Sega following the Video Game Crash of and the two companies would later work together on the live action CGI Sonic the Hedgehog film series br On August Paramount Studios caught fire Two or three sound stages and four outdoor sets were destroyed br When Charles Bluhdorn died unexpectedly his successor Martin Davis dumped all of Gulf and Western s industrial mining and sugar growing subsidiaries and refocused the company renaming it Paramount Communications in With the influx of cash from the sale of Gulf and Western s industrial properties in the mid s Paramount bought a string of television stations and KECO Entertainment s theme park operations renaming them Paramount Parks These parks included Paramount s Great America Paramount Canada s Wonderland Paramount s Carowinds Paramount s Kings Dominion and Paramount s Kings Island br In May Paramount decided to start its own talent department an attempt to form a stable of exclusively contracted film personnel outside of Eddie Murphy this effort proved unsuccessful and studio president Dawn Steel decided to shut down the department on July In Paramount Pictures MGM UA Communications Co and Universal Pictures teamed up in order to market feature film and television product to China a response to the billion admission tickets that were clocked in the country in Worldwide Media Sales a division of the New York based Worldwide Media Group had been placed in charge of the undertaking That year Paramount Pictures decided to consolidate its distribution operations closing a number of branch offices that were designed for the studio and relocating staff and major activities in an effort to cut costs and provide for a more efficient centralization this decision was made in response to a change in distribution practices that had occurred among the various major studios In August Paramount Overseas Productions declared that the subsidiary would be in service not just for the upcoming film Experts which was shot on a budget of million in Canada but also for other films filmed there worldwide including the United Kingdom and Canada br In Sumner Redstone s entertainment conglomerate Viacom made a bid for a merger with Paramount Communications this quickly escalated into a bidding war with Barry Diller s QVC But Viacom prevailed ultimately paying billion for the Paramount holdings Viacom and Paramount had planned to merge as early as br Paramount is the last major film studio located in Hollywood proper When Paramount moved to its present home in it was in the heart of the film community Since then former next door neighbor RKO closed up shop in Paramount ultimately absorbed their former lot Warner Bros whose old Sunset Boulevard studio was sold to Paramount in as a home for KTLA moved to Burbank in Columbia joined Warners in Burbank in then moved again to Culver City in and the Pickford Fairbanks Goldwyn United Artists lot after a lively history has been turned into a post production and music scoring facility for Warners known simply as The Lot For a time the semi industrial neighborhood around Paramount was in decline but has now come back The recently refurbished studio has come to symbolize Hollywood for many visitors and its studio tour is a popular attraction br br br Paramount Communications br br In Gulf and Western began a restructuring process that would transform the corporation from a bloated conglomerate consisting of subsidiaries from unrelated industries to a more focused entertainment and publishing company The idea was to aid financial markets in measuring the company s success which in turn would help place better value on its shares Though its Paramount division did very well in recent years Gulf and Western s success as a whole was translating poorly with investors This process eventually led Davis to divest many of the company s subsidiaries Its sugar plantations in Florida and the Dominican Republic were sold in the consumer and industrial products branch was sold off that same year In Davis renamed the company Paramount Communications Incorporated after its primary asset Paramount Pictures In addition to the Paramount film television home video and music publishing divisions the company continued to own the Madison Square Garden properties which also included MSG Network a stake in USA Networks the other was owned by MCA Universal Studios and Simon Schuster Prentice Hall Pocket Books Allyn Bacon Cineamerica a joint venture with Warner Communications and Canadian cinema chain Famous Players Theatres br That same year the company launched a billion hostile bid to acquire Time Inc in an attempt to end a stock swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to billion in cash and stock Gulf and Western responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time Warner merger The court ruled twice in favor of Time forcing Gulf and Western to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit and allowing the formation of Time Warner br Paramount used cash acquired from the sale of Gulf and Western s non entertainment properties to take over the TVX Broadcast Group chain of television stations which at that point consisted mainly of large market stations which TVX had bought from Taft Broadcasting plus two mid market stations which TVX owned prior to the Taft purchase and the KECO Entertainment chain of theme parks from Taft successor Great American Broadcasting Both of these companies had their names changed to reflect new ownership TVX became known as the Paramount Stations Group while KECO was renamed to Paramount Parks br Paramount Television launched Wilshire Court Productions in conjunction with USA Networks before the latter was renamed NBCUniversal Cable in Wilshire Court Productions named for a side street in Los Angeles produced television films that aired on the USA Networks and later for other networks USA Networks launched a second channel the Sci Fi Channel now known as Syfy in As its name implied it focused on films and television series within the science fiction genre Much of the initial programming was owned either by Paramount or Universal Paramount bought one more television station in Cox Enterprises WKBD TV in Detroit Michigan at the time an affiliate of the Fox Broadcasting Company br br br Dolgen Lansing and old Viacom era br In February Viacom acquired of Paramount Communications Inc shares for billion following a five month battle with QVC and completed the merger in July At the time Paramount s holdings included Paramount Pictures Madison Square Garden the New York Rangers the New York Knicks and the Simon Schuster publishing house The deal had been planned as early as when the company was still known as Gulf and Western Though Davis was named a member of the board of National Amusements which controlled Viacom he ceased to manage the company br During this time period Paramount Pictures went under the guidance of Jonathan Dolgen chairman and Sherry Lansing president During their administration over Paramount the studio had an extremely successful period of films with two of Paramount s ten highest grossing films being produced during this period The most successful of these films Titanic co produced with th Century Fox and Lightstorm Entertainment became the highest grossing film up to that time grossing over billion worldwide Also during this time three Paramount Pictures films won the Academy Award for Best Picture Titanic Braveheart and Forrest Gump br Paramount s most important property however was Star Trek Studio executives had begun to call it the franchise in the s due to its reliable revenue and other studios envied its untouchable and unduplicatable success By Star Trek television shows movies books videotapes and licensing provided so much of the studio s profit that it is not possible to spend any reasonable amount of time at Paramount and not be aware of its presence filming for Star Trek Voyager and Star Trek Deep Space Nine required up to nine of the largest of the studio s sound stages br In Viacom and Chris Craft Industries United Television launched United Paramount Network UPN with Star Trek Voyager as its flagship series fulfilling Barry Diller s plan for a Paramount network from years earlier In Viacom bought out United Television s interests and handed responsibility for the start up network to the newly acquired CBS unit which Viacom bought in an ironic confluence of events as Paramount had once invested in CBS and Viacom had once been the syndication arm of CBS as well During this period the studio acquired
