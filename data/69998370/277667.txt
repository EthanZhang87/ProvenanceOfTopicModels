and gloves fall out of his pocket As Cindy spends the night at Buffy and Doofy s she receives a call from the killer br The following day Bobby is released from jail Buffy is beheaded by the killer

Buddy Johnson and Phil Beauman writers for the sitcom The Wayans Bros br At the same time Miramax was developing a spoof of Scream scripted by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer Due to a WGA decision all six writers were credited despite Friedberg and Seltzer not actually working on the filmed script br br Anna Faris had graduated from the University of Washington and planned to travel to London but decided instead to go to Los Angeles and after meeting with some managers she then auditioned for the film and booked her first acting job Keenen had rejected many other actresses and was willing to take the chance on Faris despite her lack of experience because of her instinctual performance He said She had this natural innocence and was funny br Jenny McCarthy and Melissa Joan Hart auditioned for the part of Drew Decker before Carmen Electra was cast br br Much of the humor of Scary Movie relies upon specific references to other contemporary films Roger Ebert remarked in his review that to get your money s worth you need to be familiar with the various teenage horror franchises The two films on which the script is most heavily based are Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer both written by Kevin Williamson using the general narrative arcs of both films and featuring comedic recreations of key scenes The backstory in which the teenagers are responsible for accidentally killing a man following a beauty pageant recalls the same plot point in I Know What You Did Last Summer Major references to Scream include the identity of Ghostface and the murder of Drew Decker in the opening scene a reference to the opening scene of Scream in which the same thing occurs to the character of Casey Becker played by Drew Barrymore Additionally the characters of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer are mirrored in the film and the title Scary Movie was originally the working title for the project that would eventually become Scream At one point the title of this film was going to be Scream If You Still Know What I Did Last Halloween Although the Ghostface mask and costume was a replica the original costume in the Scream series was used when Cindy notices the killer outside of the school br Many scenes and jokes parody or reference other films outside the horror film genre The fight between Cindy and the killer heavily mimics The Matrix particularly its use of bullet time The final scene in which Doofy stops feigning his disability and drives away with Gail is a takeoff of the final scene of The Usual Suspects When asked about her favorite horror movie Drew answers Kazaam due to Shaquille O Neal s acting Cindy becomes aggressive and roars Say my name during sex with Bobby similar to the sex scene between Michelle and Jim in American Pie The movie theater scene shows a screening of Shakespeare in Love and a trailer for a fictitious sequel to Amistad titled Amistad II with elements of Titanic also appears in the movie theater scene When Gail and her cameraman are attacked by the killer she partakes in a parody of the famous scene in The Blair Witch Project where Heather records an apology to her friends parents br The film also makes other pop culture references beyond the scope of film such as the parodied version of Sarah Michelle Gellar s character Helen Shivers in I Know What You Did Last Summer being named Buffy which is a reference to her character in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Others include a brief references to Dawson s Creek Candid Camera Big Momma s House Candyman Friday the th and a parody of the Whassup ad

based on reviews indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br Joe Leydon of Variety said that the film was unbounded by taste inhibition or political correctness and that the outer limits of R rated respectability are stretched if not shredded Leydon concluded the film is practically guaranteed to make you laugh until you re ashamed of yourself Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four saying it delivers the goods calling the film a raucous satirical attack on slasher movies However Ebert was critical of the film for not being as innovative as other films saying it lacked the shocking impact of Airplane which had the advantage of breaking new ground br Bob Longino of The Atlanta Journal Constitution felt that the film s crude humor detracted from the film saying that Scary Movie dives so deep into tasteless humor that it s a wonder it landed an R rating instead of an NC Other reviewers such as A O Scott of The New York Times argued that the jokes were annoying less for their vulgarity than for their tiredness Scott remarked Couch bound pot smokers prison sex mannish female gym teachers those Whassssup Budweiser commercials hasn t it all been done to death br Peter Howell of The Toronto Star wrote that the film doesn t just push the gross out envelope it folds spindles mutilates and mails it to your mama He adds however that Scary Movie has a nasty side to it that negates much of the humour Many jokes are just plain sexist racist homophobic violent and not funny A scene where a woman is knocked to the ground by an angry man who then proceeds to brutally kick her is sickening to watch The film s frequent use of profanity also seems gratuitous even by these standards but that may be beside the point By the time you realize the four letter word count is running high the plot itself has become repetitious and forced br br List of films featuring fictional films br List of films set
