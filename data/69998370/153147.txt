praising the periodical s coverage of contemporary rock music and offbeat performers such as Frank Zappa Craven left the academic world for the more lucrative role of pornographic film director In the documentary Inside Deep Throat Craven says on camera he made many hardcore X rated films under pseudonyms While his role in Deep Throat is undisclosed most of his early known work involved writing film editing or both br Craven s first feature film as director was The Last House on the Left which was released in Craven expected the film to be shown at only a few theaters which according to him gave me a freedom to be outrageous and to go into areas that normally I wouldn t have gone into and not worry about my family hearing about it or being crushed Ultimately the movie was screened much more widely than he assumed leaving him ostracized due to the content of the film br After the negative experience of Last House Craven attempted to move out of the horror genre and began writing non horror films with his partner Sean S Cunningham none of which attracted any financial backing Finally based on advice from a friend about the ease of filming in the Nevada deserts Craven began to write a new horror film based on that locale The resulting film The Hills Have Eyes cemented Craven as a horror film director with Craven noting It soon became clear that I wasn t going to do anything else unless it was scary br Craven frequently collaborated with Sean S Cunningham In Craven s debut feature The Last House on the Left Cunningham served as producer They pooled all of their resources

Spring The goat in the dream sequence at the beginning of A Nightmare on Elm Street was included by Craven as a homage to Bu uel br br br Style and themes br br Craven s works tend to explore the breakdown of family structures the nature of dreams and reality and often feature black humor and satirical elements Ostensibly civilized families succumb to and exercise violence in The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes A Nightmare on Elm Street Shocker and the Scream films address the process of addressing family trauma br Several of Craven s films are characterized by abusive familial relationships such as The Hills Have Eyes A Nightmare on Elm Street The People Under the Stairs and others Families in denial are a common thread throughout his movies an idea Craven openly discussed br br The family is the best microcosm to work with It s very much where most of our strong emotions or gut feelings come from I grew up in a white working class family that was very religious There was an enormous amount of secrecy in the general commerce of our getting along If there was an argument it was immediately denied If there was a feeling it was repressed I began to see that as a nation we were doing the same things br The blurring of the barrier between dreams and reality sometimes called rubber reality is a staple of Craven s style A Nightmare on Elm Street for example dealt with the consequences of dreams in real life The Serpent and the Rainbow and Shocker portray protagonists who cannot distinguish between nightmarish visions and reality Following New Nightmare Craven increasingly explored metafictional elements in his films New Nightmare has actress Heather Langenkamp play herself as she s haunted by the villain of the film in which she once starred At one point in the film the audience sees on Craven s word processor a script he s written which includes the conversation he just had with Langenkamp as if the script were being written as the action unfolds br In Scream the characters frequently reference horror films similar to their situations and at one point Billy Loomis tells his girlfriend that life is just a big movie This concept was emphasized in the sequels as copycat stalkers re enact the events of a new film about the Woodsboro killings Woodsboro being the fictional town where Scream is set occurring in Scream br
