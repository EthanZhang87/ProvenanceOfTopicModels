the progressive music scene in the United Kingdom in the early s br Island Records operates four international divisions Island US Island UK Island Australia and Island France known as Vertigo France until Current key people include Island US president Darcus Beese and MD Jon Turner Partially due to its significant legacy Island remains one of UMG s pre eminent record labels br br Island Records was founded in Jamaica on July by Chris Blackwell Graeme Goodall and Leslie Kong and financed by Stanley Borden from RKO Its name was inspired by the Harry Belafonte song Island in the Sun Blackwell explained in I loved music so much I just wanted to get into it or be as close to it as I could Blackwell s first album was Lance Hayward at the Half Moon Hotel which was recorded in late br Tom Hayes the label s sales manager between and referred to the early period of the label in the UK as organized chaos The hit My Boy Lollipop sung by Jamaican singer Millie Small was the label s first success in the UK and led to a world tour that also involved Blackwell Blackwell explained in a th anniversary documentary that he was only interested in building long term careers at that stage in time rather than short term projects Suzette Newman has been a close colleague of Chris Blackwell s since working together in the early days of Island Records and while there she ran the Mango world music label Suzette Newman and Chris Salewicz were the editors for the book The Story of Island Records Keep On Running br Blackwell relocated to England in May to garner greater levels of attention after the local Jamaican sound systems proved to be overwhelmingly successful The label was based at a now demolished basement in Kilburn London Borough of Brent in a property that was used by Sonny Roberts s Planetone label and whose landlord was Lee Gopthal who would later create Trojan Records The vast majority of the artists who had signed to Blackwell s fledgling label while he was in Jamaica agreed to allow the musical entrepreneur to release their music in the UK While in England Blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city He did not provide any copies to radio stations as they would not play any of the Island music the music was also not reviewed by the press Meanwhile Goodall left to start the Doctor Bird record label in br br br Blackwell signed the Spencer Davis Group to the label at that time many Island releases were being distributed by Philips Fontana The group became very popular and Island started their own independent series to spotlight UK rock talent They signed artists such as John Martyn Fairport Convention Free and greatly influenced the growing FM radio market By the late s and early s they were a major label in England with artists including Roxy Music King Crimson Sparks Traffic the Wailers Cat Stevens Steve Winwood and many others In the US many of their releases were licensed to A M prior to signing up distribution deals with Capitol and later Atlantic and also independent distribution br For Toots and the Maytals the group that introduced the term reggae in song with their single Do the Reggay Chris Blackwell was the one who decided on the line up of the group before introducing them to an international audience Blackwell had signed Bob Marley and now Toots and the Maytals In November Jackie Jackson described the formation of the group in a radio interview for Kool FM Jamaica Accompanied by Paul Douglas and Radcliffe Dougie Bryan in studio Jackson explained br br We re all original members of Toots and the Maytals band First it was Toots and the Maytals three guys Toots Raleigh and Jerry And then they were signed to Island Records Chris Blackwell And we were their recording band One day we were summoned to Chris house And he says Alright gentleman I think it s time This Toots and the Maytals looks like it s going to be a big thing By this time he had already signed Bob Marley So in his camp Island Records there was Toots and the Maytals the late Bob Marley we were talking about reggae is going international now We kept on meeting and he Blackwell decided that the backing band that back all of the songs the recording band should be the Maytals band So everything came under Toots and the Maytals So we became Maytals also And then we hit the road in we were the opening act for the Eagles Linda Ronstadt and Jackson Browne We were the opening act for The Who for about two weeks br In Island Records acquired a deconsecrated th century church building at Basing Street in the Ladbroke Grove area of Notting Hill in West London The building was refurbished to create the Island Studios recording studio while also serving as the new location for Island Records offices br The first Toots and the Maytals album released and distributed by Chris Blackwell s Island Records was Funky Kingston The Maytals had recently added a full time backing band that included drummer Paul Douglas and bassist Jackie Jackson and Chris Blackwell joined the group in the studio as a co producer for the album Music critic Lester Bangs described the album in Stereo Review as perfection the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released As Blackwell says The Maytals were unlike anything else sensational raw and dynamic Blackwell had a strong commitment to Toots and the Maytals saying I ve known Toots longer than anybody much longer than Bob Bob Marley Toots is one of the purest human beings I ve met in my life pure almost to a fault br Despite the initial establishment work that Blackwell completed almost single handedly Island struggled as a business in the late s and early s Bob Marley s death was detrimental to the label especially after its having engineered Marley s international breakthrough only a few years earlier while Irish rock band U which had signed to Island in March was growing in popularity but had not yet reached the international superstar status that was to come In Blackwell also used the label to finance a new film production and distribution company producing the film Countryman In Paul Morley and producer Trevor Horn started the ZTT label under the Island banner and Blackwell was known to approve excessive spending by the label Morley recalls in a book about Island Records br br I eventually grew to appreciate how Chris Blackwell and therefore Island Records was not about one thing or one style or one system or one way of doing things I began reflecting how the world functions and reinvents itself precisely because it is a fluid sometimes dangerous always exhilarating union of systems and beliefs and the best way of allowing the world to progress is to mix up and place in glorious conflict these various systems and beliefs br In the film production company formed a partnership with Shep Gordon s Alive Enterprises to form Island Alive and had success with Kiss of the Spider Woman Koyaanisqatsi and Stop Making Sense The partnership was dissolved in In August the company was not able to pay US million that it owed to U in royalties for The Joshua Tree album as it had diverted the funds to finance several unsuccessful films U responded by negotiating a deal whereby they received a stake in the label that was estimated to be around per cent br The label s th Broadway division operating since the mid s achieved some success marketing alternative hip hop and dance pop music with artists such as Eric B and Rakim and the Stereo MCs Mango Chaka Demus and Pliers was another Island dance oriented subsidiary while it was singer Robert Palmer who achieved worldwide success with the rock song Addicted to Love in African musicians such as King Sunny Ad and Ang lique Kidjo were also championed by Blackwell br br In July Blackwell sold Island Records and Island Music to the PolyGram UK Group for million he explained in It had gotten too big and too corporate for me and I couldn t really handle it Following the sale Island was no longer an independent company but Blackwell was given a position on PolyGram s board and stayed on as CEO of PolyGram s new Island Entertainment division for ten years PolyGram immediately began reissuing much of the Island back catalogue on compact disc and expanded Island s reach through its global manufacturing and distribution network but the label was relatively unfocused in the s Between and Island had a sub label called the Island Red Label which focused on independent artists br Blackwell eventually ended his association with the company in as the corporate life hindered the independent ethos of his personal life I never really had a job until I sold Island to PolyGram in It had gotten too corporate he commented afterwards After Blackwell left PolyGram closed Island s film business Blackwell left to found the Palm Pictures company and run a chain of boutique hotels in Miami US and the Caribbean including the very exclusive Goldeneye once the Jamaican home of James Bond creator Ian Fleming Then in May all of PolyGram and its associated labels were purchased by Seagram which announced its plan to integrate PolyGram with UMG to produce an estimated cost savings within a couple of years of between US million and million annually Seagram further explained that the acquisition would unite a significant international presence with a thriving domestic business as more than three quarters of PolyGram s sales were outside the US br br In December and the first three months of UMG placed three divisions under the management of the Island brand one in the UK one in the US and one in Germany In each territory these companies were merged under umbrella groups br br In the UK Island Records Group now operating under Virgin EMI Records since br In the US Island Mercury and Def Jam and other record labels were merged into The Island Def Jam Music Group however

the music company remains under the name Universal Music Group UMG br In the US Island became a predominantly pop rock label as their urban artists were assigned to either Def Jam or Def Soul a new Island Def Jam R B imprint Following the takeover of Island by UMG flagship band U were dissatisfied after chief Jason Iley moved to the Mercury label in the mid s and signed with Mercury for the UK and Interscope Records for the US However successful artists such as Tricky and PJ Harvey were impressed by the label and signed on as artists Tricky explained I knew I could get freedom I knew I could do what I wanted to do while Harvey later stated br br I came to work with them sort of fully formed the way that I looked the way that I sounded that was already there And I felt like that they just supported where that was going to go br The label celebrated its th anniversary in br br In Island Records marked the th anniversary of its foundation in Jamaica by Chris Blackwell with a series
