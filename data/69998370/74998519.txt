An armed conflict between Israel and Hamas led Palestinian militant groups has been taking place chiefly in the Gaza Strip and southern Israel since October The fifth war of the Gaza Israel conflict since it has been the deadliest for Palestinians in the entire Israeli Palestinian conflict and the most significant military engagement in the region since the Yom Kippur War br The war began when Hamas led militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel on October which involved a rocket barrage and a few thousand militants breaching the Gaza Israel barrier and attacking Israeli civilian communities and military bases During this attack Israelis and foreign nationals were killed including civilians and security personnel In addition Israelis and foreigners were taken captive into Gaza Hamas said its attack was in response to Israel s continued occupation blockade of Gaza and settlements expansion as well as alleged threats to the Al Aqsa Mosque and the plight of Palestinians After clearing militants from its territory Israel launched one of the most destructive bombing campaigns in modern history and invaded Gaza on October with the stated objectives of destroying Hamas and freeing hostages br Since the start of the Israeli operation more than Palestinians in Gaza have been killed of whom of identified were women and children Israel s tightened blockade cut off basic necessities and attacks on infrastructure have caused healthcare collapse and an impending famine By early Israeli forces had destroyed or damaged more than half of Gaza s houses at least a third of its tree cover and farmland most of its schools and universities hundreds of cultural landmarks and at least a dozen cemeteries Nearly all of the strip s million residents were forcibly displaced Over Israelis remain internally displaced br The war continues to have significant regional and international repercussions Large primarily pro Palestinian protests have taken place across the world calling for a ceasefire The International Court of Justice is reviewing a case accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza The United States has given Israel extensive military aid and vetoed multiple UN Security Council ceasefire resolutions Meanwhile the Axis of Resistance has engaged with its groups attacking American military bases in the Middle East the Yemeni Houthi movement attacking commercial ships allegedly linked to Israel incurring a US led military response and the ongoing exchange of strikes between Lebanon s Hezbollah and Israel risking the eruption of another full scale war br br br Background br br The Palestine war saw the establishment of Israel over most of what had been Mandatory Palestine with the exception of two separated territories that became known as the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which were held by Jordan and Egypt respectively Following the Six Day War Israel occupied the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip The upcoming period witnessed two popular uprisings by Palestinians against the Israeli occupation the First and Second Intifadas in and respectively with the latter s end seeing Israel s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in br Hamas officials stated that the attack was a response to the Israeli occupation blockade of the Gaza Strip Israeli settler violence against Palestinians restrictions on the movement of Palestinians and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians whom Hamas sought to release by taking Israeli hostages Since the Gaza Strip has been governed by Hamas an Islamist militant group while the West Bank remained under the control of the Fatah led Palestinian Authority After Hamas takeover Israel imposed a blockade of the Gaza Strip that significantly damaged its economy The blockade was justified by Israel citing security concerns but international rights groups have characterized the blockade as a form of collective punishment Due to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip UNRWA reported that of people were living below the poverty level in with being food insecure and dependent on international assistance br Since Israel and Hamas along with other Palestinian militant groups based in Gaza have engaged in conflict including in four wars in and These conflicts killed approximately Palestinians and Israelis In there were large weekly organized protests near the Gaza Israel border which were violently suppressed by Israel whose forces killed hundreds and injured thousands of Palestinians by sniper fire Soon after the Israel Palestine crisis began Hamas military wing the Al Qassam Brigades started planning the October operation against Israel br Numerous commentators have identified the broader context of Israeli occupation as a cause of the war The Associated Press wrote that Palestinians are in despair over a never ending occupation in the West Bank and suffocating blockade of Gaza Several human rights organizations including Amnesty International B Tselem and Human Rights Watch have likened the Israeli occupation to apartheid although many dispute this characterization br br br Events br br br October attacks br br The attacks took place during the Jewish holidays of Simchat Torah and Shemini Atzeret on Shabbat and one day after the th anniversary of the start of the Yom Kippur War which also began with a surprise attack on Israel At around a m IDT UTC on October Hamas announced the start of what it called Operation Al Aqsa Flood stating it had fired over rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within a span of minutes Israeli sources reported that at least projectiles had been launched from Gaza At least five people were killed by the rocket attacks Explosions were reported in areas surrounding the strip and in cities in the Sharon plain including Gedera Herzliya Tel Aviv and Ashkelon Air raid sirens were activated in Beersheba Jerusalem Rehovot Rishon LeZion and Palmachim Airbase br Hamas employed tactics such as using aerial drones to disable Israeli observation posts paragliders for infiltration into Israel and motorcycles which was unusual for Hamas Palestinian militants opened fire on Israeli boats while clashes broke out between Palestinians and the Israel Defense Forces IDF along the Gaza perimeter fence In the evening Hamas launched another barrage of rockets towards Israel with explosions reported in Yavne Givatayim Bat Yam Beit Dagan Tel Aviv and Rishon LeZion Simultaneously around Hamas militants infiltrated Israel from Gaza using trucks motorcycles bulldozers speedboats and

hostage during the attacks mostly civilians Captives in Gaza included children festivalgoers peace activists caregivers elderly people and soldiers Hamas militants also reportedly engaged in mutilation torture and sexual and gender based violence including rape and sexual assault by Hamas or other Gazan militants br A briefing in The Economist noted that the assault dwarf ed all other mass murders of Israeli civilians reasoning that the last time before October th that this many Jews were murdered on a single day was during the Holocaust br Hamas stated that its attack was a response to the blockade of the Gaza Strip the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements rising Israeli settler violence and recent escalations at Al Aqsa Intelligence and security officials from multiple Western countries along with Hamas political officials asserted that the October attack was a calculated effort to create a permanent state of war and revive interest in the Palestinian cause br br br Initial Israeli counter operation October br br After the initial breach of the Gaza perimeter by Palestinian militants it took hours for the IDF to start its counter attack br The first helicopters sent to support the military were launched from the north of Israel and arrived at the Gaza Strip an hour after fighting began They immediately encountered difficulty in determining which outposts and communities were occupied and distinguishing between Palestinian militants and the soldiers and civilians on the ground The helicopter crews initially sustained a high rate of fire attacking approximately targets in hours Later on the crews began to slow down the attacks and carefully select targets br According to Haaretz s journalist Josh Breiner a police source said that a police investigation indicated an IDF helicopter which had fired on Hamas militants apparently also hit some festival participants in the Re im music festival massacre The Israeli police denied the Haaretz report br A subsequent Israeli investigation claimed that militants had been instructed not to run so that the air force would think they were Israelis This deception worked for some time but pilots began to realize the problem and ignore their restrictions By around am amid the chaos and confusion some helicopters started laying down fire without prior authorization br The attack appeared to have been a complete surprise to the Israelis Prime Minister Netanyahu convened an emergency gathering of security authorities and the IDF launched Operation Swords of Iron in the Gaza Strip In a televised broadcast Netanyahu said We are at war He threatened to turn all the places where Hamas is organized and hiding into cities of ruins called Gaza the city of evil and urged its residents to leave Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant conducted security assessments at IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv Overnight Israel s Security Cabinet voted to act to bring about the destruction of the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad The Israel Electric Corporation which supplies of the Gaza Strip s electricity cut off power to the area This reduced Gaza s power supply from MW to MW provided by power plants paid for by the Palestinian Authority br The IDF declared a state of readiness for war mobilized tens of thousands of army reservists and declared a state of emergency for areas within kilometers mi of Gaza The Yamam counterterrorism unit was deployed along with four new divisions augmenting existing battalions Reservists were reported deployed in Gaza in the West Bank and along borders with Lebanon and Syria br Residents near Gaza were asked to stay inside while civilians in southern and central Israel were required to stay next to shelters The southern region of Israel was closed to civilian movement and roads were closed around Gaza and Tel Aviv While Ben Gurion Airport and Ramon Airport remained operational multiple airlines cancelled flights to and from Israel Israel Railways suspended service in parts of the country and replaced some routes with temporary bus routes while cruise ships removed the ports of Ashdod and Haifa from their itineraries br br br Israeli blockade and bombardment br br Following the surprise attack the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes that they said targeted Hamas compounds command centers tunnels and other targets Israel employed its artificial intelligence Habsora The Gospel software with a new and superior capacity to automatically generate targets to be attacked Two days after the surprise attack Israel said that Hamas targets had been hit including destroying Beit Hanoun homes of Hamas officials a mosque and an internet hub Israel also rescued two hostages before declaring a state of war for the first time since the Yom Kippur War br On October Defense Minister Gallant announced a total blockade of the Gaza Strip cutting off electricity and blocking the entry of food and fuel adding We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly This drew criticism from Human Rights Watch HRW who described the order as abhorrent and as a call to commit a war crime and accused Israel of using white phosphorus munitions over Gaza stating that it violated international law Israel denied the allegations Gallant then changed his position of a complete blockade after receiving pressure from US President Joe Biden and a deal was made on October for Israel and Egypt to allow aid into Gaza The first aid convoy after the start of the war entered Gaza on October while fuel entered Gaza only in November br br br Evacuation of Northern Gaza br br Almost a week after the initial attack on Israel on October the IDF called the evacuation of all civilians of Gaza City to the area south of the Wadi Gaza All Palestinians in that region including those in Gaza City were given hours to evacuate to the south The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs responded by telling residents in northern Gaza to remain steadfast in your homes and stand firm in the face of this disgusting psychological war waged by the occupation The statement by Israel faced widespread backlash with numerous agencies such as Doctors Without Borders the World Health Organization the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights among others condemning the order as outrageous and impossible while calling for an immediate reversal of the order br As a part of the order the IDF announced a six hour window from a m to p m local time on October for refugees to flee south along specified routes within the Gaza Strip An explosion at p m along one of the safe routes killed people Some sources attributed it to an IDF airstrike while CNN said the cause was unclear The Jerusalem Post said open source analysts believed the explosion originated from a car on the ground but the cause was unclear The Financial Times carried out an investigation concluding analysis of the video footage rules out most explanations aside from an Israeli strike although it was difficult to conclusively prove whether these blasts came from an IDF strike a potential Palestinian rocket misfire or even a car bomb br The IDF stated Hamas set up roadblocks to keep Gaza residents from evacuating south and caused traffic jams Israeli officials stated this was done to use civilians as human shields which Hamas denied A number of countries and international organizations condemned what they called Hamas s use of hospitals and civilians as human shields According to an unnamed Israeli official Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar left Gaza City using a vehicle associated with a humanitarian relief mission br br br October br br On October Israel bombed in areas of southern Gaza Ministry of Health officials in Gaza reported heavy overnight bombing killing over people including families who had evacuated from Gaza City in the north One of the airstrikes killed a senior Hamas military commander Ayman Nofal In the afternoon an Israeli strike hit a UNRWA school in the Al Maghazi refugee camp killing six and injuring br Late in the evening an explosion occurred in the parking lot of the Al Ahli Arabi Baptist Hospital in the center of Gaza City killing hundreds The cause of the explosion was disputed by Hamas and the IDF and the ongoing conflict prevented independent on site analysis Palestinian statements that it was an Israeli airstrike were denied by the IDF which stated that the explosion resulted from a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad The PIJ denied any involvement An independent analysis by Human Rights Watch indicated that the evidence pointed to a misfired Palestinian rocket as the cause but stated that further investigation was required br On October President Biden said the Pentagon had independently concluded that the explosion was not caused by Israel but by the other team based on data from the Defense Department Over the next few days Canadian British and French officials announced that their respective intelligence agencies concluded the cause to be a failed Palestinian rocket and not an Israeli airstrike In its article dated November CNN stated that multiple experts said they believe this to be the most likely scenario although they caution the absence of munition remnants or shrapnel from the scene made it difficult to be sure All agreed that the available images of evidence of the damage at the site was not consistent with an Israeli airstrike br br br Invasion of the Gaza Strip until the truce October November br br On October the IDF launched a large scale multi pronged ground incursion into parts of northern Gaza The IDF was building up a force of over soldiers in the cities of Ashkelon Sderot and Kiryat Gat

of treating all those detained with humanity and dignity in accordance with international humanitarian law The BBC reported that a video of the apparent surrender of weapons was unclear on whether a

humanitarian crisis as a result of the Israel Hamas war The crisis includes both a famine and a healthcare collapse At the start of the war Israel tightened its blockade on the Gaza Strip which has resulted in significant shortages of fuel food medication water and essential medical supplies This siege resulted in a drop in electricity availability impacting hospital power supplies sewage plants and shutting down the desalination plants that provide drinking water Widespread disease outbreaks have spread across Gaza br Heavy bombardment by Israeli airstrikes caused catastrophic damage to Gaza s infrastructure further deepening the crisis Direct attacks on telecommunications infrastructure by Israel electricity blockades and fuel shortages caused the near total collapse of Gaza s largest cell network providers Lack of internet access has obstructed Gazan citizens from communicating with loved ones learning of IDF operations and identifying both the areas most exposed to bombing and possible escape routes The blackouts have also impeded emergency services making it more difficult to locate and access the time critical injured and have impeded humanitarian aid agencies and

br br Since the start of the war the UN Human Rights Council has identified clear evidence of war crimes by both Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces A UN Commission to the Israel Palestine conflict

Palestinian armed groups are responsible for the war crimes of intentionally directing attacks against civilians murder or willful killing torture inhuman or cruel treatment destroying or seizing the property of an adversary outrages upon personal dignity and taking hostages including children In relation to Israeli military operations and attacks in Gaza the commission concluded that Israeli authorities are responsible for the war crimes of starvation as a method of warfare murder or willful killing intentionally directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects forcible transfer sexual violence torture and inhuman or cruel treatment arbitrary detention and outrages upon personal dignity It also found that Israel committed numerous crimes against humanity including carrying out the extermination of Palestinians and gender persecution targeting Palestinian men and boys The commission said that they had submitted pieces of evidence to the International Criminal Court related to crimes committed by Israel and Hamas as part of the International Criminal Court investigation in Palestine br br br Diplomatic impact br br The war sparked a major diplomatic crisis with many countries around the world reacting strongly to the conflict that affected the momentum of regional relations At least nine countries took the drastic step of recalling their ambassadors and cutting diplomatic ties with Israel br The war has also resulted in a renewed focus on a two state solution to the broader conflict Global public opinion of Israel has dropped during the war as well a Morning Consult poll published in January indicated that the United States was the only remaining wealthy country in which Israel had net positive approval br Negotiations have focused on the possibility of a ceasefire in the war with Egypt and Qatar serving as mediators in negotiations between Israel and Hamas The United Nations Security Council passed resolution in March demanding an immediate ceasefire and the unconditional release of hostages for the month of Ramadan br Following talks mediated by China on July Palestinian groups including Hamas and Fatah reached an agreement to end their divisions and form an interim unity government which they announced in the Beijing Declaration br br br Reactions br br br Israel br br The Israeli government s response to the Hamas led attack on Israel has multiple aspects including a military response leading to the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip In October the Knesset approved a war cabinet in Israel adding National Unity ministers and altering the government Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz froze non war legislation establishing a war cabinet with military authority br The IDF s subsequent large scale bombing and invasion of Gaza led to a humanitarian crisis mass detentions and famine Israel s response was criticized as resulting in war crimes and it was charged with genocide by South Africa in the International Court of Justice Settler expansions and officials controversial remarks heightened unrest leading to protests in Israel The Knesset s law criminalizing terrorist materials consumption drew criticism br In an interview to the Wall Street Journal on December Netanyahu said that Israel s objectives were to destroy Hamas demilitarize Gaza and deradicalize the whole of Palestinian society There was broad support in Israeli society for military operations in Gaza Public opinion poll conducted in December by the Israel Democracy Institute found that of Jewish Israelis supported the war in Gaza br br br Palestinian territories br Initially Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas asserted the Palestinians right to self defense against the terror of settlers and occupation troops and condemned the orders by Israel for residents to evacuate north Gaza labeling it a second Nakba Later Abbas rejected the killing of civilians on both sides and said that the Palestinian Liberation Organization was the sole representative of the Palestinians br br br International br br Significant geopolitical divisions emerged during the war Much of the Western world provided strong diplomatic and military support to Israel including the United States United Kingdom and Germany although the strong support is at odds with the attitudes of Western publics which continue to shift away from Israel according to Hugh Lovatt a senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations Lovatt says that during the Cold War Israel sided with the West against the Arab countries supported by the Soviets and Western leaders generally see Israel as a fellow member of the liberal democratic club and that this partially explains the continued strong Western support for Israel which has now largely become reflexive At least nations denounced Hamas and explicitly condemned its conduct on October as terrorism including a joint statement by the United States the United Kingdom France Italy and Germany br In contrast the Islamic world and much of the Global South denounced the actions of Israel and its allies criticizing the moral authority of the West and alleging that it holds double standards surrounding human rights The double standards in their view is condemning an illegal occupation in Ukraine while standing firmly behind Israel that has occupied Palestinian lands Bolivia has cut all ties with Israel as a result of the conflict while fellow South American countries Colombia and Chile recalled their ambassadors to the country br The United States United Kingdom and Germany have supplied Israel with substantial military and medical aid br The Israeli government s response prompted international protests

Kingdom arranged flights for its citizens in Israel the first plane departed Ben Gurion Airport that day The government had said before that it would not be evacuating its nationals due to available commercial flights However most commercial flights were suspended Nepal arranged a flight to evacuate at least of its citizens who were studying in Israel India launched Operation Ajay to evacuate its citizens from Israel Ukraine has facilitated the evacuation of around of its citizens from Israel as of October with additional evacuation flights in the planning for the near future br br br Regional effects br br According to Daniel Byman and Alexander Palmer the attack showcased the decline of the Palestine Liberation Organization PLO and the rise of Hamas as a power center in Palestinian politics They predicted the PLO s further decline if the status quo held Laith Alajlouni wrote that the immediate effect of the Hamas offensive was to unite Hamas and PLO However it may soon lead to conflict between them possibly leading the PLO to lose control of the security situation in the West Bank if more militant groups there begin to launch their independent attacks br Political journalist Peter Beaumont described the attack as an intelligence failure for the ages on the part of the Israeli government The Jewish News Syndicate deemed it a failure of imagination A BBC report on the intelligence failure commented that it must have taken extraordinary levels of operational security by Hamas US officials expressed shock at how Israeli intelligence appeared to be unaware of any preparations by Hamas Israeli officials later anonymously reported to Axios that the IDF and Shin Bet had detected abnormal movements by Hamas the day before the attack but decided to wait for additional intelligence before raising the military s alert level They also did not inform political leaders of the intelligence reports br Amit Segal chief political commentator for Israel s Channel said that the conflict would test Benjamin Netanyahu s survival as prime minister noting that past wars had toppled the governments of several of his predecessors such as that of Golda Meir following the Yom Kippur War Menachem Begin following the Lebanon War and Ehud Olmert following the Lebanon War Prior to the formation of an emergency unity government on October Politico described the then potential move as Netanyahu s opportunity to correct his course and save his political legacy Citing the Israeli intelligence failure which some observers attributed to the incumbent government focusing more on internal dissent the judicial reform and efforts to deepen Israel s occupation of the Palestinian territories some commentators criticized Netanyahu for putting aside the PLO and propping up Hamas and described him as a liability br In an analysis by The Times of Israel the newspaper wrote Hamas has violently shifted the world s eyes back to the Palestinians and dealt a severe blow to the momentum for securing a landmark US brokered deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia Andreas Kluth wrote in his Bloomberg News column that Hamas torched Biden s deal to remake the Middle East arguing that the deal that was being discussed between Saudi Arabia Israel and the United States would have left Palestinians in the cold so the group decided to blow the whole thing up He added that viewed from Gaza things were only going to get worse considering that Netanyahu s coalition partners opposed a two state solution for the conflict He suggested they would prefer to annex the entirety of the West Bank even at the expense of turning Israel into an apartheid state br br br Economic impact br br On November the Bank of Israel reported that the drop in labor supply caused by the war was costing the Israeli economy million a week or of weekly GDP The bank also stated that the estimate does not reflect total damage and did not include damages caused by the absence of Palestinian and foreign workers In the final quarter of the Israeli economy shrank by quarter to quarter due to labour shortages in construction and from the mobilization of reservists While Israel did still see economic growth of this was down from growth in the year before the war Further consequences of the war were that consumer spending declined by imports declined by and exports were reported to decline by br Israel s high tech factories reported on December that they had been having trouble with electronic imports from China due to recent bureaucratic obstacles leading to higher import costs and

farming sectors China s actions were described as a de facto sanction br The Water Transport Workers Federation of India a trade union representing major Indian ports and workers said it would refuse

a shortage of about foreign and Palestinian workers br It has been calculated that the carbon cost in terms of climate impact of rebuilding Gaza would exceed the annual greenhouse emissions of countries br br br Media coverage br br br Criticism from journalists br Over journalists signed an open letter condemning Israel s killing of reporters in Gaza and criticizing Western media s coverage of the war The letter said newsrooms are accountable for dehumanizing rhetoric that has served to justify ethnic cleansing of Palestinians Signers of the letter were criticized for potentially impeding their organizations ability to gather news and could face management backlash Semafor reported that Los Angeles Times journalists who signed the letter were barred from covering the Gaza war in any way for at least three months br On November eleven international news organizations sent a letter to Israel and Egypt asking for access to the Gaza Strip to cover the war br CBS reported on December a statement of the International Federation of Journalists noting that the number of journalists killed in the past two months in the war in Gaza has surpassed the amount killed in the Vietnam War which lasted two decades More than Palestinian journalists died Various dangerous conditions such as airstrikes lack of food risks related to lack of clean water and shelter make it such that Palestine is one of the most dangerous places for a journalist to do their job Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court under section b of the Rome Statute accusing Israel of committing war crimes against journalists It also lodged a complaint against Hamas under section a of the Rome Statute for the killing of a reporter covering the October attack br The Committee to Protect Journalists has accused Israel of targeting journalists reporting from Gaza and their families saying that in at least two cases journalists reported receiving threats from Israeli officials and Israel Defense Forces officers before their family members were killed br br br Unsubstantiated reports of certain October atrocities br br In the aftermath of the initial Hamas assault witnesses from the IDF and the Israeli organization ZAKA reported on various media outlets that they had seen bodies of beheaded infants and children at the site of the Kfar Aza
