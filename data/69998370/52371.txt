world including Paris He wins two third class tickets for the Titanic in a poker game and travels with his friend Fabrizio He is attracted to Rose at first sight Her fianc s invitation to dine with them the next evening enables Jack to mix with the first class passengers for a night Cameron s original choice for the role was River Phoenix however he died in Though established actors like Matthew McConaughey Chris O Donnell Billy Crudup and Stephen Dorff were considered Cameron felt they were too old for the part of a year old Tom Cruise was interested but his asking price was too high Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role but Leto refused to audition Jeremy Sisto did a series of screen tests with Winslet and three other actresses vying for the role of Rose DiCaprio years old at the time was brought to Cameron s attention by casting director Mali Finn Initially he did not want the role and refused to read his first romantic scene Cameron said He read it once then started goofing around and I could never get him to focus on it again But for one split second a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio s acting ability and told him Look I m not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic I m not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want Cameron envisioned the character as being like those played by James Stewart or Gregory Peck Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax Nova Scotia where victims are buried there is a grave labeled J Dawson The producers did not know of the real J Dawson until after the film was released br Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater Cameron said Winslet had the thing that you look for and that there was a quality

Ryder Claire Danes who had previously worked with DiCaprio in Romeo Juliet the previous year Gabrielle Anwar and Reese Witherspoon had been considered for the role When they turned it down Winslet campaigned heavily for the role She sent Cameron daily notes from England which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions As with DiCaprio casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron s attention When looking for a Rose Cameron described the character as an Audrey Hepburn type and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him After she screen tested with DiCaprio Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him that she whispered to Cameron He s great Even if you don t pick me pick him Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed From Your Rose and lobbied him by phone You don t understand she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee I am Rose I don t know why you re even seeing anyone else Her persistence as well as her talent eventually convinced him to cast her in the role br Billy Zane as Caledon Cal Hockley Rose s arrogant and snobbish year old fianc who is the heir to a

than having a loving marriage She strongly dislikes Jack even though he saved her daughter s life br Gloria Stuart as the modern day Rose Dawson Calvert Rose narrates the film in a framing device Cameron stated In order to see the present and the past I decided to create a fictional survivor who is close to years and she connects us in a way through history The year old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the Heart of the Ocean after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck She shares the story of her time aboard the ship and speaks about her relationship with Jack for the first time since the sinking At Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role Of casting Stuart Cameron stated My casting director found her She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was and Fay Wray was also considered for the role But Stuart was just so into it and so lucid and had such a great spirit And I saw the connection between her spirit and Winslet s spirit stated Cameron I saw this joie de vivre in both of them that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it s the same person br Bill Paxton as Brock Lovett a treasure hunter looking for the Heart of the Ocean in the wreck of the Titanic in the present Time and funding for his expedition are running out He reflects at the film s conclusion that despite thinking about Titanic for three years he has never understood it until he hears Rose s story br Suzy Amis as Lizzy Calvert

events the film includes portrayals of various historical figures br br Kathy Bates as Margaret Molly Brown Brown is looked down upon by other first class women including Ruth as vulgar and new money She is friendly to Jack and lends him a suit of evening clothes bought for her son when he is invited to dinner in the first class dining saloon She was dubbed The Unsinkable Molly Brown by historians because with the support of other women she commandeered Lifeboat from Quartermaster Robert Hichens Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron s film Reba McEntire was offered the role but had to turn it down because it conflicted with her touring schedule br Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews The ship s builder Andrews is portrayed as a kind decent man who is modest about his grand achievement After the collision he tries to convince the others particularly Ismay that it is a mathematical certainty that the ship will sink He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first class smoking room lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the Titanic this story which was published in a book Thomas Andrews Shipbuilder and therefore perpetuated came from John Stewart a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no at approximately a m There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts then he continued assisting with the evacuation br br Bernard Hill as Captain Edward John Smith Smith planned to make the Titanic his final voyage before retiring He retreats into the wheelhouse on the bridge as the ship sinks dying when the windows burst from the water pressure whilst he clings to the ship s wheel There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat B br Jonathan Hyde as J Bruce Ismay White Star Line s ignorant boorish managing director Ismay influences Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention while this appears in popular portrayals of the disaster it is unsupported by evidence After the collision he struggles to comprehend that his unsinkable ship is doomed Ismay later boards Collapsible C one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship just before it is lowered He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned br Eric Braeden as John Jacob Astor IV a first class passenger and the richest man on the ship The film depicts Astor and his year old wife Madeleine Charlotte Chatton

struck the iceberg During a rush for the lifeboats Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan as well as another passenger in a momentary panic then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head When Murdoch s nephew Scott saw the film he objected to his uncle s portrayal as damaging to Murdoch s heroic reputation A few months later Fox vice president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie Scotland where Murdoch lived to deliver a personal apology and also presented a donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school s William Murdoch Memorial Prize Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the women and children first policy According to Cameron his depiction of Murdoch is that of an honorable man not of a man gone bad or of a cowardly murderer He added I m not sure you d find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one That says something about character and heroism br Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water and following the collision suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the

Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat Lifeboats and were emergency boats with a capacity of Situated at the forward end of the boat deck these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard On the night of the disaster Lifeboat was the fourth to be launched with people aboard including Duff Gordon his wife and her secretary The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the women and children first policy and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat s crew which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe The Duff Gordons at the time and his wife s secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat there is confirmation that lifeboat of the Titanic was almost empty and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place simply to fill it after they had asked if they could get on Duff Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe The British Board of Trade s inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff Gordon s denial of bribing the crew but

flask According to the real Joughin s testimony he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold most likely thanks to alcohol In a deleted scene he s shown throwing deckchairs overboard before taking a drink from his bottle br Terry Forrestal as Chief Engineer Joseph G Bell Bell and his men worked throughout the sinking to keep the lights and the power on in order for distress signals to get out The film portrays Bell and all of the engineers as having died in the bowels of the Titanic however there is evidence to suggest that at least some of the engineers were released to come on deck when the flooding became severe Greaser Frederick Scott testified to seeing eight engineers between approximately and a m standing up against the electric crane on the starboard Boat Deck by then all the lifeboats had gone br br br Cameos br Several crew members of the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh appear including Anatoly Sagalevich the creator and pilot of the Mir self propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle Van Ling portrayed Fang Lang his backstory inspired Cameron to produce a documentary The Six based on a group of Chinese survivors who survived the sinking Anders Falk who filmed a documentary about the film s sets for the Titanic Historical Society makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda then President and Vice President of the Society who served as film consultants were cast as extras in the film br br br Pre production br br br Writing and inspiration br br James Cameron has long had a fascination with shipwrecks and for him Titanic was the Mount Everest of shipwrecks He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition but said he still had a mental restlessness to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college When an IMAX film Titanica was made from footage shot of the Titanic wreck Cameron decided to seek Hollywood funding for his own expedition It was not because I particularly wanted to make the movie Cameron said I wanted to dive to the shipwreck br Cameron wrote a scriptment for a Titanic film met with th Century Fox executives including Peter Chernin and pitched it as Romeo and Juliet on the Titanic Cameron said the executives were unconvinced of the commercial potential and had instead hoped for action scenes similar to his previous films They approved the project as they hoped for a long term relationship with Cameron br Cameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the Titanic wreck and organized several dives over a period of two years He also convinced Fox that shooting the real wreck for the film scenes instead of simulating it with special effects would provide value We can either do the shots with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that which will cost X amount of money or we can spend X plus per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck br The crew shot at the wreck in the Atlantic Ocean times in The work was risky as the water pressure could kill the crew if there were a tiny flaw in the submersible structure Additionally adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting footage During one dive one of the submersibles collided with Titanic s hull damaging both sub and ship and leaving fragments of the submersible s propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure The external bulkhead of the captain s quarters collapsed exposing the interior and the area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was damaged br Descending to the site emphasized to the crew that the Titanic disaster was not simply a story but a real event with real loss of life Cameron said Working around the wreck for so much time you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it and the message of it He felt a great mantle of responsibility to convey the emotional message of the story as he was aware there might never be another filmmaker to visit the wreck br Cameron felt the Titanic sinking was like a great novel that really happened but that the event had become a mere morality tale the film would give audiences the experience of living the history The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy He believed that the romance of Jack and Rose would be the most engaging element when their love is finally destroyed the audience would mourn the loss He said All my films are love stories but in Titanic I finally got the balance right It s not a disaster film It s a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history br After filming the underwater shots Cameron began writing the screenplay He wanted to honor the people who died and spent six months researching the Titanic s crew and passengers He created a detailed timeline of the events of the voyage and sinking and had it verified by historical experts From the beginning of the shoot the team had a very clear picture of what happened on the ship Cameron said That set the bar higher in a way it elevated the movie in a sense We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you d gone back in a time machine and shot it Cameron was influenced by the British film about Titanic A Night to Remember which he had seen as a youth He liberally copied some dialogue and scenes including the lively party of the passengers in steerage and the musicians playing on the deck during the sinking br Cameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant While Winslet and Stuart believed Rose dies at the end of the film Cameron said the answer has to be something you supply personally individually br br br Scale modeling br br Harland Wolff Titanic s builders opened their private archives to the crew sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost For the ship s interiors production designer Peter Lamont s team looked for artifacts from the era The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch Fox acquired acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico and began building a new studio on May A horizon tank of million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship providing degrees of ocean view The ship was built to full scale but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank with the remaining sections filled with digital models The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent The boat deck and A deck were working sets but the rest of the ship was steel plating Within was a foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences The foot th scale model of the stern section was designed by the naval architect Jay Kantola using plans of the Titanic s sister ship RMS Olympic Above the model was a foot tall m tower crane on feet m of rail track acting as a combined construction lighting and camera platform br The sets representing the interior rooms of the Titanic were reproduced exactly using photographs and plans from the Titanic s builders The Grand Staircase which features prominently in the film was recreated to a high standard though it was widened compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plasterwork based on Titanic s original designs The carpeting upholstery individual pieces of furniture light fixtures chairs cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs Cameron hired two Titanic historians Don Lynch and Ken Marschall to authenticate the historical detail br br br Production br Principal photography began on July at Dartmouth Nova Scotia with the modern day expedition scenes aboard the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh In September the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito Mexico where a full scale Titanic had been constructed The poop deck was built on a hinge that could rise from zero to degrees in a few seconds just as the ship s stern rose during the sinking For the safety of the stuntmen many props were made of foam rubber By November the boarding scenes were being shot Cameron built his Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north to south wind which blew the funnel smoke aft This posed a problem for shooting the ship s departure from Southampton as it was docked on its port side Implementation of written directions as well as props and costumes had to be reversed for example if someone walked to their right in the script they had to walk left during shooting In post production the film was flipped to the correct direction A full time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in Despite this several critics noted anachronisms in the film br br Cameron sketched Jack s portrait of Rose Winslet posed in a bathing suit Cameron felt the scene had a backdrop of repression and freedom You know what it means for her the freedom she must be feeling It s kind of exhilarating for that reason he said The sketching scene was DiCaprio and Winslet s first scene together It wasn t by any kind of design although I couldn t have designed it better There s a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them Cameron stated They had rehearsed together but they hadn t shot anything together If I d had a choice I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot Cameron said he and his crew were just trying to find things to shoot because the big set wasn t ready for months so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot Cameron felt the final scene worked well br The shoot was an arduous experience that cemented Cameron s formidable reputation as the scariest man in Hollywood He became known as an uncompromising hard charging perfectionist and a decibel screamer a modern day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie talkie swooping down into people s faces on a ft crane Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the m gallon water tank in which the ship would sink There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him Jim has a temper like you wouldn t believe she said God damn it he would yell at some poor crew member That s exactly what I didn t want Bill Paxton was familiar with Cameron s work ethic from his earlier experience and said There were a lot of people on the set Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him Mij Jim spelled backwards In response to the criticism Cameron said Film making is war A great battle between business and aesthetics More than crew members worked on the film a large number for any Hollywood production br On August during the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh shoot in Canada an unknown person suspected to be a crew member put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night in Dartmouth Nova Scotia It sent more than people to the hospital Paxton and Cameron ate the soup and went to the hospital but Paxton decided to leave telling Cameron Jim I m not gonna hang out here this is bedlam I m gonna wander back down to the set and just drink a case of beer There were people just rolling around completely out of it Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics said actor Lewis Abernathy Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked One eye was completely red like the Terminator eye A pupil no iris beet red The other eye looked like he d been sniffing glue since he was four The Nova Scotia Department of Health confirmed that the soup had contained PCP on August and the Halifax Regional Police Service announced a criminal investigation the next day The investigation was closed in February The person behind the poisoning was never caught br br The filming schedule was intended to last days but grew to filming officially wrapped on March Many cast members came down with colds flu or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water including Winslet In the end she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned a lot of money Several others left the production and three stuntmen broke their bones but the Screen Actors Guild decided following an investigation that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set Additionally DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets although he acknowledged I m demanding and I m demanding on my crew In terms of being kind of militaresque I think there s an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe I think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people br The costs of filming Titanic ballooned and eventually reached million a bit over million per minute of screen time Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three hour film They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings thus less revenue even though long epics are more likely to help directors win Oscars Cameron refused telling Fox You want to cut my movie You re going to have to fire me You want to fire me You re going to have to kill me The executives did not want to start over because it would mean the loss of their entire investment The executives initially rejected Cameron s offer to forfeit his share of the profits as an empty gesture as they predicted profits would be unlikely Worried about the mounting costs Fox wanted to find a partner studio to co finance the film Fox first turned to Universal Pictures as they had picked up the international distribution rights to Cameron s True Lies when production costs began to mount however Universal would turn Fox down and Fox was then approached by Paramount Pictures in May following the success both studios had collaborating together on Mel Gibson s Braveheart and ultimately agreed to co finance the film together and split the distribution rights In an effort to recoup their million investment Fox sold the domestic rights to the film to Paramount in return for Paramount providing Fox an additional million for production while retaining international rights Fox however would still be responsible for any further budget overruns going forward but also retain all profits from any merchandise sold based on the film as part of the deal with Paramount br Cameron explained forfeiting his share as complex the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than T and True Lies Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget Titanic also had a large budget to begin with but it went up a lot more he said As the producer and director I take responsibility for the studio that s writing the checks so I made it less painful for them I did that on two different occasions They didn t force me to do it they were glad that I did Amidst the film s successful box office run a Fox executive William Mechanic commented that Jim Cameron told us we could have an expensive bad movie or a more expensive potentially great movie We made our judgment And we made the best choice br In July Cameron stated that it was actually co producer Jon Landau who bore the brunt of the studio pressure when Titanic was being made According to Cameron Landau gave his all to provide the time and resources for me to make the film I saw in my head br br br Post production br br br Effects br Cameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on The Abyss and Terminator Judgment Day Many previous films about Titanic shot water in slow motion which did not look wholly convincing Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their foot long m miniature of the ship as if we re making a commercial for the White Star Line Afterwards digital water and smoke were added as were extras captured on a motion capture stage Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors including himself and his children for the digital extras and stuntmen There was also a foot long m model of the ship s stern that could break in two repeatedly the only miniature to be used in water For scenes set in the ship s engines footage of the SS Jeremiah O Brien s engines were composited with miniature support frames and actors shot against a greenscreen In order to save money the first class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out br br An enclosed US gallon L tank was used for sinking interiors in which the entire set could be tilted into the water In order to sink the Grand Staircase US gallons L of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank Unexpectedly the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel reinforced foundations although no one was hurt The foot long m exterior of Titanic had its first half lowered into the tank but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water to get the set into the water Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself After submerging the dining saloon three days were spent shooting Lovett s ROV traversing the wreck in the present The post sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a US gallon L tank where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water and wax was coated on hair and clothes br The climactic scene which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic involved a tilting full sized set extras and stunt performers Cameron criticized previous Titanic films for depicting the liner s final plunge as a graceful slide underwater He wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was When carrying out the sequence people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts The risks were eventually minimized by using computer generated people for the dangerous falls A Linux based operating system was utilized for the creation of the effects br br br Editing br Cameron said there were aspects of the Titanic story that seemed important in pre and post production but became less important as the film evolved He omitted the SS Californian the ship that was close to the Titanic the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night did not hear her crew s SOS calls and did not respond to their distress flares A scene involving the Californian was cut according to Cameron because it focuses you back onto that world If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor as a microcosm for the end of the world in a sense then that world must be self contained He said its omission was not a compromise to mainstream filmmaking but about emphasis creating an emotional truth to the film br During the first assembly cut Cameron altered the ending In the original version Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide Rose reveals that she had the Heart of the Ocean diamond all along but never sold it to live on her own without Cal s money She allows Brock to hold it but tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean After accepting that treasure is worthless Brock laughs at his stupidity In the editing room Cameron decided that by this point the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the scene so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond He also did not want to disrupt the audience s melancholy after the Titanic s sinking Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock s epiphany and laugh was unnecessary saying I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better Our job was done by then If you re smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it you ll listen to the film and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need br The version used for the first test screening featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon The scene was written to give the film more suspense and had Cal offering to give Lovejoy his valet the Heart of the Ocean if he can get it from Jack and Rose Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first class dining room Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a window this is why Lovejoy has a gash later in the film Test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one s life for wealth and Cameron cut it for this reason as well as for timing and pacing reasons Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons br br br Heart of the Ocean br br For the Heart of the Ocean design London based jewelers Asprey Garrard used cubic zirconias set in white gold to create an Edwardian style necklace to be used as a prop in the film The studio designed and produced three variations very similar but unique and distinguishable in character Two of them were used in the film while the third went unused until after the film had been released The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop the J Peterman necklace and the Asprey necklace br The third and final design was not used in the film After the film s success Asprey Garrard were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design The result was a platinum set carat g heart shaped Ceylon sapphire surrounded by diamonds This design featured a much larger inverted pear shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round pear and marquise cut white diamonds The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone The necklace was donated to Sotheby s auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California s Aid For AIDS It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client for million equivalent to million in under the agreement that Dion would wear it two nights later at the Academy Awards ceremony Since then this necklace has not been made available for public viewing br br br Soundtrack br br Cameron wrote Titanic while listening to the work of the Irish new age musician Enya After Enya declined an invitation to compose for the film Cameron instead chose James Horner The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on Aliens but Titanic cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner s death For the vocals heard throughout the film Horner chose the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjeb commonly known as Sissel Horner knew Sissel from her album Innerst i sjelen and particularly liked how she sang Eg veit i himmerik ei borg I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle He tried around singers before choosing Sissel br Horner wrote the end theme My Heart Will Go On in secret with Will Jennings because Cameron did not want any songs in the film C line Dion agreed to record a demo at the persuasion of her husband Ren Ang lil Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song After playing it several times Cameron declared his approval although worried that he would have been criticized for going commercial at the end of the movie Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion br The soundtrack was the best selling album of with sales of over million br br br Release br br br Initial screening br Distribution for the film was split between Paramount Pictures and th Century Fox the former handling the distribution in the United States and Canada and the latter handling the international release Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July The film was to be released on this date to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better In April Cameron said the film s special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film on that date would not be possible The studios considered pushing the film to late July or the first week of August but Harrison Ford whose film Air Force One was to be released on July is reported to have informed Paramount which had produced his lucrative Indiana Jones and Jack Ryan franchises that he would never work with them again if they released Titanic so close to his own film On May Paramount pushed back the release date to December This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster A preview screening in Minneapolis on July generated positive reviews and c hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the film This eventually led to more positive media coverage br Cameron refused to hold the film s world premiere in Los Angeles Paramount disagreed with Cameron s decision but Fox acquiesced and went ahead and held the premiere on November at the Tokyo International Film Festival where reaction was described as tepid by The New York Times Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December where the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the

report attributes this to the film s similarities and shared themes with most Bollywood films br br br Initial theatrical run br The film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday December By the end of that same weekend theaters were beginning to sell out The film earned on its opening day and over the opening weekend from theaters averaging to about per venue and ranking number one at the box office ahead of Mouse Hunt Scream and the eighteenth James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies It would go on to surpass The Godfather Part III s record for having the highest Christmas Day gross generating a total of million For its second weekend the film made million making it the biggest December weekend gross surpassing Scream By New Year s Day Titanic had made over million had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out In just days it became the fastest film to approach the million mark at the domestic box office surpassing the former record held by Jurassic Park which took days to do so Titanic would hold this record until when it was taken by Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace br Its highest grossing single day was Saturday February on which it earned more than eight weeks after its North American debut On March it surpassed Star Wars as the highest grossing film ever in North America It stayed at number one for consecutive weeks in North America a record for any film By April the film s number one spot would be overtaken by Lost in Space dropping into second place The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost months before finally closing on Thursday October with a final domestic gross of equivalent to million in Outside North America the film made double its North American gross generating and accumulating a grand total of worldwide from its initial theatrical run br br br Commercial analysis br Before Titanic s release various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time When it was shown to the press in autumn of it was with massive forebodings since the people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs because of this great albatross of a picture on which finally two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making Cameron also thought he was headed for disaster at one point during filming We labored the last six months on Titanic in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose million It was a certainty he stated As the film neared release particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance A film critic for the Los Angeles Times wrote that Cameron s overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project and that the film was a hackneyed completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances br br When the film became a success with an unprecedented box office performance it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers emotions The film was playing on screens ten weeks after it opened and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts jumped in total sales in its ninth week of release It earned over million for each of its first weekends and after weeks was still bringing in more than million on weekdays th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seen Titanic twice by its fifth week Although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused Leo Mania were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all time box office record other reports have attributed the film s success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground breaking special effects The Hollywood Reporter estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of million the film turned a net profit of billion with a modern profit of as much as billion after ancillary sources br Titanic s impact on men has also been especially credited It is considered one of the films that make men cry with MSNBC s Ian Hodder stating that men admire Jack s sense of adventure and his ambitious behavior to win over Rose which contributes to their emotional attachment to Jack The film s ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the film Zombieland where character Tallahassee Woody Harrelson when recalling the death of his young son states I haven t cried like that since Titanic br Scott Meslow of The Atlantic stated while Titanic initially seems to need no defense given its success it is considered a film for year old girls by its main detractors He argued that dismissing Titanic as fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film s accomplishment that this grandiose hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone including teenage boys Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of matching the ratings for teenage boy targeted films like Iron Man it is common for boys and men to deny liking Titanic He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it It s this collection of elements the history the romance the action that made and continues to make Titanic an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe he stated Titanic has flaws but for all its legacy it s better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe It s a great movie for year old girls but that doesn t mean it s not a great movie for everyone else too br Quotes in the film aided its popularity Titanic s catchphrase I m the king of the world became one of the film industry s more popular quotations According to Richard Harris a psychology professor at Kansas State University who studied why people like to cite films in social situations using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others People are doing it to feel good about themselves to make others laugh to make themselves laugh he said br Cameron explained the film s success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing When people have an experience that s very powerful in the movie theatre they want to go share it They want to grab their friend and bring them so that they can enjoy it he said They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life That s how Titanic worked Media Awareness Network stated The normal br repeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about The repeat rate for Titanic was over The box office receipts were even more impressive when factoring in the film s hour and minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie s four showings In response to this m any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost am br Titanic held the record for box office gross for years Cameron s follow up film Avatar was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross and did so in Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge Titanic were given For one Two thirds of Titanic s haul was earned overseas and Avatar tracked similarly Avatar opened in markets globally and was no in all of them and the markets such as Russia where Titanic saw modest receipts in and are white hot today with more screens and moviegoers than ever before Brandon Gray president of Box Office Mojo said that while Avatar may beat Titanic s revenue record the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance Ticket prices were about cheaper in the late s In December Cameron had stated I don t think it s realistic to try to topple Titanic off its perch Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years Titanic just struck some kind of chord In a January interview he gave a different take on the matter once Avatar s performance was easier to predict saying It s gonna happen It s just a matter of time br Author Alexandra Keller when analyzing Titanic s success stated that scholars could agree that the film s popularity appears dependent on contemporary culture on perceptions of history on patterns of consumerism and globalization as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the s awesome screen spectacle expansive action and more rarely seen engaging characters and epic drama br

regard to the film s overall design Roger Ebert stated It is flawlessly crafted intelligently constructed strongly acted and spellbinding Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all but almost impossible to make well He credited the technical difficulties with being so daunting that it s a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion and found himself convinced by both the story and the sad saga He named it his ninth best film of On the television program Siskel Ebert the film received two thumbs up and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship s sinking Ebert described the film as a glorious Hollywood epic and well worth the wait and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio captivating br James Berardinelli stated Meticulous in detail yet vast in scope and intent Titanic is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity You don t just watch Titanic you experience it It was named his second best film of Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short James Cameron s recreation of the sinking of the unsinkable liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood br The romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised Andrew L Urban of Urban Cinefile said You will walk out of Titanic not talking about budget or running time but of its enormous emotive power big as the engines of the ship itself determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart and as lasting as the love story that propels it Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described the film as a lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom Writer director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that Cameron s magnificent Titanic is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to Gone With the Wind Adrian Turner of Radio Times awarded it four stars out of five stating Cameron s script wouldn t have sustained Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh for minutes but somehow he and his magical cast revive that old style studio gloss for three riveting hours Titanic is a sumptuous assault on the emotions with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing paralysing fear of the moment And there are single shots such as an awesome albatross like swoop past the steaming ship when you sense Cameron hugging himself with the fun of it all br Titanic suffered backlash in addition to its success Some reviewers felt that while the visuals were spectacular the story and dialogue were weak Richard Corliss of Time magazine wrote a mostly negative review criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements Kenneth Turan s review in the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing Dismissing the emotive elements he stated What really brings on the tears is Cameron s insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities Not only is it not it is not even close He later argued that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total Barbara Shulgasser of The San Francisco Examiner gave Titanic one star out of four citing a friend as saying The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two lead characters refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say br br br Retrospective br According to Dalin Rowell of Film With complaints about its lengthy runtime observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture and jokes about its melodramatic nature Titanic is no stranger to modern day criticism In filmmaker Robert Altman called it the most dreadful piece of work I ve ever seen in my entire life Similarly French New Wave director and former Cahiers du Cin ma editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as garbage in a interview with Fr d ric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet s performance who he said was unwatchable the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long long time In the film topped a poll of Best Film Endings but it also topped a poll by Film as the worst movie of all time br In his study of the lives of the passengers on the Titanic historian Richard Davenport Hines said Cameron s film diabolized rich Americans and educated English anathematizing their emotional restraint good tailoring punctilious manners and grammatical training while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered The British film magazine Empire reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition to accommodate its readers tastes who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film and the reported activities of its fans such as those attending multiple screenings In addition to this positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film What really irks me he said are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it Willcock stated I obviously don t have anything against those who dislike Titanic but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so and they do exist trust me are way beyond my understanding and sympathy br In Cameron responded to the backlash and Kenneth Turan s review in particular by writing Titanic is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a hour and minute chunk out of their lives and dragging others with them so they can share the emotion Cameron emphasized that people from all ages ranging from to and from all backgrounds were celebrating their own essential humanity by seeing it He described the script as earnest and straightforward and said it intentionally incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes He did not see it as pandering Turan mistakes archetype for clich he said I don t share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration br In Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that the critical knives were out long before James Cameron s Titanic was complete Spiralling costs that led to it becoming the most expensive motion picture of the th Century and a cast without any big stars seemed to doom the film before release But box office and audience appreciation proved Cameron right and many critics wrong He added that the sinking of the great ship is no secret yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy and that when you consider that the film tops a bum numbing three hour running time then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron Empire eventually reinstated its original five star rating of the film commenting It should be no surprise then that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron s Titanic at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet s favourite film Ever br The film s climax has sparked many debates over the years on whether both Jack and Rose should have been able to fit on the floating door and survive becoming among the most talked about aspects of the film Cameron has stated he often gets asked about the scene and has spoken about and tested it numerous times one early test said they could not while another in advance of the film s th anniversary said it was possible but unlikely and depended on numerous variables br In on the th anniversary of its release the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally historically or aesthetically significant It was listed among the best films in an Empire poll and in a later poll of members of the film industry In Dalin Rowell of Film ranked it the third best film of Cameron s career stating that it is easily one of his best films simply because it defied the odds and considering it a legitimately remarkable achievement one that despite its large budget has a humble earnest center Even with all of the jokes the Internet loves to throw its way Titanic demonstrates

the D effects he noted the careful conversion to D lends volume and impact to certain moments but in separating the foreground and background of each scene the converters have carved the visual field
