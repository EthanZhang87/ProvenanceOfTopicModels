id: 351039
Viral marketing is a business strategy that uses existing social networks to promote a product mainly on various social media platforms Its name refers to how consumers spread information about a product with other people much in the same way that a virus spreads from one person to another It can be delivered by word of mouth or enhanced by the network effects of the Internet and mobile networks br The concept is often misused or misunderstood as people apply it to any successful enough story without taking into account the word viral br Viral advertising is personal and while coming from an identified sponsor it does not mean businesses pay for its distribution Most of the well known viral ads circulating online are ads paid by a sponsor company launched either on their own platform company web page or social media profile or on social media websites such as YouTube Consumers receive the page link from a social media network or copy the entire ad from a website and pass it along through e mail or posting it on a blog web page or social media profile Viral marketing may take the form of video clips interactive Flash games advergames ebooks brandable software images text messages email messages or web pages The most commonly utilized transmission vehicles for viral messages include pass along based incentive based trendy based and undercover based However the creative nature of viral marketing enables an endless amount of potential forms and vehicles the messages can utilize for transmission including mobile devices br The ultimate goal of marketers interested in creating successful viral marketing programs is to create viral messages that appeal to individuals with high social networking potential SNP and that have a high probability of being presented and spread by these individuals and their competitors in their communications with others in a short period br The term viral marketing has also been used pejoratively to refer to stealth marketing campaigns marketing strategies that advertise a product to people without them knowing they are being marketed to br br The emergence of viral marketing as an approach to advertisement has been tied to the popularization of the notion that ideas spread like viruses The field that developed around this notion memetics peaked in popularity in the s As this then began to influence marketing gurus it took on a life of its own in that new context br The brief career of Australian pop singer Marcus Montana is largely remembered as an early example of viral marketing In early thousands of posters declaring Marcus is Coming were placed around Sydney generating discussion and interest within the media and the community about the meaning of the mysterious advertisements The campaign successfully made Montana s musical debut a talking point but his subsequent music career was a failure br The term viral strategy was first used in marketing in in a pre digital marketing era by a strategy team at Chiat Day advertising in LA now TBWA LA led by Lorraine Ketch and Fred Sattler for the launch of the first PlayStation for Sony Computer Entertainment Born from a need to combat huge target cynicism the insight was that people reject things pushed at them but seek out things that elude them Chiat Day created a stealth campaign to go after influencers and opinion leaders using street teams for the first time in brand marketing and layered an intricate omni channel web of info and intrigue Insiders picked up on it and spread the word Within months PlayStation was number one in its category Sony s most successful launch in history br There is debate on the origin and the popularization of the specific term viral marketing The term is found in PC User magazine in with a somewhat differing meaning It was later used by Jeffrey Rayport in the Fast Company article The Virus of Marketing and Tim Draper and Steve Jurvetson of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson in to describe Hotmail s practice of appending advertising to outgoing mail from their users br Doug Rushkoff a media critic wrote about viral marketing on the Internet in The assumption is that if such an advertisement reaches a susceptible user that user becomes infected i e accepts the idea and shares the idea with others infecting them in the viral analogy s terms As long as each infected user shares the idea with more than one susceptible user on average i e the basic reproductive rate is greater than one the standard in epidemiology for qualifying something as an epidemic the number of infected users grows according to an exponential curve Of course the marketing campaign may be successful even if the message spreads more slowly if this user to user sharing is sustained by other forms of marketing communications such as public relations or advertising br Bob Gerstley wrote about algorithms designed to identify people with high social networking potential Gerstley employed SNP algorithms in quantitative marketing research In the concept of the alpha user was coined to indicate that it had now become possible to identify the focal members of any viral campaign the hubs who were most influential Alpha users could be targeted for advertising purposes most accurately in mobile phone networks due to their personal nature br In early the first ever Viral Summit was held in Las Vegas The summit attempted to identify similar trends in viral marketing methods for various media br br According to the book Contagious Why Things Catch On there are six key factors that drive virality They are organized in an acronym called STEPPS which stands for br br Social Currency the better something makes people look the more likely they will be to share it br Triggers things that are top of mind are more likely to be tip of tongue br Emotion when we care we share br Public the easier something is to see the more likely people are to imitate it br Practical Value people share useful information to help others br Stories Trojan Horse stories carry messages and ideas along for the ride br The goal of a viral marketing campaign is to widely disseminate marketing content through sharing liking br Another important factor that drives virality is the propagativity of the content referring to the ease with which consumers can redistribute it This includes the effort required to share the content the network size and type of the chosen distribution medium and the proximity of shareable content with its means of redistribution i e a Share button br br According to marketing professors Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein to make viral marketing work three basic criteria must be met i e giving the right message to the right messengers in the right environment br br Messenger Three specific types of messengers are required to ensure the transformation of an ordinary message into a viral one market mavens social hubs and salespeople Market mavens are individuals who are continuously on the pulse of things information specialists they are usually among the first to get exposed to the message and who transmit it to their immediate social network Social hubs are people with an exceptionally large number of social connections they often know hundreds of different people and have the ability to serve as connectors or bridges between different subcultures Salespeople might be needed who receive the message from the market maven amplify it by making it more relevant and persuasive and then transmit it to the social hub for further distribution Market mavens may not be particularly convincing in transmitting the information br Message Only messages that are both memorable and sufficiently interesting to be passed on to others have the potential to spur a viral marketing phenomenon Making a message more memorable and interesting or simply more infectious is often not a matter of major changes but minor adjustments It should be unique and engaging with a main idea that motivates the recipient to share it widely with friends a must see element br Environment The environment is crucial in the rise of successful viral marketing small changes in the environment lead to huge results and people are much more sensitive to environment The timing and context of the campaign launch must be right br Whereas Kaplan Haenlein and others reduce the role of marketers to crafting the initial viral message and seeding it futurist and sales and marketing analyst Marc Feldman who conducted IMT Strategies viral marketing study in carves a different role for marketers which pushes the art of viral marketing much closer to science br br To clarify and organize the information related to potential measures of viral campaigns the key measurement possibilities should be considered in relation to the objectives formulated for the viral campaign In this sense some of the key cognitive outcomes of viral marketing activities can include measures such as the number of views clicks and hits for specific content as well as the number of shares in social media such as likes on Facebook or retweets on Twitter which demonstrate that consumers processed the information received through the marketing message Measures such as the number of reviews for a product or the number of members for a campaign web page quantify the number of individuals who have acknowledged the information provided by marketers Besides statistics that are related to online traffic surveys can assess the degree of product or brand knowledge though this type of measurement is more complicated and requires more resources br Related to consumers attitudes toward a brand or even toward the marketing communication different online and social media statistics including the number of likes and shares within a social network can be used The number of reviews for a certain brand or product and the quality assessed by users are indicators of attitudes Classical measures of consumer attitude toward the brand can be gathered through surveys of consumers br Behavioral measures are very important because changes in consumers behavior and buying decisions are what marketers hope to see through viral campaigns There are numerous indicators that can be used in this context as a function of marketers objectives Some of them include the most known online and social media statistics such as number and quality of shares views product reviews and comments Consumers brand engagement can be measured through the K factor the number of followers friends registered users and time spent on the website Indicators that are more bottom line oriented focus on consumers actions after acknowledging the marketing content including the number of requests for information samples or test drives Nevertheless responses to actual call to action messages are important including the conversion rate br Consumers behavior is expected to lead to contributions to the bottom line of the company meaning increase in sales both in quantity and financial amount However when quantifying changes in sales managers need to consider other factors that could potentially affect sales besides the viral marketing activities Besides positive effects on sales the use of viral marketing is expected to bring significant reductions in marketing costs and expenses br br Viral marketing often involves and utilizes br br Customer participation and polling services br Industry specific organization contributions br Web search engines and blogs br Mobile smartphone integration br Multiple forms of print and direct marketing br Target marketing web services br Search engine optimization SEO br Social media optimization SMO br Television and radio br Influencer marketing br Viral target marketing is based on three important principles br br Social profile gathering br Proximity market analysis br Real time key word density analysis br By applying these three important disciplines to an advertising model a VMS company is able to match a client with their targeted customers at a cost effective advantage br The Internet makes it possible for a campaign to go viral very fast it can so to speak make a brand famous overnight However the Internet and social media technologies themselves do not make a brand viral they just enable people to share content to other people faster Therefore it is generally agreed that a campaign must typically follow a certain set of guidelines in order to potentially be successful br br It must be appealing to most of the audience br It must be worth sharing with friends and family br A large platform e g YouTube or Facebook must be used br An initial boost to gain attention is used e g seeding buying views or sharing to Facebook fans br The content is of good quality br Demographics It must be correlated with the Region Society br br The growth of social networks significantly contributed to the effectiveness of viral marketing As of two thirds of the world s Internet population visits a social networking service or blog site at least every week Facebook alone has over billion active users In time spent visiting social media sites began to exceed time spent emailing A study found that of people who view news online forward it on through social networks email or posts br br The introduction of social media has caused a change in how viral marketing is used and the speed at which information is spread and users interact This has prompted many companies to use social media as a way to market themselves and their products with Elsamari Botha and Mignon Reyneke stating that viral messages are playing an increasingly important role in influencing and shifting public opinion on corporate reputations brands and products as well as political parties and public personalities to name but a few br br In business it is indicated that people prefer interaction with humans to a logo Influencers build up a relationship between a brand and their customers Companies would be left behind if they neglected the trend of influencers in viral marketing as over of global brands have used influencers in marketing in br Influencers correlate to the level of customers involvement in companies marketing First unintentional influences because of brand satisfaction and low involvement their action is just to deliver a company s message to a potential user Secondly users will become salesmen or promoters for a particular company with incentives For example ICQ offered their users benefits to promote a product to their friends A recent trend in business is to offer incentives to individual users for re posting an advertisement s message to their own profiles br Marketers and agencies commonly consider celebrities as a good influencer with endorsement work This conception is similar to celebrity marketing Based on a survey of company marketing department and of agencies are currently working with celebrities in the UK The celebrity types come along with their working environment Traditional celebrities are considered singers dancers actors or models These types of public characters are continuing to be the most commonly used by company marketers The survey found that in company having worked with these traditional celebrities in the prior year However people these years are spending more time on social media rather than traditional media such as TV The researchers also claim that customers are not firmly believed celebrities are effectively influential br Social media stars such as YouTuber Zoella or Instagrammer Aimee Song are followed by millions of people online Online celebrities have connection and influence with their followers because they frequently and realisticly converse and interact on the Internet through comments or likes br This trend captured by marketers who are used to explore new potential customers Agencies are placing social media stars alongside singers and musicians at the top of the heap of celebrity types they had worked with And there are more than of company marketers having worked with one social media celebrity in the previous year br br Using influencers in viral marketing provides companies several benefits It enables companies to spend little time and budget on their marketing communication and brand awareness promotion For example Alberto Zanot in the FIFA Football World Cup shared Zinedine Zidane s headbutt against Italy and engaged more than million viewers in less than the very first hour Secondly it enhances the credibility of messages These trust based relationships grab the audience s attention create customers demand increase sales and loyalty or simply drive customers attitude and behavior In the case of Coke Millennials changed their mind about the product from parents drink to the beverage for teens It built up Millennials social needs by sharing a Coke with their friends This created a deep connection with Gen Y dramatically increased sales compared with last year and market share br br No doubt that harnessing influencers would be a lucrative business for both companies and influencers The concept of influencer is no longer just an expert but also anyone who delivers and influence on the credibility of a message e g blogger In BritMums network sharing family s daily life had bloggers and views per month on average and became endorsers for some particular brand such as Coca Cola Morrison Another case Aimee Song who had over m followers on the Instagram page and became Laura Mercier s social media influencers gaining monthly br br Decision making process seems to be hard for customers these days Millers argued that people suffered from short term memory This links to difficulties in customers decision making process and Paradox of Choice as they face various adverts and newspapers daily br Influencers serve as a credible source for customers decision making process Neilsen reported that of consumers appreciated a recommendation of their acquaintances as they have reasons to trust in their friends delivering the messages without benefits and helping them reduce perceived risks behind choices br br The main risk coming from the company is for it to target the wrong influencer or segment Once the content is online the sender won t be able to control it anymore It is therefore vital to aim at a particular segment when releasing the message This is what happened to the company BlendTech which released videos showing the blender could blend anything and encouraged users to share videos This mainly caught the attention of teenage boys who thought it funny to blend and destroy anything they could even though the videos went viral they did not target potential buyers of the product This is considered to be one of the major factors that affects the success of the online promotion It is critical and inevitable for the organisations to target the right audience Another risk with internet is that a company s video could end up going viral on the other side of the planet where their products are not even for sale br br According to a paper by Duncan Watts and colleagues entitled Everyone s an influencer the most common risk in viral marketing is that of the influencer not passing on the message which can lead to the failure of the viral marketing campaign A second risk is that the influencer modifies the content of the message A third risk is that influencers pass on the wrong message This can result from a misunderstanding or as a deliberate move br br Between and Hotmail was one of the first internet businesses to become extremely successful utilizing viral marketing techniques by inserting the tagline
