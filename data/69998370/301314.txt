Bride subdues O Ren by slicing off the top of her head She tortures Sofie for information about the other Deadly Vipers and leaves her alive as a threat Sofie goes to Bill to deliver The Bride s message Bill asks Sofie if the Bride knows that her daughter is alive br br Quentin Tarantino and Thurman conceived the Bride character during the production of Tarantino s film Pulp Fiction Kill Bill credits the story to Q U Tarantino spent a year and a half writing the script while he was living in New York City in and spending time with Thurman and her newborn daughter Maya Reuniting with the more mature Thurman now a mother influenced the way Tarantino wrote the Bride character He didn t realize that her child could still be alive until the end of the writing process br Tarantino developed many of the Bride s characteristics for the character of Shosanna Dreyfus for his film Inglourious Basterds which he worked on before Kill Bill Originally Dreyfus would be an assassin with a list of Nazis she would cross off as she killed Tarantino switched the character to the Bride and redeveloped Dreyfus Thurman cited Clint Eastwood s performance as Blondie in the film The Good the Bad and the Ugly as an inspiration In her words Eastwood says almost nothing but somehow manages to portray a whole character br Tarantino originally wrote Bill for Warren Beatty but as the character developed and the role required greater screen time and martial arts training he rewrote it for David Carradine Beatty said he turned the role down as he did not want to be away from his family while shooting in China Tarantino also considered Bruce Willis for the role Tarantino cast Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver after seeing her performance in the television film First Target The physical similarities between Thurman and Hannah inspired how he wrote the rivalry between the characters Michelle Yeoh met with Tarantino about a role in the film br An early draft included a chapter set after the confrontation with Vernita in which the Bride has a gunfight with Gogo Yubari s vengeful sister Yuki It was cut because it would have made the film overlong and added million to the budget Another draft featured a scene in which the Bride s car is blown up by Elle br br When Thurman became pregnant as shooting was ready to begin Tarantino delayed the production saying If Josef Von Sternberg is getting ready to make Morocco and Marlene Dietrich gets pregnant he waits for Dietrich Principal photography began in Although the scenes are presented out of chronological order the film was shot in sequence The choreographer Yuen Woo Ping whose previous credits include The Matrix was the martial arts advisor The anime sequence covering O Ren Ishii s backstory was directed by Kazuto Nakazawa and produced by Production I G which had produced films including Ghost in the Shell and Blood The Last Vampire The combined production lasted days and had a budget of million br According to Tarantino the most difficult part of making the film was trying to take myself to a different place as a filmmaker and throw my hat in the ring with other great action directors as opposed to the dialogue scenes he was known for The House of Blue Leaves sequence in which the Bride battles dozens of yakuza soldiers took eight weeks to film six weeks over schedule Tarantino wanted to create one of the greatest most exciting sequences in the history of cinema The crew eschewed computer generated imagery in favor of practical effects used in s Chinese cinema particularly by the director Chang Cheh including the use of fire extinguishers and condoms to create spurts and explosions of blood Tarantino told his crew Let s pretend we re little kids and we re making a Super movie in our back yard and you don t have all this shit How would you achieve this effect Ingenuity is important here br Near the end of filming Thurman was injured in a crash while filming the scene in which she drives to Bill According to Thurman she was uncomfortable driving the car and asked that a stunt driver do it Tarantino assured her that the car and road were safe She lost control of the car and hit a tree suffering a concussion and damage to her knees According to Thurman Miramax would only give her the crash footage if she signed a document releasing them of any consequences of Thurman s future pain and suffering Tarantino was apologetic but their relationship became bitter for years afterwards Thurman said that after the car crash she went from being a creative contributor and performer to being like a broken tool Miramax released the footage in after Thurman went to police following the accusations of sexual abuse by Weinstein br br Kill Bill was planned and filmed as a single film After editing began the producer Harvey Weinstein who was known for pressuring filmmakers to shorten their films suggested that Tarantino split the film in two This meant Tarantino did not have to cut scenes such as the anime sequence Tarantino told IGN I m talking about scenes that are some of the best scenes in the movie but in this hurdling pace where you re trying to tell only one story that would have been the stuff that would have had to go But to me that s kind of what the movie was are these little detours and these little grace notes The decision to split the film was announced in July Tarantino saved most of the Bride s character development for the second film saying he wanted to make her scary rather than sympathetic for Volume br br Kill Bill was inspired by grindhouse films that played in cheap US theaters in the s including martial arts films samurai cinema blaxploitation films and spaghetti westerns It pays homage to the Shaw Brothers Studio known for its martial arts films with the inclusion of the ShawScope logo in the opening titles and the crashing zoom a fast zoom usually ending in a close up commonly used in Shaw Brothers films The Bride s yellow tracksuit helmet and motorcycle resemble those used by Bruce Lee in the martial arts film Game of Death The animated sequence pays homage to violent anime films such as Golgo The Professional and Wicked City br The Guardian wrote that Kill Bill s plot shares similarities with the Japanese film Lady Snowblood in which a woman kills off the gang who murdered her family and observed that like how Lady Snowblood uses stills and illustration for parts of the narrative that were too expensive to film Kill Bill similarly uses Japanese style animation to break up the narrative The plot also resembles the French film The Bride Wore Black in which a bride seeks revenge on five gang members and strikes them off a list as she kills them br br Kill Bill Volume was released in theaters on

reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br br A O Scott of The New York Times wrote While being so relentlessly exposed to a filmmaker s idiosyncratic turn ons can be tedious and off putting the undeniable passion that drives Kill Bill is fascinating even strange to say it endearing Mr Tarantino is an irrepressible showoff recklessly flaunting his formal skills as a choreographer of high concept violence but he is also an unabashed cinephile and the sincerity of his enthusiasm gives this messy uneven spectacle an odd feverish integrity br Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times called Kill Bill Volume a blood soaked valentine to movies It s apparent that Tarantino is striving for more than an off the rack mash note or a pastiche of golden oldies It is rather his homage to movies shot in celluloid and wide wide wide wide screen an ode to the time right before movies were radically secularized She also recognized Tarantino s technical talent but thought the film s appeal was too limited to popular culture references calling its story the least interesting part of the whole equation Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave it out of describing Tarantino as effortlessly and brilliantly in command of his technique He wrote The movie is not about anything at all except the skill and humor of its making It s kind of brilliant br Cultural historian Maud Lavin states that the Bride s embodiment of revenge taps into viewers personal fantasies of committing violence For audiences particularly women viewers the character provides a complex site for identification with one s own aggression br br Uma Thurman received a Golden Globe Best Actress nomination in She was also nominated in for a BAFTA Award for
