out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br BJ Colangelo wrote in Slashfilm that With a pitch perfect ensemble cast exquisitely timed laugh out loud moments of humor a barrage of twists or should I say pirouettes an unbelievable amount of blood killer action set pieces and a downright transcendent performance by one of the best child actors in the game Abigail sets the bar as the most fun you can have with a horror movie of the year In other words Abigail is horror on pointe Traditionally films that are this delightfully raucous bloody and I mean BLOODY and silly are relegated to B movie schlock not a bad thing for the record but Abigail still embraces the excessive and ornate gothic aesthetics of classic horror movies The result is an old school vampire movie with modern frisk and flair and an absolute blast of a movie to watch with a crowd I m sure there will be plenty who think I m overhyping the film or exaggerating how good it is but I honestly wouldn t change a thing Abigail is a perfect horror movie and already one of the best films of I pinky promise br Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times that Abigail has been described as a take on Dracula s Daughter one of the horror films in Universal s vault some of which it has resurrected in some fashion The press notes for Abigail name check a few vampire titles but Daughter isn t among them and for good reason because there s little to link these two That s too bad the earlier film is a true curiosity It stars Gloria Holden as a countess who preys on men and women alike and begs a doctor to help her with her ghastly condition With its lesbian overtones the movie is a vexed and tasty text censors urged the studio to avoid suggestions of perverse sexual desire and the countess a complex villain in a film that is very much worth a look br David Fear of Rolling Stone wrote It s a gas watching this ensemble bouncing off each other when the shit goes down and navigating the obstacle course that Bettinelli Olpin and Gillett have set for them in the film s chaotic mondo bloody back half We weren t joking about that whole exploding body thing Stevens has previously shown a knack for playing complicated douchebags and that talent becomes refined here Weir who s a bit of a find in terms of playing a centuries old fiend in the body of a tween puts a sickly sharp spin on a lot of her juicier lines Cloud R I P and Durand finds different ways of showcasing the dim wittery of their characters Newton once again reminds you that she s a first rate pickpocket when it comes to stealing scenes and Barrera steps into the role as steely scream queen extraordinaire in a way that makes you hope she really does have a long career in front of her instead of an aborted one already behind her br br br Accolades br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Official website br
