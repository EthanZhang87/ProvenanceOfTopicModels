and she said Great you know well go and write that and I said What and she goes Everything we just talked about Levinson has also cited teenage anxiety as a whole as an influence for the series There

Warner Bros Studios lots in Burbank and Leavesden and a time jump to The filming is scheduled to begin in January br br br Visual style br Euphoria employs hyper stylized cinematography set design costume design and editing which presents an emotional realism that captures the inner perspectives of the series s adolescent characters The first season was shot digitally using the Arri Alexa camera The two special episodes and second season were shot on Kodak mm film stock primarily Ektachrome which cinematographer Marcell R v attributed to a desire to invoke some sort of memory of high school br br br Use of color and lighting br The series often utilizes saturated colors notably of purple and blue to communicate the emotional state of its characters Shades of green and yellow regularly symbolize distress while purple and blue convey an elated feverish atmosphere In shooting both day and night exteriors cinematographer Marcell R v relied on an exaggerated orange blue color scheme translated in the use of backlights and tungsten lights to create visuals that feel almost dreamlike LED lights and SkyPanels were used in several interior shoots to display bright and vivid colors of purple and blue The second season of Euphoria was shot on film specifically in Kodak s Ektachrome and Vision T which distorted how set lighting looked on camera br br br Camera movement br For camera movements we really wanted it to have a certain energy that ties the different storylines together So I would say the camera movement is the glue in the show that glues it together said R v on using an energized design element that stands out Extensive whip pans and tracking shots were employed to portray intimacy growth and interrelationship In the fourth episode of first season Shook Ones Pt II a minute tracking shot achieved through the use of a dolly a technocrane and four camera stitches was to introduce a space where all the characters were present and somehow connect them in one shot br br br Costume design br The costume design of Euphoria is arguably the series most notable and influential hallmark The characters of the series are regularly shown in chic flamboyant outfits that serve as plot devices and psychological profiles to represent their personalities and character arcs For example in the first season costume designer Heidi Bivens dressed Jules a transgender woman in a wardrobe consisting of bright pastels and tennis skirts inspired by the character s interest in anime and fantasy to embody the youthful optimism that comes with a fresh start and her journey to conquer femininity but as the character explores her gender identity and becomes more disillusioned between the first and second seasons she slips into a slightly muted darker and more androgynous wardrobe br br br Analysis br The visual aesthetics of Euphoria has been compared to the German expressionism movement of the early th century br br br Music br br Euphoria s score was composed by English singer songwriter and record producer Labrinth The song All for Us performed by Labrinth and Zendaya is hinted at throughout season before being performed as a large musical number at the end of the season finale Labrinth makes an appearance in the series alongside Zendaya to perform their song I m Tired br br The series also makes extensive use of popular music including

Labrinth I m Tired by Labrinth and Zendaya and Elliot s Song by Dominic Fike and Zendaya br In an interview with IndieWire Labrinth stated of the soundtrack s religious undertones We spoke about using organs because of a lot of the religious influences in the show especially with Rue We wanted a lot of the sounds edging towards a religious sound And because I love both Pentecostal and Catholic sounds I kind of was like trying to merge them both together br br br Episode titles br Many of the episode titles for season one are references to late s and early s song titles that correlate to the episode itself For instance Bonnie and Clyde is a reference to the Jay Z and Beyonc song of the same name The loyal relationship between Nate Jacobs and Maddy Perez in the episode mirrors that between
