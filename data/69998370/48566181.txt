Hippolyta tells Diana the story of how Ares became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction When the other gods attempted to stop him Ares killed all but Zeus who used the last of his power to wound him and force his retreat Before dying Zeus left the Amazons a weapon the god killer to prepare them for Ares return Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let her sister Antiope train Diana as a warrior br In Diana rescues US pilot Captain Steve Trevor when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast The island is soon invaded by German soldiers who had been pursuing him The Amazons wipe out the German landing force with Antiope sacrificing herself to save Diana br Steve is interrogated with the Lasso of Hestia and reveals that a great war is consuming the outside world and that he is an Allied spy He has stolen a notebook from the Germans chief chemist Dr Isabel Maru who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of mustard gas under the orders of General Erich Ludendorff Believing Ares to be responsible for the war Diana arms herself with the god killer sword the lasso and armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve br In London they deliver Maru s notebook to the Supreme War Council where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an armistice with Germany Diana translates Maru s notes revealing that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the Western Front br Although forbidden by his commander to act Steve with secret funding from Morgan recruits Moroccan spy Sameer Scottish marksman Charlie and Native American smuggler Chief Napi to help prevent the gas from being released The team reaches the front in Belgium Diana goes alone through No Man s Land and destroys the enemy trench liberating the nearby village of Veld with the aid of the Allied forces

separately infiltrate the party he intends to locate the gas and destroy it and she hopes to kill Ludendorff believing that he is Ares Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission but this allows

Diana fights and kills him but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war br Sir Patrick appears and reveals himself to be Ares He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the god killer sword he destroys it before

poison to a safe altitude and detonates it blowing up the plane and himself Ares attempts to direct Diana s rage and grief at Steve s death by convincing her to kill Maru but the memories of her

the war br In the present day Diana sends an email to Bruce Wayne thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve She continues to fight on the world s behalf as Wonder Woman br br br Cast br br Gal Gadot as Diana Prince Wonder Woman An immortal Amazon warrior demigoddess who is the crown princess of Themyscira and the daughter of Queen Hippolyta and Zeus being raised by the Amazons Describing Wonder Woman and her appeal Gadot said She s relatable She has the heart of a human and is very compassionate but her experiences or lack of them her naivete really make her interested in everything around her and able to view the world in a way that we d all like to with a genuine curiosity On Diana s relationship with her mother Gadot said Diana is a very opinionated girl Her mother is very opinionated Her mother is very protective as well and they have you know the very natural clash that a mother has with her daughter with their daughters the first time they want to leave home On taking on the role as Wonder Woman Gadot stated I feel very privileged that I got the opportunity to portray such an iconic strong female character I adore this character and everything that she stands for and everything that she symbolizes On Diana going to the world Gadot stated When Diana comes to the real world she s completely oblivious about gender and society rules that women are not equal to men Describing Diana s relationship with her mother and aunts Jenkins said She is the only child they raised together And their love for her manifests in a different way for each of them On working with Gadot Jenkins said Gal quickly became the person I wanted to talk to about everything We d shoot together all day And then on weekends we d be like What do you want to do That s maybe not totally normal Additionally Lilly Aspell and Emily Carey portray Diana at ages and respectively br Chris Pine as Steve Trevor An American pilot and the love interest of Diana On his role for the film Pine said I am an American pilot who s a spy It s like a boy s dream You re either a spy or a fighter pilot The first thing I wanted to be was a fighter pilot a long time ago I wanted to be Goose from Top Gun As to how his mortal character would interact with an Amazon Pine stated When I first read the script it had elements of Romancing the Stone kind of a very classic fish out of water Two people that don t really bond well at first and they re butting heads and just fun witty banter When speaking about meeting the director and being cast Pine said Patty is a pretty incredible human being When we first met about the part of Steve she sat across from me and essentially acted out the entire film over the course of a two hour lunch She was so specific so articulate and so ardent I would ve said yes just for Patty alone Pine went through a workout regimen for the film commenting I got in incredible shape for this film but also joking I was also wearing about pounds of clothing What I realized is that I made a major mistake I got in great shape and they just put clothes over all my hard work br Robin Wright as Antiope The sister of Hippolyta general of the Amazonian army Diana s aunt and mentor On being cast for the film Wright said It s two fold because when Patty Jenkins called me the director it was a three minute long conversation She said I m doing a movie about Wonder Woman Do you want to be her trainer And I was like Yes Of course And the general of the Amazonian army That was pretty cool Describing her character mentoring and training Diana to be a warrior Wright said It s a sixth sense that it is coming and I think that s also in the mythological story behind Antiope and Queen Hippolyta They know it s coming and it s her duty as the aunt to her young niece to make sure she is the fiercest warrior of all time On the Amazons fighting style Wright said It s hand combat Yes swords and knives and arrows but the precision that they have right as these warrior women it s so nice to see that disparity between what we had in the day of just raw fighting materials and the guns and how easy that is in comparison The message of the film Wright stated is not just female empowerment It s about love and justice That s what the film s about And what a great message to spread to our little ones Commenting about training for the film Wright said The most empowering was to get into that physical shape So we were doing horseback riding training weight training martial arts and to calories a day br Danny Huston as Erich Ludendorff An iron fisted general of the German Army during World War I Huston described Ludendorff as a pragmatist realist patriotic fighting for his country further explaining he lost his son on the German front lines and was just quite tortured diabolical stubborn and believes that what he s doing is for the betterment of mankind On his character Huston said Ludendorff is a believer that war is a natural habitat for humans Huston stated the film as an anti war film and somebody like Ludendorff would probably think that the idea that love conquers all is quite a naive concept But finally it s true and sometimes the best way to examine mankind is from another perspective On the genre of the film Huston said It s Greek mythology It s the origin of story and sometimes we need demigods to look at us to understand what our weaknesses are It serves the mythological world br David Thewlis as Sir Patrick A speaker for peace on the Imperial War Cabinet later revealed to be Ares based on the Greek mythological god of war who is in disguise and as part of his deceptive master plan of conquest and destruction Describing the Sir Patrick persona of his character Thewlis said Sir Patrick s entire drive through the other half of the story is to bring about the armistice That s his whole intention no matter what s going on He meets Diana and sees in her somebody who is sympathetic to his cause quite vehemently so br Connie Nielsen as Hippolyta The Amazon Queen of Themyscira and Diana s mother After meeting the director for the role Nielsen said Patty and I met in London and we just hit it off from the get go We couldn t stop talking What was supposed to be a one hour meeting turned into a two and a half hour lunch and we just really got each other She described Jenkins s directing style for the film as She s also the kind of director that I really flourish under She has very strong and particular and specific ideas about what it is she wants to say She comes from a place of strength always And so when you are dealing with someone like that you feel absolutely free to be vulnerable to be creative and I am a big researcher On playing the character Nielsen said It was a complete and utter pleasure and I absolutely loved every second of playing her On her character being Diana s mother and Amazonian queen Nielsen stated I m queen and I m preparing my child for a world that entails a lot of responsibility So it was important to me to bring that into the character She read The Amazons by Adrienne Mayor to familiarize herself with women warriors and said I used what I learned in Mayor s book as a rallying cry for how I approached Hippolyta And then of course what is a leader who is elected by her peers every year and has been doing this for a thousand years That too was interesting to think about Nielsen went through a workout regimen for the film saying I did six hours a day You know two hours of weight training two hours of swords training and then two hours of horseback riding Producer Zack Snyder was the one who fought for Nielsen to get cast after Charlize Theron turned down the role br Elena Anaya as Dr Isabel Maru The chief chemist associated with General Ludendorff who specializes in chemistry and poisons On her role Anaya said Well it was a small role in this big ensemble but it is an important character in the story I m going to be a big nightmare for Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor Describing her character Anaya said Dr Maru loves rage and enjoys people s pain She s creating terrible weapons and her purpose in life is to kill as many people as possible and provoke as much pain as possible She researched World War I and Fritz Haber the scientist who created mustard gas to prepare for the role On the character s facial scars Anaya stated I went to Patty Jenkins and asked What happened to her And she said She did it on purpose I was like What Patty you re going further than I ever imagined She said She wants to provoke painful suffering so she tested her own gas on her own face She wanted to know how deep this form of her gas would go so she put it on her own face You can see half of her face is completely gone This is the sadistic side of Dr Maru She also stated her character is quite the opposite to the lead role of this movie one of the strongest characters ever of DC comics Wonder Woman I can tell you that Doctor Poison is someone with a capacity to provoke so much pain On Dr Maru s relationship with General Ludendorff Anaya said I think that they have a relationship based on loyalty Ludendorff is a very tormented General that lacks self confidence That s why in part he takes these drugs that Dr Poison gives him They are from different worlds but they complement each other br Lucy Davis as Etta Candy Steve Trevor s secretary who befriends Diana Describing her character Davis said She s a woman in a man s world and so being heard and seen aren t the easiest things but it kind of doesn t deter her adding Etta is unapologetically herself and I think that that s the thing that has drawn me to her the most When asked if she was previously familiar with the character Davis responded No I wasn t It took me a while to know that I was auditioning for Etta because even when I found out it was Wonder Woman I still had no idea what the role was It took a little while then I Googled the character On Etta Candy s relationship with Steve Trevor Davis said One of the great things that Etta gets to work with Steve Trevor is because Steve is not your typical man in that he does entrust her with things that in probably wouldn t have been entrusted to a secretary of somebody who is quite important further explaining So I think that Trevor needs her just as much as she needs that because now she s been given responsibility that she wouldn t have normally be given before and equally he has somebody who could probably fly under the radar a bit So he can trust the person who no one s really looking at br Sa d Taghmaoui as Sameer A secret agent and ally of Steve Trevor On his casting Taghmaoui stated I was among hundreds of potential candidates and I slowly became the favorite adding It wasn t easy It took me three months I ll have to go through extensive physical training br Ewen Bremner as Charlie A sharpshooter and ally of Steve Trevor On his role Bremner said I play a character who s enlisted by Wonder Woman to help save the world as part of a small unlikely band Describing his character Bremner stated He s a shellshocked soldier who s been discharged from the war and is brought back to help on a secret mission On working with Jenkins Bremner commented Patty Jenkins is a force of nature She has fantastic vision strength and enthusiasm which is completely infectious and motivates a cast and crew of thousands to really go beyond themselves br Eugene Brave Rock as Chief A Blackfoot demi god and a smuggler who trades with both sides of the war and knows how to get people across the front lines On his casting Brave Rock said I had no idea it was for Wonder Woman I lost it when I showed up and I couldn t remember my lines I didn t take it literally until a month later I got a call saying I got the role and they wanted me to fly to London for a fitting Brave Rock raised several concerns with Jenkins over the representation of the character in the film particularly that he was not comfortable playing into stereotypes and that he was not keen on his character being simply known as Chief Jenkins responded by giving him some extra creative control over his character which Brave Rock says was unprecedented br Lisa Loven Kongsli as Menalippe Antiope s lieutenant and Diana s aunt Describing her character Kongsli said Menalippe is a fearless warrior with a strong justice needs She lives with the other Amazons on the island Themyscira and exercising continuous battle to assist man in the fight for the good On filming Kongsli stated It s a blast I ve worked damn hard to make this happen so it s absolutely absurd and fun all at once br Additionally Mayling Ng Florence Kasumba Madeleine Vall Beijner Hayley Jane Warnes Ann Wolfe and Eleanor Matsuura portray Orana Acantha Egeria Aella Artemis and Epione respectively all of whom are Amazons James Cosmo appears as Douglas Haig Steffan Rhodri appears as Darnell and Dutch supermodel Doutzen

as an unnamed soldier br br br Production br br br Background br Development for a live action Wonder Woman feature film began in with Ivan Reitman attached as producer and possible director In the project became attached to Jon Cohen who adapted Wonder Woman for producer Joel Silver with the hope that Sandra Bullock would star By Todd Alcott was hired to write the screenplay with Silver Pictures backing the project At that time Mariah Carey and Catherine Zeta Jones were also rumored to be possible candidates for the role of Wonder Woman Leonard Goldberg focused on Bullock who said that she was approached for the role Lucy Lawless the star of Xena Warrior Princess was also under consideration though she stated that she would have been more interested if Wonder Woman was portrayed as a flawed hero The screenplay went through various drafts written by Alcott Cohen Becky Johnston and Philip Levens and by August Levens had been replaced by screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis br In March Warner Bros and Silver Pictures announced that Joss Whedon would write and direct the film Early drafts of his screenplay included Steve Trevor as the narrator a fierce battle between Diana and her mother over Trevor s welfare and after leaving Themyscira his need to frequently rescue a Diana rendered helpless by the modern world Whedon was not able to complete a final version of his screenplay and left the project in br Although Whedon stated in May that he would not cast the part of Wonder Woman until he finished the script Kate Beckinsale was linked to the part In Whedon admitted that he did have an actress in mind for the part stating that Wonder Woman was basically Angelina Jolie br A day before Whedon s departure from Wonder Woman Warner Bros and Silver Pictures purchased a spec script for the film written by Matthew Jennison and Brent Strickland Set during World War II the script impressed executives at Silver Pictures However Silver stated that he had purchased the script because he did not want the rights reverting while stating the script had good ideas Silver did not want the film to be a period piece That same year Warner Bros began development of a Justice League film with Michele and Kieran Mulroney writing the screenplay The film entitled Justice League Mortal was to be directed by George Miller and would have featured Wonder Woman in her cinematic debut Australian model Megan Gale was ultimately cast in the role in January The film would later be cancelled following production delays and budgetary concerns By April Silver hired Jennison and Strickland to write a new script set in contemporary times that would not depict Wonder Woman s origin but explore Paradise Island s history br br br Development br br In Warner Bros stated that a Wonder Woman film was in development along with films based on DC Comics superheroes the Flash and Aquaman Both Wonder Woman and Aquaman were still under consideration for solo film subjects as of June DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson said Wonder Woman has been since I started one of the top three priorities for DC and for Warner Bros We are still trying right now but she s tricky On October WB chairman and CEO Kevin Tsujihara said he wanted to get Wonder Woman in a film or on TV Shortly afterward Paul Feig said he had pitched the studio an idea for Wonder Woman as an action comedy film The studio then began to search for female directors to direct the film While Michelle MacLaren was the studio s initial choice to direct and while she initially indicated interest she eventually left the project due to creative differences br In Patty Jenkins accepted an offer to direct Wonder Woman based on a screenplay by Allan Heinberg and a story co written by Heinberg and Zack Snyder and Jason Fuchs Screenwriter Allan Heinberg s work had to be finished and rewritten by Jenkins and Geoff Johns after he had left to work on a TV show Producer Charles Roven said that the duo had done a tremendous amount of collaboration Johns was initially given screenplay credit by the studio but was left out in the official credits by the WGA Of this version Gadot stated that br br for a long time people didn t know how to approach the story When Patty and I had our creative conversations about the character we realized that Diana can still be a normal woman one with very high values but still a woman She can be sensitive She is smart and independent and emotional She can be confused She can lose her confidence She can have confidence She is everything She has a human heart br This version was conceived of as a prequel to the first live action theatrical appearance of Wonder Woman in the film Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice placing Wonder Woman in the s and World War I a decision which differs from her comic book origins as a supporter of the Allies during World War II As for story development Jenkins credits the stories by the character s creator William Moulton Marston in the s and George Perez s seminal stories in the s in which he modernized the character In addition it follows some aspects of DC Comics origin changes in The New reboot where Diana is the daughter of Zeus Jenkins cited Richard Donner s Superman as an inspiration br br br Casting br br In late Zack Snyder cast Gal Gadot in the role of Wonder Woman for the film Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice over lodie Yung and Olga Kurylenko Some fans initially reacted to this choice by criticizing Gadot s appearance Snyder later commented on his decision to cast Gadot stating that he tested a bunch of actresses as you can imagine But the thing with Gal is that she s strong she s beautiful and she s a kind person which is interesting but fierce at the same time It s that combination of being fierce but kind at the same time that we were looking for Gadot described Diana as having the heart of a human so she can be emotional she s curious she s compassionate she loves people And then she has the powers of a goddess She s all for good she fights for good She also said that Diana has many strengths and powers but at the end of the day she s a woman with a lot of emotional intelligence As to how her character is different from her appearance in Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice Gadot said We go back years to when she s more naive further explaining She s this young idealist She s pure Very different to the experienced super confident grown up woman you ve seen Gadot underwent a diet and training regimen practiced different martial arts and gained pounds of muscle for the role Gadot was previously offered a different role as a villain in Man of Steel which she declined because she was pregnant at the time this allowed her to later be cast as Wonder Woman in the film s follow up Gadot signed a three picture deal She was paid a base salary of for the film itself br Chris Pine was cast as Steve Trevor a character he described as a rogue ish cynical realist who s seen the awful brutish nature of modern civilization and added that he is a worldly guy a charming guy He signed a multi picture deal Lucy Davis performance as Etta Candy is the first

late April filming took place at the Louvre Museum in Paris France where a Wayne Enterprises truck was spotted alongside Gadot Principal photography finished on May Patty Jenkins and director of photography Matt Jensen said that the film s look was inspired by painter John Singer Sargent Jenkins said she shot the movie on film instead of digital video because there s a certain type of epic grander escapism that film gives you that you cannot you will struggle very hard to get that on video Reshoots took place in November while Gadot was five months pregnant A green cloth was placed over her stomach to edit out her pregnancy during post production br To find the perfect location to shoot the Amazon island of Themyscira the birthplace of Wonder Woman herself the film s producers searched all over the world finally settling on the Cilentan Coast a stretch of coastline on the Tyrrhenian Sea located in the Province of Salerno in Southern Italy It was chosen because most beaches in the world that sit below big cliffs disappear beneath the tide for part of every day Production designer Aline Bonetto and her location manager Charles Somers considered countries and visited several of them before they found what they were looking for Bonetto explained that Italy had beautiful weather a beautiful blue green sea not too much tide not too much wave Our effects team added

According to Time Warner chief marketing officer Kristen O Hara they wanted to approach the Wonder Woman marketing campaign in a light manner similar to how they did with Supergirl O Hara elaborated that the modest campaign route they took for Supergirl aided in establishing a large central fanbase among women well in advance of the series which reportedly generated million female superhero fans

solitude and taking more notes from Richard Donner than from Christopher Nolan Patty Jenkins Wonder Woman provides a welcome respite from DC s house style of grim darkness boisterous earnest sometimes sloppy yet consistently entertaining with star Gal Gadot proving an inspired choice for this avatar of truth justice and the Amazonian way br Vox stated Trevor is the superhero girlfriend comic book movies need The San Francisco Chronicle s Mick LaSalle lauded the performances of Gadot Pine Huston and Thewlis while commending the film s different perspective and humor Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun Times described Gadot s performance as inspirational heroic heartfelt and endearing and the most real Wonder Woman portrayal br A O Scott of The New York Times wrote that it briskly shakes off blockbuster branding imperatives and allows itself to be something relatively rare in the modern superhero cosmos It feels less like yet another installment in an endless sequence of apocalyptic merchandising opportunities than like what s the word I m looking for A movie A pretty good one too Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune compared the film to Captain America The First Avenger noting that as with the first Captain America movie over in the Marvel Comics universe DC s Wonder Woman offers the pleasures of period re creation for a popular audience Jenkins and her design team make era London war torn Belgium the Ottoman Empire and other locales look freshly realized with a strong point of view There are scenes here of dispossessed war refugees witnessed by an astonished and heartbroken Diana that carry unusual gravity for a comic book adaptation Katie Erbland of IndieWire commended its thematic depth explaining that Wonder Woman is a war movie Patty Jenkins first and we hope not last entry into the DC Expanded Universe is primarily set during World War I but while the feature doesn t balk at war time violence it s the internal battles of its compelling heroine that are most vital Alonso Duralde of TheWrap similarly felt that Diana s scenes of action are thrilling precisely because they re meant to stop war not to foment it the idea of a demi god using love to fight war might sound goofy in the abstract but Jenkins makes the concept work Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post praised Gadot s and Pine s performances as well the film s detailed plot and narrative while comparing some of the slow motion action sequences to The Matrix Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine hailed the film as a cut above nearly all the superhero movies that have been trotted out over the past few summers while praising Gadot s performance as charming and marvelous and commending Jenkins s direction of the film as a step forward for women directors in directing big budget blockbuster films in Hollywood br Elise Jost of Moviepilot observed that Gadot s take on Wonder Woman is one of those unique cases of an actor merging with their story similar to Robert Downey Jr s Tony Stark Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman and Wonder Woman is Gal Gadot Jost praised Gadot s interpretation of Wonder Woman as the one in which Gadot absolutely nails the character s unwaveringly positive outlook on life She s a force of nature who believes in the greater good her conviction that she s meant to save the world is stronger than her bullet deflecting shield She s genuine she s fun she s the warm source of energy at the heart of the movie On HuffPost cultural critic G Roger Denson who regards the superhero genre as a source of contemporary Mainstream Mythopoetics the making of new yet vitally meaningful if not symbolic stories filled with imagery reflecting yet also shaping and advancing the political legal moral and social practices of today wrote that the No Man s Land scene that people are crying over in theaters and raving about afterward happens to be among the most powerfully mythopoetic scenes ever filmed at the same time it is one of the oldest myths to have been utilized by artists and writers after it had been invented by early military strategists and leaders Specifically used by director Patty Jenkins the scene raises the esteem for powerful yet compassionate women as heroes and leaders to a level equal with that of men for having won over a huge and adoring popular audience around the world br Steve Rose in The Guardian criticized the film for failing to explore the material s potential for patriarchy upending subversion Peter Travers of Rolling Stone criticized the film s over reliance on exposition Wonder Woman is hobbled by a slogging origin story and action that only comes in fits and starts Just when Gadot and director Patty Jenkins are ready to kick ass we get backstory br Gas was intended to win the war On that much Wonder Woman is absolutely right said David Hambling in Popular Mechanics Rachel Becker of The Verge stated that despite the scientific liberties of using a hydrogen based chemical weapon as a plot device the film succeeds in evoking real and horrifying history First off mustard gas is such a horrible terrifying weapon it doesn t need to be made more potent But if you were a chemist bent on raining destruction on the Allied forces you wouldn t do it by replacing the sulfur atom in mustard gas with a hydrogen atom You d know that sulfur is the linchpin holding together this poisonous molecule br One notable criticism was directed towards aspects of the final act with the reveal of Ares and the climactic fight Patty Jenkins later admitted when promoting Wonder Woman that it was studio mandated with her commenting that was the only thing that the studio forced my hand on was that it was not supposed to be it was supposed to be like that he never turns into Ares the whole point of the movie is that you get there to the big monster and he s just standing there looking at you saying I didn t do anything And then the studio kept saying we ll let you do that and then we ll see And then I could feel it creeping up and then at the last minute they were like you know what We want Ares to show up And I was like we don t have time to do that now Nope you gotta do it br br br Accolades br br br Cultural impact br br Wonder Woman according to the BBC had some thinking it s too feminist and others thinking it s not feminist enough Kyle Killian found an inherent contradiction in the construction of Wonder Woman as a warrior who she states is highly sexualized Killian suggests these elements should not be the focus of a kickass heroine her beauty bone structure and sexiness if she is to be a feminist icon Theresa Harold concurred comparing Wonder Woman to Katniss Everdeen The Hunger Games who didn t have to wear a teenager s wet dream of a costume to fight in Christina Cauterucci felt Wonder Woman s ability to be considered a feminist antidote was undermined by her sex appeal Other critics refer to the construction of Wonder Woman in the film as an implausible post feminist hero br Jenkins disagrees with this she was raised by a second wave feminist mother who taught her to be both super aware that there had been sexism but also Congratulations thank you now I get to do whatever I want Mom Jenkins notes it is this upbringing which led her to question a feminist critique of Wonder Woman s costume When she was working on her own version of Wonder Woman s Gladiator re design of the outfit Jenkins decided Wonder Woman shouldn t be dressed in armor like men It should be different I as a woman want Wonder Woman to be hot as hell fight badass and look great at the same time the same way men want Superman to have huge pecs and an impractically big body Jenkins notes she is frustrated by the critique of Wonder Woman s appearance stating when people get super critical about her outfit who s the one getting crazy about what a woman wears That s who she is that s Wonder Woman Gal Gadot agreed arguing the character is a feminist as feminism is about equality and choice and freedom And the writers Patty and myself all figured that the best way to show that is to show Diana as having no awareness of social roles She has no gender boundaries To her everyone is equal br Critic Valerie Frankel supported Jenkins s vision Frankel argues the film subverts the male gaze stating the construction of Wonder Woman shifts every few decades as it reflects the state of feminism including third wave feminism Zoe Williams offers a similar argument stating that while Wonder Woman is sort of naked a lot of the time that is not objectification so much as a cultural reset having thighs actual thighs you can kick things with not thighs that look like arms is a feminist act Williams then juxtaposes Wonder Woman with past female action heroes Sarah Connor Ellen Ripley and Lara Croft whom she suggests were all constructed for the male gaze in which a female warrior becomes a sex object br Gloria Steinem liked the film stating she felt it made the Amazon origin story clear Wonder Woman was stopping war not perpetuating it Steinem said she knew some women were disappointed by all the makeup but I may be desperate I was just happy that the Amazons had wild hair Her only complaint lay in the choice to eliminate the World War II setting as the Wonder Woman comic book developed in response to existing comics that were so sadistic and racist that there was a congressional hearing on the subject Steinem gave Hillary Clinton the first Wonder Woman Award in during the Women s Media Center s Speaking Truth to Power Awards Clinton noted she had seen the film and loved the outfit She said that as her granddaughter was really keen on Wonder Woman Clinton thought maybe I could borrow something from her for the night It didn t quite work for me but I will say that this award means a lot to me because as a little girl and then as a young woman and then as a slightly older woman I always wondered when Wonder Woman would have her time and now that has happened Clinton in a public message stated it was just as inspirational as I d suspected a movie about a strong powerful woman in a fight to save the world from international disaster would be br Director James Cameron critiqued the representation of female power in the film In a interview Cameron qualifies Jenkins s vision of Wonder Woman as an objectified icon and called the film a step backwards In contrast he states his character Sarah Connor was not a beauty icon She was strong troubled a terrible mother and earned the respect of the audience through pure grit Jenkins responded that Cameron s inability to understand what Wonder Woman is or stands for to women all over the world is unsurprising as though he is a great filmmaker he is not a woman She argued there is no right and wrong kind of powerful woman because if women have to always be hard tough and troubled to be strong and we aren t free to be multidimensional or celebrate an icon of women everywhere because she is attractive and loving then we haven t come very far have we Reaction to this debate was mixed Julie Miller sided with Cameron whom she states refers to himself as a pretty hardcore feminist and who told Vulture that I have no problem writing a script in which the males become subservient to the females which is what happens in Aliens It s up to Ripley to win the day In contrast Miller argues that Jenkins envisioned Wonder Woman as a woman who exuded both femininity and strength along with genuine confusion as to why men would treat women differently than they do other men Susannah Breslin agreed with Cameron describing Jenkins s Wonder Woman as a Playmate with a lasso and female power with no balls Others were more critical of Cameron s critique A Newsweek article suggests that in contrast to his criticism of Jenkins Cameron s own films include lot of objectification and quotes Hollywood celebrities who echoed this view One came from Jesse McLaren who states Cameron s just confused there s a female hero whose motivations aren t centered around motherhood Noah Berlatsky found areas of agreement between Cameron and Jenkins stating that while Cameron s objection is an old point that s been made over and over for decades Jenkins s film is not solely focused on objectifying Gal Gadot for a male audience br Cameron reiterated his criticism in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter He compared Gadot s representation of the character to Raquel Welch films of the s and reinforced a comparison with Linda Hamilton s portrayal of Sarah Connor He argued Connor was if not ahead of its time at least a breakthrough in its time because though she looked great she wasn t treated as a sex object He stated that he while he applaud s Patty directing the film and Hollywood uh letting a woman direct a major action franchise I didn t think there was anything groundbreaking I thought it was a good film Period Former Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter responded by asking Cameron to Stop dissing WW Like Jenkins she suggests that while Cameron does not understand the character she does She refers to Cameron s critiques as thuggish jabs at a brilliant director that are as ill advised as the movie was spot on Carter states she has the authority to make these observations because she has embodied this character for more than years Jenkins responded to Cameron s comments in an interview with Variety stating she was not upset at all as everybody is entitled to their own opinion But if you re going to debate something in a public way I have to reply that I think it s incorrect Tricia Ennis was critical of Cameron s statements arguing that while he may consider himself a feminist and an ally to women he is not very good at it as being an ally means using his position of privilege without silencing the voices of those you re trying to help She states that it is not enough to simply call yourself a feminist It s not even enough to create a strong female character You have to bring women to the table You have to let them speak You cannot speak for them But speaking for women is exactly what Cameron is doing through his comments Cameron is using his position of power as a respected producer and director to silence women br br br Future br br br Sequel br br Originally signed for three feature films with Wonder Woman and Justice League being her
