ride out on br br In Brigham Young University film students Jon Heder and Jared Hess collaborated on a class project the result was a minute short movie shot on black and white mm film entitled Peluca about a nerdy high school student named Seth br Peluca was shown at the Slamdance Film Festival and was well received Jeremy Coon convinced Hess to drop out of school and adapt it into a feature length film and he helped him to find investors for the project Hess sent the short film and the script to a variety of different casting directors many of whom thought that the idea was too weird or they just didn t like the character Hess explained One casting director suggested Jake Gyllenhaal over unknown actor Jon Heder for the lead role but Hess believed Heder was the only actor to play the part Jason Lee was offered the role of Uncle Rico while Brad Garrett auditioned for Rex and enjoyed the script but decided not to commit Actor Vincent Gallo was also considered and almost cast as Uncle Rico Heder was paid for starring in the film but successfully negotiated to receive more after the film became a runaway success br br Hess shot the film on location in Preston in southeastern Idaho located near the Utah border in July Operating on a tight budget of Hess cast many of his friends from school including Heder and Aaron Ruell and he relied on the generosity of Preston locals who provided housing and food to crew members Among the established actors in the cast was comedy veteran Diedrich Bader who filmed his scenes as virile martial art instructor Rex in one day He recalled in that Napoleon Dynamite still to this day is one of the two top scripts I ve ever read alongside Office Space one of his most recognized roles It was very very hot Hess recalled in a Rolling Stone interview But it was so much fun being in this rural farm town making a movie We shot it in days so we were moving very very fast I just didn t have a lot of film to be able to do a lot of takes It was a bunch of friends getting together to make a movie It was like Are people going to get this Is it working br br Hess describes the film as being so autobiographical I grew up in a family of six boys in Preston Idaho and the character of Napoleon was a hybrid of all the most nerdy and awkward parts of me and my brothers growing up Jerusha really was like Deb growing up Her mom made her a dress when she was going to a middle school dance and she said I hadn t really developed yet so my mom overcompensated and made some very large fluffy shoulders Some guy dancing with her patted the sleeves and actually said I like your sleeves they re real big Hess said in an interview with Rolling Stone br The film is set during the school year as shown on Napoleon s student ID card in the title sequence The film contains several culturally retroactive elements harkening back between the s to s For example Deb wears a side ponytail and Napoleon wears Moon Boots both popular fashion trends of the s One scene is set at a school dance that plays only s music such as Alphaville s Forever Young whereas an earlier scene features students performing a sign language rendition of The Rose originally made popular by Bette Midler it was actually sung in the film by L A based studio session vocalist Darci Monet who was never credited or paid any residuals for her work Much of the technology in the film is also archaic Napoleon uses a top loader VCR and Walkman cassette player Kip connects to the Internet via a pay per minute dial up connection and Uncle Rico drives a Dodge Tradesman The song Napoleon Dynamite dances to at the end of the film Canned Heat by Jamiroquai came out in br br The film was originally made without opening titles Audiences at test screenings were confused about when the film was set Eight months after the film was completed the title sequence was filmed in cinematographer Munn Powell s basement Ruell who played Kip suggested the idea of the title sequence The sequence shows a pair of hands placing and removing several objects on a table Objects like plates of food had the credits written in condiments while other objects like a Lemonheads box or a tube of ChapStick had the credits printed on them Hess explains br br So this question came up a few times and the Fox Searchlight marketing people were like maybe we could do something to say that this is happening now because I kept explaining to them that I grew up in a small town in Idaho and that things are more you know functional and fashion doesn t matter as much It s kind of weird but because they wanted to show that the film takes place now there s a title where a hand pulls Napoleon s school ID out of a wallet and it says br On the studio s reaction to the sequence Hess adds br br We actually had Jon Heder placing all the objects in and out of frame and then showed it to Searchlight who really liked it and thought it was great but some lady over there was like There are some hangnails or something the hands look kinda gross It s really bothering me can we re shoot some of those We ll send you guys a hand model We were like WHAT This of course was my first interaction with a studio at all so they flew out a hand model a couple weeks later who had great hands but was five or six shades darker than Jon Heder So we reshot but they re now intermixed so if you look there are like three different dudes hands our producers are in there too It all worked out great though and was a lot of fun br br The Hesses wrote the climactic dance scene because they knew Heder liked to dance Jared s wife was like Jon I hear you re pretty good dancer I ve seen you boogie it s pretty sweet recalled Heder And I was like Well I like to dabble I liked to mess around sometimes in front of friends and dance But I did take pride in it I won t be modest I wasn t great but I did like to mess around Cut to two years later after we had shot the short they were like Okay we re going to have you dancing in the movie as the climax This is going to make or break the film br When it came to shooting the dance scene for the final film the producers scheduled to film it towards the end of the film When they finally got to the scene they were running out of money and film They only had one roll of film approximately minutes left to shoot br It was a lot of pressure Heder observed I was like Oh crap This isn t just a silly little scene This is the moment where everything comes and he s making the sacrifice for his friend That s the whole theme of the movie Everything leads up to this Napoleon s been this loser This has to be the moment where he lands a victory He gets up there and it s quiet no reaction from the audience br The dance was spontaneously improvised by Heder with some choreography help from Tina Majorino and additional moves taken from Saturday Night Fever Michael Jackson and Soul Train They were like No Jon just figure it out So I just winged it I danced three times and they took the best pieces from each of those br When you re shooting in independent film you don t know what you re going to get the rights to Heder explained We thought Jamiroquai might be expensive So we danced to three different songs To that song and another Jamiroquai song Little L We danced to Michael Jackson something off of Off the Wall Just those three And then we got the rights to Jamiroquai And I think that was half our budget br br Upon the film s release it was noted that the name Napoleon Dynamite had originally been used by musician Elvis Costello most visibly on his album Blood Chocolate although he had used the pseudonym on a single B side as early as Filmmaker Jared Hess states that he was not aware of Costello s use of the name until two days before the end of shooting when he was informed by a teenage extra He later said Had I known that name was used by anybody else prior to shooting the whole film it definitely would have been changed I listen to hip hop dude It s a pretty embarrassing coincidence Hess claims that Napoleon Dynamite was the name of a man he met around on the streets of Cicero Illinois while doing missionary work for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints br Costello believes that Hess got the name from him whether directly or indirectly Costello said The guy just denies completely that I made the name up but I invented it Maybe somebody told him the name and he truly feels that he came to it by chance But it s two words that you re never going to hear together br br Napoleon Dynamite premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January where it was picked up by Fox Searchlight Pictures Shortly after Fox collaborated with Paramount Pictures and MTV Films to

instead of rehashing the original film s plot br br I feel like the future for Napoleon would be a lot more raw and edgy So whatever he comes up with would be fun to explore because I think whatever
