and his envoy into a bottomless pit Leonidas then visits the Ephors proposing a strategy to drive back the Persians through Thermopylae to funnel the Persians into a narrow pass giving the Greeks heavy infantry the advantage over the numerically superior Persian light infantry The Ephors warn Leonidas that the Carneia is approaching and that Sparta should not wage war during that time They consult the Oracle who decrees that Sparta should honor the Carneia As Leonidas angrily departs an agent from Xerxes appears alongside a Spartan politician Theron rewarding the Ephors for their covert

suggests they will not go but depart for war shortly after that They are joined by a few thousand Arcadians and other Greeks led by Daxos They reach Thermopylae watching a storm sinking many Persian navy ships at the Aegean Sea The Spartans then scouted out a large Persian encampment and constructed the wall using slain Persian scouts as mortar br Meanwhile Leonidas encounters Ephialtes a deformed Spartan whose parents fled Sparta to spare him certain infanticide Ephialtes asks to join Leonidas army and warns him of a secret goat path the Persians could use to outflank and surround the Spartans Though sympathetic Leonidas rejects him since his deformity could compromise the phalanx formation br The battle begins soon after the Spartans refusal to lay down their weapons Because of the narrowed pathway the Spartans repel many waves of the advancing Persian army Xerxes personally approaches Leonidas and offers him immense wealth and power in exchange for his submission Leonidas declines and mocks the inferior quality of Xerxes warriors Xerxes sends in his elite guard the Immortals accompanied by the monstrous Uber Immortal but the Greeks are once again victorious br On the second day Xerxes sends in new waves of armies including war elephants and an armored rhinoceros with no success Meanwhile an embittered Ephialtes has defected to Xerxes and reveals the secret path in

battle against the Persians at Plataea br br br Cast br br br Production br br br Development br br Producer Gianni Nunnari was not the only person planning a film about the Battle of Thermopylae as director Michael Mann had already planned a film of the battle based on the book Gates of Fire Nunnari discovered Frank Miller s graphic novel which impressed him enough to acquire the film rights was jointly produced by Nunnari and Mark Canton while Michael B Gordon wrote the script Director Zack Snyder was hired in June as he had attempted to make a film based on Miller s novel before making his debut with the remake of Dawn of the Dead Snyder then had screenwriter Kurt Johnstad rewrite Gordon s script for production and Frank Miller was retained as consultant and executive producer Frank Miller s original graphic novel was inspired by the film The Spartans which Miller first saw at age six br The film is a shot for shot adaptation of the comic book similar to the film adaptation of Sin City Snyder photocopied panels from the comic book from which he planned the preceding and succeeding shots It was a fun process for me to have a frame as a goal to get to he said Like the comic book the adaptation also used the character Dilios as a narrator Snyder used this narrative technique to show the audience that the surreal Frank Miller world of was told from a subjective perspective By using Dilios gift of storytelling he was able to introduce fantasy elements into the film explaining that Dilios is a guy who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth Snyder also added the subplot in which Queen Gorgo attempts to rally support for her husband br br Two months of pre production were required to create hundreds of shields spears and swords some of which were recycled from Troy and Alexander Creatures were designed by Jordu Schell and an animatronic wolf and thirteen animatronic horses were created The actors trained alongside the stuntmen and even Snyder joined in Upwards of costumes were created for the film as well as extensive prosthetics for various characters and the corpses of Persian soldiers Shaun Smith and Mark Rappaport worked hand in hand with Snyder in pre production to design the look of the individual characters and to produce the prosthetic makeup effects props weapons and dummy bodies required for the production br br br Filming br entered active production on October in Montreal and was shot over the course of sixty days in chronological order with a budget of million Employing the digital backlot technique Snyder shot at the now defunct Icestorm Studios in Montreal using bluescreens Butler said that while he did not feel constrained by Snyder s direction fidelity to the comic imposed certain limitations on his performance Wenham said there were times when Snyder wanted to precisely capture iconic moments from the comic book and other times when he gave actors freedom to explore within the world and the confines that had been set Headey said of her experience with the bluescreens It s very odd and emotionally there s nothing to connect to apart from another actor Only one scene in which horses travel across the countryside was shot outdoors The film was an intensely physical production and Butler pulled an arm tendon and developed foot drop br br br Post production br Post production was handled by Montreal s Meteor Studios and Hybride Technologies filled in the bluescreen footage with more than visual effects shots Visual effects supervisor Chris Watts and production designer Jim Bissell created a process dubbed The Crush which allowed the Meteor artists to manipulate the colors by increasing the contrast of light and dark Certain sequences were desaturated and tinted to establish different moods Ghislain St Pierre who led the team of artists described the effect Everything looks realistic but it has a kind of a gritty illustrative feel Various computer programs including Maya RenderMan and RealFlow were used to create the spraying blood The post production lasted for a year and was handled by a total of ten special effects companies br br br Music br br In July composer Tyler Bates began work on the film describing the score as having beautiful themes on the top and large choir but tempered with some extreme heaviness The composer had scored for a test scene that the director wanted to show to Warner Bros to illustrate the path of the project Bates said that the score had a lot of weight and intensity in the low end of the percussion that Snyder found agreeable to the film The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and features the vocals of Azam Ali A standard edition and a special edition of the soundtrack containing tracks was released on March with the special edition containing a page booklet and three two sided trading cards br br The score has caused some controversy in the film composer community garnering criticism for its striking similarity to several other recent soundtracks including James Horner and Gabriel Yared s work for the film Troy The heaviest borrowings are said to be from Elliot Goldenthal s score for Titus Remember Us from is identical in parts to the Finale from Titus and Returns a King is similar to the cue Victorius Titus On August Warner Bros Pictures acknowledged in an official statement a number of the music cues for

unfavorable reviews came from major American newspapers A O Scott of The New York Times described as about as violent as Apocalypto and twice as stupid and he also criticized its color scheme and suggested that its plot includes racist undertones Scott also poked fun at the buffed bodies of the actors who portrayed the Spartans declaring that the Persian characters are pioneers in the art of face piercing and declaring that the actors who played the Spartans had access to superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities Kenneth Turan wrote in the Los Angeles Times that unless you love violence as much as a Spartan Quentin Tarantino or a video game playing teenage boy you will not be endlessly fascinated Roger Ebert gave the film a out of rating writing that has one dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud Some critics employed at Greek newspapers have been particularly critical such as film critic Robby Eksiel who said that moviegoers would be dazzled by the digital action but also feel irritated by the pompous interpretations and one dimensional characters br Variety s Todd McCarthy described the film as visually arresting although bombastic while Kirk Honeycutt writing in The Hollywood Reporter praised the beauty of its topography colors and forms Writing in the Chicago Sun Times Richard Roeper acclaimed as the Citizen Kane of cinematic graphic novels Empire gave the film three out of five writing Visually stunning thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as a pygmy s paddling pool this is a whole heap of style tinged with just a smidgen of substance Comic Book Resources Mark Cronan found the film compelling leaving him with a feeling of power from having been witness to something grand IGN s Todd Gilchrist acclaimed Zack Snyder as a cinematic visionary and a possible redeemer of modern moviemaking br br br Accolades br At the MTV Movie Awards was nominated for Best Movie Best Performance for Gerard Butler Best Breakthrough Performance for Lena Headey Best Villain for Rodrigo Santoro and Best Fight for Leonidas battling the ber Immortal but only won the award for Best Fight won both the Best Dramatic Film and Best Action Film honors in the Golden Icon Awards presented by Travolta Family Entertainment In December won IGN s Movie of the Year along with Best Comic Book Adaptation and King Leonidas as Favorite Character The movie received nominations for the Saturn Awards winning the awards for Best Director and Best Action Adventure Thriller Film In National Review magazine ranked number on its Best Conservative Movies of the Last Years list br br br Historical accuracy br In the actual Battle of Thermopylae the Spartans had already joined an alliance with other Greek poleis against the Persians During the Battle of Thermopylae Xerxes s invasion of Greece coincided with a Spartan religious festival the Carneia in which the Spartans were not permitted to make war Still realizing the threat of the Persians and not wanting to appear as Persian sympathizers the Spartan government rather than Leonidas alone decided to send Leonidas with his personal strong bodyguard to Thermopylae Other Greek poleis joined the Spartan men and totaled somewhere between and total Greek troops The historical consensus among both ancient chroniclers and current scholars was that Thermopylae was a clear Greek defeat and the Persian invasion would be pushed back only in later ground and naval battles br Since few records on the actual martial arts used by the Spartans survive aside from accounts of formations and tactics the fight choreography led by the stunt coordinator and fight choreographer Damon Caro was a synthesis of different weapon arts with Filipino martial arts as the base br Paul Cartledge Professor of Greek History at Cambridge University advised the filmmakers on the pronunciation of Greek names and said that they made good use of his published work on Sparta He praised the film for its portrayal of the Spartans heroic code and of the key role played by women in backing up indeed reinforcing the male martial code of heroic honour but he expressed reservations about its West goodies vs East baddies polarization Cartledge wrote that he enjoyed the film but found Leonidas description of the Athenians as boy lovers ironic since the Spartans themselves incorporated institutional pederasty into their educational system br Ephraim Lytle assistant professor of Hellenistic history at the University of Toronto said that selectively idealized Spartan society in a problematic and disturbing fashion and portrayed the hundred nations of the Persians as monsters and non Spartan Greeks as weak He suggested that the film s moral universe would have seemed as bizarre to ancient Greeks as it does to modern historians Lytle also commented Ephialtes who betrays the Greeks is likewise changed from a local Malian of sound body into a Spartan outcast a grotesquely disfigured troll who by Spartan custom should have been left exposed as an infant to die Leonidas points out that his hunched back means Ephialtes cannot lift his shield high enough to fight in the phalanx This is a transparent defense of Spartan eugenics and convenient given that infanticide could as easily have been precipitated by an ill omened birthmark br Victor Davis Hanson a National Review columnist and former professor of classical history at California State University Fresno wrote the foreword to a reissue of the graphic novel and said that the film demonstrates a specific affinity with the original material of Herodotus in that it captures the martial ethos of ancient Sparta and represents Thermopylae as a clash of civilizations He remarked that Simonides Aeschylus and Herodotus viewed Thermopylae as a battle against Eastern centralism and collective serfdom which opposed the idea of the free citizen of an autonomous polis He also said that the film portrays the battle in a surreal manner and that the intent was to entertain and shock first and instruct second br Touraj Daryaee who is now Baskerville Professor of Iranian History and the Persian World at the University of California Irvine criticized the film s use of classical sources by writing br br Some passages from the Classical authors Aeschylus Diodorus Herodotus and Plutarch are spilt over the movie to give it an authentic flavor Aeschylus becomes a major source when the battle with the monstrous human herd of the Persians is narrated in the film Diodorus statement about Greek valor to preserve their liberty is inserted in the film but his mention of Persian valor is omitted Herodotus fanciful numbers are used to populate the Persian army and Plutarch s discussion of Greek women specifically Spartan women is inserted wrongly in the dialogue between the misogynist Persian ambassador and the Spartan king Classical sources are certainly used but exactly in all the wrong places or quite naively The Athenians were fighting a sea battle during this br Robert McHenry the former editor in chief of Encyclop dia Britannica and the author of How to Know said that the film is an almost ineffably silly movie Stills from the film could easily be used to promote Buns of Steel or AbMaster or ThighMaster It s about the romanticizing of the Spartan ideal a process that began even in ancient times was promoted by the Romans and has survived over time while less and less resembling the actual historical Sparta br The director of Zack Snyder stated in an MTV interview that the events are percent accurate It s just in the visualization that it s crazy I ve shown this movie to world class historians who have said it s amazing They can t believe it s as accurate as it is Nevertheless he also said the film is an opera not a documentary That s what I say when people say it s historically inaccurate He was also quoted in a BBC News story as saying that the film is at its core a fantasy film He also describes the film s narrator Dilios as a guy who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth br In an interview the writer Frank Miller he stated The inaccuracies almost all of them are intentional I took those chest plates and leather skirts off of them for a reason I wanted these guys to move and I wanted em to look good I knocked their helmets off a fair amount partly so you can recognize who the characters are Spartans in full regalia were almost indistinguishable except at a very close angle Another liberty I took was they all had plumes but I only gave a plume to Leonidas to make him stand out and identify him as a king I was looking for more an evocation than a history lesson The best result I can hope for is that if the movie excites someone they ll go explore the histories themselves Because the histories are endlessly fascinating br Kaveh Farrokh in the paper The Movie Separating Fact from Fiction noted that the film falsely portrayed the Greco Persian Wars in binary terms the democratic good rational Us versus the tyrannical evil and irrational other of the ever nebulous if not exotic Persia He highlighted three points regarding the contribution of the Achaemenid Empire to the creation of democracy and human rights The founder of the Achaemenid Empire Cyrus the Great was the world s first emperor to openly declare and guarantee the sanctity of human rights and individual freedom Cyrus was a follower of the teachings of Zoroaster the founder of one of the world s oldest monotheistic religions When Cyrus defeated King Nabonidus of Babylon he officially declared the freedom of the Jews from their Babylonian captivity This was the first time in history that a world power had guaranteed the survival of the Jewish people religion customs and culture He abolished slavery br br br General criticism br Before the release of Warner Bros expressed concerns about the political aspects of the film s theme Snyder relates that there was a huge sensitivity about East versus West with the studio Media speculation about a possible parallel between the Greco Persian conflict and current events began in an interview with Snyder that was conducted before the Berlin Film Festival The interviewer remarked that everyone is sure to be translating this film into contemporary politics Snyder replied that he was aware that people would read the film through the lens of current events but no parallels between the film and the modern world were intended br Outside current political parallels some critics have raised more general questions about the film s ideological orientation Slate s Dana Stevens compared the film to The Eternal Jew as a textbook example of how race baiting fantasy and nationalist myth can serve as an incitement to total war Since it s a product of the post ideological post Xbox st century will instead be talked about as a technical achievement the next blip on the increasingly blurry line between movies and video games Roger Moore a critic for the Orlando Sentinel relates to Susan Sontag s definition of fascist art Indeed the Lambda sign on the Spartans shields in formed the inspiration for the official symbol of the far right Identitarian movement br Newsday critic Gene Seymour on the other hand stated that such reactions are misguided writing that the movie s just too darned silly to withstand any ideological theorizing Snyder himself dismissed ideological readings suggesting that reviewers who critique a graphic novel movie about a bunch of guys stomping the snot out of each other using words like neocon homophobic homoerotic or racist are missing the point Snyder however also admitted to fashioning an effeminate villain specifically to make young straight males in the audience uncomfortable What s more scary to a year old boy than a giant god king who wants to have his way with you The Slovenian critic Slavoj i ek pointed out that the story represents a poor small country Greece invaded by the army of a much large r state Persia and suggested the identification of the Spartans with a modern superpower to be flawed br The writer Frank Miller said The Spartans were a paradoxical people They were the biggest slave owners in Greece But at the same time Spartan women had an unusual level of rights It s a paradox that they were a bunch of people who in many ways were fascist but they were the bulwark against the fall of democracy The closest comparison you can draw in terms of our own military today is to think of the red caped Spartans as being like our special ops forces They re these almost superhuman characters with a tremendous warrior ethic who were unquestionably the best fighters in Greece I didn t want to render Sparta in overly accurate terms because ultimately I do want you to root for the Spartans I couldn t show them being quite as cruel as they were I made them as cruel as I thought a modern audience could stand br Michael M Chemers author of With Your Shield or on It Disability Representation in in the Disability Studies Quarterly said that the film s portrayal of the hunchback and his story is not mere ableism this is anti disability Frank Miller commenting on areas in which he lessened the Spartan cruelty for narrative purposes said I have King Leonidas very gently tell Ephialtes the hunchback that they can t use him as a soldier because of his deformity It would be much more classically Spartan if Leonidas laughed and kicked him off the cliff br br br Iranian criticism br br From its opening also attracted controversy over its portrayal of Persians Officials of the Iranian government denounced the film Some scenes in the film portray demon like and other fictional creatures as part of the Persian army and the fictionalized portrayal of Persian King Xerxes I has been criticised as effeminate Critics suggested that it was meant to stand in stark contrast to the portrayed masculinity of the Spartan army Steven Rea argued that the film s Persians were a vehicle for an anachronistic cross section of Western aspirational stereotypes of Asian and African cultures br The film s portrayal of ancient Persians caused a particularly strong reaction in Iran Various Iranian officials condemned the film The Iranian Academy of the Arts submitted a formal complaint against the film to UNESCO that called it an attack on the historical identity of Iran The Iranian mission to the UN protested the film in a press release and Iranian embassies protested its screening in France Thailand Turkey and Uzbekistan The film was banned in Iran with the film being considered American propaganda br Reviewers in the United States and elsewhere noted the political overtones of the West against Iran story line and the way Persians are depicted as decadent sexually flamboyant and evil in contrast to the noble Greeks With black market copies of the film already available in Tehran with the film s international release and news of the film s surprising success at the US box office the film prompted widespread anger in Iran Azadeh Moaveni of Time reported All of Tehran was outraged Everywhere I went yesterday the talk vibrated with indignation over the film Newspapers in Iran featured headlines such as Hollywood declares war on Iranians and Against Million the latter being the size of Iran s population Ayende No an independent Iranian newspaper said The film depicts Iranians as demons without culture feeling or humanity who think of nothing except attacking other nations and killing people Four Members of Majles the Iranian parliament called on other Muslim countries to ban the film and a group of Iranian film makers submitted a letter of protest to UNESCO regarding the film s misrepresentation of Iranian history and culture The cultural advisor to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called the film an American attempt for psychological warfare against Iran br Moaveni identified two factors that may have contributed to the intensity of Iranian indignation over the film Firstly she described the timing of the film s release on the eve of Nowruz the Persian New Year as inauspicious Secondly Iranians tend to view the era depicted in the film as a particularly noble page in their history Moaveni suggested that s box office success compared with Alexander s failure another spurious period epic dealing with Persians was cause for considerable alarm signaling ominous U S intentions br According to The Guardian Iranian critics of ranging from bloggers to government officials described the movie as a calculated attempt to demonise Iran at a time of intensifying U S pressure over the country s nuclear programme An Iranian government spokesman described the film as hostile behavior which is the result of cultural and psychological warfare Moaveni reported that the Iranians with whom she interacted were adamant that the movie was secretly funded by the U S government to prepare Americans for going to war against Iran br br br In popular culture br has been spoofed in film television and other media and spawned the This is Sparta internet meme Skits based upon the film have appeared on Saturday Night Live and Robot Chicken the latter of which mimicked the visual style of in a parody set during the American Revolutionary War titled Other parodies

Mort Drucker th Century Fox released Meet the Spartans a spoof directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer Universal Pictures once planned a similar parody titled National Lampoon s The Legend of Awesomest Maximus Wallace Leonidas Samurai Jack an American animated series by Genndy Tartakovsky also paid homage to the Battle of Thermopylae in the th episode of its second season but instead used minotaur robots as the antagonists br particularly its pithy quotations has been adopted by the student body of Michigan State University whose nickname is the Spartans with chants of Spartans what is your profession becoming common at sporting events starting after the film s release and Michigan State basketball head coach Tom Izzo dressed as Leonidas at one student event Nate Ebner a football player with the New England Patriots in the National Football League and formerly with the Ohio State Buckeyes was nicknamed Leonidas after the Greek warrior king hero of Sparta acted by Gerard Butler in the movie because of his intense workout regimen and his beard br br br Sequel br br In June producers Mark Canton Gianni Nunnari and Bernie Goldmann revealed that work had begun on a sequel to
