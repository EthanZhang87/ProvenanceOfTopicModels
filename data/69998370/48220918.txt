thrilling twists and turns this horror road movie is a surprisingly smooth ride Metacritic reports a out of rating based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews br The New York Times Neil Genzlinger gave the film a positive review and wrote Its five segments do what they re supposed to do unsettle you but as a bonus they also leave you wanting more These are fragments more than complete stories and the incompleteness is its own kind of creepiness The filmmakers aren t after tidy tales neatly connected and concluded They know that the human mind finds loose ends unnerving Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times described it as one of the smartest and scariest movies in recent memory and Rolling Stone s David Ehrlich compared the film to episodes of Twilight Zone that a baked Rod Serling might have written after watching Carnival of Souls these chapters are eerie to the extreme and seedy enough to make you feel like you re watching something you were never meant to see It gets under your skin because it knows there s nothing scarier than realizing that no matter how far you drive the evil in your rearview mirror is always closer than it appears br Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review The vignettes are cleverly interwoven by having situations or characters bleeding over from one to the next and despite the multiple helmers and scripters involved the film boasts a strong stylistic consistency Featuring fine performances by its ensemble Southbound should well please genre fans nostalgic for the likes of Tales From the Crypt and Creepshow Nicolas Rapold of Film Comment wrote This anthology of five horror tales is the rare group effort without a dud as it cruises through variations on the genre with style and confidence Todd Brown founder and editor of Twitch Film described the film as the Twilight Zone for the indie horror generation br The film was included on numerous Best Horror Films of lists including Rolling Stone s Best Horror Movies of BuzzFeed s The Best Horror Films Of and the Thrillist s Best Horror Movies of The Year s Scariest Films br Paul Thomas Anderson called the film a hidden gem br br There are numerous allusions to the film s alternate meanings hidden throughout the segments most of the popular theories suggest that the main characters in the film are all trapped in Purgatory where they are forced to endlessly pay for the sins they committed while living br These allusions and easter eggs include the clearly visible bullet wound on Mitch the blood spatter on the motel wall bullet holes that mysteriously appear after Mitch becomes trapped in the motel implying a connection between the room and bullet wound s scar on Mitch the implication that the ancillary characters have all participated in the situations before the same dispatch voice heard every time a character calls the suggestion that Danny has transcended the physical world to find his sister the use of Carnival of Souls the films share similar themes and storylines the clerk at the truck stop is named Sutter which is an allusion to Sutter Kane from John Carpenter s In the Mouth of Madness another film with similar themes mirrored dialogue scenes and images throughout the creatures being visible in each story elements of the production design that include the word fear visible in the magazine Sutter is reading the flyer for The White Tights in the Jailbreak segment Jack s Only God Can Judge Me tattoo and the name of the bar that Danny breaks into The Trap br Additionally The Way Out and The Way In have numerous connective visual and audible easter eggs throughout to establish the narrative and physical connection between stories that create the film s never ending loop as well as point towards the film s hidden meanings These include br br The truck from The Way Out is visible in the Freez n Over parking lot at the beginning of The Way In br The house is the same in both The Way Out and The Way In and many of the same shots are used including of the decorative lights outside when Mitch enters in The Way Out and when the masked man enters in The Way In and when Jem walks down the same hallway where Mitch gets trapped br In The Way Out the creatures stalk Mitch and Jack in exactly the same fashion that Mitch and Jack stalk the family in The Way In first from afar before closing in and again similar shots are used in both br Jack is grabbed by the creature in the bathroom with a T shirt which is what he used to kill Cait br The shaking in Roy s Cafe is the sound made when the ground opens up in The Way In implying that these are the creatures below the diner br When Jack is killed by the creature he dies in much the same way as Cait did when he suffocated her br The knocks that lure Mitch into the motel room in The Way Out are the same pattern as the knocks from outside the house in The Way In br The motel room that Mitch enters is room in The Way Out the same as the house s address in The Way In br The mask that Mitch wears in The Way In is visible on the table in the last shot of The Way Out and it is what he was looking at when he first hears his daughter giggle br The songs Don t Let the Party End and Goodbye Goodbye are used in both though different parts of the songs are played br The DJ s voice over Larry Fessenden is in both segments however the ending version has slightly different dialogue implying that the loop is not the same every time and that the characters have the option of making better choices with the possibility that they may be allowed to escape should they cease to make the same wrong choices time and time again br br List of films featuring home invasions br br Southbound at IMDb br Southbound
