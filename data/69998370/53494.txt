Marquis of Sarzano was an Italian political refugee his wife Lee s great grandmother was English born opera singer Marie Carandini n e Burgess He had an elder sister Xandra Carandini Lee br Lee s parents separated when he was four and divorced two years later During this time his mother took his sister and him to Wengen in Switzerland After enrolling in Miss Fisher s Academy in Territet he played his first role as Rumpelstiltskin They then returned to London where Lee attended Wagner s private school in Queen s Gate and his mother married Harcourt George St Croix Rose a banker and uncle of Ian Fleming Fleming author of the James Bond novels thus became Lee s step cousin The family moved to Fulham living next door to the actor Eric Maturin One night he was introduced to Prince Yusupov and Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich the assassins of Grigori Rasputin whom Lee was to play many years later br When Lee was nine he was sent to Summer Fields School a preparatory school in Oxford some of whose pupils later attended Eton He continued acting in school plays though the laurels deservedly went to Patrick Macnee Lee applied for a scholarship to Eton where his interview was in the presence of the ghost story author M R James His poor maths skills meant that he was placed eleventh and thus missed out on being a King s Scholar by one place His step father was not prepared to pay the higher fees that being an Oppidan Scholar meant so instead he attended Wellington College where he won scholarships in the classics studying Ancient Greek and Latin Aside from a tiny part in a school play he did not act while at Wellington He was a passable racquets player and fencer and a competent cricketer but did not do well at the other sports played hockey football rugby and boxing He disliked the parades and weapons training and would always play dead as soon as possible during mock battles Lee was frequently beaten at school including once at Wellington for being beaten too often though he accepted them as logical and therefore acceptable punishments for knowingly breaking the rules At age and with one year left at Wellington the summer term of was his last His step father had gone bankrupt owing equivalent to in br His mother separated from Rose and Lee had to get a job his sister already working as a secretary for the Church of England Pensions Board With most employers on or preparing to go on summer holidays there were no immediate opportunities for Lee who was sent to the French Riviera where his sister was on holiday with friends On his way there he stopped briefly in Paris where he stayed with the journalist Webb Miller a friend of Rose and witnessed Eugen Weidmann s execution by guillotine the last public execution performed in France Arriving in Menton he stayed with the Russian Mazirov family living among exiled princely families It was arranged that he should remain in Menton after his sister had returned home but with Europe on the brink of war he returned to London instead He worked as an office clerk for United States Lines taking care of the mail and running errands br br br Military service br When the Second World War broke out in Lee had enrolled in a military academy and volunteered to fight for the Finnish Army against the Soviet Union during the Winter War He and other British volunteers were kept away from the actual fighting but they were issued with winter gear and were posted on guard duty a safe distance from the border After two weeks in Finland they returned home In a later interview Lee said he knew how to shoot but not how to ski and that he probably would not be alive if he had been allowed to go to the front line Lee returned to work at United States Lines and found his work more satisfying feeling that he was contributing In early he joined Beecham s at first as an office clerk then as a switchboard operator When Beecham s moved out of London he joined the Home Guard In the winter his father fell ill with bilateral pneumonia and died on March Realising that he had no inclination to follow his father into the Army Lee decided to join up while he still had some choice of service and volunteered for the Royal Air Force br Lee reported to RAF Uxbridge for training and was then posted to the Initial Training Wing at Paignton After he had passed his exams in Liverpool the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan meant that he travelled on the Reina del Pacifico to South Africa then to his posting at Hillside at Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia Training with de Havilland Tiger Moths Lee was having his penultimate training session before his first solo flight when he suffered from headaches and blurred vision The medical officer hesitantly diagnosed a failure of his optic nerve and he was told he would never be allowed to fly again Lee was devastated and the death of a fellow trainee from his former school Summer Fields only made him more despondent His appeals were fruitless and he was left with nothing to do He was moved around to different flying stations before being posted to Southern Rhodesia s capital Salisbury in December He then visited the Mazowe Dam Marandellas the Wankie Game Reserve and the ruins of Great Zimbabwe Thinking he should do something constructive for my keep he applied to join RAF Intelligence His superiors praised his initiative and he was seconded into the British South Africa Police and was posted as a warder at Salisbury Prison He was then promoted to leading aircraftman Leaving South Africa he sailed from Durban to Suez on the Nieuw Amsterdam br After killing time at RAF Kasfareet near the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal Zone in he resumed intelligence work in the city of Isma lia He was then attached to No Group RAF before being commissioned at the end of January and attached to No Squadron RAF as an intelligence officer As the North African Campaign progressed the squadron leapfrogged between Egyptian airstrips from RAF El Daba to Maaten Bagush and on to Mersa Matruh they lent air support to the ground forces and bombed strategic targets Lee broadly speaking was expected to know everything The Allied advance continued into Libya through Tobruk and Benghazi to the Marble Arch and then through El Agheila Khoms and Tripoli with the squadron averaging five missions a day As the advance continued into Tunisia with the Axis forces digging themselves in at the Mareth Line Lee was almost killed when the squadron s airfield was bombed After breaking through the Mareth Line the squadron made their final base in Kairouan following the Axis surrender in North Africa in May the squadron moved to Zuwarah in Libya in preparation for the Allied invasion of Sicily They then moved to Malta and after its capture by the British Eighth Army the Sicilian town of Pachino before making a permanent base in Agnone Bagni At the end of July Lee received his second promotion of the year this time to flying officer After the Sicilian campaign was over Lee came down with malaria for the sixth time in under a year and was flown to a hospital in Carthage for treatment When he returned the squadron was restless frustrated with a lack of news about the Eastern Front and the Soviet Union in general and with no mail from home or alcohol Unrest spread and threatened to turn into mutiny Lee by now an expert on Russia talked them into resuming their duties which much impressed his commanding officer br After the Allied invasion of Italy the squadron was based in Foggia and Termoli during the winter of where Lee was then seconded to the Army during an officers swap scheme During most of the Battle of Monte Cassino he was attached to the Gurkhas of the th Indian Infantry Division While spending some time on leave in Naples Lee climbed Mount Vesuvius which erupted three days later During the final assault on Monte Cassino the squadron was based in San Angelo and Lee was nearly killed when one of the planes crashed on takeoff and he tripped over one of its live bombs After the battle the squadron moved to airfields just outside Rome and Lee visited the city where he met his mother s cousin Nicol Carandini who had fought in the Italian resistance movement In November Lee was promoted to flight lieutenant and left the squadron in Iesi to take up a posting at Air Force HQ Lee took part in forward planning and liaison in preparation for a potential assault into the rumoured German Alpine Fortress After the war ended Lee was invited to go hunting near Vienna and was then billeted in P rtschach am W rthersee For the final few months of his service Lee who spoke fluent French Italian and German among other languages was seconded to the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects Here he was tasked with helping to track down Nazi war criminals Of his time with the organisation Lee said We were given dossiers of what they d done and told to find them interrogate them as much as we could and hand them over to the appropriate authority He completed his service with the RAF in with the rank of flight lieutenant br Lee said that during the war he was attached to special forces but declined to give details Lee s stepfather served as a captain in the Intelligence Corps but it is unlikely he had any influence over Lee s military career Lee saw his stepfather for the last time on a bus in London in after he was divorced from Lee s mother and Lee did not speak to him br br br Career br br br Career beginnings br Returning to London in Lee was offered his old job back at Beecham s with a significant raise but he turned them down as I couldn t think myself back into the office frame of mind The Armed Forces were sending veterans with an education in the Classics to teach at universities but Lee felt his Latin was too rusty and didn t care for the strict curfews During lunch with his cousin Nicol Carandini now the Italian Ambassador to Britain Lee was detailing his war wounds when Carandini said Why don t you become an actor Christopher Lee liked the idea and after assuaging his mother s protests by pointing to the successful Carandini performers in Australia which included his great grandmother Marie Carandini who had been an opera singer he met Nicol s friend Filippo Del Giudice a lawyer turned film producer and head of Two Cities Films part of the Rank Organisation Lee recalled that Giudice looked me up and down and concluded that I was just what the industry had been looking for He was sent to see Josef Somlo for a contract br br Initially I was told by Somlo I was too tall to be an actor That s a quite fatuous remark to make It s like saying you re too short to play the piano I thought Right I ll show you At the beginning I didn t know anything about the technique of working in front of a camera but during those years I did the one thing that s so vitally important today I watched I listened and I learned So when the time came I was ready Oddly enough to play a character who said nothing The Creature in The Curse of Frankenstein br Somlo sent him to see Rank s David Henley and Olive Dodds who signed him on a seven year contract Like other students at Rank s Charm School Lee had difficulty finding work He finally made his film d but in in Terence Young s Gothic romance Corridor of Mirrors He played Charles the director got around his height by placing him at a table in a nightclub alongside Lois Maxwell Mavis Villiers Hugh Latimer and John Penrose Lee had a single line a satirical shaft meant to qualify the lead s bravura br In this early period he made an uncredited appearance in Laurence Olivier s film version of Hamlet as a spear carrier his later co star and close friend Peter Cushing played Osric A few years later he appeared in Captain Horatio Hornblower R N as a Spanish captain He was cast when the director asked him if he could speak Spanish and fence which he was able to do Lee appeared uncredited in the American epic Quo Vadis which was shot in Rome playing a chariot driver and was injured when he was thrown from it at one point during the shoot br He recalled that his breakthrough came in when Douglas Fairbanks Jr began making films at the British National Studios He said in I was cast in various roles in of them and even appeared with Buster Keaton and it proved an excellent training ground The same year he appeared in John Huston s Oscar nominated Moulin Rouge Throughout the next decade he made nearly films including The Cockleshell Heroes playing mostly stock action characters br br br Work with Hammer br br Lee s first film for Hammer was The Curse of Frankenstein in which he played Frankenstein s monster with Peter Cushing as Baron Victor Frankenstein It was the first film to co star Lee and Cushing who ultimately appeared together in over twenty films and became close friends When he arrived at a casting session for the film they asked me if I wanted the part I said yes and that was that A little later Lee co starred with Boris Karloff in the film Corridors of Blood Lee had previously appeared with Karloff in in the At Night All Cats are Grey episode of the British television series Colonel March of Scotland Yard Karloff and Lee were London neighbours for a time in the mid s br br Lee s own appearance as Frankenstein s monster led to his first appearance as the Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula in the film Dracula known as Horror of Dracula in the US The film saw Lee s triumphant debut fix the image of the fanged vampire in popular culture according to writer Kevin Jackson Dracula has been ranked among the best British films Lee introduced a dark brooding sexuality to the character with Tim Stanley stating Lee s sensuality was subversive in that it hinted that women might quite like having their neck chewed on by a stud The film magazine Empire ranked Lee s portrayal as Dracula the th Greatest Horror Movie Character of All Time CNN listed the performance third in their top British villains noting his chilling sonorous tone Lee accepted a similar role in an Italian French horror picture called Uncle Was a Vampire The same year he starred as Kharis in the Hammer Horror film The Mummy br br Lee returned to the role of Dracula in Hammer s Dracula Prince of Darkness Lee s role has no lines he merely hisses his way through the film Stories vary as to the reason for this Lee states he refused to speak the poor dialogue he was given but screenwriter Jimmy Sangster claims that the script did not contain any lines for the character This film set the standard for most of the Dracula sequels in the sense that half the film s running time was spent on telling the story of Dracula s resurrection and the character s appearances were brief Lee went on record to state that he was virtually blackmailed by Hammer into starring in the subsequent films unable or unwilling to pay him his going rate they would resort to reminding him of how many people he would put out of work if he did not take part br br The process went like this The telephone would ring and my agent would say Jimmy Carreras President of Hammer Films has been on the phone they ve got another Dracula for you And I would say Forget it I don t want to do another one I d get a call from Jimmy Carreras in a state of hysteria What s all this about Jim I don t want to do it and I don t have to do it No you have to do it And I said Why He replied Because I ve already sold it to the American distributor with you playing the part Think of all the people you know so well that you will put out of work Emotional blackmail That s the only reason I did them br His roles in the films Dracula Has Risen from the Grave Taste the Blood of Dracula and Scars of Dracula all gave the Count very little to do Lee said in an interview in all they do is write a story and try and fit the character in somewhere which is very clear when you see the films They gave me nothing to do I pleaded with Hammer to let me use some of the lines that Bram Stoker had written Occasionally I sneaked one in He starred in two further Dracula films for Hammer in the early s both of which attempted to bring the character into the modern day era These were not commercially successful Dracula A D and The Satanic Rites of Dracula The latter film was tentatively titled Dracula Is Dead and Well and Living in London a parody of the stage and film musical revue Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris but Lee was not amused Speaking at a press conference in to announce the film Lee said I m doing it under protest I think it is fatuous I can think of twenty adjectives fatuous pointless absurd It s not a comedy but it s got a comic title I don t see the point The Satanic Rites of Dracula was the last Dracula film in which Lee played the Dracula role as he felt he had played the part too many times and that the films had deteriorated in quality br In all Lee played Dracula ten times seven films for Hammer Productions once for Jes s Franco s Count Dracula uncredited in Jerry Lewis s One More Time and douard Molinaro s Dracula and Son he also played an unnamed but Dracula like vampire in The Magic Christian Lee portrayed Rasputin in Rasputin the Mad Monk and Sir Henry Baskerville to Cushing s Sherlock Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles Lee later played Holmes himself in s Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace and returned to Holmes films with Billy Wilder s British made The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes in which he plays Sherlock s smarter brother Mycroft Lee considers this film to be the reason he stopped being typecast I ve never been typecast since Sure I ve played plenty of heavies but as Anthony Hopkins says I don t play villains I play people Lee played a leading role in the German film The Puzzle of the Red Orchid speaking German which he had learned during his education in Switzerland He auditioned for a part in the film The Longest Day but was turned down because he did not look like a military man Some film books incorrectly credit him with a role in the film something he had to correct for the rest of his life br Lee s friend the author Dennis Wheatley was responsible for bringing the occult to him The company made two films from Wheatley s novels both starring Lee The New York Times described Lee s performance in the first The Devil Rides Out as suave dignity However the second film To the Devil a Daughter was troubled by production difficulties and was disowned by its author Although financially successful it was Hammer s last horror film Critic Leonard Maltin described it as well made but lacking punch br Other roles The Wicker Man and James Bond br br Like Cushing Lee also appeared in horror films for other companies from to These included the Dr Fu Manchu series of films made between and beginning with The Face of Fu Manchu in which he starred as the villain in yellowface make up I Monster an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson s novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde with the main characters names changed to Dr Charles Marlowe and Mr Edward Blake The Creeping Flesh and his personal favourite which he considered his best film The Wicker Man in which he played Lord Summerisle Lee wanted to break free of his image as Dracula and take on more interesting acting roles He met with screenwriter Anthony Shaffer and they agreed to work together Film director Robin Hardy and British Lion head Peter Snell became involved in the project Shaffer had a series of conversations with Hardy and the two decided that it would be fun to make a horror film centring on old religion in sharp contrast to the popular Hammer films of the day Shaffer read the David Pinner novel Ritual in which a devout Christian policeman is called to investigate what appears to be the ritual murder of a young girl in a rural village and decided that it would serve well as the source material for the project Shaffer and Lee paid Pinner equivalent to US in for the rights to the novel and Schaffer set to work on the screenplay However he soon decided that a direct adaptation would not work well and began to craft a new story using only the novel s basic outline Lee was so keen to get the film made and the budget was so small that he gave his services for free He later called the film the best he had ever made br Lee appeared as the on screen narrator in Jess Franco s Eugenie as a favour to producer Harry Alan Towers unaware that it was softcore pornography as the sex scenes were shot separately br br I had no idea that was what it was when I agreed to the role I was told it was about the Marquis de Sade I flew out to Spain for one day s work playing the part of a narrator I had to wear a crimson dinner jacket There were lots of people behind me They all had their clothes on There didn t seem to be anything peculiar or strange A friend said Do you know you are in a film in Old Compton Street In those days that was where the mackintosh brigade watched their films Very funny I said So I crept along there heavily disguised in dark glasses and scarf and found the cinema and there was my name I was furious There was a huge row When I had left Spain that day everyone behind me had taken their clothes off br br In addition to

After the mid s Lee eschewed horror roles almost entirely Ian Fleming author of the James Bond spy novels and Lee s step cousin had offered him the role of the titular antagonist in the first Eon produced Bond film Dr No Lee enthusiastically accepted but by the time Fleming told the producers they had already chosen Joseph Wiseman for the role Lee finally got to play a James Bond villain in The Man with the Golden Gun in which he was cast as the assassin Francisco Scaramanga Lee said of his performance In Fleming s novel he s just a West Indian thug but in the film he s charming elegant amusing lethal I played him like the dark side of Bond br Because of his filming schedule in Bangkok film director Ken Russell was unable to sign Lee to play the Specialist in Tommy That role was eventually given to Jack Nicholson In an AMC documentary on Halloween John Carpenter states that he offered the role of Samuel Loomis to Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee before Donald Pleasence took
