District tribute Peeta Mellark are escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy the only living victor from District Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors as they can provide life saving gifts during the Games During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman Peeta confesses his feelings for Katniss which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors she later learns his feelings are genuine br At the start of the Games Katniss grabs supplies scattered around the Cornucopia the Games starting point narrowly escaping death and fleeing into the surrounding forest She tries to avoid other tributes but Seneca Crane the Head Gamemaker triggers a forest fire to drive her back towards them She runs into the Careers composed of District s tributes Marvel and Glimmer and District s tributes Cato and Clove and climbs a tree Peeta seemingly allied with the Careers suggests they wait her out Hiding in a nearby tree Rue District s female tribute points Katniss toward a nest of genetically modified venomous wasps named Tracker Jackers which Katniss cuts to fall onto the sleeping Careers below Glimmer is killed but Peeta and the others escape Katniss retrieves Glimmer s bow and arrows but falls ill from being stung several times and has hallucinations Peeta returns and urges her to flee before making his own escape from the Careers br Rue helps Katniss recover and the two become friends Rue distracts the Careers while Katniss destroys a stockpile of their supplies by triggering the mines guarding it However Marvel finds and impales Rue with his spear before Katniss shoots him She comforts Rue by singing and after she dies adorns her body with flowers an act which incites a riot in District Panem President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane he is displeased about the unrest stating the Games purpose is to instill fear to prevent future uprisings br Haymitch persuades Crane to alter the rules of the Games allowing for two victors if they are from the same district suggesting that it would appease the audience Katniss finds Peeta severely injured and the two take shelter in a cave Despite Peeta s

has Crane locked in a room with a bowl of nightlock berries while contemplating his next action br br In March Lions Gate Entertainment known as Lionsgate entered into a co production agreement for The Hunger Games with Nina Jacobson s production company Color Force which had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the novel a few weeks earlier reportedly for Alli Shearmur and Jim Miller president and senior vice president of motion picture production at Lionsgate took charge of overseeing the production of the film which they described as an incredible property a thrill to bring home to Lionsgate The studio which had not made a profit for five years raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of for the film Suzanne Collins agent Jason Dravis remarked that they Lionsgate had everyone but the valet call us to help secure the franchise Lionsgate subsequently acquired tax breaks of million for shooting the film in North Carolina Gary Ross Sam Mendes David Slade Andrew Adamson Susanna White Rupert Sanders and Francis Lawrence were listed as possible directing candidates but in the end Ross was announced as the film s director in November Ross became interested in directing the film after his agent notified him about that a film adaptation of The Hunger Games was in development having heard about the book due to his children reading it Ross read the book quickly and called his agent to tell her that he wanted the job br Ross had many conversations with Collins about how to adapt the story and was fascinated by how Ancient Roman culture inspired the books Collins adapted the novel for film herself in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and Ross The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel with Ross saying he felt the only way to make the film really successful was to be totally subjective echoing Collins presentation of the novel in the first person present Ross felt that to preserve the novel s first person point of view the audience could know little more than what protagonist Katniss Everdeen knows about the story s developments Instead of presenting Katniss internal monologues about the Capitol s machinations through actual monologues or voice over narrations the screenplay expanded on the character of Seneca Crane the Head Gamemaker to allow several developments for which Katniss is not present to be shown directly to the audience Ross explained In the book Katniss speculates about the game makers manipulations in the film we can t get inside Katniss s head but we do have the ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes I created the game centre and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons I thought it was totally important Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow the elderly President of Panem noting that I thought that it was very interesting that there would be one generation of Panem citizens who knew that the Games were actually an instrument of political control and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and the showbiz and the sensations and the spectacle that was subsuming the actual political intention and that s really where the tension is br The Gamemakers control center about which Katniss can only speculate in the novel was also developed as a location helping to remind the audience of the artificial nature of the arena Ross commented so much of the film happens in the woods that it s easy to forget this is a futuristic society manipulating these events for the sake of an audience The look of the control center the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel constructed even when you weren t seeing the control room Ross and visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal dei ex machina Katniss experiences in the arena Duggal explained that we really didn t want to have to explain things how do you get compelled by these animals that just appear at the end of the movie We wanted to find a way to introduce them without having to explain specifically and exactly what they were and the game room was a really great opportunity for us to be able to do that br br Ross had a general idea of who he wanted to cast in some roles but the studio insisted on holding auditions for the roles which he accepted He found the castings of Katniss Everdeen Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne honestly easy Lionsgate confirmed in March that about actresses auditioned or read for the role of Katniss Everdeen including Hailee Steinfeld Abigail Breslin Emma Roberts Alyson Stoner Saoirse Ronan Chlo Grace Moretz Jodelle Ferland Lyndsy Fonseca Emily Browning Shailene Woodley Kaya Scodelario and Troian Bellisario On March it was announced that Jennifer Lawrence who was at the time filming for X Men First Class had landed the role Feeling that Lawrence blew the doors off the place Ross described Lawrence as having an incredible amount of self assuredness you got the sense that this girl knew exactly who she was And then she came in and read for me and just knocked me out I d never seen an audition like that before in my life It was one of those things where you just glimpse your whole movie in front of you br Though Lawrence was when filming began four years older than the character Collins said that the role demanded a certain maturity and power and said she would rather the actress be older than younger She added that Lawrence was the only one who truly captured the character I wrote in the book and that she had every essential quality necessary to play Katniss Lawrence a fan of the books was originally intimidated by the size of the production and took three days to accept the role br Contenders for the role of Peeta other than Josh Hutcherson included Alexander Ludwig Hunter Parrish Lucas Till Evan Peters and Austin Butler Ross felt that Hutcherson was a pitch perfect Other actors considered for the role of Gale Hawthorne included David Henrie Drew Roy and Robbie Amell before Liam Hemsworth was cast In April John C Reilly was in talks with Lionsgate to portray Haymitch Abernathy The following month Lionsgate announced that the role had gone to Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson Harrelson initially passed on the role but Ross called him up and convinced him to accept the role The casting of Grammy winner Lenny Kravitz as Cinna Oscar nominee Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman and Toby Jones as Claudius Templesmith soon followed Tucci and Ross had previously worked together in The Tale of Despereaux leading Tucci to immediately accept the role of Flickerman when Ross offered it to him in an Italian restaurant of New York City during New Year s Eve Multiple Golden Globe Award winner Donald Sutherland was cast as President Coriolanus Snow in late May Following his casting Sutherland wrote Ross a letter explaining him how much his role meant to the narrative which impressed Ross and led him to incorporate some of Sutherland s suggestions to Snow s scenes in the film br br Fireman s Fund Insurance Company insured the production but as part of the underwriting process insisted on a thorough risk analysis of hazards as diverse as wayward arrows poison ivy bears bugs and a chase across fast running water br Lawrence dyed her naturally blonde hair dark for the part of Katniss Other stars who dyed their hair for the movie include Josh Hutcherson as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Lawrence also underwent extensive training to get in shape for the role including archery rock and tree climbing combat running parkour and yoga On the last day of her six week training phase she had an accident in which she hit a wall while running at full speed but was not seriously injured Lionsgate hired Olympic bronze medal winning archer Khatuna Lorig to teach Lawrence how to shoot br With an initial budget of million principal photography began near Brevard in Transylvania County in Western North Carolina in May and concluded on September with a final budget reported as between and million reduced to million after subsidies Steven Soderbergh served as a second unit director and filmed much of the District riot scene The movie was shot on film as opposed to digital due in part to the tightness of the schedule as Ross said in an interview with The New York Times I didn t want to run the risk of the technical issues that often come with shooting digitally we simply couldn t afford any delays br Virtually all production photography took place in North Carolina with Lionsgate receiving tax credits of around million from the state government to do so Most outdoor scenes both from the arena and from the outskirts of District were filmed in DuPont State Forest the Little River with its multiple waterfalls provided several locations for shooting the river running through the arena To run across Triple Falls Lawrence was attached to wires and ran on a board br Many of the urban and interior locations in the Capitol and elsewhere were filmed in Shelby and Charlotte other scenes were filmed in the Asheville area Ross and production designer Phil Messina drew on the buildings of the New York World s Fair and symbols of political power including Tiananmen Square and Red Square when designing the Capitol architecture which they wanted to be set in the future but have a sense of its own past it s festive and alluring and indulgent and decadent but it also has to have the kind of might and power behind it For Katniss neighborhood in District the production team used Henry River Mill Village an abandoned mill town which Ross said just worked perfectly for the movie to evoke the scene Messina explained that originally we talked about maybe building one house and the facade of the house next door and redressing it and maybe doing some CG extensions we ended up finding a whole abandoned mill town it was absolutely perfect br For the costume design Judianna Makovsky and her crew looked at photographs of coal mining districts from the s in the search of an American feel The idea was to create clothing unique for every character and to strongly differentiate the people in Capitol and in districts Grey and blue prevailed in the color palette for the District while the people in Capitol were chosen to look bright in theatrical hats flowers ruffles with powdered and eyebrowless faces br br The soundtrack album for The Hunger Games contains songs inspired by the film only three of them Abraham s Daughter Safe Sound and Kingdom Come respectively appear in the film itself during the closing credits The first single from the film s companion album Safe Sound by Taylor Swift featuring The Civil Wars was released on December Along with separate songs from Swift and The Civil Wars

Games with Burnett also acting as the film s executive music producer to produce songs for the soundtrack However due to scheduling conflicts James Newton Howard replaced Elfman as the music composer

reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Several critics have reviewed the film favorably and compared it with other young adult fiction adaptations such as Harry Potter and Twilight while praising Jennifer Lawrence for her portrayal as Katniss Everdeen as well as most of the main cast According to The Hollywood Reporter Lawrence embodies Katniss just as one might imagine her from the novel Empire magazine said Lawrence is perfect as Katniss there s very little softness about her more a melancholy determination that good must be done even if that requires bad things Justin Craig of Fox News rated the film as e xcellent and stated Move over Harry Potter A darker more mature franchise has come to claim your throne Rafer Guzman of Newsday referred to The Hunger Games as being darker than Harry Potter more sophisticated than Twilight David Sexton of The Evening Standard stated that The Hunger Games is well cast and pretty well acted certainly when compared with Harry Potter s juvenile leads br Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three stars out of four praising the movie as effective entertainment and Lawrence s performance Despite a largely positive review he criticized the film for being too long and noted that the film misses opportunities for social criticism Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy gave the film four stars out of five calling it enthralling from beginning to end science fiction that has depth and intelligence to match its pulse racing entertainment value Reynolds also spoke highly of Lawrence s performance and director Gary Ross whose rough and ready handheld camerawork meant that viewers were with Katniss for every blood flecked moment of her ordeal in the combat arena However film critic David Thomson of the magazine The New Republic called it a terrible movie criticizing it for a lack of character development and unclear presentation of the violence describing the latter as un American br Eric Goldman of IGN awarded the film four out of five stars stating that director Gary Ross gets the tone of The Hunger Games right This is a grounded thoughtful and sometimes quite emotional film with its dark scenario given due weight Ross doesn t give the film a glossy romanticized Hollywood feel but rather plays everything very realistically and stark as Katniss must endure these outrageous and horrible scenarios The film received some criticism for its shaky camera style but it was said to add to the film in certain ways The violence drew commentary as well Time critic Mary Pols considered that the film was too violent for young children even though the violence had been toned down compared with the novel while critic Th oden Janes of The Charlotte Observer found that the violence is so bland it dilutes the message Also writing in Time psychologist Christopher J Ferguson argued that parents fears of the effect of the film s violent content on their children were unnecessary and that children are capable of viewing violent content without being psychologically harmed br br Interpretations of the film s themes and messages have been widely discussed among critics and general commentators In his review for The Washington Times Peter Suderman expressed that m aybe it s a liberal story about inequality and the class divide Maybe it s a libertarian epic about the evils of authoritarian government Maybe it s a feminist revision on the sci fi action blockbuster Maybe it s a bloody satire of reality television but concludes the film only proposes these theories and brings none of them to a reasonable conclusion br Reviewers and critics have differing views on whether the film represents feminist issues Historically among the top worldwide box office hits ever million and up not one has been built around a female action star Manohla Dargis of The New York Times sees Katniss Everdeen as a female hero following in the lineage of archetypal figures in the literature of the American West such as Natty Bumppo as well as characters portrayed by American actors such as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood Katniss is also seen as defying normative gender roles she exhibits both masculine and feminine traits equally Dargis also notes that Katniss is a female character with significant agency Katniss is a fantasy figure but partly what makes her powerful and I suspect what makes her so important to a lot of girls and women is that she s one of the truest feeling most complex female characters to hit American movies in a while She isn t passive she isn t weak and she isn t some random girl She s active she s strong and she s the girl who motivates the story Similarly Shelley Bridgeman of The New Zealand Herald wrote that because the characteristics of athleticism strength courageousness and prowess at hunting are not given to a male protagonist but to Katniss her character is an abrupt departure from the stereotypical depiction of women as being innately passive or helpless Mahvesh Murad of The Express Tribune said that the film s triumph is a young female protagonist with agency comparing her with Joss Whedon s Buffy Summers br The film has drawn varying interpretations for its political overtones including arguments in favor of left wing right wing and libertarian viewpoints Bob Burnett of The Huffington Post observed the film displays a general distrust of government regardless of the audience s political party affiliation Steven Zeitchik and Emily Rome in the Dallas Morning News also stated that some viewers formed an opinion about The Hunger Games as a parable of the Occupy Wall Street activity The Huffington Post reported that Penn Badgley a supporter of Occupy Wall Street saw the film as a social commentary on the movement Burnett also states that Collins doesn t use the terms percent and percent but it s clear that those in the Capitol are members of the percent and everyone in the Panem districts is part of the percent br Steven Zeitchik and Emily Rome in the Los Angeles Times and the Dallas Morning News reported that among other disparate interpretations some viewers saw The Hunger Games as a Christian allegory Jeffrey Weiss of Real Clear Religion published in the Star Tribune has remarked on what he saw as the intentional absence of religion in The Hunger Games universe and has commented that while the stories contain no actual religion people are find ing aspects that represent their own religious values within it br br Several critics compared The Hunger Games unfavorably to Kinji Fukasaku s Japanese film Battle Royale just as the novel had for its similarities to the novel it was based on by Koushun Takami Jonathan Looms of The Oxford Student argues that it is unfair that the film is only drawing comparisons with Battle Royale but that it is a veritable pastiche of other movies as well comparing it to The Truman Show Death Race the Bourne films and Zoolander and that it is common for artists to borrow from and improve on many sources Quentin Tarantino has built his career on this principle The Hunger Games is considered to be part of a wider battle royale genre which had earlier been defined by Battle Royale Prior to The Hunger Games the battle royale genre was largely limited to Japan where Battle Royale had inspired a wave of manga anime and visual novel works such as Gantz Higurashi When They Cry Future Diary Btooom Zero Escape and Danganronpa br Wheeler Winston Dixon a film professor at the University of Nebraska Lincoln listed several precedents Battle Royale Jackson s The Lottery William Golding s Lord of the Flies Metropolis Blade Runner Death Race and George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four Manohla Dargis in The New York Times compares it to Battle Royale Ender s Game and Twilight but contrasts The Hunger Games in terms of how its exciting female protagonist Katniss rescues herself with resourcefulness guts and true aim Steve Rose of The Guardian refers to the film as think Battle Royale meets The Running Man meets Survivor br Charles McGrath writing for The New York Times said that the film will remind viewers of the television series Survivor a little of The Bachelorette and of the short story The Lottery by Shirley Jackson published in by The New Yorker It reminded an author at Salon of the film The Most Dangerous Game The Hunger Games has also been conceptually compared to Robert Sheckley s short story Seventh Victim and its Italian film adaptation by Elio Petri The th Victim as the story and film feature a government endorsed televised in the film s case Big Hunt featuring contestants from around the world acting as hunters and victims Writing in The Atlantic Govindini Murty made a list of touchstones the film alludes to from the ancient Greek Roman and Egyptian civilizations to modern references such as the Great Depression the Vietnam and Iraq Wars and reality television For her part author Collins cites the myth of Theseus the modern Olympic Games reality television and coverage of the Iraq War as her inspiration br In while on Jimmy Kimmel Live Quentin Tarantino accused The Hunger Games of plagiarizing Battle Royale br br During the film s opening weekend controversial statements about various members of the cast arose sparking open dialogue about issues of racism sexism and unrealistic body image Comparisons were also made between The Hunger Games premise of children killing each other and the child soldiers of the Lord s Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony In a Jezebel article published March Dodai Stewart reported that several users on Twitter posted racist tweets criticizing the portrayals of Rue Thresh and Cinna by African American actors In a interview with Entertainment Weekly Collins stated that while she did not have any ethnic background in mind for lead characters Katniss and Gale because the book is written in a time period where hundreds of years have passed and there would be a lot of ethnic mixing she explains there are some characters in the book who are more specifically described and states that both Rue and Thresh are African American Lyneka Little of The Wall Street Journal states that although it is easy to find bigoted or offensive postings online the racist Hunger Games tweets because they are so shockingly ignorant even by the standards of the fringes of the internet have kicked up a storm br Fahima Haque of The Washington Post Bim Adewunmi of The Guardian and Christopher Rosen of The Huffington Post all reiterate the fact that Rue and Thresh are described in The Hunger Games as having dark brown skin as well as Collins s assertion that they were intended to be depicted as African Americans Adewunmi remarked that it comes to this if the casting of Rue Thresh and Cinna has left you bewildered and upset consider two things One you may be a racist congrats Two you definitely lack basic reading comprehension Mazel tov Erik Kain of Forbes saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech He states that while society may never be free of racism racist comments made on Facebook and Twitter quickly become public record Aggregations of these comments like the Jezebel piece expose people for what they are Sure many hide under the cloak of anonymity but many others cannot or choose not to And as the internet becomes more civilized and its denizens more accountable this sort of thing carries more and more weight Amandla Stenberg responded to the controversy with the following statement As a fan of the books I feel fortunate to be part of The Hunger Games family It was an amazing experience I am proud of the film and my performance I want to thank all of my fans and the entire Hunger Games community for their support and loyalty Dayo Okeniyi was quoted saying I think this is a lesson for people to think before they tweet and It s sad We could now see where society is today But I try not to think about stuff like that br br A number of critics expressed disappointment in Lawrence s casting as Katniss because her weight was not representative of a character who has suffered a life of starvation Manohla Dargis in her review of the film for The New York Times stated a few years ago Ms Lawrence might have looked hungry enough to play Katniss but now at her seductive womanly figure makes a bad fit for a dystopian fantasy about a people starved into submission Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said that in certain scenes Lawrence displays lingering baby fat These remarks have been rebuked by a number of journalists for pushing unrealistic body image expectations for women br L V Anderson of Slate states that j ust as living in a world with abundant calories does not automatically make everyone fat living in a dystopian world like Panem with sporadic food access would not automatically make everyone skinny Some bodies I daresay would be even bigger than Lawrence s Since none of Lawrence s male co stars have come under the same scrutiny Anderson concludes that complaints about Lawrence s weight are inherently sexist MTV asked for responses from audiences on the controversy and reported that most found criticism of Lawrence s weight misguided One response pointed to Collins s physical description of Katniss in The Hunger Games novel which reads I stand straight and while I m thin I m strong The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me Los Angeles Times writer Alexandra Le Tellier commented that T he sexist commentary along with the racist barbs made by so called fans are as stomach churning as the film s cultural commentary which in part shines a light on the court of public opinion and its sometimes destructive power to determine someone else s fate br br The film has been rated A by the British Board of Film Classification BBFC in the UK for intense threat moderate violence and occasional gory moments To achieve that rating Lionsgate had to cut or substitute seven seconds of film by digitally removing blood splashes and the sight of blood on wounds and weapons The uncut version was ultimately released on Blu ray in the UK with a certificate In the United States the film was granted a PG rating from the Motion Picture Association of America MPAA for intense violent thematic material and disturbing images all involving teens as Collins had originally anticipated br Screening of The Hunger Games was delayed indefinitely in Vietnam The film was to be released on March but according to a member of the Vietnamese National Film Board the Board considers the film to be too violent and unanimously voted for the indefinite delay It was later banned br br The Hunger Games received fifty one nominations and won twenty eight The song Safe Sound won a Grammy Award and
