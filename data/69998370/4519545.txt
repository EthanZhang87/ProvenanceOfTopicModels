Prescott will return in Scream VII with Kevin Williamson attached to direct the new upcoming sequel br br In a interview promoting the fifth Scream film Campbell described Sidney as a symbol of strength and a person who refuses to be a victim When asked about Sidney s cultural impact she inferred that the character offered significant meaning to fans She identified the fans who related to Sidney as being people who felt misunderstood and shut down some way in their life and had to push a glass ceiling or been subjected to bullying She expressed appreciation for the character s role as a symbol of resilience and hope for anyone who struggles with bullying especially in their youth and that her actions in the films give fans and audience goers the confidence that they can overcome br Like with Dawson s Creek Sidney s character was partly rooted in writer Kevin Williamson s own experiences Referring to her trust issues Williamson in a interview stated One of the things I ve wrestled with is trust and Sidney trusted no one he explains Did she really know her mother Is her boyfriend who he says he is In the end she wasn t even trusting herself He further commented on an LGBT allegory for the character stating the final girl trope spoke to Williamson s own sexuality He stated As a gay kid I related to the final girl and to her struggle because it s what one has to do to survive as a young gay kid too You re watching this girl survive the night and survive the trauma she s enduring Subconsciously I think the Scream movies are coded in gay survival br br Born in Sidney grows up an only child though Scream depicts a revelation that she is actually the secondborn child of Maureen Prescott n e Roberts following Roman Bridger Scott Foley nine years prior Sidney s residence in the fictional town of Woodsboro is known as Elm Street a nod to Scream director Wes Craven s previously directed horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street br The name of Sidney s childhood home Elm was given dialogue and visual confirmation in the fifth film Scream co director Matt Bettinelli Olpin stated that the first reference to this is Tara Carpenter Jenna Ortega s namecalling the address when referring to the Stab movie within a movie version of the character portrayed by Tori Spelling in Scream and later an additional scene in the fifth film depicts two characters driving down by the block as they enter Woodsboro Originally a scene scripted by Williamson and filmed by Craven in the original film cut this reference due to time constraints In the cut scene Sidney is shown typing out the address in writing during her distress call to the online system br The third film penned by Ehren Kruger introduces a future long term romance character for Sidney a homicide detective named Mark Kincaid portrayed by Patrick Dempsey He narrowly survives the third act saving Sidney from being stabbed after serving as a red herring in the film While initially intended to be brought back for Scream scheduling conflicts prevented this and thus the Sidney character was single in the film In a interview Campbell referred to the relationship as sort of pseudo love interests after working with Dempsey again In the fifth film Sidney s husband also has the name Mark and it was assumed to be the character portrayed by Dempsey two films prior This was confirmed by Bettinelli Olpin in a January interview Campbell admitted to being unaware that the husband named Mark was actually Dempsey s character br The fifth film reveals Sidney became a mother of three children between the events of the fourth and fifth films set ten years apart Her children with Dempsey s character include a newborn or toddler in a baby stroller as well as two school aged daughters that Sidney plans to take to school after she goes for an exercise run In the directors released the first draft written on March six months before filming began which describes the two daughters being aged six and eight years old In the first draft Mark and the children make an appearance Her third child however is absent from this first draft br br The role of Sidney Prescott was initially given to actress Drew Barrymore after Barrymore herself approached the production having read the script to request the role and was signed to the film before a director had even been found Wes Craven after being hired as director commented that he was able to have bigger actors in the film than his budget allowed because of Barrymore s desire to be involved which he believed helped attract other big names to the production While early development on the film took place however Barrymore s schedule commitments meant she was no longer able to remain in the demanding leading role but still wishing to take part she volunteered to play the smaller role of Casey Becker who dies early in the film with her scene being filmed in five days Following Barrymore s abdication of the role actresses Melissa Joan Hart Alicia Witt and Brittany Murphy auditioned for the part The production also offered the role to Reese Witherspoon although she ultimately never auditioned Molly Ringwald and Tori Spelling were also considered for the role It was Canadian actress Neve Campbell who was given the lead of Sidney Prescott after Craven saw her in the television series Party of Five believing she could best embody a character who was innocent but also able to handle herself while dealing with the demanding physicality and emotions of the role Campbell herself was reluctant to undertake a role in another horror film so soon after taking part in The Craft but agreed to Scream as it would be her first leading role and she adored the character saying She s a fantastic character for any kind of movie Campbell and her on screen boyfriend Skeet Ulrich had previously starred together in The Craft which they believed helped make their performance of the relationship between Sidney and Ulrich s character Billy Loomis more natural br On how she approached the leading role in the series Campbell stated br br I remember feeling insecure on the first film everybody around me was being goofy and funny and had all these great one liners and I seemed so stoic in some ways But I came to realize that if the audience couldn t see the movie through my eyes then they wouldn t see me at all They weren t going to feel it and weren t going to care So it was very important for me to remain reality based within the film because there had to be some source of reality for it to be good It was the same thing on the sequel br Kevin Williamson had submitted treatments for two possible sequels to Scream before the film was even released and so Campbell had been contracted for Scream when she signed on to the original film as she played the only character guaranteed to survive the film However scheduling became an issue for Campbell and the production as at the time she was still starring in Party of Five br For Scream Craven insisted that convincing Campbell and the other principal cast to return was not a problem but scheduling Campbell s availability with the film s production again became an issue with Campbell starring not only in Party of Five but three other feature films Her availability was limited enough that she was only available for days of filming which resulted in a significantly reduced role for her character and a shift in focus to Cox and Arquette s characters of Gale Weathers and Dewey Riley respectively br When production of Scream was announced nearly ten years after the last installment of the series Campbell initially refused offers to reprise her role as Sidney forcing early script drafts to be written in consideration of her absence while again shifting focus on to Cox and Arquette s roles However by September Campbell was confirmed as reprising her role in the film Early versions of Williamson s Scream script involved Campbell s character being attacked in the opening a key point of contention for Bob Weinstein head of Scream developer Dimension Films who had it removed br In September it was confirmed that Campbell would be reprising her role as Sidney Prescott for the fifth Scream film directed by Matt Bettinelli Olpin and Tyler Gillett She was initially apprehensive and hesitant to take the role given the death of Wes Craven however she was convinced to join once the new directors came to me with this beautiful letter saying that they ve become directors and love film because of these films and because of Wes and they really want to be true to his story and his journey with these films so I was really happy to hear that The film was released on January and earned widespread acclaim Campbell was lauded for her performance once more and she was particularly praised for her fresh take on the role of Prescott The Hollywood Reporter wrote that it s a pleasure to see Campbell again in fine form as Sidney striding back into Woodsboro to take care of unfinished business Elle magazine named her the Reigning Queen of Scream and stated that Sidney might not have that impact on people were it not for Campbell s portrayal rife with vulnerability intelligence and a palatable dose of humor br On June Campbell stated she would not be returning for Scream VI after contract and salary negotiations had stalled with Paramount Pictures she stated As a woman I have had to work extremely hard in my career to establish my value especially when it comes to Scream I felt the offer that was presented to me did not equate to the value I have brought to the franchise Campbell expanded on her statement a few weeks later saying she could not bear walking on set and feeling undervalued and that the offer would have been different had she been a man br br On her character of Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell spoke positively saying she adored the character and She s a fantastic character for any kind of movie In the Scream role won Campbell the Saturn Award for Best Actress and an MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance nomination The following year she went on to win the Best Female Performance for Scream and received a second Best Actress nomination from the Saturn Awards losing to Jodie Foster for Contact She received a third and final Best Female Performance nomination from MTV in for the character in Scream but lost to fellow Scream alum Sarah Michelle Gellar for Cruel Intentions br John Muir author of Wes Craven The Art of Horror praised the development of Sidney Prescott in Scream labeling her character amongst others beloved br Roger Ebert heavily critical of the cast and film of Scream singled out Campbell s role for praise saying The camera loves her She could become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute Harry Knowles of Ain t It Cool News was considerably less complimentary of Campbell saying She adds ZERO coolness Zero talent And Zero charisma to Scream br Bryan Enk and Adam Swiderski of UGO ranked Neve Campbell as the th greatest Scream Queen for her role as Sidney Prescott saying in the s Neve was pretty much the number one scream queen around br In its review of the fifth film Elle magazine said that Sidney might not have that impact on people were it not for Campbell s portrayal rife with vulnerability intelligence and a palatable dose of humor br br Laurie Strode br Nancy Thompson A Nightmare on Elm Street br Final girl
