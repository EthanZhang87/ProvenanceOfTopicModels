interrupt a border patrol sting They take one of the men attempting to cross the border who is an extraterrestrial in disguise named Mikey When he tries to attack one of the patrol officers K is forced to shoot him and erase the memories of everyone in the group creating a cover story of an explosion in an underground gas pipeline Deciding that he is too old to continue working D chooses to retire and has K erase his memory br NYPD officer James Darrell Edwards III catches an unnaturally agile fleeing criminal and sees his eyes blink unusually before he leaps from the roof of the Guggenheim Museum During his interrogation K arrives and scouts James as a potential new agent impressed by his ability to chase down an alien K explains to James that their organization the Men in Black was founded after first contact was made with aliens in at this time Earth was established as a politically neutral zone for alien refugees br The MIB is a secret organization that monitors and polices these aliens and uses neuralyzers to erase the memories of anyone who witnesses alien activities James agrees to join taking a new identity as Agent J and his civilian identity is erased from government records br Meanwhile an alien crash lands in upstate New York kills a farmer named Edgar and begins wearing his skin as a disguise J and K investigate the crash site and discover this alien is a Bug an extremely dangerous cockroach like species The Bug kills two disguised aliens who are sent to a city morgue overseen by coroner Laurel Weaver J and K inspect the bodies and J and Laurel accidentally opens the head of one revealing a small injured alien in a control cockpit The alien tells them To prevent war the galaxy is on Orion s belt before dying br K neuralyzes Laurel and tells J that the alien was Rosenberg a member of the Arquillian royal family They question an informant Frank the Pug who explains that Rosenberg was the guardian of a miniature galaxy that is a precious source of sub atomic energy the Bug killed Rosenberg to acquire it so the Bugs may destroy the Arquillians Frank also tells them that the galaxy is on Earth An Arquillian warship enters Earth s orbit issuing an ultimatum to MIB to give them the galaxy br J deduces the galaxy is in a jewel on the collar of Rosenberg s cat Orion which is in Laurel s care The Bug reaches the same conclusion and arrives at the morgue first it seizes and swallows the galaxy and flees with Laurel The Arquillians who are willing to destroy the galaxy rather than let the Bugs have it warn MIB that they will destroy Earth in one hour unless the galaxy is returned br With all other transports locked down J realizes the Bug s only escape is the observation towers of the New York State Pavilion at Flushing Meadows which was built for the New York World s Fair to disguise two real flying saucers The Bug attempts to take off but J and K shoot down the ship and the Bug sheds Edgar s skin to reveal its true much larger form It swallows J and K s guns and K goads it to swallow him as well The Bug begins to board the second ship but J steps on cockroaches from a dumpster to antagonize it stalling it until K finds his gun in its stomach and shoots it from inside The Bug is blown in half but attacks the two again until Laurel destroys it with J s gun br After recovering the galaxy from the Bug s remains K admits to J that he is ready to retire from MIB and has been training J as a replacement After bidding each other farewell J neuralyzes K creating a cover story that he was in a coma for years Laurel joins MIB as J s new partner Agent L br In the closing scene perspective pulls back across billions of light years revealing our Milky Way galaxy to be contained within a marble that an alien is using to play a game br br Tommy Lee Jones as Kevin Brown Agent K J s grizzled and humorless mentor The studio wanted Clint Eastwood for the part while Jones only accepted the role after Steven Spielberg promised the script would improve based on his respect for Spielberg s track record He had been disappointed with the first draft which he reportedly said stank feeling it did not capture the tone of the comic br Will Smith as James Darrell Edwards III Agent J A former NYPD detective newly recruited to the MIB Smith was cast because Barry Sonnenfeld s wife was a fan of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air Sonnenfeld also liked his performance in Six Degrees of Separation The studio preferred Chris O Donnell for the role fresh off his portrayal of Dick Grayson whom he played in Batman Forever and Batman Robin and Spielberg told Sonnenfeld to take him to dinner to convince him to do it However Sonnenfeld got him to not accept the role by saying that he was not a good director and that the script was one O Donnell should skip David Schwimmer also turned down the part Like Jones Smith said he accepted the role after meeting with Spielberg and cited his success as a producer br Linda Fiorentino as Dr Laurel Weaver Agent L A deputy medical examiner and later J s partner br Vincent D Onofrio as Edgar The Bug A farmer who is killed and eaten by a giant alien insect which then wears his skin in order to search for the Galaxy and incite a war from the Arquillians John Turturro and Bruce Campbell were both offered the role but they turned it down due to scheduling conflicts br Rip

smart talking pug like alien br Mark Setrakian as Rosenberg Alien br Brad Abrell Thom Fountain Carl J Johnson and Drew Massey as the Worm Guys A quartet of worm like aliens that work for Men in Black br br The film is loosely based on Lowell Cunningham and Sandy Carruthers s comic book The Men in Black Producers Walter F Parkes and Laurie MacDonald optioned the rights to The Men in Black in and hired Ed Solomon to write a very faithful script Parkes and MacDonald wanted Barry Sonnenfeld as director because he had helmed the darkly humorous The Addams Family and its sequel Addams Family Values However Sonnenfeld was attached to Get Shorty so they instead approached Les Mayfield best known for his remake of Miracle on th Street Mayfield was briefly attached before it fell through John Landis and Quentin Tarantino were asked to direct but each declined As a result Men in Black was delayed allowing Sonnenfeld to make it his next project after Get Shorty br Much of the initial script drafts were set underground with locations ranging from Kansas to Washington D C and Nevada Sonnenfeld decided to change the location to New York City because the director felt New Yorkers would be tolerant of aliens who behaved oddly while disguised terming the movie as The French Connection with aliens He also felt much of the city s structures resembled flying saucers and rocket ships One of the locations Sonnenfeld thought perfect for the movie was a giant ventilation structure for the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel which became the outside of the MIB headquarters br br Principal photography began in March Many last minute changes ensued during production First the scene where James Edwards was chasing a disguised alien was to be filmed at Lincoln Center but the New York Philharmonic decided to charge the filmmakers for using their buildings prompting Sonnenfeld to film the scene at the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum instead Then five months into the shoot Sonnenfeld decided that the original ending with a humorous existential debate between Agent J and the Bug was unexciting and lacking the action that the rest of the film had Five potential replacements were discussed One of these had Laurel Weaver being neuralyzed and K remaining an agent Eventually it boiled down to the Bug eating K and fighting J replacing the animatronic Bug Rick Baker s crew had developed with a computer generated Bug with an appearance closer to a cockroach The whole action sequence cost an extra million to the filmmakers br Further changes were made during post production to simplify the plotline involving the possession of the tiny galaxy The Arquillians would hand over the galaxy to the Baltians ending a long war The Bugs need to feed on the casualties and steal the galaxy in order to continue the war Through changing of subtitles the images on M I B s main computer and Frank the Pug s dialogue the Baltians were eliminated from the plot Earth goes from being potentially destroyed in the crossfire between the two races into being possibly destroyed by the Arquillians themselves to prevent the Bugs from getting the galaxy These changes to the plot were carried out when only two weeks remained in the film s post production but the film s novelization still contains the Baltians br br Production designer Bo Welch designed the MIB headquarters with a s tone in mind because that was when their organization was formed He cited influences from Finnish architect Eero Saarinen who designed a terminal at John F Kennedy International Airport As the arrival point of aliens on Earth Welch felt the headquarters had to resemble an airport br Rick Baker was approached to provide the prosthetic and animatronic aliens many of whom would have more otherworldly designs instead of looking humanoid For example the reveal of Gentle Rosenberg s Arquillian nature went from a man with a light under his neck s skin to a small alien hidden inside a human head Baker would describe Men in Black as the most complex production in his career requiring more sketches than all my previous movies together Baker had to have approval from both Sonnenfeld and Spielberg It was like Steven likes the head on this one and Barry really likes the body on this one so why don t you do a mix and match And I d say because it wouldn t make any sense Sonnenfeld also changed a lot of the film s aesthetic during pre production I started out saying aliens shouldn t be what humans perceive them to be Why do they need eyes So Rick did these great designs and I d say That s great but how do we know where he s looking I ended up where everyone else did only I took three months The maquettes built by Baker s team were later digitized by Industrial Light Magic which was responsible for the visual effects and computer generated imagery for more mobile digital versions of the aliens br br Two different soundtracks for the film were released a score soundtrack featuring music composed by Danny Elfman and an album of songs used in and inspired by the film featuring Will Smith s original song Men in Black based on the film s plot br Elfman s music was called rousing by the Los Angeles Times Variety called the film a technical marvel giving special credit to Elfman s always lively score Elfman was nominated for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score at the th Academy Awards for his score but lost to The Full Monty br Elfman recalled in how he was chosen to compose the soundtrack as strange He was on the set of The Frighteners with Peter Jackson when D Onofrio who was shooting Men In Black on the other set walked in and invited both men to watch him perform the final scene Then on the way home Elfman got a call from his agent saying that he was hired to compose the soundtrack even though there was no discussion about it prior br Elvis Presley s song Promised Land is featured in the scene where the MIB s car runs on the ceiling of Queens Midtown Tunnel br br

critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three and a half stars out of four praising the film as a smart funny and hip adventure film in a summer of car wrecks and explosions Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three stars out of four giving particular praise to the film s self reflective humor and Rick Baker s alien creature designs Janet Maslin reviewing for The New York Times wrote the film is actually a shade more deadpan and peculiar than such across the board marketing makes it sound It s also extraordinarily ambitious with all star design and special effects talent and a genuinely artful visual style As with his Addams Family films and Get Shorty which were more overtly funny than the sneakily subtle Men in Black Mr Sonnenfeld takes offbeat genre material and makes it boldly mainstream br Writing for Variety Todd McCarthy acknowledged the film was witty and sometimes surreal sci fi comedy in which he praised the visual effects Baker s creature designs and Elfman s musical score However he felt the film doesn t manage to sustain this level of inventiveness delight and surprise throughout the remaining two thirds of the picture Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film a C writing Men in Black celebrates the triumph of attitude over everything else plausibility passion any sense that what we re watching actually matters The aliens for all their slimy visual zest aren t particularly scary or funny they aren t allowed to become characters and so the joke of watching Smith and Jones crack wise in their faces quickly wears thin br John Hartl of The Seattle Times claimed the film is moderately amusing well constructed and mercifully short but it fails to deliver on the zaniness of its first half While he was complimentary of the film s first half he concluded somewhere around the midpoint they run out of energy and invention Even the aliens once they stop their shape shifting ways and settle down to appear as themselves begin to look familiar br br Men in Black won Best Makeup
