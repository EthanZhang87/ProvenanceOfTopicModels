br br br br br br br br br br br br Don Murphy was initially planning a G I Joe film adaptation but when the United States launched the invasion of Iraq in March Hasbro suggested adapting the Transformers franchise instead Tom DeSanto joined Murphy because he was a fan of the series They met with comic book writer Simon Furman and cited the Generation cartoon and comics as their main influence They made the Creation Matrix their plot device though Murphy had it renamed because of the film series The Matrix but was later used again in the sequel DeSanto chose to write the treatment from a human point of view to engage the audience while Murphy wanted it to have a realistic tone reminiscent of a disaster film The treatment featured the Autobots Optimus Prime Ironhide Jazz Prowl Arcee Ratchet Wheeljack and Bumblebee and the Decepticons Megatron Starscream Soundwave Ravage Laserbeak Rumble Skywarp and Shockwave br Steven Spielberg a fan of the comics and toys signed on as executive producer in John Rogers wrote the first draft which pitted four Autobots against four Decepticons and featured the Ark spaceship Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman fans of the cartoon were hired to rewrite the script in February Spielberg suggested that a boy and his car should be the focus This appealed to Orci and Kurtzman because it conveyed themes of adulthood and responsibility the things that a car represents in the United States The characters of Sam and Mikaela were the sole point of view given in Orci and Kurtzman s first draft The Transformers had no dialogue as the producers feared talking robots would look ridiculous The writers felt that even if it would look silly not having the robots speak would betray the fanbase The first draft also had a battle scene in the Grand Canyon Spielberg read each of Orci and Kurtzman s drafts and gave notes for improvement The writers remained involved throughout production adding additional dialogue for the robots during the sound mixing although none of this was kept in the final film which ran fifteen minutes shorter than the initial edit Furman s The Ultimate Guide published by Dorling Kindersley remained as a resource to the writers throughout production Prime Directive was used as a fake working title This was also the name of Dreamwave Productions first Transformers comic book br Michael Bay was asked to direct by Spielberg on July but he dismissed the film as a stupid toy movie Bay admitted that he was skeptical when he was offered to direct Nonetheless he wanted to work with Spielberg and gained a new respect for the concept upon visiting Hasbro Bay considered the first draft too kiddie so he increased the military s role in the story The writers sought inspiration from G I Joe for the soldier characters being careful not to mix the brands Orci and Kurtzman were concerned the film could feel like a military recruitment commercial so they chose to make the military believe nations like Iran were behind the Decepticon attack as well as making the Decepticons primarily military vehicles Bay based Lennox s struggle to get to the Pentagon phoneline while struggling with an unhelpful operator from a real account he was given by a soldier when working on another film br Orci and Kurtzman experimented with numerous robots from the franchise ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers to form the final cast Bay acknowledged that most of the Decepticons were selected before their names or roles were developed as Hasbro had to start designing the toys Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked Optimus Megatron Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender Bay also disliked her motorcycle form which he found too small An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped br Bay said the film cost million and explained My secret is I shoot very very fast Bay compared his way of working to James Cameron as they both work quickly and serve as their own assistant director Bay took a reduction in his fee to keep the production in Los Angeles and work with his usual crew Producers Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Ian Bryce said the film cost only million and called it a bargain compared to the other tentpole films that summer which cost as much as million According to Kim Masters of NPR instead of boasting about how much they had spent the studios did not want to admit to their real budget and risk further cost inflation on other projects and her Hollywood source said that the budget of Transformers had passed million br br The filmmakers created the size of each robot with the size of their vehicle mode in mind supporting the Transformer s rationale for their choice of disguise on Earth The concept of traveling protoforms was developed by Roberto Orci when he wondered why aliens who moonlight as vehicles need other vehicles to travel This reflected a desire to move to a more alien look away from the blocky Generation Transformers Another major influence in the designs was samurai armor returning full circle to the Japanese origins of the toy line The robots also had to look alien or else they would have resembled other cinematic robots made in the image of man br A product placement deal with General Motors supplied alternate forms for most of the Autobots which saved million for the production GM also provided nearly two hundred cars most of which were flood damaged or non salable destined for destruction in the climactic battle scene The U S Armed Forces provided significant support enhancing the film s realism the film features F s F s and V Ospreys the first time these aircraft were used for a film soldiers served as extras and authentic uniforms were provided for the actors A Thunderbolt IIs and Lockheed AC s also appear Captain Christian Hodge joked that he had to explain to his superiors that the filmmakers wanted to portray most of their aircraft as evil Decepticons however he remarked people love bad guys br br To save money for the production Bay reduced his usual fee by He planned an day shooting schedule maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set ups per day than usual Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada allowing him to work with a crew he was familiar with and who understood his work ethic A pre shoot took place on April and principal photography began three days later at Holloman Air Force Base which stood in for Qatar Due to their destruction later in the film by the Decepticon Blackout the majority of the military structures shown on screen were not property of Holloman Air Force Base but were purchased ahead of filming from a private manufacturer of military shelter systems AKS Military To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin ironically the village would be blown up The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft who improvised dialogue as if it were an actual battle br The company also shot at Hoover Dam and at the Pentagon the first time since the September attacks that film crews had been allowed at these locations The external Hoover Dam scenes were shot before tourists arrived daily at a m with shooting moving inside for the remainder of the day Production in California was based at Hughes Aircraft at Playa Vista where the hangar in which Megatron is imprisoned was built Six weekends were spent in Los Angeles California shooting the climactic battle with some elements being shot on the Universal Studios backlot and at Detroit s Michigan Central Station The crew was allowed to shoot at Griffith Observatory which was still closed for renovations begun in and would reopen in November Filming wrapped on October br The film has been found to re use footage from Bay s previous film Pearl Harbor br br Spielberg encouraged Bay to restrict computer generated imagery to the robots and background elements in the action sequences Stunts such as Bonecrusher smashing through a bus were done practically while cameras were placed into the midst of car crashes and explosions to make it look more exciting Work on the animatics began in April Bay indicated that three quarters of the film s effects were made by Industrial Light Magic while Digital Domain made the rest including the Arctic discovery of Megatron Frenzy s severed head a vending machine mutated by the Allspark and the Autobots protoforms Many of the animators were big Transformers fans and were given free rein to experiment a scene where Jazz attacks Brawl is a reference to a scene in Race for the Artifact where Brixler jumps on Skylion br br ILM created computer generated transformations during six months in looking at every inch of the car models Initially the transformations were made to follow the laws of physics but it did not look exciting enough and was changed to be more fluid Bay rejected a liquid metal surface for the characters faces instead going for a Rubik s Cube style of modeling He wanted numerous mechanical pieces visible so the robots would look more interesting realistic dynamic and quick rather than like lumbering beasts One such decision was to have the wheels stay on the ground for as long as possible allowing the robots to cruise around as they changed Bay instructed the animators to observe footage of two martial artists and numerous martial arts films to make the fights look graceful br Due to the intricate designs of the Transformers even the simplest motion of turning a wrist needs visible parts each of Ironhide s guns are made of ten thousand parts Bumblebee uses a piece below his face plate as an eyebrow pieces in his cheeks swivel to resemble a smile and all the characters eyes are designed to dilate and brighten According to Bay The visual effects were so complex it took a staggering hours for ILM to render just one frame of movement that meant ILM had to increase their processing facilities Each rendered piece had to look like real metal shiny or dull This was difficult to model because the aged and scarred robots had to transform from clean cars Close up shots of the robots were sped up to look cool but in wide shots the animation was slowed down to convincingly illustrate a sense of weight Photographs were taken of each set These were used as a reference for the lighting environment which was reproduced within a computer so the robots would look like they were convincingly moving there Bay who has directed numerous car commercials understood ray tracing was the key to making the robots look real the CG models would look realistic based on how much of the environment was reflecting on their bodies Numerous simulations were programmed into the robots so the animators could focus on animating the particular areas needed for a convincing performance br br Composer Steve Jablonsky who collaborated with Bay on The Island scored music for the trailers before work began on the film itself Recording took place in April at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City California The score including the teaser music uses six major themes across ninety minutes of music The Autobots have three themes one named Optimus to represent the wisdom and compassion of the Autobot leader and another played during their arrival on Earth The Decepticons have a chanted theme which relies on electronics unlike most of the score The AllSpark also has its own theme Hans Zimmer Jablonsky s mentor also helped to compose the score br br Transformers had its worldwide premiere at N Seoul Tower on June The film s June premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival used a live digital satellite feed to project the film on to a screen A premiere took place at Rhode Island on June which was a freely available event giving attendees the opportunity to buy tickets for to benefit four charities the Rhode Island Community Food Bank the Autism Project of Rhode Island Adoption Rhode Island and Hasbro Children s Hospital The film was released in IMAX on September with additional footage that had not been included in the general theatrical release br br Hasbro s toy line for the film was created

on June The line featured characters not in the film including Arcee A second wave titled AllSpark Power was set for release late which consisted of repaints and robotic versions of ordinary vehicles

companies to promote the film in countries Michael Bay directed tie in commercials for General Motors Panasonic Burger King and PepsiCo while props including the Camaro used for Bumblebee and the AllSpark were put up for charity sale on eBay A viral marketing alternate reality game was employed through the Sector website which presented the film and all previous Transformers toys and media as

s Todd Gilchrist called it Bay s best film and one of the few instances where it s OK to enjoy something for being smart and dumb at the same time mostly because it s undeniably also a whole lot of fun The Advertiser s Sean Fewster found the visual effects so seamless that you may come to believe the studio somehow engineered artificial intelligence The Denver Post s Lisa Kennedy praised the depiction of the robots as having a believably rendered scale and intimacy and ABC presenter Margaret Pomeranz was surprised that a complete newcomer to the Transformers phenomenon like myself became involved in the fate of these mega machines Ain t It Cool News s Drew McWeeny felt most of the cast grounded the story and that it has a real sense of wonder one of the things that s missing from so much of the big CGI light shows released these days Author Peter David found it ludicrous fun and said that Bay manages to hold on to his audience s suspension of disbelief long enough for us to segue into some truly spectacular battle scenes Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review giving it stars out of a possible writing It s goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is but to make that into an asset br Response to the human storylines was mixed The Hollywood Reporter s Kirk Honeycutt liked how a teen plotline gets tied in to the end of the world while Empire s Ian Nathan praised Shia LaBeouf as a smart natural comedian who levels the bluntness of this toy story with an ironic bluster Ain t It Cool News founder Harry Knowles felt Bay s style conflicted with Spielberg s arguing the military story only served as a distraction from Sam James Berardinelli hated the film as he did not connect with the characters

s Joshua Starnes felt the Transformers were completely believable right up to the moment they open their mouths to talk when they revert to bad cartoon characters Daily Herald s Matt Arado was annoyed that the Transformers are little more than supporting players and felt the middle act was sluggish CNN s Tom Charity questioned the idea of a film based on a toy and felt it would buzz its youthful demographic but leave the rest of us wondering if Hollywood could possibly aim lower br br Transformers fans were initially divided over the film due to the radical redesigns of many characters

until midway through the film Transformers comic book writer Simon Furman and Beast Wars script consultant Benson Yee both considered the film to be spectacular fun although Furman also argued that
