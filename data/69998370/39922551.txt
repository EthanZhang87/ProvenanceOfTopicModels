Lindsay Devlin Fox had approached the two directors who are part of the filmmaking collective Radio Silence based upon their short in the horror anthology V H S br Bettinelli Olpin and Gillett had been approached by several other companies for haunted house projects but chose to work on Devil s Due over the other projects because they felt that the script was a character based creepy mood piece that focused on the deteriorating relationship between its two main characters In an interview the directors said they focused on Zach Samantha s love story from day one and the horror of watching the person you love degenerate and being left helpless beyond continuing to love them unconditionally br The script had been pitched to them as a found footage take on Rosemary s Baby but the directors wanted to find ways to make their movie different from the film that they both praise and consider a personal favorite This included instilling a fun energy throughout and a sense of humor into the script br Along with Allison Miller Zach Gilford was announced to be in the film which was shot during April in the Dominican Republic New Orleans and Paris br Bettinelli Olpin and Gillett chose to shoot the film primarily with a Sony PMW EX which they chose so that the film s actors could carry it throughout the film The Canon D Canon Vixia HF G and an iPhone were also used in the production br br br Promotion br Fox released its first trailer for the film on October and a second trailer on December Whereas the initial marketing campaign focused the intimate thriller aspects of the McCalls love story later marketing concentrated specifically on the larger horror facets of the film br On January prior to the release of the film Fox promoted the movie by releasing a video of footage of an animatronic baby carriage and demon baby scaring passers by in New York City The video went viral shortly thereafter and has had over million views as of January br A collector s edition of the Blu Ray with cover art by Orlando Arocena was released in alongside MGM Fox horror films such as Carrie Joy Ride and Black Swan br br br Reception br Critical reception of Devil s Due was negative On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The film s consensus reads Derivative and mostly uninspired Devil s Due adds little to either the found footage or horror genres that it s content to mimic On Metacritic the film has a score of out of based on critics indicating generally unfavorable reviews br Much of the film s criticism centered upon the film s similarity to other films such as Rosemary s Baby and Paranormal Activity an element that Fearnet reviewer Scott Weinberg remarked was likely more due to decisions by the film s production company than anything else Weinberg called the movie a darkly passionate homage to Rosemary s Baby the similarities are both intentional and affectionate and Bloody Disgusting gave the film a favorable review praising the acting of its lead characters the sense of humor and drawing positive comparisons to the directors earlier work on V H S br However since initial release the film has found a cult following and director Eli Roth has been vocal in his support of the film and in a series of posts on his official Twitter account wrote Don t pre judge Devil s Due because Rosemary s Baby is a holy grail movie It s so smart creative inventive and fun Very very scary The guys at Radio Silence killed it Devil s Due is a legit scary smart horror film So many awesome scenes I loved it br br br Use of found footage br Common criticism aimed is at the film s use of the found footage technique and asks the question who assembled this footage The film s directors claimed that this was a deliberate choice stating that Audiences are way too smart to have the this is real found footage wool pulled over their eyes anymore and that much like Chronicle Devil s Due doesn t pretend to be footage that anyone has found or compiled it s simply a story told through cameras that exists in that world In that sense it s a bit of an experiment that we were able to have fun with and as the character s sic lives spiral out of control we re able to mirror that journey visually by shifting to different POVs The movie begins very bright very intimate and full of movement but as the watchers close in our couple we shifted to a lot more of the static cameras that exist in the world like the security cameras with much wider frames We hoped to use that distance and coldness to mirror the despair and hopelessness that was tearing the couple apart The film intentionally breaks many found footage conventions throughout including the deliberate absence of a framing device such as these tapes were found by the police the use of an animated opening quote a recognizable cast a non chronological narrative structure and a music cue becoming the end credits song br br br Soundtrack br The film contains diagetic music from Elvis Presley The Gaslight Anthem Alkaline Trio Brenton Wood Berlin General Public and Laura Stevenson br br br See also br br Rosemary s Baby br Inseminoid br The Ward br
