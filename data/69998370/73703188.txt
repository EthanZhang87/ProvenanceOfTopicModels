id: 73703188
From May to September the Writers Guild of America WGA representing screenwriters went on strike over a labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers AMPTP With a duration of days the strike is tied with the strike as the second longest labor stoppage that the WGA has performed only behind the strike days Alongside the SAG AFTRA strike which continued until November it was part of a series of broader Hollywood labor disputes Both strikes contributed to the biggest interruption to the American film and television industries since the COVID pandemic br The lack of ongoing film and television productions resulted in some studios having to close doors or reduce staff The strike also jeopardized long term contracts created during the media streaming boom big studios could terminate production deals with writers through force majeure clauses after days saving them millions of dollars In addition numerous other areas within the global entertainment ecosystem were impacted by the strike action including the VFX industry and prop making studios Following a tentative agreement union leadership voted to end the strike on September On October the WGA membership officially ratified the contract with of WGA members voting in favor of it Its combined impact with the SAG AFTRA strike resulted in the loss of jobs and an estimated billion loss to the economy of Southern California br br One of the main focus points in the labor dispute is the residuals from streaming media the WGA claims that AMPTP s share of such residuals has cut much of the writers average incomes compared to a decade ago Writers also wanted artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT to be used only as a tool that can help with research or facilitate script ideas and not as a tool to replace them The COVID pandemic and its aftermath saw major reductions in the workforce and cancellations of multiple film and television productions to save money on basic residuals and music licensing costs though Apple and Amazon remained outliers The ensuing fall of Peak TV created worsening conditions for writers as well as actors br On May the latest Minimum Basic Agreement MBA became the collective bargaining agreement that covered most of the work done by WGA writers The Minimum Basic Agreement was an agreement that established a minimum wage for television and film writers In television the Minimum Basic Agreement only applied to those who wrote for broadcast television shows and not for streaming television This was very clear when comparing late night talk shows that were produced for broadcast television such as The Late Show with Stephen Colbert by CBS versus The Problem with Jon Stewart produced for streaming by Apple TV The writers who worked for The Problem were not covered by the MBA and therefore had to negotiate individually with the streaming company for their pay and as a result they were paid less than writers who wrote for The Late Show while doing the same amount of work This pattern held true with other shows in the two categories The MBA expired on May br The WGA estimated that its proposals would yield writers about US million a year whereas the AMPTP s offer would yield million br One disputed issue is the Guild wanting requirements for mandatory staffing and duration of employment terms to be added to their contract which would require all shows to be staffed with a minimum number of writers for a minimum amount of time whether needed or not per the AMPTP br Another important proposal that the WGA is advocating for is to ensure each member of a writing team receives their own pension and their own health care funds The AMPTP rejected this proposal and did not offer a counterproposal At the same time there was a tentative agreement between the WGA and AMPTP to have of negotiated minimums for all WGA minimums shifted into pensions and health funds br br On April of members of the Writers Guild of America WGA voted to go on strike if they failed to reach a satisfactory agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers AMPTP which represents the major film and television studios in Hollywood by May The AMPTP engaged in lengthy negotiations with the WGA on behalf of Amazon Studios as well as MGM Holdings Apple Studios Lionsgate NBCUniversal Netflix Paramount Global Sony Pictures the Walt Disney Company and Warner Bros Discovery WBD but failed to reach a deal before the mandated deadline br br As a result the leadership of the Writers Guild of America West WGAW and Writers Guild of America East WGAE unanimously approved a strike on the eve of May the first of its kind since the strike fifteen years prior br The Hollywood Reporter reported that the WGA had set some prospective rules for writers during the strike The Writers Guild stated that writers cannot do any writing revising pitching or discussing future projects with companies that are members of the AMPTP br The Writers Guild also stated that fiction podcasts that are produced by companies against which the Guild and its members are striking must stop production The Guild said that they hoped that writers of animated series not covered by the Writers Guild but by the Animation Guild would seek advice from the Writers Guild on whether or not their work as a writer was counter to the activities of the strike and if so to cease such work for the duration of the strike The Guild noted that while they cannot punish non Guild writers who write for companies against which the union is striking they promise to bar such writers from future Guild membership br The WGA instructed members to begin picketing on May at p m PDT Some places that the WGA has picketed include AMC Networks

violence seriously and investigate them thoroughly As we continue to investigate we have sent home the individual involved The WGA also released a statement which read Workers should not be threatened with physical harm when exercising their right to publicly protest and picket against unfair wages and working conditions br br On July Deadline Hollywood reported that the AMPTP and the major Hollywood studios did not plan to return to negotiations with the WGA until late October at the earliest The studio executives who anonymously spoke with Deadline stated that by October many writers would be financially strained to the point where they would lose their housing which they believed would allow them to be in a better position to dictate the terms of any new deal Representatives for the AMPTP distanced themselves from the anonymous sources claiming they remained committed to signing a deal as soon as possible br br On August the WGA announced that it would meet with the AMPTP on the following Friday to discuss negotiations regarding the strike The location of the meeting was not disclosed A spokesman for the AMPTP speaking in relation to the strikes of the WGA and SAG AFTRA

are willing to negotiate on proposals that the AMPTP has presented to the public as deal breakers and that they have asked them to leave the AMPTP in order to negotiate independently with the WGA A few hours later the AMPTP released a statement refuting that claim saying The AMPTP member companies are aligned and are negotiating together to reach a resolution Any suggestion to the contrary is
