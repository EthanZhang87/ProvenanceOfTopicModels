id: 4288756
Ghostface alternatively stylized as Ghost Face or GhostFace is a fictional identity that is adopted by the primary antagonists of the Scream franchise The figure was originally created by Kevin Williamson and is primarily mute in person but voiced over the phone by Roger L Jackson regardless of who is behind the mask as all killers use a voice changer utilizing that exact voice starting in person with Scream The disguise has been adopted by various characters in the movies and in the third season of the television series br Ghostface debuted in Scream as a disguise used by teenagers Billy Loomis Skeet Ulrich and Stu Macher Matthew Lillard during their killing spree in the fictional town of Woodsboro The mask was a popular Halloween costume created and designed by Fun World costume company before being chosen by Marianne Maddalena and Craven for the film The identity is used primarily as a disguise for the antagonists of each film to conceal their identities while conducting serial murders and as such has been portrayed by several actors br In the Scream universe the costume is not unique and is easily obtainable allowing others to wear a similar outfit Ghostface often calls their targets to taunt or threaten them while using a voice changer that hides their true identity In Scream this is taken further when Ghostface uses a device that enables him to sound like several other characters in order to manipulate targets The changing identity of the person beneath the mask means that Ghostface has no definite motivation ranging from revenge and seeking fame to peer pressure In the first three movies each killer shares the common goal of killing Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell due to a chain of events that started when Sidney s estranged half brother Roman Bridger Scott Foley told Billy his father had had an affair with Sidney s mother Maureen Lynn McRee In the fourth movie Sidney s cousin is jealous of Sidney s notoriety and plans to kill her so she too can become famous In the fifth and sixth films the focus shifts to Billy s daughter Samantha Sam Carpenter Melissa Barrera and her half sister Tara Jenna Ortega who are targeted due to their connection to Billy In these later installments the new Ghostface killers have motives that may sometimes be connected to the in universe Stab film series loose adaptations of the tell all books about previous Ghostface killings by Gale Weathers Courteney Cox with Sam also assuming the Ghostface mantle herself in the sixth film in order to kill the mastermind Ghostface other new killers would often be family members of previous Ghostfaces seeking revenge for the death of their own loved ones br The Ghostface persona remains the same throughout the Scream series featuring a black hood and cloak with a jagged base and a white rubber mask resembling a ghost with an anguish expression Though each iteration of Ghostface is human they often exhibit extreme durability against physical harm high levels of physical strength and an almost supernatural stealth ability able to appear and disappear in seemingly impossible situations The character has become a popular culture icon since its inception referenced in film and television as well as spawning a series of action figures and merchandise as well as parodies and titular spoofs br In the television series Scream Ghostface is adapted as the Lakewood Slasher who appeared in the series for the first two seasons and the Shallow Grove Slasher who appeared in the Halloween special episodes of the second season both are voiced by Mike Vaughn with a different mask due to copyright issues The original Ghostface persona returned in Scream Resurrection once again voiced by Roger L Jackson replacing Vaughn In the movies Ghostface has appeared in all entries to date returning most recently in Scream VI with Jackson reprising his role now credited as The Voice br br br Appearances br br br Films br br Ghostface first

Billy cites his motivation as abandonment by his mother brought about by his father s affair with Maureen while Stu cites peer pressure As the two killers reveal their plan to frame Sidney s father for their killing spree reporter Gale Weathers Courteney Cox suddenly appears and attempts to shoot them with their gun only for Billy to knock her out and prepare to kill her only to suddenly realize

who then finishes Billy off with a bullet to the head citing the fact that They ALWAYS come back a common horror clich and now her catchphrase This is most likely one of the many tropes taught to her by Randy Meeks who is obsessed with horror and openly lists these clich s earlier in the film during a party br Ghostface s second appearance was in Scream where it was again used as a disguise by the main antagonists A series of murders occur at Windsor College Sidney s current location with the initial victims sharing names with Billy and Stu s victims from Scream The killers again taunt Sidney

film within a film based on Sidney and her experiences with Ghostface while leaving images of Maureen at the crime scenes to draw Sidney out of seclusion Ghostface is revealed as Sidney s half brother film director Roman Bridger Scott Foley born to their mother Maureen during a two year period when she moved to Hollywood to become an actress under the name Rina Reynolds After being gang raped and impregnated at a party she gave Roman up for adoption Roman sought her out years later only to be rejected telling him that he s Rina s child Roman began stalking Maureen and filming her relationships with other men including Hank Loomis He used this footage to reveal to Billy why his mother had abandoned him before convincing him to kill Maureen sparking the chain of events in Scream and Scream As Roman rants on his motive and desire to frame and kill Sidney for stealing the life she took from him Sidney shuts him up saying that she s heard those rants before from other killers and that he simply kills people because he chose to provoking an enraged Roman into fighting Sidney which she eventually wins by outsmarting Roman and stabbing him in the back and chest while Gale and Dewey Riley David Arquette arrive shortly after and discover his identity ruining Roman s plans of framing Sidney for his crimes A defeated Roman briefly connects with Sidney by holding her hand but then attempts to attack once more Dewey manages to ultimately kill Roman with Sidney s help ending the series of murders based on his revenge against Maureen br In the director s commentary the Stab Sidney Prescott actress Angelina Tyler Emily Mortimer is revealed to have been a second killer and Roman s lover with the scenes revealing her survival and true allegiances after apparently being killed by Ghostface having been cut Wes Craven elaborated that an earlier scene in the film where Sidney came across Angelina wearing Ghostface gear in her dressing room which Angelina had passed off as still wearing due to just having come off of set was Sidney unknowingly actually having caught Angelina in the act of changing into her Ghostface gear furthermore leaving it ambiguous as to whether or not Angelina was actually dead or could return in the subsequent Scream Trilogy box set booklet Angelina is not listed among the deceased characters after the events of Scream However this is contradicted in a scene in Scream VI listing Roman Bridger as the only Ghostface in the Hollywood killings Ghostface is also voiced by Foley Schreiber Lynn McRee Campbell Cox Arquette Beth Toussaint and Ulrich via a voice changer used to impersonate them br In Scream another Ghostface killer emerges in Woodsboro on the th anniversary of the massacre conducted by Billy and Stu the new killer recreates events from the

Sidney has survived An enraged Jill makes a desperate attempt to kill Sidney but is stalled by Dewey Gale and Judy Hicks Marley Shelton long enough for Sidney to electrocute her on the head with a defibrillator saying that Jill forgot the first rule of remakes Don t fuck with the original An injured Jill attempts to stab Sidney with a piece of broken glass in a last ditch attempt to finish her off but Sidney anticipates this and shoots Jill through the heart finally killing her while Jill s status as the sole surviving hero ultimately becomes short lived br In Scream years after the

commit a killing spree in the hopes of inspiring a real life requel half reboot half sequel of the franchise believing they re real fans that can save the Stab franchise by restoring it to its normal

died cowardly and pleading for his life In the ensuing fight Tara seriously wounds Ethan by stabbing him in the mouth and Sam kills Quinn by shooting her in the head while Bailey is knocked unconscious When he wakes up Bailey finds himself receiving a phone call from Ghostface who taunts him over his motives and soon emerges to attack causing Bailey to immediately become frightened and

br Despite being absent in the first and second seasons Ghostface made an appearance in the third season of the anthology television slasher series Scream The season titled Scream Resurrection premiered on VH on July In this season the killers are revealed in the episode Endgame Beth Giorgia Whigham and Jamal Jay Elliot Tyga who is the older half brother of main character Marcus Elliot RJ Cyler br br br Video games br Ghostface is featured as a killer in the asymmetrical multiplayer survival horror game Dead by Daylight voiced by Filip Ivanovic He was added in the Ghost Face DLC released on June under the alias The Ghost Face In the game Ghostface s real identity is Danny Johnson known by the pseudonym Jed Olsen a narcissistic freelancer newspaper journalist in the fictional town of Roseville Florida who covers the Ghostface murders by day and commits them by night This version of Ghostface is an original character who was created exclusively for the game and has no relation to the Scream franchise This is because the developers were only able to acquire the license for the Scream mask which is separate from the one for the character as the films used a pre existing mask Players can access different styles of the mask for Ghostface in Dead by Daylight br Ghostface appears as a playable operator in Season Six of Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War and Call of Duty Warzone Roger L Jackson reprises his role as the voice of Ghostface br In April Ghostface was added in an update as a free playable skin for a limited time in the online multiplayer social deduction game Among Us br br br Concept and creation br br The Ghostface costume is the outfit worn by the main antagonists of the Scream franchise consisting of a rubber white mask with black eyes nose and mouth and black cloth like material a hooded robe with faux tatters draping from the arms and a spiked trim to the base of the outfit In the movie the costume is considered common and easily purchasable making identifying the buyers difficult and creating the possibility for anyone to be the killer br The Ghostface mask was first developed for novelty stores during the Halloween season between and by Fun World as part of a series entitled Fantastic Faces the mask itself known as The Peanut Eyed Ghost with the final design approved by Fun World vice President Allan Geller the design was adapted from a wailer ghost mask created by Alterian Inc artist Loren Gitthens in and Craven claimed to have originally found the mask but later clarified that he had misremembered the event and that it was producer Marianne Maddalena who discovered it She found it while inside a house during location scouting for the film and brought it to the attention of Craven who set about trying to obtain the rights to use it Fun World licensing director R J Torbert joined Fun World in and was given the task of naming the mask prior to its film debut deciding on GhostFace with the blessing of Fun World owners Stanley and Allan Geller Torbert felt it looked like a ghost in pain believing it to be a unique design The Ghostface design and title are owned by Fun World br The design of the mask bears reference to Edvard Munch s painting The Scream the film poster to Pink Floyd s The Wall the ghostly characters that appeared in the s Betty Boop cartoons and Season Scooby Doo Where Are You ghosts in the episode A Night Of Fright Is No Delight The mask is stark white and depicts a caricature of someone screaming and crying at the same time Designer Sleiertin stated that the mask displayed different emotions It s a horrible look it s a sorry look it s a frantic look Since the appearance of Ghostface in Scream the costume has become the most worn and sold costume for Halloween in the United States br The initial script labeled the main antagonist as masked killer with no specifications to its appearance forcing Craven and his staff to produce the costume eventually worn by Ghostface as they were shooting Craven asked Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger of design company KNB Effects to produce a mask specifically for the film based on the Fun World design but did not like the final result After Fun World and Dimension Films were able to complete an agreement for the use of the Ghostface mask Craven was able to use the original design as he wanted The custom mask made by KNB Effects still appears in the scenes involving the murders of Casey Becker and Principal Himbry as filming of these scenes completed prior to the finalization of the deal between Fun World and Dimension Films br br The Fantastic Faces edition of the mask used in Scream is made of thin white rubber with blackened eyes nose and mouth Despite being fictionally a character in the movie cast in the first second and fourth films the costume was most often worn by stunt performer Dane Farwell who gave the character specific characteristics such as cleaning the knife after killing also giving the stature and a unique movement to the character In the first film Craven wore the costume during the opening murder scene where the character is struck by a phone and by Ulrich only once during a finale scene where the character prepares to murder Randy Despite Stu wearing the costume in the film actor Lillard never actually wore the outfit Scream features a slightly redesigned version of the mask from the Fearsome Faces line possessing slightly altered eyes and an indented chin Following Scream the Ghostface mask became part of the Ghostface line of masks featuring several variations of the design including glow in the dark models The plain white version of the Ghostface line mask is used in Scream by Bridger Another edition of the mask was developed for use by Ghostface in Scream dubbed The Deluxe Edition Mask again similar to the original Ghostface design but constructed of thicker rubber with a pearlescent finish br Following the description in Williamson s script of a ghost mask Craven and designers had originally intended to use a white motif creating a white cloak and hood for the killer s costume It was the intervention of Maddalena who felt that the cloak would be scarier if it was black that resulted in the dark costume shown on screen The cloak itself had to be custom made for the film as the Father Death outfit identified in Scream as that of the killers did not really exist the Fun World mask was sold only as a stand alone item The cloak entered into retail markets only following the release of Scream Each cloak was estimated to cost to hand produce by a seamstress and was made of a heavy thick black material with reflective threads woven throughout creating a subtle glimmer The cloak was created to help conceal the identity of the killers by covering most of their visible bodies as it was believed that otherwise audiences would be able to guess which character was involved by his or her clothing and body shape br The knife used by Ghostface in the films is a custom prop knife based on the Buck Hunting Knife The knife blades are made of aluminum or chrome paint coated plastic with a rubber handle depending on the scenario for which they are needed The handle is black with a silver metallic appearance for the tip The Buck knife was chosen as the model for the Ghostface weapon because of the large blade it features br br br Characterization br Ghostface is rarely depicted as speaking while physically on screen in order to aid in concealing the identity of the character behind the mask Exceptions to this are grunts and groans when injured which are dubbed into the film during the editing phase by Jackson Ghostface only speaks physically on screen on four occasions in the series on the first two occasions it is just before his true identity is revealed the third occasion is the hospital scene in Scream the fourth occasion is the opening sequence in Scream VI The voice given to the character provided by Jackson is used when talking to another character over the phone or to display the use of the voice changer when the killer reveals himself Despite being portrayed by different characters in each film Ghostface displays similar personality and physical attributes regardless of who is wearing the costume or speaking to a target such as taunting his victims over the telephone the ritualistic cleaning of his knife after a kill slashing the throat of his victims before killing them by stabbing almost superhuman strength and durability and grunts and groans when injured br Ghostface is first referred to by that name in the first movie when character Tatum Riley played by Rose McGowan calls the masked killer Mr Ghostface prior to her death br br Ghostface is often shown to taunt his targets initially representing himself as charming and even flirtatious when speaking His conversations turn confrontational and intimidating using his knowledge of other characters or graphically describing his intentions before appearing to the target physically Craven considers Jackson s voice performance as Ghostface to have evil sophistication When confronting his intended victim Ghostface is portrayed in varying ways sometimes quick and efficient and other times clumsy falling or colliding with objects that hinder his pursuit a characteristic that varies based upon who is wearing the costume Whoever inhabits the costume Ghostface taunts its victims and prolongs a kill when it appears to have an advantage The Billy Stu Ghostface would gut its victims after killing them this was not performed on Tatum Riley who was killed in a mechanical garage door This Ghostface in particular would ask its victim questions about horror films and employ the tropes of the genre in its attacks displaying a detachment from reality and aligned with the same self awareness of the film itself which toys with the expectations of the horror genre The second Ghostface created by Mickey and Mrs Loomis would repeatedly stab its victim to death but often in a public place or with witnesses The third Ghostface created by Roman preferred more clean kills with precise stabbings and used theatricality and movie props to attack his victims using a voice changer that allowed him to sound like many other people casting suspicion and doubt on other characters In addition he would use images and the synthesized voice of Maureen to specifically taunt Sidney even shrouding himself in a bloodied crime scene cover alluding to the murder of Maureen to fool Sidney into believing that she was losing her sanity The fourth Ghostface created by Jill and Charlie filmed each murder on web cameras hidden around the environment and spy cameras in its mask Charlie mostly repeatedly stabbed his victims to death in a more vicious and brutal fashion and would go further and gut them if he wanted while Jill mostly stabbed only once The two killers also made some of the murders public to gain the attention of the world press The fifth Ghostface created by Richie and Amber mainly focused on brutally attacking and injuring victims while killing most of them in a swift manner The sixth Ghostface created by Richie s family committed violent murders and attacks on either the ones close to Sam Carpenter or anyone standing in the way while leaving the masks of previous Ghostface killers at the scene of the crime afterwards br The motivations for Ghostface s killing vary in each film and are respective to each killer wearing the costume Billy claimed to have been driven to insanity by his mother s abandonment an incident he blamed on Maureen and after taking his revenge on her chose to continue his spree leading towards her daughter Sidney while Stu lists peer pressure as his motivation In Scream Mrs Loomis cites her motivation as simple revenge against the person she holds responsible for her son s death while Mickey desires the fame that his involvement in the killings will garner when he is caught In Scream Roman seeks revenge for what he sees as his mother s rejection and abandonment by engineering Maureen s death and trying to kill Sidney seeing her as having the family life he was denied In Scream Jill jealous of Sidney wished to obtain similar fame as the sole survivor of a new massacre while Charlie aided her both for those reasons and his love for Jill In Scream Richie and Amber who are shown to be extremely toxic fans of the Stab franchise start a huge killing spree in an effort to inspire a ninth Stab film that goes back to the franchise s old formula having hated the eighth film which was written and directed by Rian Johnson for its new storytelling elements that stepped away from the old formula In Scream VI Detective Wayne Bailey and his son and daughter Ethan and Quinn who are revealed to be Richie s family desire to get revenge on the one who killed Richie by assassinating her character and framing her for a new killing spree br In costume the Ghostfaces share a ritualistic mannerism of gripping the blade of its knife between thumb and forefinger and wiping it clean of any blood following a murder by drawing its hand from handle to the tip of the knife This characteristic was given to the character by stuntman Dane Farwell who wore the costume for many of its scenes in Scream Each killer is depicted as possessing effective physical abilities such as the capabilities of nearly flawless stealth prowling without being detected moving silently and efficiently vanishing from its targets defense Additionally the killer tends to display sufficient strength that allows them to overpower victims such as in Scream in regards to defeating two trained detectives single handedly Ghostface is shown to be able to sustain and even ignore severe levels of physical damage surviving blunt trauma stabbing wounds and gunshots While Stu Mrs Loomis Charlie Richie Quinn and Wayne were all killed instantly in one blow Billy Mickey Roman Jill Amber and Ethan despite having sustained severe injuries prior all survived to make one final desperate attack before finally being killed by the heroes br br br Cultural impact br br McFarlane Toys produced a inch figurine of Ghostface in for the Movie Maniacs II series of horror and science fiction inspired line of character models A series of figures were produced by NECA for Scream featuring the standard mask and black cowl plus variations such as Zombie Ghostface with a decayed appearance on the mask and Scarecrow Ghostface with brown burlap material used for the mask and clothing br Ghostface has been parodied and referenced numerous times in media following his appearance in the Scream franchise most prominently in the parody film Scary Movie where a killer dressed as Ghostface commits a series of murders However unlike the original film the killer is revealed to be a single person this parodic version of Ghostface later appears in the June Erma comic strip named Prank Call wherein the character is making prank calls whilst quoting Scream alongside the series titular character In the parody film Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the th a killer wearing a Jason Voorhees style hockey mask is set on fire his mask melting to resemble that of Ghostface The film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back features Ghostface as Shannen Doherty and Craven

edition representing iconic characters of the s alongside Dennis Rodman and the character Rose from the film Titanic A parody of Ghostface appears in the television series All Grown Up episode Interview with a Campfire where Lil DeVille is taunted by phone and stalked by a character wearing an Easter Bunny mask br The character appears briefly in The Simpsons episode Home Away from Homer where Homer Simpson suggests him as a babysitter for his daughter Maggie Simpson Roger L Jackson lends his voice to Ghostface in the Robot Chicken episode That Hurts Me alongside other famous film killers in a show that parodies Big Brother launching a prank war against Pinhead and Freddy Krueger before giving a speech to save himself from elimination from the show He is referenced by Kenny Powers the main character of Eastbound Down who requests to wear the mask while having sex In Scream XXX A porn parody a new Ghostface wearing a clown variant of the Father Death mask begins murdering the cast and crew of an in production pornographic parody of the Stab series In another porn parody the gay movie Moan the version of Ghostface seen in the film does not wear a mask Instead he has a hood and facepaint that resembles the mask presembly this change was made to help make the movie more erotic br In his book Going to Pieces The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film Adam Rockoff opined that Ghostface s mask was a striking surreal and downright terrifying presence Calling the mask a hyperbolic rendering of Edvard Munch s The Scream Rockoff wrote that the face is twisted in an exaggerated almost mocking grin as if reflecting the look of terror and surprise on his victims faces Tony Magistrale also discussed the similarities between Ghostface s mask and The Scream in his book Abject Terrors Surveying the Modern and Postmodern Horror Film stating that the painting an apt representation of the degree of alienation from other people inspires the killers murderous agenda
