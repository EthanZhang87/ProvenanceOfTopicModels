trilogy finds its footing in this much more exciting and purposeful second chapter Todd McCarthy of Hollywood Reporter wrote that Nearly everything represents an improvement over the first instalment of Peter Jackson s three part adaptation of J R R Tolkien s beloved creation He also praised the High Frame Rate of The Desolation of Smaug as being better than that of An Unexpected Journey Mark Hughes who reviewed the film for Forbes was highly enthusiastic and felt The Desolation of Smaug is another grand entry in the Tolkien saga raising the emotional and physical stakes while revealing more of the sinister forces before concluding It s pleasing to see a filmmaker this in love with storytelling this committed to creating entire worlds that s a rare thing indeed and for it to turn out so well is even more rare It s a sight to behold and you won t be sorry you did br Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian scored the film four stars out of five writing It s mysterious and strange and yet Jackson also effortlessly conjures up that genial quality that distinguishes The Hobbit from the more solemn Rings stories Total Film also scored the film four stars out of five but reviewer Matt

s a lot to admire in The Desolation of Smaug Jim Vejvoda who reviewed the film for IGN awarded it out of and felt It s a breathlessly told action packed crowd pleaser that restores the luster of the

stars out of four He felt it was a little less long and a little less boring than the first instalment and offered praise for the depiction of Smaug saying as a digital creation Smaug is a bloody wonder of slithering fright He was however very critical of the film s padding of a slender novel but concluded I d endure another slog through Middle Earth just to spend more time with Smaug Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph was even less admiring and awarded it two stars out of five He too criticised the decision to turn Tolkien s book into three films and felt Jackson is mostly stalling for time two or three truly great sequences tangled up in long beards and longer pit stops He continued writing There is an awful lot of Desolation to wade through before we arrive weary and panting on Smaug s rocky porch and disapproved of the introduction of a love triangle to Tolkien s narrative adding Maybe this really is what a lot of people want to see from a film version of The Hobbit but let s at least accept that Tolkien would probably not have been among them br br Official website br The Hobbit Blog Official blog of The Hobbit movies br The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug at IMDb br The
