attended by Sidney Prescott and her friends He disciplines several students for wearing Ghostface masks and comforts Sidney after she narrowly escapes the killer While in his office he is attacked by Ghostface and is stabbed to death His body was said to have been discovered hanging up on the school s goalposts br Scream producer Bob Weinstein had Himbry s death added to the movie after he realized that the film had pages of script without a death occurring By chance this gave writer Kevin Williamson a reason for the teenagers to leave Stu Macher s party during the film s finale a plot point Williamson had been struggling to formulate The language used by Himbry and his aggressive actions towards the students were among several reasons why the film s production was forced to leave Santa Rosa High School the school board found the film s content unacceptable and did not want it filmed there br br br Billy Loomis br Portrayed by Skeet Ulrich br Appeared in Scream Scream hallucination Scream VI hallucination br William Billy Loomis is a Woodsboro teenager the boyfriend of Sidney Prescott and best friend of Stu Macher He is also an avid fan of horror films Following a series of murders Billy becomes a suspect when he is found at Sidney s house with a cellphone shortly after she is taunted on the phone and attacked by a masked killer Evidence is discovered that points to other characters and Billy is removed as a suspect During a party at Stu Macher s home Billy and Sidney are reconciled and have sex before Billy is stabbed by Ghostface Later after a series of attacks Billy is revealed to be alive and tries to help Sidney obtaining in the process a gun which he then uses to shoot Randy Meeks Billy then reveals himself to be the killer having feigned the injury in the first place with Stu confessing to be Billy s accomplice The pair also admit to having murdered Sidney s mother Maureen Prescott one year previously after she had an affair with Billy s father causing Billy s parents to divorce and his mother to abandon him Billy and Stu s plan to frame Sidney s father for their killing spree ultimately backfires when Sidney manages to escape and calls the police on them while taunting Billy and Stu with a phone call leaving Billy shocked and enraged Despite his desperate attempts to kill Sidney Billy is ultimately beaten by both her and reporter Gale Weathers and finally dies after Sidney shoots him in the head br In Scream Billy s mother seeks revenge on Sidney for Billy s death In Scream Roman Bridger reveals that he provided Billy the evidence of his father s affair and gave him advice on how to kill Maureen In Scream it is revealed that Billy cheated on Sidney during the events of the first film fathering a daughter named Sam

revealed by Billy Loomis and Stu who are Casey s Ghostface killers that even if she answered correctly they would have killed her anyway In Stab the fictional film within a film based on the murders Casey is played by Heather Graham br Barrymore was already a successful actress when she appeared in Scream at a time when casting a big name for a horror film was uncommon She was originally signed to play the role of Sidney after reading the script and approaching the production team herself However she decided she would rather play the part of Casey Becker because of her connection to the character and wanting to deliver a shock to the audience It was not due to a scheduling conflict even though a very popular rumor states it was This has been debunked by Barrymore herself as well as Wes Craven Like her co stars Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox her appearance is credited by Craven for raising the profile of the film and helping to attract a larger female audience br Several scenes leading to Casey s eventual death gave rise to disputes between Craven and the Motion Picture Association of America MPAA the film rating board who raised concerns over the violence and intensity of the scene When she is initially stabbed in the chest by Ghostface Craven insisted that he had only been able to make one successful take of the scene so that no substitution was possible he was in fact lying The scene in which her corpse is hung from a tree and disemboweled was heavily edited Craven was forced to remove all still shots of the body and the scene itself was sped up to reduce its time on screen br br br Cotton Weary br br Portrayed by Liev Schreiber br Appeared in Scream cameo Scream Scream br Cotton Weary was the original suspect in the rape and murder of Maureen Prescott

After Mrs Loomis kills Derek and Hallie she intends to frame Cotton for the recent murder spree but he attacks and stabs her to death He then tries to take revenge on Sidney for his false imprisonment

additional scene in which Dewey survives and is placed in an ambulance in case test audiences reacted positively to the character When they did this scene was added to the film and his death was instead depicted in the fifth installment of Scream br Arquette was originally brought in to audition for the role of Billy Loomis in Scream but preferred the character of Dewey and requested to audition for that instead Despite resistance from the production team who were concerned that the role was described as hunky rather than the younger goofier approach of Arquette Craven appreciated

entrance and stabbing a frightened Bailey multiple times Ghostface is then revealed to be Sam wearing Billy s robe and mask who then ultimately kills Bailey by stabbing him in the eye br Jackson who voices Ghostface in all the Scream films was chosen for the part after weeks of local casting in Santa Rosa California He was intended only as a temporary voice to be replaced in the post production phase of the film with a dubbed voice but his contribution was retained because Craven felt he imbued the voice with a truly evil malevolence He and the casts of the films were intentionally prevented from meeting for most if not all of each film s production to discourage the cast from putting a face to the voice and to make him seem more menacing when interacting with the characters on the phone br br br Hank Loomis br Portrayed by C W Morgan br Appeared in Scream Scream footage br Hank Loomis is the father of Billy and the ex husband of Mrs Loomis Hank is a lawyer and represents his son when
