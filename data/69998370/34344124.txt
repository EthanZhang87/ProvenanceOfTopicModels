Terminator Judgment Day is a American science fiction action film directed by James Cameron who co wrote the script with William Wisher Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger Linda Hamilton and Robert Patrick it is the sequel to The Terminator and is the second installment in the Terminator franchise In the film the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet sends a Terminator a highly advanced killing machine back in time to to kill the future leader of the human resistance John Connor when he is a child The resistance sends back a less advanced reprogrammed Terminator to protect Connor and ensure the future of humanity br The Terminator was considered a significant success enhancing Schwarzenegger s and Cameron s careers but work on a sequel stalled because of animosity between the pair and Hemdale Film Corporation which partially owned the film s rights In Schwarzenegger and Cameron persuaded Carolco Pictures to purchase the rights from The Terminator producer Gale Anne Hurd and Hemdale which was financially struggling A release date was set for the following year leaving Cameron and Wisher seven weeks to write the script Principal photography lasted from October to March taking place in and around Los Angeles on an estimated million budget making it the most expensive film made at the time The advanced visual effects by Industrial Light Magic ILM which include the first use of a computer generated main character in a blockbuster film resulted in a schedule overrun Theatrical prints were not delivered to theaters until the night before the picture s release on July br Terminator was a critical and commercial success grossing million at the box office to become the highest grossing film of worldwide and the third highest grossing film of its time The film won several accolades including Saturn BAFTA and Academy awards Terminator merchandise includes video games comic books novels and T D Battle Across Time a live action attraction br Terminator is considered one of the best science fiction action and sequel films ever made It is also seen as a major influence on visual effects in films helping usher in the transition from practical effects to reliance on computer generated imagery The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in Although Cameron intended for Terminator to be the end of the franchise it was followed by a series of sequels including Terminator Rise of the Machines Terminator Salvation Terminator Genisys and Terminator Dark Fate as well as a television series br br In Earth has been ravaged by the war between the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet and the human resistance Skynet sends the T an advanced shape shifting prototype Terminator made of virtually indestructible liquid metal back in time to kill resistance leader John Connor when he is a child To protect Connor the resistance sends back a reprogrammed T Terminator a less advanced metal endoskeleton covered in living tissue br In Los Angeles John s mother Sarah is incarcerated in Pescadero State Hospital for her violent efforts to prevent Judgment Day the prophesied events of August when Skynet will gain sentience and in response to its creators attempts to deactivate it incite a nuclear holocaust John living with foster parents also considers Sarah delusional and resents her efforts to prepare him for his future role The T locates John in a shopping mall but the T intervenes coming to John s aid and enabling his escape John calls to warn his foster parents but the T deduces that the T has already killed them Realizing the T is programmed to obey him John forbids it to kill people and orders it to save Sarah from the T br The T and John intercept Sarah as she is making an escape attempt but Sarah flees in horror because the T looks identical to the Terminator sent to kill her in John and the T persuade her to join them and they escape the pursuing T Although distrustful of the T Sarah uses its knowledge of the future to learn that a revolutionary microprocessor being developed by Cyberdyne engineer Miles Dyson will be crucial to Skynet s creation Over the course of their journey Sarah sees the T serving as a friend and father figure to John who teaches it catchphrases and hand signs while encouraging it to become more human like br Sarah plans to escape to Mexico with John but a nightmare about Judgment Day convinces her to kill Dyson She attacks Dyson in his home but realizes she cannot bring herself to kill a person and relents John arrives and reconciles with Sarah while the T convinces Dyson of the future consequences of his work Dyson reveals that his research has been reverse engineered from the CPU and severed arm of the Terminator Believing that his work must be destroyed Dyson helps Sarah John and the T break into Cyberdyne retrieve the CPU and the arm and set explosives to destroy the lab The police assault the building and fatally shoot Dyson but he detonates the explosives as he dies The T pursues the surviving trio cornering them in a steel mill br Sarah and John split up to escape while the T mangles the T and briefly deactivates it by destroying its power source The T assumes Sarah s appearance and voice to lure out John but Sarah intervenes and along with the reactivated T pushes it into a vat of molten steel where it disintegrates The T explains that it must also be destroyed to prevent it from serving as a foundation for Skynet Despite John s tearful protests the T persuades him that its destruction is the only way to protect their future Sarah having come to respect the T shakes its hand and lowers it into the vat The T gives John a thumbs up as it is incinerated As Sarah drives down a highway with John she reflects on her renewed hope for an unknown future musing that if the T could learn the value of life so can humanity br br Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator a

Hamilton s infant son Dalton Abbott portrays John in a dream sequence Co writer William Wisher cameos as a man photographing the T in the mall and Michael Biehn reprises his role as resistance soldier Kyle Reese in scenes that were removed from the theatrical release br br The Terminator had been a surprise hit earning million against its million budget confirming Schwarzenegger s status as a lead actor and establishing James Cameron as a mainstream director Schwarzenegger expressed interest in a sequel saying I always felt we should continue the story I told Cameron that right after we finished the first film Cameron said Schwarzenegger had always been more enthusiastic about a sequel than he was because Cameron considered the original a complete story br Discussions to make a sequel stalled until in part owing to Cameron s work on other films such as Aliens and The Abyss but also because of a dispute with rights holder Hemdale Film Corporation Hemdale co founder John Daly against Cameron s wishes had attempted to alter the ending of The Terminator nearly resulting in a physical confrontation A sequel could not be made without Hemdale s approval as Cameron had surrendered of his rights to the company to get The Terminator made Cameron had also sold half of the remaining stake to his ex wife Gale Anne Hurd producer and co writer on the first film for following their divorce By Hemdale was being sued by Cameron Schwarzenegger Hurd and special effects artist Stan Winston for unpaid profits from The Terminator br Schwarzenegger aware Hemdale was experiencing financial difficulties convinced Carolco Pictures to purchase the film rights to The Terminator having worked with the independent film studio on the big budget science fiction film Total Recall Owner Mario Kassar described the rights acquisition as the most difficult deal Carolco ever conducted He accepted a million offer for Hemdale s share considering it a sum fabricated to ward him off and paid Hurd million for her share Prior to development the total cost of the acquisition rose to million after factoring in incidental costs br Kassar told Cameron that in order to recoup his investment the film would proceed with or without him and offered Cameron million to be involved and write the script The film would become a collaboration between several production studios Carolco Le Studio Canal Cameron s Lightstorm Entertainment and Hurd s Pacific Western Productions The studio also had an existing U S distribution deal with TriStar Pictures which stipulated that the film be ready for release by May Memorial Day br br With a scheduled release date Cameron had six to seven weeks to write the sequel He approached his frequent collaborator and The Terminator co writer William Wisher in March They spent two weeks developing a film treatment based on Cameron s vision to form a relationship between John Connor and the T a concept Wisher believed was a joke Their treatment diverged from the science fiction slasher theme of the original focusing on the unconventional family bond formed between Sarah John and the T Cameron said this relationship is the heart of the movie comparing it to the Tin Man receiving a heart in The Wizard of Oz br Cameron s concept featured Skynet and the resistance each sending a T both played by Schwarzenegger into the past one to kill John and the other to protect him Wisher believed a fight between two identical Terminators would be boring The pair briefly considered a larger Super Terminator but found it uninteresting and adopted an early idea Cameron had for The Terminator a liquid metal Terminator resembling an average sized human in contrast to Schwarzenegger s large frame The first half of their concept concluded with the destruction of Skynet s T forcing it to use the T its ultimate weapon Although he once considered removing the T altogether Cameron solidified it as the only antagonist Cameron and Wisher had the T take on the appearance of a police officer allowing it to operate with less suspicion Wisher found it challenging to depict the T as good without making it non threatening at the same time The pair decided to give it the ability to learn and develop emotions becoming more human over time They kept the T s dialogue brief relying on the audience to infer a lot of meaning through small bites Its catchphrase Hasta la vista baby was something Wisher and Cameron said after their telephone calls br Wisher developed the first half of the treatment at Cameron s home over the course of four weeks while Cameron worked on the latter half Many pages were removed including a convoluted subplot about Dyson and a massacre of a camp of survivalists helping Sarah Cameron who did not consider the budget while writing had to cut some elaborate scenes including a nine minute opening that showed a time travel machine being used in Wisher and Cameron also frequently conferred with special effects studio Industrial Light Magic ILM to determine which ideas were achievable br Cameron and Wisher analyzed the first film to help envision each character s development and evolution Cameron believed Sarah s knowledge of the future would isolate her forcing her to associate with survivalists and become a self sufficient commando She was written to have become an emotionally cold and distant character comparable to a Terminator especially when deciding to go after Dyson Instead of the story beginning with Sarah John is placed with a foster family to increase tension John s character was inspired by the Sting song Russians with Cameron recalling I remember sitting there once high on E I was struck by the lyrics I hope the Russians love their children too And I thought The idea of a nuclear war is just so antithetical to life itself That s where John came from They spent three days refining the script before flying to Cannes where Terminator was announced in early May Schwarzenegger initially struggled with portions of the script once asking What is polyalloy He also expressed concern about his character s non lethal depiction which conflicted with his action hero persona and portrayal of the character in The Terminator Cameron explained he wanted to defy audience expectations Schwarzenegger requested Just make me cool br br Schwarzenegger became interested in reprising his role after finding the character more complex and sympathetic than in the previous film To accurately portray a fearless and emotionless machine he trained extensively with stunt coordinator Joel Kramer to remain unaffected by fire and explosions around him Schwarzenegger earned million for his involvement Carolco had been blamed for the increase in exorbitant salaries paid to actors having paid Schwarzenegger around million for Total Recall They justified the expense as the value of their leads wide appeal in markets outside the U S To lessen the immediate financial burden Carolco paid most of Schwarzenegger s salary with a financed million Gulfstream III jet br Cameron refused to re cast Hamilton s role but developed plans to work around her absence if she chose not to return Negotiations were protracted but concluded promptly after Cameron informed Carolco the script could not be finished until he knew if Hamilton would be involved Hamilton received roughly million which she described as quite a bit more than her earnings for The Terminator but expressed disappointment at the pay disparity between her and Schwarzenegger Hamilton requested that Sarah exhibit a crazy demeanor explaining that after years of living with the impending doom of humanity she believed Sarah would have transformed into an untamed entity a warrior combined with a psychologically unstable woman She continued The T is a better human than I am and I m a better Terminator than he is Cameron considered giving the character a facial scar but determined that applying it daily would be difficult Hamilton undertook extensive preparation for her role working with a personal trainer for three hours a day six days a week and maintaining a strict low fat diet losing about pounds kg of body weight She also received judo and military training from former Israeli commando Uziel Gal Between training filming and spending time with her infant son Dalton Hamilton averaged only four hours of sleep per day She described her experience as sheer hell but enjoyed showing off her new physique Hamilton s twin sister Leslie was also cast in scenes where two versions of Sarah appear on screen simultaneously br Patrick who was living in his car was one of several actors in their late s considered for the T role Cameron wanted a lithe actor resembling a newly recruited police officer to contrast with Schwarzenegger According to Cameron If the T series is a kind of human Panzer tank then the T series had to be a Porsche Casting director Mali Finn believed Patrick had the intense presence they wanted Patrick auditioned by acting like an emotionless hunter and later participated in a screen test to judge the way lighting worked with his skin and eyes For his character he drew inspiration from Schwarzenegger s performance in The Terminator and observed hunting creatures reptiles insects cats and sharks Patrick s facial expressions were based on those of an eagle keeping his head tilted down to imply constant forward movement He also employed a mixture of military posture with martial arts to express a fluid motion that differed from the T s rigid movements The role demanded that Patrick be lean and fast requiring peak physical shape He learned to sprint without displaying heavy breathing and exhaustion and received specialized training from Gal Weapons master Harry Lu taught Patrick to operate and reload weapons such as the T s Beretta FS without looking and eventually without blinking Singer Billy Idol was originally cast for the role before seriously injuring his leg in a motorcycle crash In a retrospective Cameron said Idol had an interesting aesthetic but in hindsight he probably would not have cast him Singer Blackie Lawless of the rock band W A S P was also considered but deemed too tall br Furlong among hundreds of other prospects secured the role of young John Connor at his last audition Cameron believed that early candidates for the role were either overexposed in other media or came from advertisement backgrounds which trained them to be happy and perky Furlong had no acting experience and was discovered by Finn at the Boys Girls Club in Pasadena Cameron described Furlong as having a surliness an intelligence just a question of pulling it out He was required to take acting lessons learn Spanish and be able to ride a motorcycle and repair guns br Joe Morton believed his casting as Miles Dyson had to do with Cameron wanting a minority character to be integral to the changing of the world Morton avoided interacting with the cast so that their on screen relationships would seem believably distant The role of Dyson was reduced after the preferred casting choice Denzel Washington declined it because the role mainly required him to act scared br br The planned three months of pre production was reduced to meet the release schedule leaving Cameron without the time he wanted to prepare all aspects before filming began Over a week he spent several hours each day choreographing vehicle scenes with toy cars and trucks filming the results and printing the footage for storyboard artists There was no time to properly test practical effects before filming so if effects did not work the filmmakers had to work around them Principal photography began on October with a million budget Scenes were filmed out of sequence to prioritize those requiring extensive visual effects Schwarzenegger found this difficult because he was meant to convey subtle signs of the T s progressive humanity and was unsure what was fitting for each scene Cinematographer Adam Greenberg who also worked on The Terminator described the greater scope of the sequel as the most daunting prospect Where he had been able to shout instructions to his crew on the original film he used one of walkie talkies to conduct efforts over an expansive area br The production was arduous in part because of Cameron who was known for his short temper and uncompromising dictatorial manner The crew made T shirts bearing the slogan You can t scare me I work for Jim Cameron Schwarzenegger described him as a supportive but demanding taskmaster with a fanaticism for physical and visual detail Even so by the st day of filming Schwarzenegger and Hamilton were frustrated by the high number of takes Cameron performed spending five days just on close ups of Hamilton in the Dyson home To stay on schedule Cameron worked through Christmas and persuaded Schwarzenegger to cancel a visit to American troops in Saudi Arabia with U S President George H W Bush to film his scenes br br The production filmed in many locations in and around Los Angeles The now destroyed Corral bar in Sylmar is where the T confronts a group of bikers Location manager Jim Morris chose Corral because it was raised above ground allowing the scene to take place over different levels The police beating of Rodney King took place at the same location a week after filming being captured on the same videotape a spectator used to capture the filming of the biker bar scenes On one occasion a woman who was oblivious to ongoing filming walked into the bar When she asked Schwarzenegger who was wearing only a pair of shorts what was going on he replied It s male stripper night Executives suggested cutting the scene to save money but Cameron and Schwarzenegger refused br The T s arrival in was filmed at the Sixth Street Viaduct and John s hacking of an ATM was filmed at a bank in Van Nuys His foster parents residence is in the Canoga Park neighborhood deliberately chosen for its generic appearance The Terminators confrontation with John takes place inside Santa Monica Place mall although exterior shots were captured at Northridge Fashion Center because there was less traffic In the subsequent scene Patrick s training allowed him to outrun John on his dirtbike so the bike s maximum speed was increased The T continues its pursuit using a truck in a scene filmed at the Bull Creek spillway Other locations include the Lake View Terrace hospital standing in as Pescadero State Hospital and the Petersen Automotive Museum was used as its garage In a interview Hamilton said she suffered permanent partial hearing loss after not wearing earplugs during the hospital elevator scene where the T fires a gun as well as shell shock from months of exposure to violence loud noise and gunfire Elysian Park serves as the site of Sarah s apocalyptic dream and scenes at the Dyson home were captured at a private property in Malibu The Cyberdyne Building s destruction was filmed at an abandoned office in San Jose scheduled for demolition To bring a heightened sense of authenticity real members of the Los Angeles Police Department s SWAT division were featured in the scene although Cameron embellished their tactics to be visually interesting In a spontaneous decision during Morton s death scene Cameron opted to detonate nearby glass to examine its visual impact br The final highway chase was filmed along the Terminal Island Freeway near Long Beach of which a mile km stretch was closed to traffic every night for two weeks Scenes set during the future war of were filmed in the rubble of an abandoned steel mill in Oxnard California in a one half square mile km space that was enhanced with burned bicycles and cars from a fire at the Universal Studios Lot Terminator s ending was filmed in the closed Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana which Greenberg made appear operational mainly through lighting techniques Despite appearing to be actively smelting steel the mill was frigid and dangerous because of the moving machinery and high catwalks The T s thumbs up during its death was added during filming Hamilton considered it too sentimental Six months of filming concluded on March about three weeks behind schedule br br Terminator was edited by Conrad Buff IV Richard A Harris and Mark Goldblatt who said although there was more time to edit than on The Terminator it was still relatively small given the greater scope of the sequel They described the complexity of scenes such as the final battle between the Terminators which required a seamless combination of live action practical effect shots and CGI After having to rush editing at the end of The Abyss Cameron limited filming on Terminator to five days a week so he could help edit the film on weekends from the start of filming br Several scenes were deleted in part to reduce its running time These include Kyle Reese appearing to Sarah in a dream and encouraging her to continue fighting Sarah being beaten in the hospital the T killing John s dog a scene the animal loving Patrick was not a fan of John teaching the T to smile and discussing whether it fears death the T malfunctioning after being frozen in the steel mill and additional scenes with Dyson s family Schwarzenegger unsuccessfully rallied to retain his favorite scene in which John and Sarah modify the T s CPU allowing it to learn and evolve and Sarah attempts to destroy the CPU but John defends the T The scene was replaced with dialogue indicating that the T already possesses the ability to learn The scripted ending depicted an alternative that was filmed at the Los Angeles Arboretum in Arcadia in which an aged Sarah narrates how Skynet was never created while John now a US Senator plays with his daughter in a Washington D C playground To make the film more evocative and memorable Cameron changed this scene to one in which the characters look out at the road ahead br The production ran until about two days before the film s theatrical release Delays were caused mainly by the rendering of shots at Consolidated Film Industries the most difficult of which was the T s death Co producer Stephanie Austin said the production crew worked hour shifts and slept on site The minute long release print was delivered to theaters the night before its release There were two private pre release screenings one for family friends and crew at Skywalker Ranch and another in Los Angeles for studio executives Austin said People were stamping their feet and clapping for ten or fifteen minutes at which point the crew knew they had succeeded During test screenings the ending was well received and was described as a touching favorite scene br The minimum estimated cost to produce Terminator had been million dwarfing the budget of the first film Cameron and Schwarzenegger said the final budget excluding marketing was about million and the cost of making the film was about million According to Carolco executives Peter Hoffman and Roger Smith the film cost million before marketing saying Terminator was only modestly over budget Including marketing and other costs the film s total budget is reported to have been between million and million Kassar said he had secured of the budget from advances and guarantees of million including North American television million and home video million rights and million from theatrical home video and television rights outside the U S The distribution deal with TriStar Pictures earned it a set percentage of the budget an estimated million News sources labeled Terminator the most expensive independent film ever and predicted it would bankrupt Carolco br br A month schedule and about million of Terminator s budget was allocated just for special effects including million for the T alone and a further million for stunts at the time one of the largest ever stunt budgets Four main companies were involved in creating the visual effects ILM under special effects supervisor Dennis Muren managed the computer generated imagery CGI effects Stan Winston Studio the prosthetics and animatronics Fantasy II Film Effects developed miniatures and optical effects and Ward Productions was responsible for creating a nuclear explosion effect Pacific Data Images and Video Image provided additional effects the former doing digital wire removal and the latter creating the Termovision POV The cost and time involved in producing CGI meant that the effect was used sparingly appearing in shots alongside practical effects br Portraying the T was a risky endeavor as CGI was in its infancy and there was no backup plan in place if the CGI did not work as intended or could not be composited effectively with Winston s practical effects The computer systems needed to animate and render the T CGI cost thousands of dollars alone but creating the character also relied on a variety of practical appliances visual illusions and filming techniques A team of up to at ILM was required for the five minutes of screen time the T s effects appear and the process was so complex that rendering seconds of footage took up to ten days br br The Terminator composer Brad Fiedel returned for the sequel working in his garage in Studio City Los Angeles Film industry professionals regarded his return with concern and skepticism as they believed his style would not suit the film Fiedel quickly realized he would not receive the finished footage until late in the production after most effects were completed which made it difficult to commit to decisions such as use of an orchestra because unlike ambient music the score had to accompany the on screen action Fiedel and Cameron wanted the musical tone to be warmer due to its focus on a nobler Terminator and young John Fiedel experimented with sounds and shared them with Cameron for feedback br While The Terminator score had mainly used oscillators and synthesizers Fiedel recorded real instruments and modified their sounds He developed a library of sounds for characters such as the T whose theme was created by sampling brass instrument players warming up and improvising Fiedel said to the players You re an insane asylum You re a bedlam of instruments He slowed down the resulting sample and lowered the pitch describing it as artificial intelligent monks chanting Cameron considered the atonal sound too avant garde to which Fiedel replied you re creating something that people have never seen before and the score ought to sound like something people have never heard before to support that br Tri Star asked Schwarzenegger to arrange a tie in music video and theme song for the film He chose to work with rock band Guns N Roses because they were popular and there was a rose in the movie and bloody guns The band offered the use of You Could Be Mine the debut single from their album Use Your Illusion II The music video featuring Schwarzenegger as the T pursuing the band was directed by Stan Winston Andrew Morahan and Jeffrey Abelson Patrick unsuccessfully lobbied to use Head Like a Hole by Nine Inch Nails as the tie in song in part because his brother Richard Patrick was their tour guitarist Wisher suggested using Bad to the Bone by George Thorogood the Destroyers as the T puts on the biker clothes Although Cameron did not like the idea Wisher said he later found that Cameron had used the song but had forgotten it was his idea Guitars Cadillacs by Dwight Yoakam also features in Terminator br br The summer theatrical season spanning from mid May to early September was expected to witness strong competition among studios Fifty five films were slated for release compared with thirty seven in Release dates underwent frequent changes as studios aimed to evade direct competition and optimize their films chances of success to compensate for the increase in film production costs since This increase was partly attributed to hefty salaries demanded by stars who also claimed a portion of the film s profits Moreover revenues from box office receipts video sales and television network deals were on the decline Films scheduled for release included City Slickers The Naked Gun The Smell of Fear Only the Lonely Hudson Hawk The Rocketeer What About Bob and Point Break Terminator was among the films expected to do well along with Backdraft Dying Young and the year s predicted top film Robin Hood Prince of Thieves It was also seen as having strong international appeal An unnamed studio executive said audiences were seeking escapist entertainment such as comedy or action and avoiding films about less positive subject matter br br Schwarzenegger was involved in Terminator s marketing and merchandising campaign which was estimated to be worth at least million By advertising for Terminator was ubiquitous with high audience recognition despite its U S R rating which restricted the film to audiences aged and over unless accompanied by an adult merchandise was mainly aimed at children TriStar contributed about million for marketing which included a teaser trailer that was directed by Winston and depicts the construction of a T Trailers ran for six months before the film s release Tristar incentivized cinema staff to play it frequently by offering chances to win Terminator branded goods and tickets to the premiere Fast food restaurants and soft drink manufacturers such as Subway and Pepsi also offered Terminator themed foodstuffs and drinks alongside promotional posters br The premiere took place on July at the Cineplex Odeon in Century City Los Angeles According to Fiedel it was treated as a major event unlike the premiere of The Terminator during which the audience was skeptical or laughed at the wrong times Celebrities in attendance included Maria Shriver Nicolas Cage Sylvester Stallone Sharon Stone Michael Douglas and Furlong s date Soleil Moon Frye br br Terminator Judgment Day opened in the United States and Canada on July leading into the Independence Day holiday weekend It had the highest grossing Wednesday opening with million Between Friday and Sunday the film grossed million from theaters an average of per theater making it the number one film of the weekend ahead of The Naked Gun million in its second weekend and Robin Hood Prince of Thieves million in its fourth Over the five day holiday weekend Wednesday to Sunday Terminator grossed million becoming the second highest opening five day total ever behind Batman s million in It set a record opening for an R rated film and for an Independence Day weekend The opening week audience was evenly split between adults teenagers and children about of whom were women although TriStar said the figure was higher The film benefited from repeat viewings by young audience members One theater chain executive said nothing since Batman has created the frenzy for tickets we saw this weekend with Terminator At virtually all our locations we are selling out the word of mouth buzz out there is just phenomenal Industry professional Lawrence Kasanoff said it was an open secret that despite the R rating children were seeing the film remarking When T opened I saw kids skateboard up to the ticket window br It retained the number one position in its second weekend grossing million ahead of the debuts of One Hundred and One Dalmatians million and Boyz n the Hood million and in its third weekend with million ahead of Bill Ted s Bogus Journey million and One Hundred and One Dalmatians million Terminator Judgment Day fell to number two in its fifth weekend grossing million against the debut of the comedy Hot Shots million It remained in the top five highest grossing films for twelve consecutive weeks and the top ten highest grossing films for fifteen weeks In total Terminator Judgment Day spent about twenty six weeks in theaters in a total of cinemas and grossed million making it the highest grossing film of the year ahead of Robin Hood Prince of Thieves million Beauty and the Beast million and The Silence of the Lambs million This also made it the thirteenth highest grossing film of its time behind Back to the Future and the highest grossing R rated film The Los Angeles Times estimated after the theater and distributor cuts the box office returns to Carolco would be well over twenty percent of the film s cost br Outside the U S and Canada Terminator Judgment Day set numerous box office records In the United Kingdom it had a record three day opening weekend of million and a one week record of million and went on to gross at least million In France it grossed a record million in its opening week the biggest opening since Rocky IV and million in two weeks In Germany it grossed a record million in five days and also had a record Australian opening weekend of million In Thailand it was the highest grossing western hemisphere film ever with a gross of million The film also performed well in Brazil and grossed at least million in Japan Internationally the film grossed about million making it the first film to gross over million outside of the U S and Canada Terminator Judgment Day is estimated to have grossed a worldwide total of million making it the year s highest grossing film and the third highest grossing film ever behind s Star Wars million and s E T the Extra Terrestrial million br br Terminator Judgment Day was released to general acclaim Many reviews focused on the state of the art physical special and make up effects which were roundly praised as revolutionary and spectacular particularly those calling the T a technological wonder Several publications wrote that Cameron s ability to realize cinematic action blockbusters was unmatched Janet Maslin said that at his best despite occasional lapses into melodrama Cameron s work is akin to that of director Stanley Kubrick Both Maslin and The Austin Chronicle commented on the kindness and compassion in the film The Austin Chronicle contrasted it to the lack of a moral message in The Terminator and Travers described it as a visionary parable but they alongside others criticized Terminator s muddled message about protecting the value of human life and peace by using extreme violence to prevent the use of nuclear weapons war and technological reliance br Reviewers generally agreed the narrative early in the film is stronger than the one near the end Owen Gleiberman said the first hour has a genuine emotional pull and according to Roger Ebert the initial concept of a boy finding a father figure in a Terminator that is learning to be human is intriguing but Gleiberman said the narrative weakens once Hamilton s character joins the group Travers and Corliss wrote it stumbles after hours of relentless action and a conventional climax Despite this observation Gleiberman praised the final battle between the T and the protagonists Empire s review and Terrence Rafferty found the film s narrative less satisfying and idea driven than that of The Terminator Gleiberman said despite it being an effective and witty thriller Terminator Judgment Day comes across as an expensive B movie when compared with visionary spectacles such as the Mad Max series and RoboCop Kenneth Turan said Terminator s action scenes succeed without the extreme gore and violence of RoboCop br Ebert and Maslin among others appreciated the twist on Schwarzenegger s public action hero persona by making him a hero who does not kill his enemies David Ansen and Glieberman found humor in the T s non lethal methods and efforts to become more human like Maslin and Hinson agreed that as in The Terminator Schwarzenegger s role is perfect for his acting abilities Hinson said Schwarzenegger portrayed more humanity as a machine than he did when portraying normal people In contrast Empire suggested that the change was a concession to Schwarzenegger s young fans and Peter Travers chose the T s death as a cornball scene that is out of place for the actor and film br Several reviewers praised the T character for the combination of Patrick s chilling expressionless performance and the advanced special effects which create an implacable showstopping villain Empire called the character one of the great monsters of the cinema Gleiberman said the character s absence from much of the film s second act is to the film s detriment and Hinson wrote that the T lacks any soul and thus a way for the audience to identify with it Critics generally agreed Hamilton portrays a fierce female hero with an impressive physique that lets her outshine another action hero Sigourney Weaver s Ellen Ripley in Cameron s Aliens Other publications found Sarah Connor s narrations about peace to be heavy handed overused and unintentionally amusing Furlong was praised for giving a natural performance at a young age and Hinson wrote that despite limited screentime Morton made an impression Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on a scale of A to F br br At the Saturn Awards Terminator Judgment Day

professionals Schwarzenegger became the top international star ahead of actors such as Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise It also marked the start of a lasting friendship between Schwarzenegger and Cameron who formed a midlife crisis motorcycle club and reunited for the action film True Lies Cameron and Hamilton began a romantic relationship in married in and later divorced In Cameron was given a five year million contract by th Century Fox to produce twelve films br Furlong became a highly sought after actor and Patrick found dealing with his new found recognition difficult as people asked him to impersonate the T Despite the film s success Carolco reported losses of million which was caused by the financial problems of its other films and subsidiaries Support from investors failed to prevent the studio from filing for bankruptcy in and its assets including Terminator were sold to Canal Plus for million br br On December Terminator Judgment Day was released on VHS and LaserDisc It was a

Infinity and Revolution and the T novel series by S M Stirling in the early s Several video game adaptations of Terminator were published including a pinball machine and an arcade game in The arcade

Merchandise for Terminator Judgment Day was estimated to have generated million in sales br In T D Battle Across Time a live action attraction was opened at Universal Studios Florida and later at

developed Skynet They are confronted by the T but saved by the T which returns to with John to defeat Skynet and its latest creation the T br br Cameron oversaw a year long D remaster and subsequent theatrical re release of Terminator Judgment Day in August Cameron said If you ve never seen it this ll be the version you want to see and remember Cameron made visual modifications to the film to fix errors that had bothered him including the addition of windshield glass to the T s truck which fell out during its stunt fall and reappears in later scenes concealing the obvious use of stuntmen for Furlong and Schwarzenegger during the same scene concealed more of Patrick s nudity during his introduction and brightened the visuals The D remaster s theatrical release was seen as a disappointment earning about in its debut across theaters compared to the D re release of Cameron s Titanic in which fetched million br br A central theme of Terminator Judgment Day is the relationship between John Connor and the T which serves as a surrogate for the father Kyle Reese he never knew Cameron said Sure there s going to be big thunderous action sequences but the heart of the movie is that relationship comparing it to the Tin Man getting a heart in The Wizard of Oz As with Cameron s earlier film Aliens Terminator focuses on compassion and parental figures depicting the T as a relentless protector and father figure to John against the equally relentless T The T is designed to emulate humans for infiltration purposes but as it grows and evolves its emotions become real and it learns from John to feel grief The T chooses to sacrifice its life to ensure the survival of everyone else In essayist Robert Bly wrote that older men were not offering suitable role models for young men and in Terminator Sarah denounces the many men in her past who failed to be a father for John except for the T Once its role is complete the T leaves John for his own good after stating that it lacks the emotions John must rely on br While John teaches the T about humanity his biological mother Sarah has become less human because of her knowledge about the future Cameron said She s a sad character a tragic character she believes that everyone she meets talks to or interacts with will be dead very soon This theme of machine like humans links with Cameron s and Wisher s choice to make the T appear as a police officer because thematically they believed it represents humans who should have empathy for others becoming more machine like and detached from their emotions The SWAT team at Cyberdyne shoots Dyson an African American without warning Cinephilia described Dyson as the most human character in the film an intelligent optimistic family man who represents real world encounters between police forces and people of color in contrast to their encounter with the Caucasian T during which they warn him before opening fire br Following her escape from the state hospital Sarah appears to embrace John but is actually checking him for injuries forgoing any emotional attachment for the practicality of ensuring his survival and bringing about his destiny as a future leader The T is portrayed as a better parent than Sarah offering him undivided attention while Sarah remains distant and focused on the future rather than the present Philosophy professor Richard T McClelland notes that Sarah s acceptance of the T as John s surrogate father is such that she leaves it in control of John when she drives away to kill Dyson Sarah s dream about the nuclear holocaust that will kill six billion people including her son incites her to kill Dyson before he can complete the work that will bring about Skynet but when the moment comes she is unable to fully forsake her humanity and murder him with no emotion Cameron described this as a question of humanity s worth if we abandon it to win the battle for its existence In contrast with the bleak nihilistic themes of the first film Terminator emphasizes the concept of free will and the value of human life Schwarzenegger quoted the film s line no fate but what we make saying people have control over their own destinies br Terminator also comments on the use of violence On its release reviewers were critical of Terminator Judgment Day s message about preserving peace through violence Owen Gleiberman stated that reckless indifference to human life is intrinsic to the film but the T maiming people rather than killing them potentially condemns victims of violence to a life of pain Cameron described the film as the world s most violent anti war movie and said it is about people struggling with their own violent natures In particular Cameron had been concerned by the original antagonist T s status as a cultural icon and power fantasy as a lethal unstoppable force of strength and power and chose to redefine it in Terminator retaining the power fantasy without taking lives Cinephilia said it is not morally possible to recover from killing people so Terminator is about redeeming the T and Sarah br br According to Professor Jeffrey A Brown there was a growth of female led action films in the wake of Aliens s success Brown believes this reflected the increase in women assuming non traditional roles and the division between professional critics who perceive a masculinization of the female hero and audiences who embrace characters regardless of gender The hyper masculine heroes played by Schwarzenegger Stallone and Jean Claude Van Damme were replaced with independent women who are capable of defending themselves and defeating villains in films such as Terminator and The Silence of the Lambs Brown said these female characters often perform stereotypical male actions and have muscular physiques rather than feminine soft bodies He considers Hamilton s undershirt to be symbolic of typically male action heroes such as John McClane and John Rambo as well as women displaying masculine traits such as Rachel McLish in Aces Iron Eagle III br Despite the emphasis on strong femininity Hamilton s character remains secondary to Schwarzenegger s Sarah s efforts to defeat the T fall short until the last minute intervention of the T Author Victoria Warren said this allows the female character to be strong enough to be admired but not strong enough to undermine the male protagonist s masculinity Professors Amanda Fernbach and Thomas B Byers said the rigid form of the T represents reactionary masculinity that is in direct opposition to the gender bending T which represents a post modern fluid nature that is outside traditional norms and in opposition to patriarchy and the preservation of the traditional family br Author Mark Duckenfield said Terminator Judgment Day can be seen as an unintended allegory for the decline of United States industries against successful Japanese technology firms with the cutting edge T representing Japan against the older less advanced T The U S industries which were sometimes seen as villains during the economic boom of the s are seen as more sympathetic in the face of obsolescence just as the T is presented as friendlier and still powerful but no longer overwhelmingly so Duckenfield considers the final scene which takes place in a steel mill a place of American industry symbolic According to Warren Terminator reflects Cold War American values that emphasized principles of American culture in particular individualism and rejection of government intervention The institutions that the film s protagonists should be able to rely on such as the government the police and technology are the ones attempting to stop them because they do not believe in the protagonists doomsday prophecy br br Terminator is considered a highly influential film setting a benchmark for sequels action set pieces and visual effects Cameron and special effects supervisor Dennis Muren said the groundbreaking special effects in Terminator demonstrated the possibilities of computer generated effects and that without it effects focused films such as Jurassic Park would not have been possible Various publications have referenced Terminator s influence on special effects describing it as the most important special effects film since Tron marking the start of the era of reliance on CGI effects for films such as Jurassic Park and The Matrix In the Visual Effects Society an entertainment industry organization of visual effects practitioners named Terminator the th most influential visual effects film of all time and the T is listed by Guinness World Records as the first major blockbuster movie character generated using computers According to The Guardian the film s groundbreaking effects led to CGI laziness a reliance on computer graphics over practical effects stunts and craft A Entertainment Weekly article said Terminator contributed to the contemporary Hollywood high budget science fiction epic film and a reliance on turning films into franchises targeted at young audiences and broad demographics Den of Geek described it as one of the most influential blockbusters since the thriller Jaws Several filmmakers and creative leads have named it as an influence on their work including Steven Caple Jr Ryan Coogler Kevin Feige and Hideo Kojima and it was the favorite film of Russian political prisoner Alexei Navalny br With a million budget Terminator Judgment Day was the most expensive movie made in its time and as of it remains Schwarzenegger s highest grossing film Alongside her appearance in The Terminator Hamilton s Sarah Connor became regarded as one of the greatest and most influential cinematic female action heroes and an iconic character Patrick s T is considered one of the most iconic cinematic villains He made cameo appearances as the T in Wayne s World and Schwarzenegger s Last Action Hero In Last Action Hero Stallone replaces Schwarzenegger as the T on the Terminator poster The T s line Hasta la vista baby is considered an iconic piece of movie dialogue and is often quoted Schwarzenegger also used it in speeches during his political career Terminator Judgment Day has been referenced in a variety of media including television films and video games The biker bar scene was recreated for a advertisement which featured Schwarzenegger for the video game WWE K the bar patrons were replaced with WWE wrestlers In the Library of Congress selected Terminator Judgment Day for preservation in the National Film Registry as being culturally historically or aesthetically significant br br Since its release Terminator Judgment Day has been assessed as one of the best action science fiction and sequel films ever made Terminator and The Terminator are generally considered the standout films in the Terminator franchise with each taking turns in the top spot Some publications have listed Terminator among the greatest films made br In the American Film Institute AFI ranked Terminator number on its

characters The film has a score of out of on Metacritic based on critics reviews indicating generally favorable reviews During Terminator s th anniversary in Cameron among others said despite using

Rolling Stone s reader voted list of the best sequels ranks Terminator second behind The Godfather Part II and Empire readers ranked the film th on its Greatest Movies list br br Cameron said he had no intentions for further sequels believing that Terminator brings the story full circle and ends And I think ending it at this point is a good idea Wisher and Cameron wrote the script with the intention of leaving no option for a sequel Even so four sequels followed Terminator Rise of the Machines Terminator Salvation Terminator Genisys and Terminator Dark Fate though none replicated the success of The Terminator or Terminator br Schwarzenegger returned for all but Terminator Salvation while Cameron and Hamilton returned only for Dark Fate a direct sequel to the events of Terminator Although better critically received than other post Terminator sequels Dark Fate is also considered a failure Analysts blamed audience disinterest on the diminishing quality of the series since Terminator and repeated attempts to reboot the series Fans also criticized Dark Fate s opening scene in which a T kills Furlong s teenage John Connor Entertainment website Collider wrote that this retroactively damages the ending of Terminator A television series Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles also takes place after the events of Terminator and ignores the events in sequels Terminator
