recruit Dr Bruce Banner so he can trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions Fury approaches Steve Rogers to discuss his knowledge of the Tesseract and Agent Phil Coulson visits Tony Stark so he can check Selvig s research Loki is in Stuttgart where Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract This leads to a confrontation with Rogers Stark and Romanoff that ends with Loki s surrender While Loki is being escorted to S H I E L D his adoptive brother Thor arrives and frees him hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard Stark and Rogers intervene and Loki is imprisoned in S H I E L D s flying aircraft carrier the Helicarrier br The Avengers disagree on how to approach Loki and become argumentative once they realize S H I E L D plans to use the

Hulk Stark and Rogers restart the damaged engine while Thor attempts to stop the Hulk s rampage Romanoff subdues Barton freeing him from Loki s influence Loki escapes after mortally wounding Coulson

Earth br br br Cast br br Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark Iron Man A self described genius billionaire playboy and philanthropist who wears an electromechanical suit of armor of his own invention Downey was cast as part of his four picture deal with Marvel Studios which included Iron Man and The Avengers He initially suggested to Whedon that Stark should be the lead character stating Well I said I need to be in the opening sequence I don t know what you re thinking but Tony needs to drive this thing He was like Okay let s try that We tried it and it didn t work because this is a different sort of thing the story and the idea and the theme is the theme and everybody is just an arm of the octopus Downey commented on the character s evolution stating In Iron Man which was an origin story he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts Iron Man is all about not being an island dealing with legacy issues and making space for others In The Avengers he s throwing it down with the others Downey earned million from the film once box office bonuses and backend compensation were factored in br Chris Evans as Steve Rogers Captain America A World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films including The Avengers Rogers is depicted as darker in The Avengers with Evans stating It s just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world You ve got to imagine it s enough of a shock to accept the fact that you re in a completely different time but everybody you know is dead Everybody you cared about He was a soldier obviously everybody he went to battle with all of his brothers in arms they re all dead He s just lonely I think in the beginning it s a fish out of water scene and it s tough It s a tough pill for him to swallow Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world Evans also discussed the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark saying I think there s certainly a dichotomy this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark they re polar opposites One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along They explore that and it s pretty fun Evans earned million for the film br Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner Hulk A genius scientist who due to exposure to gamma radiation transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated Ruffalo initially considered for the role in The Incredible Hulk before Edward Norton took on the part was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton fell through Reflecting on replacing Norton Ruffalo stated I m a friend of Ed s and yeah that wasn t a great way for all that to go down But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me I look at it as my generation s Hamlet Discussing the character he explained He s a guy struggling with two sides of himself the dark and the light and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk I like that the part has those qualities Ruffalo described the Hulk s role on the team stating He s like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team He s a loose cannon It s like Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let s hope it turns out well This is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk Ruffalo expressed excitement about the prospect saying I m really excited No one s ever played the Hulk exactly they ve always done CGI They re going to do the Avatar stop action stop motion capture So I ll actually play the Hulk That ll be fun The D model used to create the Hulk s body was based on Long Island bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm while Ruffalo s face served as the model for the Hulk s facial features To produce the Hulk s voice Ruffalo s voice was combined with those of Lou Ferrigno and others however Ruffalo provided the Hulk s sole speaking line Puny god himself Ruffalo earned million for his role in the film br Chris Hemsworth as Thor The crown prince of Asgard based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal He had previously collaborated with Joss Whedon on The Cabin in the Woods Hemsworth maintained his physique from Thor by consuming a high protein diet consisting of chicken breasts fish steak and eggs daily When asked about the quantity he humorously replied My body weight in protein pretty much Thor s motivation in The Avengers is described by Hemsworth as personal as it involves his brother s disruptive actions He explained It s much more of a personal one in the sense that it s his brother that is stirring things up Whereas everyone else it s some bad guy who they ve gotta take down It s a different approach for me or for Thor He s constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs it s his little brother there I ve been frustrated with my brothers at times or family but I m the only one who is allowed to be angry at them There s a bit of that Hemsworth earned million for his role in the film br Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff Black Widow A highly trained spy working for S H I E L D Johansson discussed her character s relationship with Hawkeye stating Our characters have a long history They ve fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries We re the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors we have no superpowers Black Widow is definitely one of the team though She s not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy She s there to fight so I never felt like I was the only girl We all have our various skills and it feels equal Regarding her training for the role Johansson mentioned Even though Iron Man was one for them I d never done anything like that before I d never been physically driven in something or a part of something so big For The Avengers I ve spent so many months training with our stunt team and fighting all the other actors it s crazy I do nothing but fight all the time Johansson earned million for her portrayal in the film br Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton Hawkeye A master archer working as an agent for S H I E L D Renner prepared for the physically demanding role by training extensively and practicing archery He expressed his appreciation for Hawkeye s character stating When I saw Iron Man I thought that was a really kick ass approach to superheroes Then they told me about this Hawkeye character and I liked how he wasn t really a superhero he s just a guy with a high skill set I could connect to that Regarding Hawkeye s relationship with Natasha Romanoff Renner explained It s a lonely game He s an outcast His only connection is to Scarlett s character Natasha It s like a left hand right hand thing They coexist and you need them both especially when it comes to a physical mission Renner emphasized that Hawkeye is confident in his abilities and not insecure about his humanity stating Quite the opposite he s the only one who can really take down the Hulk with his tranquilizer tipped arrows He knows his limitations But when it comes down to it there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero Renner earned million for his role in the film br Tom Hiddleston as Loki Thor s adoptive brother and nemesis based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name Hiddleston reflected on his character s evolution from the film Thor stating I think the Loki we see in The Avengers is further advanced You have to ask yourself the question How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making So I think by the time Loki shows up in The Avengers he s seen a few things Regarding Loki s motivations Hiddleston explained At the beginning of The Avengers he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king And like all the delusional autocrats of human history he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self respect so I haven t let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation br Stellan Skarsg rd as Erik Selvig An astrophysicist and friend of Thor under Loki s control who is studying the Tesseract s power Skarsg rd commented on Loki s control over Selvig stating Well with the scene we did in Thor it was like Loki one way or the other entered Erik s mind And in Avengers you will see more clarity in how Loki is using Erik s mind Regarding his role he added My character is of importance but the size of the role is not big br Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury The director of S H I E L D who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the Avengers Initiative Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films Jackson expressed that he has a more significant role in The Avengers compared to previous films You don t have to wait until the end of the movie to see me Reflecting on the role Jackson stated It s always good to play somebody who is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real life would seem He likened the character to Ordell Robbie in Jackie Brown describing him as a nice guy to hang out with You just don t want to cross him Jackson earned million for the film br Clark Gregg appears as Phil Coulson a S H I E L D agent overseeing many of the division s field operations Gregg was cast as part of a multi picture deal with Marvel He noted that his role was expanded in The Avengers expressing What Agent Coulson had become in terms of the import of this particular story and how important his job is in bringing the Avengers together it kind of felt a little surreal like somebody was playing a prank and that wasn t the real script But it wasn t it was the real thing I got to show up and do that stuff and it felt like such an amazing payoff to what the journey had been and the fact I had been doing it for five years Gregg said Whedon provided insight into his character s backstory particularly about Coulson being a fan of Captain America Cobie Smulders appears as Maria Hill a high ranking S H I E L D agent working closely with Nick Fury Smulders initially considered by Whedon for his unproduced live action Wonder Woman film was selected from a short list of potential actresses including Morena Baccarin Her deal integrated her into nine films Regarding her preparation Smulders said I hired this amazing black ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun take me to a shooting range how to hit how to hold myself how to walk and basically how to look I don t do a ton of fighting in the movie which is why I wasn t offered a trainer but I wanted to look like I had the ability to On relating to the character Smulders said I can relate to her being a mom and being a businesswoman and trying to work full time and raising a family and having a career We re asked to do a lot of things these days I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going br Gwyneth Paltrow and Maximiliano Hern ndez reprise their roles as Pepper Potts and Jasper Sitwell respectively from previous MCU films Paul Bettany returns to voice J A R V I S Frequent Whedon collaborator Alexis Denisof portrays the Other while Damion Poitier portrays his master Thanos unnamed in the film in a post credits scene Powers Boothe and Jenny Agutter appear as members of the World Security Council later revealed to be Gideon Malick and Councilwoman Hawley Avengers co creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in a news report Additionally Harry Dean Stanton cameos as a security guard and Polish film director Jerzy Skolimowski appears as Georgi Luchkov Romanoff s interrogator Warren Kole has a brief role as a S H I E L D bridge tech who is caught playing Galaga Enver Gjokaj who later went on to play Daniel Sousa in the series Agent Carter appears as a police officer br br br Production br br br Development br br Ideas for a film based on the Avengers began in with Avi Arad the CEO of Marvel Studios first announcing plans to develop the film in April after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts the studio s intention was to release individual films for the main characters to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them before merging the characters together in a crossover film Screenwriter Zak Penn who wrote The Incredible Hulk became attached to the film in and was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June In the wake of the Writers Guild of America strike Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts including Captain America Ant Man and The Avengers After the successful release of Iron Man in May the company set a July release date for The Avengers In September Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount an extension of a previous partnership which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films br Casting began in October with Downey s signing Although Don Cheadle was reported to reprise his Iron Man role of War Machine for The Avengers he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film Simultaneously two major developments occurred for Marvel Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film and the company signed a long term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big budget films Iron Man Thor and Captain America The First Avenger at their Manhattan Beach California complex In February Samuel L Jackson signed a nine picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in Iron Man and other films In September Edward Norton who played Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk stated he was open to returning in the film The next month executive producer Jon Favreau stated he would not direct the film but would definitely have input and a say Favreau also expressed concerns stating It s going to be hard because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man and Iron Man is very much a tech based hero and then with Avengers you re going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor Mixing the two of those works very well in the comic books but it s going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we ve created In March Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in portraying Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man a deal that subsequently attached her to The Avengers The following day Marvel announced that the film s release date had been pushed back to May almost a full year later Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film s cast in June returning as Thor and Loki respectively br In July Penn discussed the crossover process stating My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we re mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected There s just a board that tracks Here s where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie I m pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie to draw boards so that we re all working off the same visual ideas But the exigencies of production take first priority Initially Penn attempted to reduce Thor s role in the script due to doubts about the character s ability to succeed on film However he changed his mind once Hemsworth was cast as Thor Although the film always intended to use Loki as its villain Penn noted that early discussions had considered using Red Skull br In January Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige was asked if it would be challenging to blend the fantasy of Thor with the high tech science fiction in Iron Man and The Avengers No he said because we re doing the Jack Kirby Stan Lee Walt Simonson J Michael Straczynski Thor We re not doing the blow the dust off of the old Norse book in your library Thor And in the Thor of the Marvel Universe there s a race called the Asgardians And we re linked through this Tree of Life that we re unaware of It s real science but we don t know about it yet The Thor movie is about teaching people that In March it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script and that Marvel editor in chief Joe Quesada and Avengers comic book writer Brian Michael Bendis had received copies Also in March Chris Evans accepted an offer to play Captain America in three films including The Avengers br br br Pre production br br By April Joss Whedon was nearing the completion of a deal to direct the film and to revise Penn s script and was officially announced in July Regarding the hiring Arad stated My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer It s part of his life so you know he is going to protect it I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better Feige added I ve known Joss for many years We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it we want ed to find a director that s on the verge of doing something great as we think Joss is Whedon stated at the San Diego Comic Con that what drew him to the film is that he loves how these people shouldn t be in the same room let alone on the same team and that is the definition of family br When Whedon received Penn s draft he told Feige he felt the studio did not have anything and they should pretend this draft never happened Part of Whedon s issue was the lack of character connections in Penn s draft which necessitated Whedon to begin at square one Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film and created the tagline Avengers Some Assembly Required riffing on the Avengers Assemble slogan from the comic books Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki a battle among the heroes in the middle a battle against the villains at the end and that he get the film done for its May release The script went through a lot of insane iterations of what might be according to Whedon There was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film so he wrote a huge bunch of pages starring The Wasp and wanted Zooey Deschanel to play the character He also was worried that one British character actor Hiddleston was not enough to take on Earth s mightiest heroes and that we d feel like we were rooting for the overdog So I wrote a huge draft with Ezekiel Stane Obadiah Stane s son in it Once all of the actors were locked in place the movie stayed on mission Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue unlike the X Men He felt these guys just don t belong together before realizing their interactions could be like The Dirty Dozen Whedon also referenced Dr Strangelove The Abyss His Girl Friday and Black Hawk Down Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn though Whedon noted he fought for sole credit and was very upset about it Penn felt the two could have collaborated more but that was not his choice He wanted to do it his way and I respect that br br The casting process continued throughout much of with the additions of Jeremy Renner Mark Ruffalo and Clark Gregg Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton whom Marvel declined to bring back We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers stated Feige Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble as evidenced by Robert Chris H Chris E Samuel Scarlett and all of our talented casts We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks In response Norton s agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige s statement calling it purposefully misleading and an inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light In October Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he wanted more diversity with his career and did not want to be associated with only one character br In August it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February In October Grumman Studios in Bethpage New York and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn New York City were announced as filming locations with set construction slated to begin in November but as Whedon later explained Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque Also that October Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man and The Avengers The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit placement of the company s production logo on marketing materials and the film s opening titles As a result the onscreen production credit reads Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures though the film is solely owned distributed financed and marketed by Disney Paramount s Epix retained pay TV rights br In December Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson and Marvel Studios Co president Louis D Esposito announced that The Avengers would primarily film in Albuquerque New Mexico with principal photography scheduled for April through September Parts of the film were also slated to be shot in Michigan but plans to film in Detroit were scrapped after Governor Rick Snyder proposed a budget that would eliminate a film tax incentive Three months later in March Governor of Ohio John Kasich announced during Mayor Frank G Jackson s State of the City address that The Avengers would also film in Cleveland br Concept illustrator and designer of Iron Man s Mark VII armor Phil Saunders stated that Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the cool factor of the suitcase suit from Iron Man while still being a fully armored heavy duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle To achieve this Saunders combined ideas proposed in Iron Man with some concepts abandoned in the first Iron Man film creating a modular suit featuring large ammo packets on the arms and a backpack Additionally the Science Entertainment Exchange provided science consultation for the film br Casting reached its final stages the following year In February Cobie Smulders was cast in the role of Maria Hill after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key S H I E L D member whom Samuel L Jackson described as Nick Fury s sidekick Morena Baccarin Jessica Lucas and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were also considered for the role Over the successive months the film s cast expanded to include Stellan Skarsg rd Paul Bettany and Gwyneth Paltrow Paltrow was cast at Downey s insistence prior to this Whedon had not intended the film to include supporting characters from the heroes individual films commenting You need to separate the characters from their support systems in order to create the isolation you need for a team br br br Filming br br Principal photography began on April at Albuquerque Studios in Albuquerque New Mexico with the working title Group Hug In June stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald sustained a head injury while attempting a stunt involving a foot fall from a building after being struck by an arrow Despite the injury Fitzgerald recovered and resumed work on set as confirmed by a Marvel spokesperson to TMZ Second unit filming occurred in the Butler area about an hour outside Pittsburgh Pennsylvania the following month Additionally a chase sequence was shot in Worthington Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms which provided miles of abandoned limestone tunnels feet below the ground for filming br Production shifted to Cleveland Ohio in August where filming spanned four weeks The city s East th Street was selected as a stand in for New York City s nd Street serving as the backdrop for climactic battle scenes Army Reserve soldiers from the st Military Police Battalion based in Columbus Ohio participated in the background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland Staff Sergeant Michael T Landis noted that the involvement of real soldiers enhanced the realism of the scenes and portrayed the military positively citing their ability to provide on the spot corrections to tactics and uniforms The NASA Plum Brook Station near Sandusky Ohio specifically its Space Power Facility doubled as a S H I E L D research facility Filming also occurred at the Chevrolet powertrain plant in Parma Ohio where a series of explosions were captured for the battle sequence originating in Cleveland Additional scenes were shot at Public Square and the Detroit Superior Bridge with Public Square s southwest quadrant transformed into Stuttgart Germany for filming br Principal photography concluded in New York City where filming took place over a span of two days Filming locations included Park Avenue and Central Park To capture scenes set in Manhattan visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison spent over three days shooting aerial footage to use as background plates Morrison emphasized the importance of incorporating real imagery into the effects work to enhance realism stating There is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need br Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey explained that he chose a aspect ratio to accommodate the varying heights of the main characters He said Shooting is kind of unusual for an epic film like this but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk Captain America and Black Widow who is much smaller We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame Also Joss Whedon knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important This film marked McGarvey s first experience using a digital camera specifically the Arri Alexa Additionally the Canon EOS D Mark II and Canon EOS D digital SLR cameras were employed for certain shots while high speed shots were captured on mm film using the Arriflex McGarvey emphasized a visual approach focused on immersion and naturalism stating Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a comic book look that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images and we chose angles that were dramatic like low angles for heroic imagery br br br Post production br In December Disney announced the film would undergo a conversion to D According to Whedon I m not a big fan of extreme long lens talky movies I like to see the space I m in and relate to it so D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years Whedon also noted there definitely are movies that shouldn t be in D but stated The Avengers isn t obnoxiously D There s no Oh look we re going to spend minutes going through this tunnel because it s in D And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time But it s an action movie Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway In January it was reported that the film would undergo digital remastering for IMAX D and would open in IMAX theaters on May the same day as its regular theater release This IMAX release followed Marvel s earlier IMAX releases of Iron Man and Thor Initially when the film was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America s rating board it received an R rating due to Phil Coulson s death scene The scene was subsequently edited to secure a PG rating br In a May interview Whedon revealed that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post credits scene even though the character is not identified in the film He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain He s the great grand daddy of the badasses and he s in love with Death and I just think that s so cute For me the greatest Avengers comic book was Avengers Annual that Jim Starlin did followed by Marvel Two in One Annual that contained the death of Adam Warlock Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki s work and I was like It s got to be Thanos And they said Okay and I m like Oh my God Additionally an extra scene featuring the Avengers enjoying shawarma was filmed on April a day after the world premiere Evans wore a prosthetic jaw during the scene to conceal the beard he had grown Following the film s release shawarma sales in Los Angeles St Louis and Boston reportedly saw a significant surge Whedon explained that the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the aftermath of filming a scene in the Angel episode A Hole in the World where Fred dies in Wesley s arms After filming Whedon along with actors Amy Acker and Denisof who played Fred and Wesley respectively went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly exhausted from the day s events an experience that Whedon recreated in the film s scene br br The film features over visual effects shots completed by companies Industrial Light Magic ILM Weta Digital Scanline VFX Hydraulx Fuel VFX Evil Eye Pictures Luma Pictures Cantina Creative Trixter Modus FX Whiskytree Digital Domain The Third Floor and Method Design ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film s key effects including the Helicarrier the New York cityscape digital body doubles Iron Man and the Hulk To bring the Hulk to life on screen Ruffalo performed in a motion capture suit on set alongside the other actors while four motion capture HD cameras two capturing his full body and two focused on his face recorded his facial and body movements Jeff White ILM s visual effects supervisor aimed for a more realistic depiction of the Hulk compared to the one seen in Ang Lee s film stating We really wanted to utilize everything we ve developed the last years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him So much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance not only in motion capture and on set but down to his eyes his teeth and his tongue br ILM digitally recreated the majority of the New York cityscape featured in the film covering approximately ten city blocks by four city blocks To accomplish this ILM dispatched a team of four photographers for an eight week shoot to capture images of the area Tyson Bidner the New York location manager for the film played a crucial role in securing the rights to nearly every building s likeness needed by ILM Initially there were plans to include OsCorp Tower from The Amazing Spider Man in the film as Disney and Sony Pictures had agreed to it However this idea was abandoned because much of the skyline had already been finalized br Weta Digital assumed responsibility for animating Iron Man during the forest duel taking over from ILM Guy Williams Weta s visual effects supervisor explained We shared assets back and forth with ILM but our pipelines are unique and it s hard for other assets to plug into it But in this case we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different Williams highlighted that the most challenging aspect was reproducing Iron Man s reflective metal surfaces br Scanline VFX handled the reveal shots of the Helicarrier from Black Widow and Captain America s arrival on the carrier deck to its lift off Evil Eye Pictures integrated digital backgrounds into greenscreen footage for scenes set inside the Helicarrier Colin Strause from Hydraulx mentioned their contribution stating We did the opening ten minutes of the movie other than the opening set up in space covering Loki s arrival on Earth and his subsequent escape from the S H I E L D base Luma Pictures focused on the Helicarrier s bridge shots and integrated the graphic monitor displays developed by Cantina Creative Fuel VFX handled shots in and around Tony Stark s penthouse at Stark Tower Digital Domain crafted the asteroid environment where Loki encounters The Other Method Design based in Los Angeles was responsible for the film s closing credits Steve Viola creative director at Method Design described it as a two minute self contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG He explained that they designed modeled textured and lit all environments and many foreground objects for each shot Assets from Marvel were modified extensively to create a post battle macro sequence Method Design also crafted a custom typeface for the main title of The Avengers as well as in scene credits br br br Music br br In November Marvel announced that Alan Silvestri who scored Captain America The First Avenger would compose the score for The Avengers Silvestri commented on the challenge of the project stating I ve worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it s a very different situation It s very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together Silvestri collaborated with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London England to develop the score Whedon praised Silvestri s approach stating The score is very old fashioned which is why Silvestri was letter perfect

a rare A grade on an A to F scale br Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review of the film remarking It s clamorous the save the world story is one everyone s seen time and again and the characters have been around for more than half a century in comic book issues But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish however familiar is irresistibly tasty again To Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster It s also the blockbuster Travers said I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny stupendously exciting package It s Transformers with a brain a heart and a working sense of humor Justin Chang of Variety wrote Like a superior state of the art model built from reconstituted parts Joss Whedon s buoyant witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash up is escapism of a sophisticated order boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this minute team origin story Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times complimented the film s frenetic pace while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times commented that it provides its fans with exactly what they desire Whether it is exactly what they deserve is

alongside Downey The Village Voice s Karina Longworth concluded Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd genius who in contrast to the preening hunks on the team knows better than to draw attention to himself Travers asserted that the actor resonated a scruffy warmth and humor vibe while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he s at war every moment with himself The film finally solves the Hulk problem He s a lot more fun in small doses br Referring to Downey Joe Morgenstein of The Wall Street Journal despite complimenting Downey s performance favored his work in Iron Man over his acting in The Avengers His Iron Man is certainly a team player but Mr Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers a character of established sophistication the industrialist inventor Tony Stark a sharp tongued man of the world and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self irony Neumaier praised Evans stating that he accurately conveyed his character s internal conflicts br Commentators appreciated the character development and dialogue Associated Press reviewer Christy Lemire wrote that the script sparkles as brightly as the special effects these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but they re well fleshed out underneath Scott suggested that certain parts of the film exuded a charm
