young Rohirrim warrior Daniel Falconer has a cameo as an Elvish archer at the battle br br br Comparison to the source material br br Screenwriters did not originally script The Two Towers as its own film The Lord of the Rings trilogy was initially written as a two part series to be produced by Miramax with parts of The Two Towers written as the conclusion to The Fellowship of the Ring The two films became a trilogy under New Line and writers Jackson Walsh and Boyens shuffled their scripts br The most distinct difference from the book by J R R Tolkien is its structure Tolkien s The Two Towers is split into two parts opening with the war in Rohan and concluding with focus on the journey of Frodo and Sam The film omits the book s opening Boromir s death which was used as a linear climax at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring Where the book ends with the Fellowship going to Isengard and Frodo s confrontation with Shelob the film climaxes with the Battle of Helm s Deep leaving the aforementioned scenes for the film adaptation of The Return of the King This was done partly to fit more closely the timeline indicated by the book br In the film Th oden is possessed by Saruman whereas in the book he is depicted as depressed and deluded by Wormtongue Afterwards in the film Th oden is still unsure of what to do and flees to Helm s Deep In the book he rides out to war only ending up besieged when he considers helping Erkenbrand Erkenbrand does not exist in the films his character is combined with omer as the Rohirrim general who arrives with Gandalf at the film s end omer himself is present during the entire battle in the book br On the way to Helm s Deep the refugees from Edoras are attacked by Wargs similar to a scene in The Fellowship of the Ring where the Fellowship battles a group of Wargs Here a new subplot is created where Aragorn falls over a cliff and is assumed to be dead Jackson stated that he added it to create tension This scene also resonates with a new subplot regarding Arwen where she decides to leave Middle earth after losing hope in the long term possibilities of her love In the book Arwen s role is primarily recorded in the Appendices and she is never depicted as considering such an act br A larger change was originally planned Arwen and Elrond would visit Galadriel and Arwen would accompany an army of Elves to Helm s Deep to fight alongside Aragorn During shooting the script changed both from writers coming up with better ideas to portray the romance between Aragorn and Arwen as well as poor fan reaction The new scene of Arwen leaving for the West was created and the conversation scene remains edited to be a flashback to a conversation between them in Rivendell on the evening before the Fellowship s departure A conversation between Elrond and Galadriel in Lothl rien was edited to be a telepathic one Nonetheless one major change already filmed remained that could not be reversed the Elven warriors fighting at Helm s Deep although Jackson and Boyens found this romantic and stirring and a reference to how in the Appendices of The Return of the King Galadriel and the Elves of Lothl rien and Thranduil of Mirkwood were first attacked by an army out of Dol Guldur in Mirkwood and then later counter attacked and assaulted the fortress itself br Another change is the fact Treebeard does not immediately decide to go to war This adds to the tension and Boyens describes it as making Merry and Pippin more than luggage Here the Hobbits show Treebeard what Saruman has done to the forest prompting his decision to act Another structural change is that the Hobbits meet Gandalf the White early on explaining why the Hobbits do not react to his return when they meet him again following Isengard s destruction This was explained in the book by Gandalf arriving at Isengard in the middle of the night to talk to Treebeard br The filmmakers decision to leave Shelob for the third film meant that Faramir had to become an obstacle for Frodo and Sam In the book Faramir like Aragorn quickly recognises the Ring as a danger and a temptation and does not hesitate long before letting Frodo and Sam go In the film Faramir first decides that the Ring shall go to Gondor and his father Denethor as a way to prove his worth In the film Faramir takes Frodo Sam and the Ring to the Battle of Osgiliath they do not go there in the book Jackson winks to readers with Sam s line By all rights we shouldn t even be here but we are After seeing how strongly the Ring affects Frodo during the Nazg l attack Faramir changes his mind and lets them go These changes reshape the book s contrast between Faramir and Boromir who in The Fellowship of the Ring attempted to take the Ring for himself On the other hand which can be seen only in the film s extended version it is actually their father who wants the Ring and urges Boromir to get it while Faramir only wants to prove himself to his father Boyens contends these plot changes were needed to keep the Ring menacing Wenham commented on the DVD documentaries that he had not read the book prior to reading the script so the film s version of Faramir was the Faramir he knew When he later read the book and noticed the major difference he approached the writers about it and they explained to him that if he did say I wouldn t pick that thing up even if it lay by the wayside it would basically strip the One Ring of all corruptive power br The meaning of the title itself The Two Towers was changed While Tolkien considered several possible sets of towers he eventually created a final cover illustration and wrote a note included at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring which identified them as Minas Morgul and Orthanc Jackson s film names them as Orthanc and Barad d r symbolic of an evil alliance out to destroy Men that forms the film s plot point The film depicted Saruman openly presenting himself outright as Sauron s servant whereas this association was not explicitly stated in the novel and indeed analysis by Gandalf and Aragorn in the chapter The White Rider stated that there was a rivalry instead as Saruman was afraid of the prospect of being at war with Sauron if Rohan and Gondor fell br br br Production br br br Production design br When Alan Lee joined the project in late Helm s Deep was the first structure he was tasked to design At scale it was one of the first miniatures built for the film and was part of the minute video that sold the project to New Line It was primarily drawn from an illustration Lee had once done for the book though the curved wall featured in the film was proposed by fellow illustrator and designer John Howe Used in the film for wide shots Jackson also used this miniature to plan the battle using toy soldiers br Helm s Deep a pivotal part of the film s narrative was built at Dry Creek Quarry with its gate a ramp and a wall which included a removable section as well as the tower on a second level A scale miniature of Helm s Deep that ran feet m wide was used for forced perspective shots as well as the major explosion sequence br The film explores the armies of Middle earth John Howe was the basic designer of the evil forces of Middle Earth with the Uruk hai being the first army approved by Jackson Howe also designed a special crossbow for the Uruk Hai characters which was significant because it did not require external tools to rearm This design was the realisation of a th century manuscript Also created were Elven suits of armour for which emphasis was placed on Autumnal colours due to the theme of Elves leaving Middle earth Two hundred and fifty suits were also made for the Rohirrim The designs for Rohan were based on Germanic and Anglo Saxon patterns with most of the weapons designed by John Howe and forged by Peter Lyon Each sword took to days to make br The exterior of the Rohirrim s capital of Edoras including its thatched roofs took six months to build on Mount Sunday The interior of the buildings doubled as offices and lunch halls The interior of the Hall of Edoras was filmed at Stone Street Studios with tapestries designed by Lee and Th oden s wooden throne was partly created by his daughter Hill endured heavy make up for the possession scene where his skin was pulled back and released for increased wrinkles Dourif shaved off his eyebrows and put potato flakes as dandruff in his hair for unnerving effect br Through Frodo and Sam s story the film also provides a look at Mordor and Gondor Barad d r is fully seen in a tracking shot a design which Howe called a mockery of Gothic Cathedrals He and Lee created the Black Gate though a typo in the script made the miniature into two and Osgiliath a ruined city reflecting London during the Blitz or Berlin in The set on a backlot was based around a bridge and reused some of Moria br br br Principal photography br br The Two Towers shared principal photography with The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King The trilogy was filmed between October and December The scenes which take place in Rohan were shot earlier in the production during which time Viggo Mortensen Orlando Bloom and John Rhys Davies s stunt double Brett Beattie sustained many injuries Mortensen broke two toes when he kicked an Orc helmet while filming the scene in which he Legolas and Gimli find the remains of the Uruk hai and believe Merry and Pippin to be dead a shot which is included in the film Furthermore during filming Bloom fell off his horse and cracked three ribs and Beattie dislocated his knee These injuries led to the actors suffering two days of pain during the running sequence in the first act of the film leading Jackson to jokingly refer to them as The Walking Wounded br The filming of the Battle of Helm s Deep took approximately three months with most of the nighttime shots handled by John Mahaffie Some injuries were sustained during the filming of the sequence including Mortensen chipping his tooth and Bernard Hill s ear getting slashed The sequence also features extras who insulted each other in M ori and improvised scenes such as the Uruk hai stamping their spears before the beginning of the battle However there was alleged annoyance among the film s crew for the strength of the gates which were claimed to be too reinforced during the Battering Ram scene Mortensen greatly respected the stunt team and head bumped them often as a sign of that respect br Wood and Astin were joined by Serkis on April br br br Special effects br As with The Fellowship of the Ring Jim Rygiel served as the visual effects supervisor for The Two Towers while newcomer Joe Letteri joined the visual effects team to supervise Andy Serkis s motion capture performance in the creation of the character Gollum During the production of The Two Towers Weta Digital doubled their staff members of In total they would produce minutes of digital effects with shots The film would feature their first challenge in creating a battle scene as well as creating two digital characters who needed to act rather than be a set piece unlike the previous film s Cave Troll and Balrog br br Gollum br br Weta began animating Gollum in late to convince New Line they could achieve the effect Andy Serkis played Gollum by providing his voice and movements on set as well as performing within the motion capture suit later on His scenes were filmed twice with and without him Originally Gollum was set to solely be a CGI character but Jackson was so impressed by Serkis audition tape that they used him on set as well br Gollum s CGI model was also redesigned during when Serkis was cast as Sm agol Gollum s former self so as to give the impression Andy Serkis as Sm agol transforms into the CGI Gollum The original model can still be glimpsed briefly in the first film Over Christmas the crew proceeded to reanimate all the previous shots accordingly within two months Another problem was that the crew realised that the cast performed better in the takes which physically included Serkis In the end the CGI Gollum was rotoscoped and animated on top of these scenes br Serkis s motion capture was generally used to animate Gollum s body except for some difficult shots such as him crawling upside down Gollum s face was animated manually often using recordings of Serkis as a guide Gino Acevedo supervised realistic skin tones which took four hours per frame to render br While the novel alludes to a division within his mind the film depicts him as having a split personality The two personas the childlike Sm agol and the evil Gollum are established during a scene in which they argue over remaining loyal to Frodo The two personalities talk to each other as established by contrasting camera angles and by Serkis altering his voice and physicality for each persona br br Treebeard br Treebeard took between and hours per frame to render For scenes where he interacts with Merry and Pippin a foot tall puppet was built on a wheel Weta took urethane moulds of tree bark and applied them to the sculpt of Treebeard to create his wooden skin Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd sat on bicycle seats concealed into Treebeard s hands to avoid discomfort and were left alone on set sitting in the puppet s hands during breaks The puppet was shot against bluescreen br br br Score br br The musical score for The Two Towers was composed orchestrated and conducted by Howard Shore who also composed the music for the other two films in the series While the scores for its predecessor and sequel won the Academy Award for Best Score the soundtrack for The Two Towers was not nominated Initially there was confusion over the score s eligibility due to a new rule applying to sequels but the academy did declare it eligible br The score features The London Philharmonic Orchestra London Voices The London Oratory School Schola and several vocal and instrumental soloists including soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian and Irish fiddler and violinist Dermot Crehan who also performed on the Hardanger fiddle which is used in this film in conjunction with the various Rohan themes br The funeral song owyn sings during her cousin Th odred s entombment in the extended edition is styled to be a traditional song of the Rohirrim and has lyrics in their language Rohirric represented by Old English The song does not appear in the book and the tune is a variation upon a theme of the r mur Icelandic folk tradition it can be heard as part of track in the recording of a musical version of the Edda by Sequentia br The soundtrack was recorded at Abbey Road Studios The soundtrack has a picture of Peter Jackson barefoot the composer and two producers crossing Abbey Road referencing The Beatles album

response br br On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes The Two Towers holds an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The website s critics consensus reads The Two Towers balances spectacular action with emotional storytelling leaving audiences both wholly satisfied and eager for the final chapter Metacritic which uses a weighted average has assigned the film a score of out of based on reviews indicating universal acclaim Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale a grade up from the A earned by the previous film br Like its predecessor The Two Towers was released to universal critical acclaim and is widely considered to be one of the greatest sequels in cinema history Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three stars out of four describing it as one of the most spectacular swashbucklers ever made and stating It is not faithful to the spirit of Tolkien and misplaces much of the charm and whimsy of the books but it stands on its own as a visionary thriller Nev Pierce for the BBC gave the film four stars out of five and wrote that while it lacked the first film s wow factor it surpassed The Fellowship of the Ring in terms of wit action and narrative drive Pierce described Gollum as the first believable CG character and the Battle of Helm s Deep as one of the finest most expansive combat sequences ever filmed Writing for The Observer Philip French described The Two Towers as a stunning visual epic French commended the battle scenes and the visual style of the film relating it to the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich the Pre Raphaelites Art Nouveau illustrations for children s books and the apocalyptic biblical landscapes of the Victorian visionary John Martin He concluded the review looking forward to the release of the final chapter writing This is likely to be happier more decisive and infinitely more satisfying than anything that will happen to our world in the next months br Joe Morgenstern for The Wall Street Journal lauded the narrative construction of The Two Towers Elaborate preparations are required for the payoff in this instalment the massing of troops plus much individual struggle as splintered groups of the Fellowship make their separate ways toward the defining battle of Helm s Deep Yet these preparations count as payoffs too Seldom has a popular entertainment set its stage so carefully or evocatively with such lavish respect for its audience Morgenstern also highlighted the digital effects and the battle scenes and said of the series The Lord of the Rings continues to stake its singular claim on movie history it s a gift of epic proportions In his review for the Evening Standard Alexander Walker wrote that the Battle of Helm s Deep was probably the greatest battlepiece composed for the screen since Eisenstein s Ivan the Terrible and that with The Two Towers the trilogy had achieved a majestic proportion chivalric and quixotic earthly and magical an experience that reaches beyond the dimensions of the cinema screen and somehow reflects the global unease of the world in the first years of the st century br In his review for Newsweek David Ansen commended Jackson s direction of the battle scenes writing Few people can stage a battle and the eyepopping siege of Helms Deep is one of the most spectacular you ll ever see with such sweep and clarity that the carnage doesn t seem an oppressive end in itself Ansen also praised the complexity of the character of Gollum commenting While everyone else in Tolkien s myth falls neatly into the camps of Good and Evil the self lacerating Gollum is at war with himself In an epic drenched in medievalism he s the dangerously ambiguous voice of the modern Caroline Westbrook for Empire gave the film five stars out of five and wrote It may lack the first view thrill and natural dramatic shape of Fellowship but this is both funnier and darker than the first film and certainly more action packed An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time Westbrook lauded Jackson s ability to temper the spectacular scenes with some heartstring tugging moments peasants despondent as they are forced to abandon their villages Aragorn and Arwen s troubled relationship and of course the return of Gandalf Sir Ian McKellen superb as ever one of the film s most powerful memorable images that may well leave Ring devotees a little misty eyed br A less enthusiastic review was written in The Guardian by Peter Bradshaw who had already written a mixed review of The Fellowship of the Ring Bradshaw gave The Two Towers three stars out of five appreciating it as a very watchable distinctive if over extended FX spectacle However he commented that the film could not be taken as a serious evocation of good and evil and dismissed the subject as lots and lots of interminable nerdish nonsense br The Battle of Helm s Deep has been named by CNN as one of the greatest screen battles of all time while Gollum was named as the third favourite computer generated film character by Entertainment Weekly in br br br Accolades br br
