is later diagnosed with terminal cancer and he leaves Vanessa without warning so she will not have to watch him die br A mysterious recruiter approaches Wade and offers him an experimental treatment for his cancer He is taken to a laboratory run by Ajax and Angel Dust who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes in his body They subject Wade to days of torture to trigger any mutation he may have without success When Wade discovers Ajax s real name is Francis and mocks him for it Ajax leaves Wade in a hypobaric chamber that periodically takes him to the verge of asphyxiation over a weekend This activates a regenerative healing factor that counteracts Wade s cancer but leaves him severely disfigured with tumor like scars all over his body He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax but relents when told his condition can be cured In the chaos Ajax subdues Wade and leaves him for dead br Wade survives due to his new healing abilities and seeks out Vanessa but does not reveal that he is alive out of fear that she will shun him because of his new appearance After consulting with his best friend Weasel Wade decides to hunt down Ajax for the cure He becomes a vigilante adopting the name Deadpool from Weasel picking him in a dead pool and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al Throughout the next year he questions and kills many of Ajax s associates until one the recruiter reveals Ajax s whereabouts This information allows Wade to enact the ambush He kills all of Ajax s henchmen subdues Ajax and demands the cure but the X Men Colossus and his trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead interrupt him Colossus attempts to convince Wade to mend his ways and join the X Men but Wade turns him down Taking advantage of this distraction Ajax escapes and regroups with Angel Dust They then head to Weasel s bar where Ajax hears of Vanessa br Ajax kidnaps Vanessa and takes her to a decommissioned Helicarrier in a scrapyard In response Wade convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him get her back They battle Angel Dust and a group of Ajax s men while Wade fights his way to Ajax During the battle Negasonic accidentally destroys the

He reveals that a cure never existed and despite Colossus s pleas Wade kills Ajax Vanessa berates Wade for leaving her but reconciles with him after she sees his disfigured face and learns the reason he never came back to her br In a post credits scene Wade imitates the post credits scene of Ferris Bueller s Day Off stating they only have enough money left to announce that Cable will show up in the sequel br br br Cast br br Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson Deadpool A wisecracking mutant mercenary with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental cancer treatment The writers described Deadpool as fun to hang out with in short doses Reynolds promised a more authentic and comic faithful version of the character than the one he portrayed in X Men Origins Wolverine The character becomes aware he is in a film after becoming Deadpool though before this Wilson does make a joke about Reynolds s role in Green Lantern br Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle An escort and Wilson s fianc e Baccarin described Vanessa as scrappy and not a damsel in distress The character was initially designed as a typical prostitute but Baccarin worked with the costume and makeup teams to make her appearance more layered The film does not explore the character s comic alter ego Copycat as the writers wanted to focus on Deadpool Makeup designer Bill Corso however included some references to Copycat s blue appearance in the comics br Ed Skrein as Francis Freeman Ajax The artificially mutated leader of the program that creates Deadpool He is immune to pain and has enhanced strength and reflexes Director Tim Miller praised Skrein s dedication to the role saying he worked really really hard for the fight sequences and completed around of his own stunts in the film Skrein was influenced by Rutger Hauer s Roy Batty from Blade Runner and serial killer Harold Shipman br T J Miller as Weasel Wilson s best friend Miller felt he was cast as the character because he looks like his superhero power is spilling mustard on his shirt Producer Simon Kinberg added that an actor was needed who could keep up with Reynolds comedically Miller attempted to give the character a facial tic but director Tim Miller rejected the idea br Gina Carano as Angel Dust An artificially mutated member of the program that creates Deadpool She uses her adrenaline as fuel to increase her strength and durability to superhuman levels Director Miller personally called Carano and asked her to take the part Carano felt the character s rage and extreme adrenaline issues made comparisons to the drug angel dust fitting She had wanted to wear yellow contact lenses to match the character s look in the comics but Corso turned the idea down comparing it to something from the Twilight films br Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead A teenaged X Men trainee who can generate atomic bursts from her body The filmmakers wanted to use the character based on her name and looked to change her comic abilities from telepathic and precognitive powers to a literal warhead They required permission from Marvel to do this which Tim Miller obtained after talking with Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige A deal was reached allowing the change in exchange for th Century Fox giving Marvel Studios the film rights to the character Ego the Living Planet for use in their film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol br Stefan Kapi i provides the voice of Colossus an X Men who can transform his entire body into organic steel Writer Rhett Reese called him a great foil to Deadpool because he s very self serious and goody two shoes Director Miller changed the character drastically from his previous film appearances where he was portrayed by Daniel Cudmore Miller felt the Cudmore version which he described as t hat dude with the shiny skin was not Colossus He wanted the character to be seven and a half feet tall Andre Tricoteux was the body double of Colossus on set and Kapi i was cast to give the character an authentic Russian accent like he has in the comics br Leslie Uggams portrays Blind Al an elderly blind woman and Deadpool s roommate Uggams said that Al has been through British Intelligence she s done all kinds of wild and crazy things she s old but she s feisty Uggams added that Al has a love hate relationship with Deadpool Karan Soni appears as Dopinder a taxi driver who befriends Deadpool and Jed Rees portrays a recruiter for Ajax X Men co creator Stan Lee and Deadpool co creator Rob Liefeld make cameo appearances as a strip club emcee and a patron of Weasel s bar respectively Rob Hayter makes a cameo appearance as Bob Agent of Hydra a recurring character in the comics alongside Deadpool The rights for Bob are owned by Marvel Studios They did not give permission for him to be used in the film so his comic history and connections to the Hydra organization are not referenced in the film He is explained instead as a former special forces operative like Wilson Hugh Jackman who portrayed Logan Wolverine in the X Men film series was very supportive of Deadpool and it making fun of himself and his character He is seen in the film on a People magazine Sexiest Man Alive cover A scene featuring Nathan Fillion as a bathroom attendant was cut but was included in the deleted scenes of the home media release br br br Production br br br Development br Artisan Entertainment announced a deal with Marvel Entertainment in May to co produce finance and distribute several films based on Marvel Comics characters including Deadpool By February writer and director David S Goyer and Ryan Reynolds were working on a Deadpool film at New Line Cinema They had worked together on the Marvel film Blade Trinity Reynolds was interested in the part of Deadpool after learning that in the comics the character refers to his appearance as Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar Pei New Line Cinema executive Jeff Katz who thought Reynolds was the only actor suitable for the role championed the idea However there were rights issues with th Century Fox and their X Men films and the project did not move forward br By March Reynolds learned that Fox had expressed interest in a film featuring Deadpool The character was set to make a cameo appearance in the film X Men Origins Wolverine with Reynolds cast in the part His role was expanded during the film s production Katz was an executive at Fox at that point and said that Deadpool was nicely set up to be explored in his own way in a future film The film s portrayal deviates from the original comic character imbuing him with several superpowers and sewing his mouth shut Deadpool apparently dies in the film though a post credits scene showing him still alive was added to the film shortly before its release After the successful opening weekend of Wolverine Fox officially began development on Deadpool with Reynolds attached to star and X Men producer Lauren Shuler Donner involved The spinoff was set to ignore the Wolverine version of Deadpool and return to the character s roots with a slapstick tone and a propensity to break the fourth wall br Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick were hired to write the script in January Reynolds who worked closely with them said they were chosen because Tonally they got it They just understood Deadpool right off the bat By that June Robert Rodriguez had been asked to direct the film He confirmed this a month later saying he had been sent a really good script and was considering taking on the project By October he was no longer interested in it and Adam Berg was being looked at to direct the film In April Tim Miller was hired after working on the visual effects for some of the X Men films in part because of his work creating animated short films These included the Academy Award winning Gopher Broke and a DC Universe Online trailer which was epic and cinematic everything Fox wanted their comic book movies to be Miller would make his directorial debut with the film while Reynolds closed a deal with Fox to produce the film br Reynolds Green Lantern superhero film was released later in and was a disappointment This tainted the Deadpool project Fox executives were already concerned about its R rated content After several meetings the studio agreed the film could not be reconfigured for a more traditional PG rating and gave Miller a low six figure budget to produce some test footage He created the footage using CGI at his animation company Blur Studio in with Reynolds voicing Deadpool The footage did not convince Fox to green light the film After the successful May release of Marvel Studios s The Avengers Reese and Wernick thought Deadpool might be approved as an already developed superhero film Fox was actually even more doubtful about the script however and began exploring ways to include Deadpool in an Avengers esque team up film At different times during development James Cameron and David Fincher both friends of Miller read the film s script and championed the project to Fox executives br br The test footage was leaked online in July and was met with an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response That September Fox gave Deadpool a release date of February Production was set to begin in March with Simon Kinberg joining as producer Reynolds attributed Fox s green lighting of the film entirely to the leak He Miller and the writers had previously discussed leaking the footage themselves and Reynolds initially thought that Miller had done so He later believed the leak came from someone at Fox In exchange for being able to make the film the way they wanted Fox gave the crew a much smaller budget than is typical for superhero films br br br Writing br Reese and Wernick wrote a draft of the script every year for six years before completing the film with around percent of the first draft ending up in the final film Reese described Reynolds as the keeper of the Deadpool flame for many years if we ever do something that is off the Deadpool path or if it doesn t feel like Deadpool he catches it The writers did not want the film to be an origin story but Reynolds disagreed They settled on a modern Deadpool story as well as the origin story connected by Deadpool s narration and fourth wall breaking This helped to balance the darker origin story with the cartoon like Deadpool scenes It also allowed the opening fight sequence to be extended through the first half of the film with the origin story told throughout saving money on additional fight scenes This fight sequence labeled the Twelve Bullets Fight reimagines the original test footage Once the origin story is told Deadpool uses a fast forward button to return the audience to the present day br In October Kinberg confirmed that Deadpool would be set in the same shared universe as the X Men films but would stand independently The writers wanted a traditional X Men in the film as a foil to Deadpool and felt Colossus was a character who had not been explored much in previous films Miller wanted more superhero stuff instead of just Deadpool and a lot of guns The character Negasonic Teenage Warhead was added as a trainee X Men mentored by Colossus She was chosen for her name from the list of comic characters available for use by Fox The characters Garrison Kane Wyre and Sluggo were included in the script at one point but ultimately removed for budgetary reasons These villains were replaced by a single character Angel Dust Cannonball Emrys Killebrew Patch and Tar Baby were also considered The Cable character was also set to appear but was eventually pushed to a potential sequel so this film could get Deadpool on his feet first br The writers worked to keep the script s pop culture references up to date throughout its development Kinberg confirmed the film would make fun of Deadpool s portrayal in X Men Origins Wolverine It also includes jokes at the expense of Green Lantern While Miller felt it was okay for audience members not to understand all of the film s jokes he wanted to avoid anything targeted specifically at comic fans He was not in favor of any joke the audience needs to look up on the internet after the movie ends The film s post credits scene is a parody of the equivalent scene from Ferris Bueller s Day Off where the title character of that film breaks the fourth wall like Deadpool In the parody scene Deadpool wears a bath robe and tells the audience to go home He also confirms that Cable will appear in the sequel After reading the scene a Fox executive described the film as a combination of Ferris Bueller s Day Off and Natural Born Killers a description the writers felt was accurate br br Forty eight hours before the film received the official green light from Fox the studio cut its budget by million down to million This forced a last minute re write that saw about nine pages cut from the page script Changes included the removal of a motorcycle chase at the end of the Twelve Bullets Fight and having Deadpool forget his bag of guns before the final battle sequence to avoid having to shoot a costly gun fight in the third act Reese said It was that last lean and mean chop that got us to a place where Fox was willing to make it The script was very efficient and not too long That was a function of budget more than anything but I think it really made the movie pace nicely br br br Pre production br In January T J Miller and Ed Skrein were in talks to appear in the film with Miller as an additional comic voice and Skrein as a villain A month later Fox was testing actresses to portray the female lead including Morena Baccarin Taylor Schilling Crystal Reed Rebecca Rittenhouse Sarah Greene and Jessica De Gouw Gina Carano was cast as Angel Dust and Miller was confirmed for an unspecified role Baccarin was cast as Deadpool s love interest before the end of February Colossus actor Daniel Cudmore said he would not be reprising the role for Deadpool and declined an offer to provide reference for a CG version of the character to be voiced by another actor br An immediate focus during pre production was Deadpool s suit Russ Shinkle and Film Illusions were hired to create the costume Shinkle noted that comic book art is fairly over the top in terms of physique and he tried to balance that with reality Reynolds did not wear a muscle suit under the costume which Tim Miller felt gave it a slimmer quintessential Deadpool look Miller and Reynolds wept when they saw the completed costume Reynolds explained we fought like hell to make this the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation fans have ever seen That s hard to accomplish and a feat but we re just so happy with how this came out The costume was designed with the film s stunts in mind The mask s eye areas were removable so versions of the eyes better suited for the stunts could be used without having to change the whole mask The suit was difficult for the visual effects team to replicate with CGI Visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart blamed this on the suit s fabric He described it as mesh that allowed dirt to get into the gutters and the cracks so when the light hits it it still takes that orangey hue but as soon as it goes in the shadow it dropped to this more blueish of the dirt Film Illusions made six hero versions of the costume and twelve stunt specific versions along with three hero versions of Negasonic Teenage Warhead s costume br Miller wanted Deadpool s scarred appearance to make him appear fucking horrible to justify his anger Makeup designer Bill Corso had some leeway because in the comics he s everything from a rotten corpse to a guy with a couple of lines on his face Corso acknowledged the script s description of the character as disfigured but also wanted him to be kind of charming and iconic He wanted to avoid comparisons with Freddy Krueger and looked to Sin City for inspiration The final makeup required nine silicone prosthetics to cover Reynolds head which took several hours to apply For the scene where the character is naked it took six hours to apply Reynolds full body makeup Corso described the makeup for the rest of the film s characters as pretty simple Tim wanted to keep it really grounded br br br Filming br Principal photography began on March in Vancouver British Columbia under the working title Wham Filming took place at North Shore Studios and on location around the city The production hired more than locals as actors extras and crew members T J Miller and Baccarin were revealed to be playing Weasel and Vanessa respectively Skrein confirmed he was in the film playing Ajax Newcomer Brianna Hildebrand was cast as Negasonic Teenage Warhead br Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng wanted the film to look grittier and less clean and glossy than other superhero films They decided to shoot with digital cameras but add film grain in post production to give the images texture Seng used Super Baltar lenses and Cooke zooms for the origin story timeline and Panavision Primo lenses for the Deadpool scenes which gave them more clarity The film s exterior scenes have a consistent overcast look but location shooting came with unpredictable weather For instance the production had use of the Georgia Viaduct for two weeks and shot rain or shine before their permit expired Seng used more lighting on cloudy days and less on sunny days to keep a consistent look Production designer Sean Haworth who had specific ideas for the sets also worked closely with Miller The production had to be very specific about which elements of each set were constructed to conserve the budget for visual effects For the final scrapyard scene garbage was built to a certain height to be extended with CGI A gimbal was used for a tilting section of the yard that had to interact with many digital elements The final sequence was filmed in a naval yard dressed with scrap metal Rubber casts of the metal were made for stunts br br When Fox was unwilling to pay Reese and Wernick to be on set every day Reynolds paid their salaries The writers had scripted the action very specifically every kill and almost down to every punch kick or shot but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators were free to change this Robert Alonzo and Philip J Silvera were the film s stunt coordinators Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage The stunt team had a month before filming began to prepare the actors Skrein worked nonstop to prepare Silvera said Reynolds has a photographic memory he d do something three or four times and remember it very well A lot of the film s jokes were improvised on set particularly by Reynolds He said the actors often came up with around alternate jokes for each one in the script and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints For example Reese said Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic Instead Reynolds improvised the line on set It s funny that I only ever see two of you It s almost like the studio couldn t afford another X Men This was based in truth and became then Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos favorite line Filming ended on May br br br Post production br Leslie Uggams said that she was in the film in July playing the role of Blind Al Tim Miller stated that Jed Rees portrays The Recruiter and did a good job of being creepy and syrupy sweet Miller explained that Colossus would be a solely CGI creation in the film with Andre Tricoteux cast to provide motion reference on set for the role along with the voice In December the voice of Colossus was recast with Stefan Kapi i taking over the role He completed his work eight weeks before the film was scheduled for release br As soon as editor Julian Clarke began selecting shots for the film they were color graded by EFILM s Tim Stipan to ensure they all matched Stipan colored the characters slightly differently He gave Deadpool a dark modern touch and Colossus a particular vibrancy and substance Clarke edited each scene focusing on humor choosing between alternate takes of jokes He removed jokes made after Vanessa is kidnapped because they felt inappropriately timed He cut down other scenes with fewer jokes such as Wilson being tortured as they were too much It would take the audience too long to recover and get back in the irreverent spirit of the movie During editing a linear version of the film was produced Clarke decided to go with interweaving the timelines to balance the different serious and silly tones br One sequence removed from the film saw Wilson and Vanessa travel to Mexico looking for a cure after he turned down the recruiter It was removed for pacing reasons and replaced with a short scene of Wilson sitting beside his window that was originally filmed to show him thinking about his diagnosis In its new context the scene implies him re thinking the recruiter s offer br Because of the animation required for Deadpool s mask and Colossus Reese and Wernick had more freedom than usual to keep adjusting the script during post production Reynolds recorded new dialogue using his iPhone and then re recorded the lines in an additional dialogue recording session once the film was finalized Lines added after filming included Reynolds doing an impression of Wolverine star Hugh Jackman s natural Australian accent and another where Deadpool asks whether the character Professor X is being portrayed by James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart at that point in the X Men timeline This became a favorite line in the film for many audience members br br br Visual effects br Digital Domain DD Atomic Fiction Blur Studio Weta Digital Rodeo FX and Luma Pictures produced Deadpool s visual effects Reynolds credited Miller and his visual effects experience with producing a film that looked like others made with bigger budgets Motion capture supervisor Greg LaSalle agreed noting that Miller held off working on the CGI for Colossus until after the film was edited to avoid spending money on shots that would not be used Miller worked with visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart to design and complete the film s effects shots more than originally planned of them were completed in the last four weeks of production br br Colossus s movements were re recorded with performer T J Storm as Tricoteux had been unable to move athletically because of the platform shoes he wore on set to replicate the character s height LaSalle was used for his facial performance DD then mapped these performances onto a digital model that was designed to be comic accurate The team sought specific reference for Colossus s metallic finish to avoid looking chromey visiting a metal company to look at samples They settled on cold rolled steel with the darker hot rolled steel used for his hair The model also includes ridges which could be moved separately to keep them perfectly straight as in the comic books DD also created the model of Deadpool that was used by all the FX vendors His mask was animated around the eyes to be expressive as in the comics This helped balance out the chinwag coming through the bottom of the mask as Reynolds acted Fully replacing Deadpool s head was going to be too costly so Weta Digital warped each shot based on facial references from Reynolds and adjusted the lighting to reflect the changes instead This was called an ingenious D ish solution br Atomic Fiction created a freeway environment for the Twelve Bullets Fight with a backdrop based on Detroit Chicago and Vancouver They also created the vehicles used in the sequence These assets were used by Blur for the opening titles which move through a frozen moment where Deadpool is fighting thugs inside a crashing car The amusing titles include Directed by an overpaid tool and Produced by asshats Reynolds Miller and the writers came up with their own credits hoping to set the tone for the film br Luma contributed the film s blood and gore using practical footage as well as digital effects for more complex scenes When Deadpool cuts off his own hand DD did not want to be outdone by Luma and had buckets of blood pouring out Luma created the regrowing hand inspired by the hand of a fetus When Deadpool breaks both his hands DD went through or different versions of what broken fingers could look like For Deadpool s initial scarring from the warehouse fire Rodeo FX referenced rotting fruit and maggot eaten meat The company added a CGI penis to Reynolds in this sequence which visual effects supervisor Wayne Brinton said you don t even notice but when it wasn t there it looked really weird Rodeo also augmented the practical fire in the scene br The vendors all collaborated for the final battle sequence which takes place in the wreckage of a helicarrier Luma created the climactic fight between Deadpool and Ajax DD created most of the Colossus effects until he is damaged when Blur Studio took over DD created the effects for Negasonic Teenage Warhead s abilities as well as expanding the helicarrier s deck Rodeo contributed matte paintings for the background and Weta provided the facial animation for Deadpool Negasonic s abilities were the only supernatural effect sy thing in the film and were based on fuel air explosives and solar flares to try to ground them in reality Setting the final sequence on the wrecked helicarrier was Miller s idea This helped to expand the scope of the third act and include more connections to the comics and the wider Marvel Universe To avoid rights issues with Marvel Studios the helicarrier for Deadpool was designed to be as different as possible from the one in The Avengers Additionally a French animation artist with a unique style created D cartoon characters that dance around Deadpool after he is stabbed in the head during the fight br br br Music br br Tom Holkenborg announced in October that he would compose the score for Deadpool Noting that Deadpool only makes pre musical references Holkenborg decided to use sounds from the s in the movie s main theme such as those of an Oberheim and a Synclavier Several songs were written in to Reese and Wernick s script to be used in the film Some of these ultimately did not work as intended For example the sex montage with Wilson and Vanessa was to play along with Frank Sinatra s version of It Was a Very Good Year in the script but it was changed to Neil Sedaka s Calendar Girl during editing A soundtrack album featuring Holkenborg s score and the songs heard in the film was released digitally on February and physically on March through Milan Records The Deadpool rap was also featured during the Finding Francis montage br br br Marketing br br Due to the film s limited marketing budget Reynolds worked closely with Fox s marketing chief Marc Weinstock to use the Internet to their advantage and come up with cheaper Deadpool based ways to market the film This included unique trailers unconventional billboards promotional tie ins with Super Bowl and Viacom and an extensive social media presence Reynolds kept one of the Deadpool costumes for himself and appeared in it throughout the marketing campaign Visual effects vendor Image Engine animated Deadpool s mask for these appearances using a process similar to that used by Weta Digital for the film Emma Grey Ellis at Wired com described the campaign as crazy and unrelenting with Deadpool waging a marketing siege of every platform you would think of Bobby Anhalt at Screen Rant called it possibly the best film marketing campaign in the history of cinema HostGator s Jeremy Jensen attributed the campaign s success to Reynolds and to Fox for embracing the film s R rating br br br Release br br br Theatrical br Deadpool s world premiere was held at the Grand Rex in Paris on February before its initial theatrical release in Hong Kong the

scored Deadpool three and a half out of four calling it a voraciously self aware comedy and the first R rated Marvel film with real teeth He praised the film s attitude and tone Reynolds for making Deadpool a likeable character and the film s action scenes TheWrap s Alonso Duralde said Deadpool shouldn t work but it absolutely does feeling that it successfully balanced comedy with superhero action and that the chemistry between Reynolds and Baccarin gave enough weight to the plot to support the tone and violence Calvin Wilson at the St Louis Post Dispatch also gave the film three and a

enough humor to support it and that Reynolds was born to play Deadpool Chris Nashawaty graded the film a B for Entertainment Weekly saying it doesn t have the most adrenalized action sequences or the deepest origin story but makes up for that with R rated fun Nashawaty felt Reynolds was the perfect star for the film and is a blast of laughing gas in a genre that tends to take itself way too seriously Tasha Robinson at The Verge felt there was too much juvenile humor She noted the film did not make homophobic racist or sexist jokes and that its overall tone remained joyous despite the material David Edelstein of Vulture said the film s jokes save it from a lack of subtext and strong villains and noted the gratifyingly twisty structure Manohla Dargis at The New York Times was not impressed with the listing of the film s genre cliches in the opening credits before they were used She highlighted the human elements in the film and the moments where Reynolds and Tim Miller did more than hit the same bombastic notes over and over again IndieWire s Kate Erbland gave the film a B praising its style and Reynolds Deadpool for breaking the superhero mold but criticizing the overall film for following genre conventions and focusing on numbing violence and un original swearing and nudity br Writing for the Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan said that Deadpool gets off to a fun start but the character eventually wears out his welcome He noted that though the film has a complicated narrative it is masking a conventional Marvel origin story Turan did highlight the film s romantic element and Baccarin s performance Jonathon Pile of Empire gave the film three out of five saying the number of jokes will soon numb you to their impact He called the film a fun alternative to other superhero films Robbie Collin at The Daily Telegraph also gave the film three out of five saying it is not the future of superhero movies calling it an enjoyably obnoxious detour He felt some of the film s jokes about superhero cliches were out of date by the time the film was released The San Francisco Chronicle s Mick LaSalle did not appreciate the humor fourth wall breaking or violence He concluded the film is bad borderline garbage but disturbing too in that it s just the kind of fake clever awfulness that might be cinema s future br br br Accolades br br Deadpool has received many awards and nominations recognizing the film as a whole as well as the cast s performance particularly Reynolds as Deadpool several technical areas including the film s makeup sound and visual effects and the film s unconventional marketing campaign It was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards four Critics Choice Movie Awards winning two a Directors Guild of America Award five Empire Awards seven Golden Trailer Awards winning two a Hugo Award two Key Art Awards for marketing winning both eight MTV Movie Awards winning two a Producers Guild of America Award four People s Choice Awards winning two three Saturn Awards winning one six Teen Choice Awards winning two and a Writers Guild of America Award br After being nominated for awards such as the Golden Globes Critics Choice and Writers Guild of America Deadpool was considered a serious contender by commentators for several Academy Awards despite its content and tone This included potential nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Makeup and Hairstyling and after its Producers Guild of America nomination Best Picture When the film did not receive any Academy Award nominations it was widely considered to have been snubbed Analyzing potential reasons for this Screen Rant s Alex Leadbeater said that while the film earned a solid thumbs up from most it was generally not praised by top critics for offering any depth or related subversion of its genre He also noted an apparent bias that Academy voters have against superhero films the lack of a targeted campaign for the awards by Fox who did not seem to be expecting any of the film s previous awards either and the number of other films in contention as was all in all a pretty good year for movies A variant cover for Marvel Comics X Men Gold with art by Ron Lim and released in April references Deadpool s Oscar snub br br br Cinematic impact br Before Deadpool s success R rated comic based films considered successful were and Watchmen which earned about half the opening weekend gross of successful PG superhero films Kick Ass a film tonally similar to Deadpool made even less with a million opening Many reasons were given why Deadpool went on to be more successful than these including the popularity of the Marvel brand and Reynolds performance Tom Huddleston Jr wrote for Fortune that Deadpool was proof to Hollywood that R rated films can be as successful as PG films particularly when fans see the rating itself as validation that the film is true to its source material br A Hollywood executive not involved with the film felt it succeeded because it has a self deprecating tone that s riotous It s never been done before It s poking fun at Marvel That label takes itself so seriously can you imagine them making fun of themselves in a movie James Gunn director of Marvel s Guardians of the Galaxy rejected this saying Deadpool was a success because it s original it s damn good and it wasn t afraid to take risks Gunn hoped studios would learn the right lesson from the film and not just try to make more films like Deadpool After Fox s Logan also became a success Forbes Paul Tassi reiterated Gunn s sentiments saying the rating was appropriate given the adult nature of these two heroes but too much stock is being put into unrestrained violence rather than people examining what actually makes these movies work Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter concurred adding Why not take the freedom that comes from that rating and try to re approach the mainstream genre with that attitude br In March a Warner Bros executive said that an R rated DC Extended Universe film could absolutely happen while Sony Pictures began developing an R rated adaptation of the character Venom with a smaller budget inspired by Fox s success with Deadpool and Logan even though Venom was released under the PG rating In June Kevin Feige said in response to the successes that though Marvel Studios was not planning any R rated films for its Marvel Cinematic Universe it s not out of the question After the proposed acquisition of st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December Disney CEO Bob Iger said that the company would be willing to make

alongside Deadpool br br br Deadpool Wolverine br br In March Reese said that a future film focused on X Force would be separate from Deadpool so I think we ll be able to take two paths X Force is where we re launching something bigger but then Deadpool is where we re contracting and staying personal and small After the acquisition of Fox by Disney was announced in December and completed in March Bob Iger said that Deadpool and other Marvel properties at Fox would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU under Marvel Studios In December Reynolds confirmed that a third
