br Cast br Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark Iron Man The benefactor of the Avengers who describes himself as a genius billionaire playboy and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor he made According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo Downey was the only actor to receive the entire screenplay for the film Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that Stark s death was inevitable as a move to selflessness and as an end to the chapter Stark began They felt that his death was earned after granting him the perfect retirement life That s the life he s been striving for They got married they had a kid it was great It s a good death It doesn t feel like a tragedy It feels like a heroic finished life Joe Russo said that Stark always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe and was the most defiant of the Avengers Stark is the most formidable of all of them because of his heart The Russos sought Downey s approval for Stark s arc which they had developed since Captain America Civil War br Chris Evans as Steve Rogers Captain America The leader of the Avengers World War II veteran and former fugitive he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world Markus described Rogers as someone who is moving toward some sort of enlightened self interest McFeely knew that Rogers was going to get his dance that he promised Peggy Carter in Captain America The First Avenger He initially planned to complete Rogers s story arc by killing him off given the character s long life for his occupation before deciding to have Rogers abandon his shield Patrick Gorman provided an on set reference for an elderly Steve Rogers br Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner Hulk An Avenger and genius scientist who because of exposure to gamma radiation transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated Banner balances his two sides with gamma experimentation in this film enabling him to combine his intelligence with the Hulk s strength and physical stature based on his Professor Hulk comic book identity Compared to other heroes who were demotivated by their loss to Thanos Banner is the only character to remain hopeful according to Anthony Russo Banner is the sole character who is actually forging into a bright new future trying to build something totally new and find something completely new Banner is the one who is most heroic in a sense that he maintains his will to keep trying This concludes a character arc that was established in Thor Ragnarok and continued in Avengers Infinity War br Chris Hemsworth as Thor An Avenger and the king of Asgard based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker after the destruction of his hammer Mjolnir in Thor Ragnarok In the film Thor has become an overweight drunken ruler of Asgard s refugees in T nsberg Norway Hemsworth said about this drastic character change I just had an opinion I wanted to do something different this time Each film I ve wanted to in particular the last couple and they were on board and added We shot for many hours and days and discussed how far could we push Thor and what we could do different According to Anthony Russo Even though there s a lot of fun to be had in the movie with his physical condition it s not a gag It s a manifestation of where he is on a character level and we think it s one of the most relatable aspects of him I mean it s a very common sort of response to depression and pain Thor s story was Russo s favorite arc Part of Chris magic as a comedic actor is his dedication to the depth of the character on a very earnest level It s so devious and subversive when comedy is coming from a place of complete commitment and emotional complexity Hemsworth underwent around three hours of hair and makeup work for the transformation which also required him to wear a large silicone prosthetic suit he called himself Lebowski Thor on set Thor was initially supposed to revert to his old chiseled self in the middle of Endgame but Hemsworth wanted to retain Thor s new physique br Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff Black Widow An Avenger and a highly trained spy and former agent of S H I E L D Romanoff continues to command several teams from around the galaxy in the Avengers headquarters at the beginning of the film which Joe Russo said stemmed from her inability to move on from their failure to stop Thanos S he s doing everything she can to try and hold the community together She s the watcher on the wall still On the decision for Romanoff to sacrifice herself for Barton to acquire the Soul Stone to bring everyone back Joe Russo said that it was part of a larger theme of the desires to sacrifice or protect in Infinity War When she gets to that Soul Stone scene I think she understands that the only way to bring the community back is for her to sacrifice herself McFeely said Her journey in our minds had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back She comes from such an abusive terrible mind control background so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back that s a thing she would trade for To prepare for the film Johansson adopted an intense workout regimen which included plyometrics Olympic weightlifting and gymnastics and a time restricted diet All were supervised by her longtime trainer Eric Johnson with whom she had worked since Iron Man the film which introduced her character br Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton Hawkeye A master archer and a former Avenger and agent of S H I E L D who was recently under house arrest McFeely described Barton s dark turn as a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap The film s cold open with the disintegration of Barton s family was initially supposed to be in Infinity War after Thanos snapped it was moved to Endgame however with Markus saying that it was going to blunt the brutality of what Thanos did Joe Russo called it a very tragic scene to open the movie with It s one of the few scenes in the movie that actually makes me tear up when I watch it because I think about my own family And then you think about what would happen to you as a father You d become very self destructive br Don Cheadle as James Rhodey Rhodes War Machine An officer in the U S Air Force and an Avenger who operates the War Machine armor Cheadle described Rhodes s newfound belonging as an Avenger as not so much straddling one foot in the military He s much more on the side of The Avengers than he was prior This is reflected on Rhodes s more instinctive and realistic worldview in the midst of encountering the fantastic according to Cheadle He s definitely got some what the eff is happening attitude more than maybe the rest of them do given his background But it s a trial by fire and he s quickly adapted to what the threat is rather than what he wishes it were br Paul Rudd as Scott Lang Ant Man A former petty criminal and Avenger who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in size while also increasing in strength Lang is portrayed by twins Bazlo and Loen LeClair as a baby by Jackson A Dunn at age and by Lee Moore at age This was Moore s final film before his death in August Markus explained that adding Lang helped with implementing time travel into the film saying we had access to him in the second movie and the fact that he was bringing a whole subset of technology that did have something to do with a different concept of time was like a birthday present br Brie Larson as Carol Danvers Captain Marvel An ex U S Air Force fighter pilot and Avenger whose DNA was altered during an accident giving her superhuman strength energy projection and flight Markus said that Danvers s powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and compared her personality to Rogers s which is sort of a person who s right and knows they re right and doesn t really want to hear it when you tell them they re wrong Danvers has little screen time in the film which McFeely said was not the story we re trying to tell it s the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion and she s the new fresh blood Larson filmed her scenes for Endgame before beginning work on her solo film Captain Marvel which was released first Captain Marvel directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were present for the filming of her scenes in Endgame and gave Danvers s characterization in the film their blessing br Karen Gillan as Nebula An adopted daughter of Thanos and an Avenger who was raised with Gamora After being an antagonist or an anti hero in previous MCU films Nebula undergoes a redemption arc and makes amends for her past actions including an encounter with a past version of herself according to Gillan she is staring her former self in the face and it s really clear how far she s come from that angry bitter and twisted person She s starting to connect with other people and find some level of forgiveness Gillan guessed that Nebula would play a prominent role in the film when she realized that Infinity War and Endgame would be adapted from The Infinity Gauntlet which she had read when she was initially cast as Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy Gillan shared several scenes most of which were improvised with Downey in the film s opening br Danai Gurira as Okoye The general of the Dora Milaje a group of elite women warriors br Benedict Wong as Wong A Master of the Mystic Arts and a companion of Doctor Strange br Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan The former head of security at Stark Industries and Stark s friend and former driver br Bradley Cooper as Rocket A member of

his acting and expressions the character s motion reference Rocket s appearance continues a story arc that was established by Guardians of the Galaxy writer director and Endgame executive producer

CEO of Stark Industries Potts wears a weaponized powered exosuit of armor made for her by Stark based on the Rescue armor Paltrow said this would be her final major appearance in the MCU br Josh Brolin as Thanos An intergalactic warlord from Titan who acquired all six Infinity Stones in Infinity War and triggered the Snap killing half of all life in the universe Joe Russo said that after Thanos was successful in Avengers Infinity War he was done and retired Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older post Infinity War Thanos into the film because the character already had the Infinity Stones until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film s first act Markus said that the character s early death improved his agenda Thanos has less screen time in Endgame than in Infinity War where he was considered the main character According to McFeely We had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain a little bit I don t think anyone in the first half of the movie is going Oh I wish there was a villain You re rolling around in the loss and the time heist and you think it s sort of Avengers against nature The younger version of Thanos was nicknamed Warrior Thanos by the filmmakers In addition to voicing the character Brolin did the motion capture Joe Russo was a stand in for Thanos for some scenes with Nebula br Several actors from

sequel of Avengers Age of Ultron entitled Avengers Infinity War Part was scheduled to be released on May and Part was scheduled for May Marvel s plan was to film both parts of Infinity War back to back Anthony and Joe Russo were hired to direct the films in April The next month Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write screenplays for both parts of the film Producer Kevin Feige said that the sequel was titled as two parts of a single film because of shared elements but they would be two distinct projects not one story split across two films The Russos decided to re title the two films to remove any misconceptions in May and Marvel left the second film untitled that July Feige and the Russo brothers indicated that the title was being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film and Infinity War br Principal photography began on August under the working title Mary Lou at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County Georgia with Trent Opaloch the director of photography The film and Infinity War were shot with ARRI Alexa IMAX D cameras the first time a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras Filming was done that month in the Gulch area of downtown Atlanta near the Five Points MARTA station and in Piedmont Park Feige said that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but were ultimately shot back to back It became too complicated to cross board them like that and we found ourselves again something would always pay the price We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie Anthony Russo originally felt that it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously for financial and logistical reasons including the large number of cast members and had suggested that some days we ll be shooting the first movie and some days we ll be shooting the second movie Just jumping back and forth The Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham England during production of Infinity War in early May Production wrapped on January although additional filming took place in New York s Dutchess and Ulster counties in June Re shoots began by

released digitally by Hollywood Records on April with a physical release on May A video for the track Portals composed for the climactic Avengers assemble scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers was released on June br Silvestri described the score as having the franchise s most versatile tone ranging from thunderous percussion and powerful brass for the action scenes to minimalist jazz inspired music for Ant Man and the Quantum Realm He reprised his themes from the previous Avengers films and Captain America The First Avenger including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in Infinity War Silvestri found writing the music to end Captain America s story poignant since he had been on this journey with him since the beginning The film also used the Ant Man theme by Christophe Beck the Doctor Strange theme by Michael Giacchino and the Captain Marvel theme by Pinar Toprak The songs Come and Get Your Love by Redbone and It s Been a Long Long Time by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn were also used after previously being heard in Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America The Winter Soldier respectively br br br Marketing br The marketing campaign for Endgame cost over million the most for any Marvel Studios film Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer Mastercard Ulta Beauty the Audi e tron GT concept car which appears in the film McDonald s GEICO Coca Cola Google General Mills Hertz Ziploc Oppo and Synchrony Financial A year before the film s release Germain Lussier of io spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film given the end of Infinity War where many established characters die He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns and if the actors playing them would participate in press events leading up to the film s release Lussier felt that Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members most of the living characters but noted that it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters this would create a mystery and curiosity about how they come back and a whole new level of interest for the film while having all the stars front and center Feige said in June that the dead characters would not be featured in the film s marketing He presented a behind the scenes video from the film at CineEurope and said that its marketing campaign would begin at the end of In early December before the first trailer s release Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter spoke about the fevered anticipation surrounding it and felt it remarkable mostly fan created without the noticeable direction from Marvel or the filmmakers involved knowledge about the film without promotion was a kind of brand awareness that was unusual McMillan urged Marvel not to release any trailers for the film since the advanced level of enthusiasm was likely to build before its release a trailer would take away the Schr dinger s cat esque position as it was almost guaranteed to disappoint fans br The first trailer for the film was released on December Dustin Sandoval vice president of digital marketing for Marvel Studios said that the marketing team made the choice to omit the title or hashtag for the film in its trailer posts allowing fans to see the trailer without spoiling it by watching at the end Richard Newby also of The Hollywood Reporter felt that although little new material was revealed in the trailer it offered a somber glimpse of a universe made unrecognizable and let the viewer consider the ending of Avengers Infinity War and our questions of loss Newby noted that the trailer highlighted the characters humble beginnings with its visual language and left viewers with just as many questions as we had before Austen Goslin of Polygon said that the title references a line by Doctor Strange to Tony Stark in Infinity War and a line by Stark in Age of Ultron Goslin said The scene surrounding this line in Age of Ultron is one of the most important ones in the movie Things look dark and the group of heroes face an enemy they don t think they can defeat The Endgame trailer mirrors this perfectly and shows us that the Avengers two most prominent characters are who they ve always been Iron Man a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look and Captain America an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world s heroes fight together The trailer was viewed million times in its first hours and was the most viewed trailer in that time period surpassing the record of Avengers Infinity War million views It set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first hours generating mentions By January BoxOffice s Trailer Impact metric service indicated that to

were released on March All actors on the poster received top billing except for Danai Gurira whose name appeared in the poster s bottom billing block with Benedict Wong Jon Favreau and Gwyneth Paltrow none of whom appeared on the poster Despite this her exclusion from the top billing prompted criticism from some fans Petrana Radulovic of Polygon said that how an actor is credited on a poster is a complex process based on dealing with agents fees and movie star demands Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day with Gurira in the top billing The second trailer was viewed million times in the first hours becoming the second most viewed trailer in that time period behind the first trailer br br br Release br br br Theatrical br Avengers Endgame had its world premiere at the Los

provide the sense of an ending a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Avengers Endgame achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling even as it falls just short of real catharsis Some called the film a notable improvement over its predecessor Avengers Infinity War including Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert com Endgame is a more patient focused film than Infinity War even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies Matt Zoller Seitz also of RogerEbert com compared the film positively to Infinity War which he considered too crowded too rushed and yet too long Seitz called Endgame a heartfelt and satisfying experience and a surprisingly relaxed character driven self aware yet sincere comedy for two thirds of the film Much of the script suggests a laid back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal cited Avengers Endgame as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga calling the final battle inevitably unwieldy but thrilling all the same and followed by a delicate coda So many stories So many adventures So much to sort out before the next cycle starts br Richard Brody was more critical of the film in The New Yorker saying that its good acting was not matched by comparable skill from its directors The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure little sense of beauty little sense of metaphor little aptitude for texture or composition their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones Anthony Lane of The New Yorker gave the film a negative review finding it overdeveloped and overwrought The one thing you do need to know about Avengers Endgame is that it runs for a little over three hours and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour do some shopping and slip back into your seat for the climax You won t have missed a thing br br br Accolades br br At the nd Academy Awards Avengers Endgame received a nomination for Best Visual Effects The film s other nominations include an Annie Award which it won a
