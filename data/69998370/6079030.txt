RealD D is a digital stereoscopic projection technology made and sold by RealD It is currently the most widely used technology for watching D films in theaters Worldwide RealD D is installed in more than auditoriums by approximately exhibitors in countries as of June br br br Technology br RealD D cinema technology is a polarized D system that uses circularly polarized light to produce stereoscopic image projection The advantage of circular polarization over linear polarization is that viewers are able to tilt their head and look about the theater naturally without seeing double or darkened images However as with other systems any significant head tilt will result in incorrect parallax and prevent the brain from correctly fusing the stereoscopic images br The high resolution digital cinema grade video projector alternately projects right eye frames and left eye frames switching between them times per second The projector is either a Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing device or Sony s reflective LCOS liquid crystal on silicon A push pull electro optical liquid crystal modulator called a ZScreen is placed immediately in front of the projector lens to alternately polarize each frame It circularly polarizes the frames clockwise for the right eye and counter clockwise for the left eye The audience wears circularly polarized glasses that have oppositely polarized lenses that ensures each eye sees only its designated frame In RealD Cinema each frame is projected three times to reduce flicker a system called triple flash The source video is usually produced at frames per second per eye total frames s which may result in subtle ghosting and stuttering on horizontal camera movements A silver screen is used to maintain the light polarization upon reflection and to reduce reflection loss to counter some of the significant light loss due to polarization filter absorption The result is a D pictures that seems to extend behind and in front of the screen itself br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br US patent Enhanced ZScreen modulator techniques issued January assigned to RealD br US patent Polarizing modulator for an electronic stereoscopic display issued December assigned to StereoGraphics Corporation br US patent Stereoscopic motion picture projection system issued January assigned to Lenny Lipton br US patent Achromatic liquid crystal shutter for stereoscopic and other applications issued December assigned to Lenny Lipton br US patent Method and system employing a push pull liquid crystal modulator issued December assigned to StereoGraphics Corporation br br br External links br br Official website br Who is Lenny Lipton About Inventor and Chief technical officer of RealD through
