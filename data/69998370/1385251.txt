make a brief cameo appearance when they are shown congratulating the secretary and his wife on their daughter s wedding McCain was criticized for his appearance in the film having previously called out Hollywood for marketing R Rated films to teenagers br br Andrew Panay co producer of Wedding Crashers had the idea for the film based on his own experiences of being excited to attend weddings in his s due to the prospect of meeting women Panay then consulted the screenwriting team of Steve Faber and Bob Fisher to come up with a story based on this premise Much of the film was based upon Fisher s experiences as a college intern in Washington D C where he would make up fake backstories to crash lobbyist events Panay and Fisher s experiences merged together to form the idea of a film in which the main characters crash weddings to meet and sleep with women br The screenwriters had doubts that the premise could be sustained into a feature length film so they decided to add female love interests born from a political family inspired by their dream of marrying a girl from the Kennedy family when they were young boys It was also Panay s desire to explore male friendship through this crazy idea of crashing weddings as the emotional core of the movie In preparation for the film the creators would crash political party platform committee meetings in order to delve into the psyche of the characters and what it means to crash a party br On April Variety reported that both Faber and Fisher had struck a mid six figures deal with New Line Cinema to acquire the pitch for the film David Dobkin signed to direct in seeing it as an opportunity to pair Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson who had previously worked with Dobkin and gave him an Abbott and Costello impression when they were at the premiere of his film Shanghai Knights br According to Dobkin the marketing department at New Line Cinema raised some concerns regarding the protagonists of the film who were seen as misogynists whose goal is to seduce women at weddings and have sex with them The director saw these characters in a different light however convincing the department br br They love weddings authentically They like the free food they like the music and the bands they like the dancing and the kids they like talking to the grandparents These guys make the weddings better You would want them to crash your wedding br That s the distinction It s not misogynistic and in fact what it s doing is replicating a real seduction which is I want to go to bed with you but I have all these walls up Can you make me laugh make me attracted to you and find a way to make this really fun so we could get to the good part That s a seduction So if I can seduce the audience if I can make them laugh and be entertained and think these are okay guys by the time they re dropping the girls in the bed it s a magic trick That was the whole idea br Vaughn and Wilson were the first actors cast in the film Dobkin cast Bradley Cooper without even watching his audition tape as he was so impressed by the actor s test reading Isla Fisher then a relatively unknown actress in the United States but who had a significant profile in the United Kingdom and Australia on account of her work in the soap opera Home and Away was cast as Gloria over Shannon Elizabeth and Anna Paquin The casting of Secretary Cleary was a contentious issue between Dobkin and the studio executives with Dobkin wanting to cast Christopher Walken but New Line Cinema wanting a more comedic actor such as Burt Reynolds instead of Walken who was viewed as a serious character actor Nicolas Cage was considered for the role of Chazz Reinhold before Will Ferrell The role of Claire was the final role to be cast with Dobkin auditioning over actresses before casting Rachel McAdams br Director David Dobkin originally considered the possibility of releasing a version of the film that was not R rated to broaden the film s commercial appeal but the idea was abandoned after a consultant provided a long list of the many R Rated elements in the film and Dobkin realized The two funniest scenes in the movie would have had to go Despite this New Line Cinema still did not want the film to be rated R but eventually conceded to keep the R rating after pressure from Dobkin br Dobkin has said that the script originally set the film around Cape Cod but a need to film in spring made this impractical He suggested moving the shoot to Washington D C his home town feeling that his knowledge of the area would make choosing locations easier and that using the city as the setting for a comedy would be an unexpected choice br br Dobkin insisted on three and a half weeks of rehearsals before filming began based on his background working in theater Principal photography began on March in Washington D C The film had a day shooting schedule br The main Cleary wedding reception scene was filmed at the Inn at Perry Cabin in Saint Michaels Maryland The Ellenborough Estate in Easton MD is the setting of the Cleary family house where a majority of the movie takes place br Director David Dobkin said Owen Wilson was nervous about the scene where Wilson grabs Jane Seymour s breast He didn t really want to squeeze her breast when she was telling him to And I was like Dude you gotta do it it doesn t look right your hands look like crab claws And then he did it eventually and that scene ended up being way funnier than I thought it was going to be Dobkin said br The family dinner scene has been cited by Keir O Donnell as the most grueling scene to film with Vaughn stating that the cast and crew were unsure if the scene would work on screen in the way in which it was intended To shoot the scene in which the family plays football Dobkin an avid fan of the NFL shot the scene in the manner in which a TV crew broadcasts an NFL game in order to make the scene seem authentic and familiar to the audience br Throughout the filming the producers encouraged improvisation from the cast specifically from Wilson and Vaughn leaving breaks in the script for the cast to improvise In one scene Vaughn improvises for over seconds straight br br The film was released in North America on July and became an immediate hit grossing in its first weekend opening at in the box office behind Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Exit polling indicated that of audiences were over years old and almost evenly split between men and women br Considering its higher than expected budget of million competition with heavily advertised blockbusters during the summer season and the film s R rating limiting its potential audience the studio did not expect the movie s level of success making it a sleeper hit New Line head of distribution David Tuckerman said We would have been happy with million this weekend br The film would prove fruitful reaching at the box office in its third week and eventually grossing over domestically making it the th highest grossing domestic film of and the first R rated comedy to earn over million dollars at the U S Box office It grossed in other territories totaling worldwide br The financial success of the film has been credited along with The Year Old Virgin for reviving the popularity of adult aimed R rated comedies br br On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The website s critical consensus states Wedding Crashers is both raunchy and sweet and features top notch comic performances from Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson On Metacritic the film has a score of out of based on reviews from critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A br Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times wrote a favorable review and in particular praised Vaughn s performance Jeremy is the soul of the movie There s something about Vaughn the deadpan eyes the sublimated misdirected intelligence that recalls Bill Murray in his Caddyshack years Chocano was critical of Will Ferrell s hyper active bonehead routine and called the interlude awful She added that the film was really just a love story about a couple of buddies who live happily ever after And it couldn t have happened to a nicer more charming couple br Brian Lowry of Variety described the film as fairly amusing fitfully over the top and occasionally a touch homophobic He praised McAdams as she manages to fill in narrative gaps and actually creates a real character said Vaughan s dialog had most of the comedic highlights and wrote that Walken was underused Lowry concluded While neither a full throated R rated romp a la There s Something About Mary nor a fully realized romantic comedy Wedding Crashers contains enough appealing elements of both to catch the bouquet in what s been a relatively humor deprived summer br Joe Morgenenstern of The Wall Street Journal called the film the best comedy of while Entertainment Weekly s Lisa Schwarzbaum described the film as an unabashedly jiggly bawdy it s all good comedy Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote It s crude yes but also funny too bad these lost boys can t stay lost Like clockwork the film soon mutates from a guy oriented sex comedy into a wish fulfillment chick flick Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film two stars out of four although he wrote that there are individual moments that are very funny he added that the director David Dobkin has too much else on his mind br British Movie magazine Empire awarded it three out of five stars and were complimentary to Vaughn and Wilson saying Sharing an easy chemistry and free of the usual joker straight guy dynamic Wilson and Vaughn quip riff and banter to hilarious effect And both get their fair share of money moments the latter s muggings are particularly hysterical in a raunchy dinner party sequence The laidback stars are funny and sweet but they re let down by a patchy script which squanders some potentially priceless set ups br Kimberley Jones of The Austin Chronicle opined that the film will no doubt make buckets of money but it ll do so without half the wit compassion or inspired madness that There s Something About Mary had Jones complained that the plot was mostly cookie cutter stuff and was offended by the portrayal of minorities writing gays and blacks are represented respectively by a squirrelly psychotic and a Jamaican house servant Jones concluded A stiff drink or maybe some pharmaceutical assistance might have made me overlook the film s sour tone or the unremarkableness of its direction After initially liking the film Scott Meslow of GQ gave a negative review in writing that Even beyond the gender and sexual dynamics that have aged rather poorly Wedding Crashers feels awfully uneven today He noted a date rape joke in the opening minutes complained about the lack of developed female characters objected to the sassy racist grandmother trope called the predatory gay man trope inexcusably unfunny felt that the film trivializes rape and called Will Ferrell s cameo lazy However Meslow added that For all its faults it does have an extremely strong pair of leads br br On April Wedding Crashers topped the nominations for the year s MTV Movie Awards with five including Best Movie It won Best Movie On Screen Team Vaughn and Wilson
