The Weinstein Company in July with Wes Craven saying that he would not mind directing the film if the script were as good as Scream Kevin Williamson the writer of Scream and Scream confirmed his return in January stating that the fourth film s production would begin during the hiatus of his show The Vampire Diaries and that Craven would direct the film In March it was confirmed that Craven would indeed direct br In May Cathy Konrad who produced the first three films in the series filed a million lawsuit against The Weinstein Company alleging that they violated a written agreement that entitled her company Cat Entertainment first rights to produce all films in the series The Weinsteins argued that this contract required Konrad s services be exclusive to the franchise which Konrad calls false pretext claiming the previous film did not require this condition The suit accuses the Weinsteins of surreptitious behavior and a scheme to force Plaintiffs to walk away from the Scream franchise without compensation enabling them to cut costs by hiring someone else to produce Craven s wife Iya Labunka not named in the suit In April it was reported that the Weinsteins had settled out of court with Konrad the details remaining confidential though it was claimed that she would receive a cash payment plus a percentage of the profits from Scream br br Craven stated that there had been no real life Ghostface murders from between the decade time jump of Scream to Scream but that there had been numerous sequels to the film within a film Stab He also commented on the status of Sidney Prescott She s done her best to move on from the events that occurred in the previous films even releasing a successful book Craven said that endless sequels the modern spew of remakes film studios and directors are the butts of parodies in the film The main characters have to figure out where the horror genre is in current days to figure out the modern events happening to and around them Williamson expressed his desire to tell a story in which the audience would really care about the characters like Sidney Prescott who survived the first three films and focus on them rather than the next kill in comparison to other horror films like those of the Saw franchise br In an early draft of the script Gale and Dewey had a baby but this was changed after it was decided bringing a baby into the film would make shooting impossible In another early form of the script the opening scene had Sidney start fighting with Ghostface and be left for dead There would have been a two year gap in the story while she recovered however Bob Weinstein feared it would slow the pace of the story and bringing in young characters would work out best br There were numerous other differences between the original script and the version that eventually reached the screen For instance the opening sequences were changed around as can be seen in the alternative versions and deleted scenes on the DVD Also the Stabathon and the sequences involving Gale being attacked there did not appear in the original script Another major difference was the ending The hospital finale scenes were added on later in the writing process The original script ended at the house with Jill being loaded into the ambulance and speaking to Dewey then agreeing to give the photographers one photo under the pretense that they would then leave her alone though she really wanted them to take her photograph Just then a paramedic from inside the house shouts that they have a woman alive not specified but assumed to be either Sidney or Kirby The film would have ended on this cliffhanger presumably setting Jill up as an antagonist anti heroine in the next film There were rumors that Sidney would then possibly be suffering from amnesia in the next film unable to recall that Jill was the killer There were also rumors that Williamson was upset that this ending was changed br Scream writer Ehren Kruger was brought in during production to do re writes Craven said Look there was a bumpy period when things shifted over from Kevin to Ehren I signed up to do a script by Kevin and unfortunately that didn t go all the way through the shooting But it certainly is Kevin s script and concept and characters and themes Additional rewrites were made by Paul Harris Boardman It was reported that the actors were not given the page script past page in order to protect the identity of the Ghostface killer br br In September Variety reported that Neve Campbell David Arquette and Courteney Cox would return Craven briefly explained their roles in a later interview with Entertainment Weekly saying It s a total integration of those three and new kids The story of Sid Gale and Dewey is very much a part of the movie At a press conference for Repo Men Liev Schreiber who played Cotton Weary in the first three films stated there were no plans for his return In an interview with FEARnet Williamson continued to deny a rumor of Jamie Kennedy returning I would love nothing more than to have Jamie Kennedy in the film However to have Randy in the film it sort of just takes it I mean Scream was a lie you know It s a false move So I just won t do it I can t do that I just won t do it In April over casting sides were released to the public to buy for auditions of the film br In May Hayden Panettiere and Rory Culkin signed on Ashley Greene was offered the role of Sidney s cousin Jill but the role later went to Emma Roberts Lake Bell was to play Deputy Judy Hicks but dropped out four days before filming due to scheduling conflicts causing the role to ultimately go to Marley Shelton Nancy O Dell reprises her role from the second and third films as a reporter Roger L Jackson returned as the voice of Ghostface Lauren Graham was to play Kate Roberts the mother of Roberts character but dropped out a few days into principal photography Craven like in the previous three films has a cameo and took to his Twitter to ask fans to pick his role the cameo was however deleted from the final cut of the film The Hollywood Reporter reported that Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell have cameos in the beginning of the film akin to Drew Barrymore and Jada Pinkett Smith in the first and second films Kristen Stewart was offered a cameo role at the beginning of the film but he declined as she couldn t emulate Drew Barrymore Shenae Grimes and Lucy Hale also have cameos in the film In September Aimee Teegarden and Britt Robertson were cast as the film s actual opening roles Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper br br On a budget of million principal photography began on June Filming was scheduled to end on September after a day shoot but instead concluded on September Filming took place in and around Ann Arbor Michigan Scenes portraying Woodsboro High School featured in the original Scream film were shot at Woodworth Middle School in Dearborn Michigan The former th District Court in Livonia Michigan was used as a police station br In April while scouting for a bookstore to use in the film Craven spotted a new bookstore that had not yet opened in downtown Northville Michigan named Next Chapter Bookstore Bistro Craven instantly loved the building as well as the name and decided to use both in the film He also hired the owner s chef to prepare the food and pastry for a scene in the film The scenes were shot the first week of July After the test screening in January Craven and Weinstein did not think the two scenes played well for the audience Aimee Teegarden and Alison Brie returned to Detroit in late January and early February for four days of additional shooting The scenes involved Teegarden s character who is stalked at her home and Brie s character who is attacked in a parking garage br The film also extensively used computer generated imagery for the first time in the franchise For example instead of using a collapsing knife the knife s blade was added during post production with CGI effects Anderson s death scene in which he is stabbed in the forehead and walks a few feet while talking before finally falling to his death was not in the script but was inspired by a real life medical emergency Craven had seen in a documentary about a person being stabbed through their head and walked into an emergency room He thought it was extraordinary if somebody was stabbed in the head and still be alive for a while Craven also did not tell the studio that he was taking this approach for the death scene jokingly saying he hoped he would not be fired the next day br br The Scream
