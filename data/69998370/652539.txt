music for Rush Hour is completely different from Rush Hour The first seconds of the main title is a reprise of the music from Rush Hour but that s it He said that Ratner had requested a symphonic score which he incidentally found suitable for Rush Hour br br For the sequel he asked me to do a symphonic score It was bigger than life like an epic score I ignored the comedy the actors took care of that I played to the chases and the danger It s a serious score in the sense of an epic score like Raiders of the Lost Ark or an Errol Flynn film Also you must realize that the symphony orchestra allows many more possibilities Mozart didn t need a rhythm section to drive I was able to create a lot of energy without the use of drums and electric guitars and all that br br Schifrin performed the
