army of Maximus br br David Franzoni who wrote the first draft of the Gladiator screenplay traveled across Eastern Europe and the Middle East by motorcycle in Everywhere I went in Europe there were arenas Franzoni recalled Even as I went east going through Turkey I began to think to myself this must have been a hell of a franchise During a stop in Baghdad Iraq he started reading the Daniel P Mannix novel Those About to Die subsequently titled The Way of the Gladiator which gave him the idea for Gladiator br Twenty five years later Franzoni wrote the screenplay for Steven Spielberg s Amistad which was Spielberg s first film for DreamWorks Pictures Though Amistad was only a moderate commercial success DreamWorks was impressed with Franzoni s screenplay and gave him a three picture deal as writer and co producer Remembering his trip Franzoni pitched his gladiator story idea to Spielberg who immediately told him to write the script After reading the ancient Roman text Historia Augusta Franzoni chose to center the story on Commodus The protagonist was Narcissus a wrestler who according to the ancient historians Herodian and Cassius Dio strangled Commodus to death br br DreamWorks producers Walter F Parkes and Douglas Wick felt that Ridley Scott would be the ideal director to bring Franzoni s story to life They showed him a copy of Jean L on G r me s painting Pollice Verso which Scott said portrays the Roman Empire in all its glory and wickedness He was so captivated by the image that he immediately agreed to direct the film When Parkes pointed out that Scott did not know anything about the story Scott replied I don t care I ll do it br Once Scott was onboard he and Franzoni discussed films that could influence Gladiator such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest La Dolce Vita and The Conformist However Scott felt Franzoni s dialogue lacked subtlety and he hired John Logan to rewrite the script Logan rewrote much of the first act and made the decision to kill off Maximus s family to increase the character s desire for revenge In November DreamWorks reached a deal with Universal Pictures to help finance the film DreamWorks would distribute the film in North America while Universal Pictures would distribute it internationally br br Before Russell Crowe was cast as Maximus several other actors were considered for the role including Antonio Banderas Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise However producers had Crowe at the top of their list after his breakout performance in L A Confidential Jude Law auditioned for Commodus but Joaquin Phoenix was offered the part after sending in a knockout audition tape Jennifer Lopez reportedly auditioned for Lucilla but the role went to Connie Nielsen br br The film was shot at three main locations between January and May The opening battle scene set in the forests of Germania was shot at Bourne Wood near Farnham Surrey in England When Scott learned that the Forestry Commission was planning to remove a section of the forest he obtained permission to burn it down for the scene The scenes of slavery desert travel and the gladiatorial training school were shot in Ouarzazate Morocco The scenes set in Rome were shot in Malta where the crew built a replica of about one third of the Colosseum to a height of feet meters The other two thirds and remaining height were added digitally br When filming battle scenes Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson used multiple cameras filming at various frame rates and used a degree shutter which resulted in stylized visuals similar to those found in Saving Private Ryan For the fight sequence involving tigers both real tigers and a dummy tiger were used Some of the live animals were filmed on set with the actors and some were filmed against a bluescreen and then digitally composited into the scene br Crowe was injured multiple times during principal photography Describing the impact filming had on his body Crowe said I ve still got a lot of little scar s He added I ve had Achilles tendons go out knees go out both shoulders this shoulder s actually had an operation on it I ve got a lower back thing that just won t go away and that s from a couple sort of fall impacts during fight sequences Oliver Reed died of a heart attack on May before all his scenes had been filmed His character Proximo was meant to survive but after Reed s death the script was revised to include his death at the hands of the Praetorian Guard To make it appear that Reed had performed the entirety of Proximo s scenes a body double was used and Reed s face was digitally attached to the body of the double in post production The film is dedicated to Reed br br Although Franzoni and Logan completed a second draft of the screenplay in October Crowe has claimed that the script was substantially underdone when filming began three months later In an interview with Inside the Actors Studio Crowe said the crew started shooting with about pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks The script was constantly changing throughout principal photography with Scott soliciting input from writers producers and actors Some dialogue was created on the spot such as Commodus s line Am I not merciful which was ad libbed by Phoenix Crowe invented the phrase Strength and Honor which is a modified version of the Latin motto of his high school Veritate et Virtute which translates as Truth and Virtue Crowe also improvised part of the scene in which Maximus describes his home to Marcus Aurelius Instead of recounting the details of a fictional place Crowe described his own home in Australia br At one point William Nicholson was hired to rewrite the script to make Maximus a more sensitive character He reworked Maximus s friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife plot thread He said he did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody Crowe however was unhappy with some of Nicholson s dialogue He called it garbage but claimed he is the greatest actor in the world and can make even garbage sound good According to a DreamWorks executive Crowe tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot You know the big line in the trailer In this life or the next I will have my vengeance At first he absolutely refused to say it br br The musical score for Gladiator was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard and conducted by Gavin Greenaway The original soundtrack for the film was produced by Decca Records and released on April Decca later released three follow up albums Gladiator More Music From the Motion Picture

all three formats br br Gladiator received many positive reviews upon its initial release with critics calling it magnificent compelling and richly enjoyable Crowe s performance in particular received acclaim Writing for The Wall Street Journal Joe Morgensten said that Crowe doesn t use tricks in this role to court our approval He earns it the old fashioned way by daring to be quiet if not silent and intensely implacably strong Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Crowe brings an essential physical and psychological reality to the role while Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said that Crowe uses his burly frame and expressive face to give dimension to what might otherwise have been comic book heroics Variety called Crowe s performance simply splendid br Critics also praised Scott s directing and the visual style of the film Manohla Dargis of LA Weekly commended Scott s state of the art filmmaking and expressed admiration for the film s breathtaking brutal lyricism Entertainment Weekly called the opening battle sequence extraordinary and described Scott as a visual artist at his most deluxe Michael Wilmington of The Chicago Tribune called Gladiator visually electrifying In addition to Crowe s acting and Scott s directing reviewers also applauded John Mathieson s cinematography Arthur Max s production design and the musical score composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard br Although critics lauded many aspects of Gladiator some derided the screenplay Ian Nathan of Empire magazine called the dialogue pompous overwritten and prone to plain silliness Roger Ebert said the script employs depression as a substitute for personality and believes that if characters are bitter and morose enough we won t notice how dull they are Manohla Dargis called the story predictable and formulaic br Audiences polled on Gladiator s opening day by the market research firm CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale On the review

Award for Best Film In Empire magazine ranked Gladiator th on its Best Movies Of All Time list and declared it the nd best film of the st century The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes included the film on its list of Essential s Movies The character Maximus placed th on Empire s list of Greatest Movie Characters br br Gladiator is loosely based on real events that occurred within the Roman Empire in the latter half of the nd century AD Scott wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film so he hired several historians as advisors Nevertheless some deviations from historical facts were made to increase interest maintain narrative continuity and for practical or safety reasons Scott also stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like some historical facts were too unbelievable to include For instance in an early version of the script gladiators endorsed products in the arena while this would have been historically accurate there was concern that audiences would think it anachronistic br At least one historical advisor resigned due to these changes Another asked not to be mentioned in the credits Allen Ward a historian at the University of Connecticut believed that a higher level of historical accuracy would not have made Gladiator less interesting or exciting He asserted that filmmakers must be granted some artistic license when adapting historical events but this license should not be employed to completely disregard facts br br Marcus Aurelius was not murdered by his son Commodus he died at Vindobona modern Vienna in AD from the Antonine Plague The epidemic believed to be either smallpox or measles swept the Roman Empire during his reign br There is no indication that Marcus Aurelius wished to return the Empire to a republican form of government as depicted in the film Moreover he shared the rule of the Empire with Commodus for three years before his own death Commodus then ruled alone until his death in AD br The film depicts Marcus seizing victory in the Marcomannic Wars In reality the war was ongoing when he died Commodus secured peace with the two Germanic tribes allied against Rome the Marcomanni and the Quadi immediately after his father s death br The character Maximus is fictional although in some respects he resembles the following historical figures Narcissus Commodus s real life murderer Spartacus who led a slave revolt Cincinnatus a farmer who was made dictator and Marcus Nonius Macrinus a general and friend of Marcus br Although Commodus engaged in show combat in the Colosseum he was not killed in the arena he was strangled in his bath by the wrestler Narcissus Commodus reigned for over twelve years unlike the shorter period portrayed in the film br In the film Lucilla is depicted as the widow of Lucius Verus She has one son also named Lucius Verus In reality Lucilla s son died long before the reign of Commodus and she remarried Claudius Pompeianus soon after Verus s death She had been married to Claudius for years by the time her brother became Emperor and her only living son during this time was Aurelius Pompeianus br The real life Lucilla was implicated in a plot to assassinate her brother in AD along with several others She was first exiled to the island of Capri by Commodus then executed on his orders later in the year br In the film Marcus banned gladiatorial games in Rome The real Aurelius however banned games only in Antioch No games were ever banned in Rome br In reality the death of Commodus did not result in peace for Rome nor a return to the Roman Republic Rather it ushered in a chaotic and bloody power struggle that culminated in the Year of the Five Emperors in AD According to the historian Herodian the Roman people were overjoyed at the news of Commodus s death although they feared that the Praetorians would not accept the new emperor Pertinax br Maximus Decimus Meridius does not appear to be a properly rendered Roman name A more accurate name would be Decimus Meridius Maximus Additionally Proximo should be rendered Proximus br br Although Gladiator takes place in the nd century AD the Imperial Gallic armor and the helmets worn by the legionaries are from AD a century earlier The centurions cavalry standard bearers and auxiliaries would have worn scale armor known as lorica squamata The Praetorian Guards wear purple uniforms in the film but this wardrobe is not corroborated by historical evidence On campaign they usually wore standard legionary equipment with some unique decorative elements Gladiator depicts Germanic tribes wearing clothing from the Stone Age which ended more than years before the events of the film br br The film shows the Roman cavalry using stirrups In reality the cavalry used a two horned saddle without stirrups The stirrups were employed during filming because riding with a Roman saddle requires additional training and skill According to the classical scholar Martin Winkler catapults and ballistae would not have been used in a forest as they were reserved primarily for sieges and were rarely used in open battles There is no documentation of the use of flaming arrows or flaming catapult canisters in ancient history br br On November a sequel to Gladiator is scheduled to be released in the United States titled Gladiator II International release dates have yet to be announced br The film is directed by Ridley Scott and written by David Scarpa It stars Paul Mescal Denzel Washington Joseph Quinn Fred Hechinger Pedro Pascal Connie Nielsen and Derek Jacobi the last two reprising their roles from Gladiator It is produced by Scott Free Productions for Paramount Pictures In addition to directing the film Scott is serving as a producer alongside Michael Pruss Douglas Wick and Lucy Fisher Costume designer Janty Yates and production designer Arthur Max both of whom worked on Gladiator are
