The British Board of Film Classification BBFC is a non governmental organisation founded by the British film industry in and responsible for the national classification and censorship of films exhibited at cinemas and video works such as television programmes trailers adverts public information campaigning films menus bonus content etc released on physical media within the United Kingdom It has a statutory requirement to classify all video works released on VHS DVD Blu ray including D and K UHD formats and to a lesser extent some video games under the Video Recordings Act The BBFC was also the designated regulator for the UK age verification scheme which was abandoned before being implemented br br br History and overview br br The BBFC was established in as the British Board of Film Censors under the aegis of the Incorporated Association of Kinematograph Manufacturers by film trade associations who preferred to manage their own censorship than to have national or local government do it for them The immediate impetus for the board s formation stemmed from the furore surrounding the release in the UK in October of the film From the Manger to the Cross about the life of Jesus The film shown at the Queen s Hall London gained considerable publicity from a great outcry in the Daily Mail which demanded Is nothing sacred to the film maker and waxed indignant about the profits for its American film producers Although the clergy were invited to see it and found little to be affronted by the controversy resulted in the voluntary creation of the BBFC which began operating on January br The Cinematograph Act required cinemas to have licences from local authorities The Act was introduced for reasons of public safety after nitrate film fires in unsuitable venues fairgrounds and shops that had been hastily converted into cinemas but the following year a court ruling determined that the criteria for granting or refusing a licence did not have to be restricted to issues of health and safety Given that the law now allowed councils to grant or refuse licences to cinemas according to the content of the films they showed the Act therefore enabled the introduction of censorship br The film industry fearing the economic consequences of a largely unregulated censorship infrastructure therefore formed the BBFC to take the process in house and establish its own system of self regulation By paying a fee of for every reel of film viewed and by appointing a panel of viewers under a censor none of whom had any film trade interests the growing cinema industry neatly created a censorship body which was both self supporting and strictly impartial and therefore was not swayed by any sectional interests inside the film trade or outside it The board s offices were originally at Oxford Street London the building is located at the junction of Wardour Street a centre of the British film industry for many years br Unlike the American Production Code Administration which had a written list of violations in their Motion Picture Production Code the BBFC did not have a written code and were vague in their translation to producers on what constituted a violation However some clarity would come in when the then president of the BBFC T P O Connor listed forty three infractions from the BBFC annual reports during the National Council of Public Morals Cinema Commission of Inquiry indicating where a cut in a film may be required These included br br In the BBFC annual report outlined grounds on seven broad categories that justified censorship including issues related to religious political military social questions of sex crime and cruelty Some decisions from the early years are now subjected to derision In the board s examiners report famously claimed that Germaine Dulac s surrealist film The Seashell and the Clergyman was almost meaningless but If there is a meaning it is doubtless objectionable br Informal links to varying degrees of closeness have been maintained between the BBFC and the Government throughout the Board s existence In the period before the Second World War an extensive but unofficial system of political censorship was implemented by the BBFC for the Home Office As the cinema became a socially powerful mass medium governments feared the effect of its use by others for propaganda and as happened in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany discouraged any expression of controversial political views in British films This trend reached its climax during the s Following protests from the German Embassy after the release of a film depicting the execution of Edith Cavell Dawn dir Herbert Wilcox intense political pressure was brought to bear on the BBFC by the Home Office A system of script vetting was introduced whereby British studios were invited to submit screenplays to the BBFC before shooting started Imported Hollywood films were not treated as strictly as British films as the BBFC believed that audiences would recognise American cinema as representing a foreign culture and therefore would not apply any political messages therein to their own lives So while the Warners gangster films and other s Hollywood films that dealt explicitly with crime and the effects of the Great Depression were released in the UK largely uncut these subjects were strictly off limits for British film makers br During the Second World War the BBFC s political censorship function effectively passed to the Films Division of the Ministry of Information and the BBFC never regained this to the same extent as before the war The increasing climate of post war liberalism ensured that from the s onwards controversies involving the BBFC centred more on depictions of sex and violence than on political expression There were some notable exceptions Yield to the Night UK dir J Lee Thompson which opposed capital punishment Room at the Top UK dir Jack Clayton which dealt with class divisions Victim UK dir Basil Dearden which implicitly argued for the legalisation of homosexuality all involved the BBFC in controversy br In autumn Lord Longford and Raymond Blackburn decided to pursue a matter of pornography classification for the film Language of Love at the Court of Appeal before Lord Denning MR they failed to obtain a writ of mandamus against the Metropolitan Police Commissioner who had refused to intrude upon the BBFC s remit br br br Change of name and scope br In the board changed its name to The British Board of Film Classification to reflect the fact that classification plays a far larger part in the board s work than censorship The board s holding company the Incorporated Association of Kinematograph Manufacturers aligned its name with the board the following year followed by another minor alteration in to British Board of Film Classification At that time it was given responsibility for classifying videos for hire or purchase to view in the home as well as films shown in cinemas Home video and cinema versions of a film usually receive the same certificate although occasionally a film may receive a more restrictive certificate for the home video market sometimes due to the bonus features as it is easier for children to watch a home video than to be admitted into a cinema br In December the first computer game to be certified by the BBFC was an illustrated text adventure called Dracula based on the Bram Stoker novel published by CRL the game received a certificate The first computer game to receive an certificate on December was another illustrated text adventure called Jack the Ripper also by CRL which dealt with the infamous real life murders in Victorian London The horror in both games came through largely in their detailed prose Had the game publishers reprinted the games text in book form it would not have carried a certificate as the BBFC has no oversight over print media Both games had numerous certificate stickers all over their covers to emphasise to parents and retailers that they were not intended for children as computer games carrying BBFC certificates were previously unheard of br The first video game to be refused classification by the BBFC was Carmageddon in however a modified version of the game was later awarded an certificate In June Manhunt was refused classification for both its PlayStation and Wii versions meaning that the game was illegal to sell or supply in the United Kingdom A modified version was made that was accepted by the ESRB but was still refused classification from the BBFC The second decision was later overturned by the Video Appeals Committee an independent body set up by legislation the BBFC then asked the High Court for a judicial review of the VAC decision The High Court ruled that the VAC had made errors in law and instructed it to reconsider its decision the VAC subsequently ruled that the modified version of the game should receive an certificate which the BBFC accepted br On June the UK s Department for Culture Media and Sport ruled in favour of the PEGI system to be the sole classification system for videogames and software in the UK This decision would also unlike beforehand allow PEGI ratings to be legally enforced much like the BBFC ratings Initially expected to take effect from April the legislation was put into effect on July br Netflix and the BBFC announced an age classification partnership on March where the former will classify their content in the United Kingdom with BBFC ratings The partnership came at the time when digital media is on the rise worldwide and when parents are concerned about children seeing inappropriate content on video on demand or online gaming platforms The implementation of BBFC ratings into Netflix UK content took effect at the end of October br br br Responsibilities and powers br The board is a self funded quango Its business affairs are controlled by a council of management selected from leading figures in the manufacturing and servicing sectors of the film industry This council appoints the President who has statutory responsibility for the classification of videos and the Director who has executive responsibility and formulates policy The board which is based in Soho Square London is financed from the fees it charges for classifying films and videos and is run on a not for profit basis br br br Editing br The BBFC can also advise cuts for a less restrictive rating This generally occurs in borderline cases where distributors have requested a certificate and the BBFC has rated the work at a more restrictive level however some cuts are compulsory such as scenes that violate the Protection of Children Act or Cinematograph Films Animals Act The final certificate then depends on the distributor s decision on whether or not to make the suggested cuts Some works are even rejected if the distributor refuses the cut br The examiners and the directors of the BBFC are hired on a permanent basis Examiners are required to watch five hours and twenty minutes of media to a maximum of thirty five hours a week Turnover is low and vacancies when available appear on its London job vacancies website br br br Cinema br In the case of films shown in cinemas local authorities have the final legal authorisation over who can view a particular film The majority of the time local authorities accept the board s recommendation for a certificate for a film There have been some notable exceptions particularly in the s when the board allowed films such as Last Tango in Paris and The Exorcist to be released with an X certificate essentially the same as today s but many local authorities chose to ban the films regardless Thirty nine local authorities in the UK either imposed an outright ban or imposed an X certificate on Monty Python s Life of Brian which the BBFC had rated as AA Suitable for ages br Conversely in a few local authorities regraded Spider Man from to PG allowing children younger than to see the film However the BBFC were already in the process of replacing the rating with a new A which allowed under s to see the film if accompanied by an adult so shortly afterwards the BBFC reclassified Spider Man as A The first A certificate awarded was for The Bourne Identity br br br Video releases br The Video Recordings Act requires that video releases not exempt music documentary non fiction video games etc under the Act had to be classified making it illegal to supply any recording that had not been certified Certificates could restrict release to any age of or under or only to licensed sex shops The government currently designate the BBFC as the authority for certifying video releases As the law requires the certificate to be displayed on the packaging and media labels of the video recording in practice only UK releases can be legally sold or hired in the UK even if a foreign release had identical content br Local authorities do not have such power for video recordings Under the Video Recording Act all non exempt recordings must be classified by an authority chosen by the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport This classification is legally binding in that supply of material contrary to its certificate recordings that have been refused a certificate or supplying to someone younger than the certified age is a criminal offence However possession is not an offence in itself other than in the case of possession with intent to supply Since the introduction of the Act the BBFC has been the chosen authority In theory this authority could be revoked but in practice such a revocation has never been suggested since most local authorities simply do not have the resources needed to do such things as remove cuts pass films that the BBFC rejected and vice versa put in place new cuts etc regularly br br br Video games br The BBFC has also rated some video games Normally these are exempt from classification unless they depict human sexual activity human genital organs or gross acts of violence in which case the publishers should submit the game for classification Publishers may opt to submit a game for classification even if they are not obliged to br Under the Digital Economy Act the primary responsibility for rating video games in the United Kingdom passed from the BBFC to the Video Standards Council using the PEGI system A game is only submitted to the BBFC if it contains strong pornographic material or if it includes video material that is not directly accessible through the game itself e g a documentary br br br Mobile operators br The BBFC also provide a classification service for mobile phone operators BBFC guidelines for film and video are used to calibrate the filters used by the operators to restrict access to internet content The default assumption is that mobile phone users are under years of age The BBFC guidelines are based on public consultations conducted every four to five years br br br Websites br br Under the Digital Economy Act the BBFC was appointed as the UK s regulator for pornographic websites As regulator the BBFC was intended to be responsible for identifying commercial pornographic websites accessible in the UK and empowered to take action against any which did not age verify their users including placing restrictions on their payment transactions or ordering their blocking by Internet service providers This was to be the case regardless of whether the websites were UK based or foreign based The BBFC had been informally named as the likely regulator in and in November of that year it was invited to take on the role and agreed to do so The formal appointment of the BBFC took place in February Before the BBFC was due to begin its role it conducted a public consultation on its draft guidance beginning in March In the BBFC estimated that five million commercial pornographic websites existed on the Internet br In March the BBFC published its guidance which stated that social media would not fall under the BBFC s jurisdiction and nor would websites where pornography made up a third or less of the website s material The BBFC proposed that a voluntary certification scheme should cover age verification providers Margot James the UK government s digital minister said that the government had asked HM Treasury to provide indemnity of up to million to the BBFC to protect it against legal challenges as the uncertainty surrounding the possibility of such challenges would leave the BBFC unable to get commercial insurance There were numerous delays to the date at which the BBFC would begin its regulatory role until in the UK government announced that the part of the Act dealing with the regulation of pornographic websites would not be implemented br br br Current certificates br br The BBFC currently issues the following certificates The current category symbols were introduced in cinemas in October and on home media since April replacing the previous ones that had been in place since br br Material that is exempt from classification sometimes uses symbols similar to BBFC certificates for example an E certificate There is no legal obligation nor a particular scheme for labelling material that is exempt from classification On the BBFC s online classification database material that has been refused a classification uses an N A symbol in place of a rating symbol br br br Age verification certificate br As part of the implementation of the Digital Economy Act the BBFC and NCC Group were planning to introduce an age verification certificate AVC or AV Certificate a voluntary non statutory certificate awarded to Internet age verification providers who meet standards of privacy and data security Plans to mandate online age verification to deny those who do not prove they are aged over access to pornographic website content were subsequently abandoned br br br Controversies br Historically the Board has faced strong criticism for their perceived overzealous attitude towards censoring films Prior to the liberalising decade of the s films were routinely and extensively censored as a means of social control For example Rebel Without a Cause was cut to reduce the possibility of teenage rebellion Ingmar Bergman s comedy Smiles of a Summer Night was cut to remove overtly sexual or provocative language br The BBFC s attitude became more liberal during the s and it concentrated on censoring films that featured graphic sex and violence However some Board decisions caused controversy in the s when it banned a series of films that were released uncut and were popular in other countries such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Last House on the Left or released other controversial films such as Straw Dogs and A Clockwork Orange However under recent presidents Andreas Whittam Smith and Sir Quentin Thomas guidelines were relaxed again allowing the release usually uncut of these previously banned films on video and in cinemas Some films from the s remain unreleased However many of these titles remain banned primarily because their distributors have not chosen to re submit the films to the BBFC almost certainly for commercial reasons if re submitted they would be likely to receive a more sympathetic hearing than to years ago Two notable examples from this period include the film Love Camp rejected in and Women in Cellblock released in and rejected in Both films contain substantial scenes of sexual violence and have remained completely banned following a re submission since br In general attitudes to what material is suitable for viewing by younger audiences have changed over the years and this is reflected by the reclassification of older films being re released on video For example a film given the former A rating could very probably be rated PG today An extreme example of this is the rating of the horror film Revenge of the Zombies with a U certificate upon its video release in the late s whereas when it was first examined as a film in it was given one of the first X ratings The Bela Lugosi horror film Island of Lost Souls was refused a certificate when first submitted in was granted an X in the s and a for home video release in when submitted for a modern video classification in it was re classified as a PG The Disney live action animated musical Mary Poppins was initially granted a U but was later re classified as PG in due to the use of the archaic word hottentot by the character Admiral Boom in one scene which was deemed by the board as discriminatory language br The BBFC are also known to cut the words spaz and retard from U certified films and videos on the grounds of discriminating against disabled people One example of this was when Marmaduke was passed U after the word spaz was removed The uncut version would have been rated They also award higher ratings to films that contain potentially imitable and dangerous behaviour this includes all five Jackass films being passed and Fred The Movie being passed They are also serious about suicide themes references or attempts and will either cut them or award a higher rating An example of this was in when the Board cut the Hindi film Anjaana Anjaani by two minutes and thirty one seconds to remove references to and sight of someone attempting suicide by asphyxiation so the distributor could get a cinema A certificate In its uncut form the film was released on home video with an certificate The Hunger Games was assessed before formal classification with the film s studio wishing to obtain a A for financial and marketing reasons To get this seven seconds of footage was cut and blood splashes were digitally removed to reduce emphasis on blood and injury as an alternative to the uncut film being rated br br br Relaxation br There has been considerable relaxation since The relaxation of guidelines has also made hardcore pornography widely available to adult audiences through the R rating Films with this rating are only legally available from licensed sex shops of which there are about three hundred in the UK They may also be seen in specially licensed cinemas br There are also examples of films with stronger sexual content some including real images of sexual intercourse being approved at level Recent examples include the passing of Irreversible Songs Antichrist and numerous other films uncut for cinema and video viewing Despite this trend towards liberalisation anti censorship campaigners are still critical of the BBFC It has attracted criticism from conservative press in particular the Daily Mail on the grounds that the release of sexually explicit and violent films was corrupting the nation The newspaper s most famous clash with the BBFC came in when the board released the David Cronenberg film Crash without cuts The following day March the Daily Mail led with the banner headline Censor s Yes To Depraved Sex Film Westminster City Council imposed its own ban on the film after the decision although anyone wanting to watch the film in a cinema only had to walk along to the non Westminster half of Shaftesbury Avenue which is in the neighbouring borough of Camden br br br Current concerns br The BBFC s current guidelines identify a number of specific areas considered when awarding certificates or requiring cuts br br Depictions of cruelty and harassment based on race gender sexual orientation or mental or physical disability and or discrimination br Adult themes and situations that may be considered too distressing for younger or more sensitive viewers br Offensive language i e profanity and use of racial and ethnic slurs br Nudity in a sexual context br Sexual content including scenes of sexual activity and spoken visual references to sex br Violence br Gore and injury detail br Sexual violence particularly rape and forced disrobing br Dangerous actions that can easily be imitated by younger more naive viewers certain combat moves ear claps headbutts and neck breaking in particular br All visual and verbal references to suicide particularly if it involves hanging oneself or slashing one s wrists br Detailed criminal acts such as breaking into a house using a credit card to jimmy the lock or hotwiring a car br Actions that result in injury or death in real life but are almost always shown in the media especially on shows aimed at younger audiences such as cartoons with no negative consequences such as hiding in appliances that can trap and kill small children i e tumble driers and old refrigerators ingesting or misusing common household chemicals or creating dangerous objects from common household items such as a flamethrower from an aerosol can and a cigarette lighter br Scenes of horror threat and danger and their intensity on audience members br Drug abuse being condoned or glamorised br The BBFC also continues to demand cuts of any material it believes breaches the provisions of the Obscene Publications Act or any other legislation most notably the Cinematograph Films Animals Act which forbids the depiction of animals being abused or in distress and the Protection of Children Act which as amended forbids the depiction of minors engaged in sex or in sexually suggestive poses or situations In of cinema films had material cut and of videos Most cuts actually occur in videos rated for or R rather than videos intended for viewing by under s In of videos and of R videos had material cut br There is no theme or subject matter considered inherently unsuitable for classification at any level although more controversial topics may drive a movie to be given a more restrictive rating This is in keeping with current practice in most liberal democracies but in sharp contrast to the early days of the BBFC in which such adult themes as prostitution incest and the relations of capital and labour were unacceptable regardless of the rating br Adult or strong language can earn a film a more restrictive certificate though BBFC policy states that there are no constraints on language use in films awarded an certificate It is difficult to compare the BBFC s policies in this area with those in other countries as there are different taboos regarding profanity in other languages and indeed in other English speaking countries For example the use of strong language has little effect on a film s classification in France The BBFC s policy proved particularly controversial in the case of Ken Loach s Sweet Sixteen in which was passed uncut only at certificate even though its main characters were teenagers who frequently used profanities that the director argued were typical of the social group his film depicted The film received similar certificates in Ireland also an certificate and the United States Shane Meadows film This Is England was also passed uncut only at due to its repeated use of racist terms and the climactic scene where Combo becomes irate and pummels his friend Milky while insulting him On the other hand some films feature strong language but nevertheless do not carry particularly restrictive certificates The King s Speech was passed for a A rating despite its repeated use of the word fuck in two scenes which would normally raise the rating to a certificate the BBFC justified its decision saying that the profanity was in a speech therapy context As of November the word nigger should not be classified lower than unless in an educational or historical context br There are minimal restrictions of the depiction of non sexual nudity which is allowed in even U and PG certificate films for example The Simpsons Movie which was given a PG rating in the US was given a PG certificate in the UK leaving the sequence where Bart skateboards naked through town and his genitals are shown through an open space in a hedge unedited but scenes of simulated sexual activity are limited to more restricted certificates With regard to material that is intended primarily as pornographic the Board s policy as stated on its website is Material which appears to be simulated is generally passed while images of real sex are confined to the R category However for some years depictions of real sex have been allowed in certificate videos intended as educational and relatively recently a number of works such as Patrice Ch reau s Intimacy and Michael Winterbottom s Songs which feature apparently unsimulated sex have been passed uncut for theatrical release br Violence remains one of the most problematic areas for censorship in the UK especially when it is in conjunction with sex or likely to sway more impressionable viewers into thinking the violence depicted is glamorous or fun and risk free However the Board takes into account issues of context and whether it considers scenes of sexual violence to eroticise or endorse sexual assault In the board passed Gaspar No s Irr versible uncut but less than a month later cut Takashi Miike s Ichi the Killer by three and a quarter minutes to remove scenes of sexual violence A Serbian Film suffered forty nine individual cuts by the BBFC which totalled four minutes and eleven seconds of cuts The cuts were made to remove portrayals of children in a sexualised or abusive context and images of sexual and sexualised violence which have a tendency to eroticise or endorse the behaviour as the Board s website states br Criminal and dangerous acts that can be easily imitated as well as scenes condoning glamorising or showing clear instruction of how to abuse drugs have also been the subject of UK editing The issue of depicting dangerous acts that can easily be imitated in real life is one that does not seem to figure especially highly in the censorship systems of most other countries though the US has done this on occasion often as the result of public backlash as seen on the MTV shows Beavis and Butt head and Jackass In the UK numerous minor cuts have been made primarily to films whose distributors want a PG or A certificate to scenes of characters performing acts that would be considered dangerous criminal or harmful if done in real life For example in issues involving suicide by hanging became problematic The Ren Stimpy Show Series DVD set classified PG was edited to remove the song The Lord Loves a Hangin because the song implied that hanging is comedic fun and risk free Paranoia Agent Volume DVD set classified was also cut to remove the depiction of a child nearly hanging herself for the same reason br The requirement to have films classified and censored can cost film producers up to thousands of pounds The North West New Wave a blanket term recently used by both film makers and local press to describe independent filmmakers in the Northwest of England is currently campaigning for the introduction of a voluntary Unrated classification in the UK br On June the BBFC refused a classification for the horror film The Human Centipede II The previous film in the series was passed uncut at but due to a shift in context and focus the BBFC judged that the sequel could fall foul of the Obscene Publications Act The film was eventually passed after cuts were made br br br Leadership br br br Presidents of the BBFC br George A Redford January November br T P O Connor December November died in office br Edward
