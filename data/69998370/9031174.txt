with Scream premiering on December at the AMC Avco theater in Westwood California and was generally released on December Based on a screenplay by screenwriter Kevin Williamson and directed by Wes Craven creator of the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise Scream offered a self referential approach to horror by featuring a cast of characters aware of the conventions clich s of the horror film genre and able to use them to survive The film focuses on teenager Sidney Prescott as she comes under attack from a mysterious character dubbed Ghostface while dealing with the anniversary of her mother s murder The film went on to be a financial success and received considerable critical acclaim for its deconstruction of the horror genre It is credited with revitalizing the horror genre in the mid s and inspiring an array of imitators It was particularly notable for its casting of established and popular actors and actresses which was previously uncommon in horror films br br br Scream br br The series continued with Scream premiering at Mann s Chinese Theater followed by a general release on December Written by Williamson and directed by Craven released less than a year after the original film Like Scream the film features characters aware of the horror genre and the conventions of the horror sequel mocking them while simultaneously falling victim to them Set in the film again focuses on the character of Sidney Prescott now a college student as a series of copycat crimes begin the killers again using the disguise of Ghostface The film was financially successful and received similar critical praise for its deconstruction of the horror film sequel and commentary on the influence of the media in society The script for Scream was leaked during production revealing the identity of the killers and so the film underwent extensive rewrites changing the identity of the killers though their motivation remained the same br br br Scream br br The series continued with Scream which premiered on February at the AMC Avco theater in Westwood California and was generally released on February Like previous entries the film was directed by Craven but Williamson was unable to formulate a complete script due to his commitment to the short lived television series Wasteland and his original film Teaching Mrs Tingle Consequently he wound up being replaced by Ehren Kruger who finalized a script based on several ideas supplied by Williamson Set in the film focuses on Sidney Prescott who faces a new Ghostface killer and the truth about her mother that led to the start of the Ghostface killings The film like its predecessors featured characters who were self aware of horror conventions in this case the rules and structure of the final entry in a movie trilogy Scream was less successful than the previous two installments commentators noting that the film had become akin to the horror films it originally parodied in Scream and Scream Others were critical of the change in tone focusing more on humor instead of horror and violence However critics who reacted positively were supportive of this change in tone and praised the film for successfully completing the film trilogy The movie and its themes were re evaluated and examined in the wake of the MeToo movement br br br Scream br br In July The Weinstein Company announced the development of a new sequel Scream written by Williamson with Craven being secured for the project in March In May Cathy Konrad producer of the original three Scream films filed a US million lawsuit against The Weinstein Company alleging they violated an agreement with her company Cat Entertainment that gave them first rights to produce all Scream films The Weinstein Company argued that the agreement requires Konrad s services to be exclusive to the franchise an argument that Konrad called false pretext as the previous films did not make this stipulation Konrad accused the Weinsteins of attempting to force her to walk away without compensation in order to hire a cheaper producer Craven s wife Iya Labunka and cut costs In April it was reported that the case had been settled out of court by The Weinstein Company br The film underwent reshoots of some scenes in January with Craven stating that they were to enhance some scenes but that the ending remains untouched countering criticism that following a January test screening the film may undergo significant changes due to poor audience responses The fourth installment premiered on April at Grauman s Chinese Theater with a general release on April The film takes place ten years after the previous film and once again follows Sidney Prescott as she returns to Woodsboro the fictional town where Scream takes place on the last stop of her book tour and encounters another set of murders and a killer again using the guise of Ghostface br br br Scream br br In Craven confirmed he was contracted to work on a fifth and sixth installment of the Scream

Halloween special episodes of the second season br After the second season the series moved from MTV to VH The third and final season subtitled Resurrection premiered on VH from July to br br br Recurring cast and characters br br br Crew br br Craven initially intended to hire talented but relatively unknown actors who had not yet had a big break in the film industry as he had done with A Nightmare on Elm Street s Johnny Depp and Shocker s Peter Berg However the decision was made to cast actors who already had a notable body of work marking a change from many previous horror films where casting current popular actors was unheard of Craven believed their budget was inadequate to secure the actors they were pursuing but felt that Drew Barrymore s presence made people eager to take part and accepting of a lower salary br Barrymore initially approached the production herself after reading the script and was signed to play Sidney Prescott However as time progressed her schedule commitments meant she would be unable to remain in the leading role so she volunteered to play the smaller role of Casey Becker who dies early in the film The production felt that killing off an actress of Barrymore s stature early on would be a risk but thought that it would be shocking to the audience and make them believe that no other character was safe Following Barrymore s changed role Alicia Witt and Brittany Murphy auditioned for the lead and the production also considered contacting Reese Witherspoon The role was ultimately given to Neve Campbell after the director saw her in Party of Five believing she could best embody a character who was innocent but also able to handle herself while dealing with the physicality and emotions of the role Though reluctant to undertake another horror film so soon after The Craft Campbell chose to do Scream as it would be her first leading role and she adored the character saying She s a fantastic character for any kind of movie The production wanted a recognizable face for the role of news reporter Gale Weathers offering it to both Brooke Shields and Janeane Garofalo Cox who was starring in the hit NBC sitcom Friends at the time was not considered due to her history of playing softer kinder characters Cox however lobbied hard for the role for that reason wishing to play a bitch character her efforts ultimately succeeding when she was cast Actresses Melinda Clarke and Rebecca Gayheart auditioned for the role of Tatum Riley before Rose McGowan was cast due to her best embodying the spunky nature of the character It was believed the collective strong female cast of Campbell Barrymore Cox and McGowan would help draw a significant female audience to the film br Kevin Patrick Walls who played Barrymore s boyfriend Steve Orth in the opening of Scream was one of the final candidates for the role of Sidney s boyfriend Billy Loomis alongside Justin Whalin before it was won by Skeet Ulrich Campbell and Ulrich had a prior working relationship on The Craft which they believed help them better develop the relationship between Sidney and Billy David Arquette was also approached for the role of Billy Loomis but instead wanted the role of Dewey The role was described as hunky instead of the younger goofier approach of Arquette but Craven appreciated the idea and cast him in the role Matthew Lillard was cast by chance as he had accompanied his then girlfriend to a separate audition where Scream casting director Lisa Beach saw him and asked him to audition where he secured the role of Stu Macher The role of Randy Meeks was contested between Jamie Kennedy and Breckin Meyer with the production favoring Kennedy Having no major role prior to Scream the studio wanted a more prominent actor than Kennedy in the role but the production were adamant that he was the best choice and successfully fought to keep him in Roger L Jackson voice of the character Ghostface was picked at the end of several weeks of local casting in Santa Rosa The production had originally intended to only use his voice temporarily but ultimately decided that it was perfect for the role He was intentionally kept from meeting many members of the cast in all three original Scream films as it was thought it would help their performance if they could not put a face to the menacing voice The calls made by his character were genuine phone calls conducted on set by Jackson to the characters again with the intention of aiding the interaction between his character and the character being stalked in a scene Craven commented on Jackson s contribution to the film I can t imagine Scream without Ghostface Roger Jackson s voice is very remarkable it s got an evil sophistication br For Scream Campbell had been contracted for a possible sequel before filming began on Scream However actors with surviving characters had a sequel option added after it was known which character would be eligible to appear in the next film In interviews the production staff of Scream stated they believed that Barrymore s role in Scream added an element of respectability to the genre that made actors normally reluctant to engage a horror film eager to sign on to Scream Many of the actors involved including Campbell Cox Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jerry O Connell were starring in their own television series at the time making scheduling their availability with the film difficult Gellar in particular had also recently finished work on another Williamson penned film I Know What You Did Last Summer which was released two months prior to Scream She would admit in interviews that she signed on to Scream without having read the script based on the success of the first film Craven took their desire to participate in the film despite their workload as a compliment to the film s quality To obtain the role of Derek O Connell and other candidates had to audition by performing a scene from the film where the character sings I Think I Love You The cast was rounded out by Laurie Metcalf who had just finished a nine year run on the popular sitcom Roseanne Lewis Arquette father of David Arquette Jada Pinkett and Timothy Olyphant in what was his first leading role in a feature film Rebecca Gayheart who had unsuccessfully auditioned to play Tatum Riley in Scream auditioned for the roles of Hallie Cici and Maureen Evans before being cast as Sorority Sister Lois br For Scream Craven stated in an interview that convincing the central cast to return was not difficult but their burgeoning fame and busy schedules made arranging their availability with the film s production troublesome Campbell in particular was only available for days of filming which resulted in a significantly reduced role for her character and a focus on Cox and Arquette s characters Emily Mortimer was cast as Angelina Tyler but shortly after filming began it was discovered she lacked the required permit to work resulting in her being flown to Vancouver to obtain one Carrie Fisher made a cameo in the film at the suggestion of Bob Weinstein and Fisher helped write her character Kelly Rutherford was cast after filming had begun as the production was undergoing constant rewrites and the opening scene evolved from requiring only a female corpse to needing a live actress with whom Schreiber could interact In a interview Matthew Lillard who played Stu Macher in Scream claimed that he was signed to reprise his role in Scream as the primary antagonist but after the script moved in a direction without his character he was bought out of his contract br When production of Scream was announced Campbell initially refused offers to reprise her role as Sidney forcing early script drafts to be written in consideration of her absence However in September Campbell Cox and Arquette were all confirmed as reprising their roles as Sidney Gale and Dewey respectively with Jackson s commitment confirmed in July Continuing the trend started in Scream the production cast established and popular actors Hayden Panettiere Rory Culkin Anna Paquin Kristen Bell and Emma Roberts Roberts was cast as Jill Sidney Prescott s cousin beating out Ashley Greene for the role Lake Bell and Lauren Graham were cast in the film but dropped out early into production Bell citing scheduling conflicts Nico Tortorella auditioned five times to secure the role of Trevor the ex boyfriend of Roberts character by reenacting a scene from Scream where the character of Billy Loomis reveals he is one of the killers br br br Production br br br Writing br br Scream was conceived under the title Scary Movie by screenwriter Kevin Williamson as an page script inspired by a series of murders by the Gainesville Ripper that Williamson had seen in a news story and his own experience alone in a friend s house after discovering an open window he had not previously noticed The treatment covered what would become the opening scene of Scream featuring Drew Barrymore Williamson began to expand this script into what ultimately became Scream because his previous script Teaching Mrs Tingle was in development hell writing it in only three days in Palm Springs and bringing it to his agent in June to put it up for sale Accompanying the script were two page outlines for potential sequels to the film Williamson hoping to provide added incentive to buy the script by providing potential for a franchise Williamson would later claim he wrote the screenplay partly because it was a film he wanted to watch and nobody else is making it The script was self referential featuring characters who watched horror films and were aware of the conventions of the genre and featured numerous homages to many preceding horror films which Williamson would claim inspired him including Halloween Friday the th A Nightmare on Elm Street and Prom Night br Williamson was told early on by his agent Rob Paris that the saturation of violence and gore in his script would make it impossible to sell and following its purchase by Miramax he was required to remove much of the gorier scenes However once Craven was confirmed to direct he was able to bring much of the excised content back Williamson intended to remove a scene in the film that took place inside the fictional school s bathroom feeling it was awkward but Craven salvaged it believing it had potential Williamson later confirmed that he was glad Craven did so The death of the character Principal Himbry was added at the request of producer Bob Weinstein who noted that there was thirty pages thirty on screen minutes without a murder occurring This later aided Williamson who was struggling to find motivation for characters to leave a party in the film s finale now able to use the discovered corpse of the Himbry character When writing the finale Williamson was unsure what to cite as a motivation for the killers or whether to give them one at all Opinions were split between staff on the picture some who felt that a motive was necessary for the audience to be given resolution while others felt it was scarier without one Ultimately Williamson decided to do both giving the character Billy Loomis the motive of maternal abandonment while not giving the character of Stu Macher one instead having the character jokingly suggest peer pressure br Following the release of Scream Williamson confirmed that he had considered a concept for a sequel where the character Sidney Prescott attends college and a copycat killer begins stalking her Dimension Films agreed to pursue a sequel in May by which point Williamson had already written pages of the new script By July filming began on Scream but his completed script was leaked on the Internet revealing much of the plot including the finale and the identity of the film s killers As a result the production was forced to continue filming with only a partial script as Williamson conducted rewrites changing much of the finale the killer s victims and the killer s identity To prevent the identity of the killer or important plot points being revealed again the actors were not given the last pages of the script until weeks before shooting and the pages that revealed the killer s identity were only provided on the day the scene was shot The short production schedule on Scream and his work on other projects meant that Williamson s final script used for the film was detailed in some areas but lacking in others the intention being for Craven to fill out these scenes on set br Williamson was approached by Bob and Harvey Weinstein in early to pen a script for Scream but at the time he was involved with the writing and directing of his original script Teaching Mrs Tingle and developing the short lived TV series Wasteland Unable to write a full script Williamson provided a draft outline for the film that involved the filming of the film within a film Stab based on the previous film s in universe murders that took place in the fictional town of Woodsboro from the original Scream Arlington Road scribe Ehren Kruger was brought into the production by the Weinstein brothers to develop a script using Williamson s notes though Kruger admitted that without having been involved with the characters in the previous two films he struggled to write them true to character Early scripts by Kruger had the character of Sidney Prescott much like Linda Hamilton in Terminator at which point Craven would intervene to bring the character closer to previous iterations Kruger admits that Craven had a hand in writing the script though he remained uncredited for it Kruger s script would differ in many ways from Williamson s original including the removal of one of the killers and the inclusion of the death of Cotton Weary who was originally absent from the film Additionally the film s location changed from Woodsboro to Hollywood as Kruger believed that the characters should be moving to bigger places from high school to college to Hollywood However there were also considerations that creating a film containing acts of murder in and around the fictional Woodsboro school would receive negative attention following the Columbine High School massacre that occurred less than a year before the film s eventual release The film was given a greater emphasis on humor over violence and fared worse than previous installments both financially and critically br Almost ten years after the last installment in late Williamson formulated a concept for a new installment and approached Bob Weinstein who after hearing his pitch told Williamson to begin writing a script for what would become Scream Campbell initially refused to return to the series for Scream forcing early script drafts to be written in consideration of her characters absence with Cox and Arquette s characters becoming the focus Early versions of the script involved Campbell s character being attacked and killed in the opening a key point of contention for Weinstein who had it removed while another version had Cox and Arquette s characters as parents but this too was removed as it was believed that them having a child would be unworkable in the context of the film After Williamson was forced to leave the production due to contractual commitments to The Vampire Diaries under threat of legal action controversy arose in July when Scream writer Ehren Kruger was brought in by Weinstein to perform re writes on Williamson s script about which Craven was outspoken on losing control of the story He would later explain that despite rewrites it was still Williamson s characters and script stating br br Look there was a bumpy period when things shifted over from Kevin to Ehren I signed up to do a script by Kevin and unfortunately that didn t go all the way through the shooting But it certainly is Kevin s script and concept and characters and themes br Weinstein clarified that Kruger was brought in to punch up the film s dialog but his involvement with the writing was not to the same extent as with Scream To preserve the secrecy of the script and the identity of the film s killer the cast were only provided with pages of the page long script Like the two previous installments in the series the script underwent rewrites often with pages sometimes only ready on the day of shooting br br br Development br br The script for Scream then known as Scary Movie was released for sale on a Friday and by a m the following Monday had become involved in a significant bidding war from several studios including Paramount Pictures Universal Pictures and Morgan Creek with producer Cathy Konrad bringing it to the attention of Bob Weinstein The bidding eventually rose to an amount that the choice ultimately came down to Oliver Stone who was at the time working with Cinergi Pictures and Weinstein under Miramax Williamson agreed to terms with Miramax for plus a contract for two sequels and a third unrelated film believing their label Dimension Films would produce Scream immediately and without significant restriction Wes Craven was approached early on to helm the film but he was occupied with remaking The Haunting and so other directors including Robert Rodriguez Danny Boyle George A Romero and Sam Raimi were approached Concerns were raised by Williamson and Weinstein when many of the approached directors having read the script believed the film to be a comedy making them reluctant to hire those particular directors believing they didn t get it Craven was approached and passed on the film several times wanting to move away from the genre but was enticed once Drew Barrymore became involved reasoning that it may be different from his previous works if an actress of her recognition was involved Ultimately the production of The Haunting at that time fell through and Craven was able to take over directing duties on the film Close to the end of the film s production the Weinstein brothers had the film s title changed from Scary Movie to Scream inspired by the Michael Jackson song of the same name as Bob Weinstein felt Scary Movie was not suitable when the film also contained elements of satire and comedy The change was immediately disliked by both Williamson and Craven who considered it stupid but would later remark that it was a positive change br Following a successful screening with a test audience and Miramax executives both Williamson and Craven were offered a two picture contract for sequels to Scream Williamson already having been offered a three picture deal by Miramax for unrelated films Bob Weinstein ordered that the film be released on December a date others were critical of as it was the Christmas season where seasonal and family films were more prevalent Weinstein argued this fact was in the film s favor as it meant that horror fans and teenagers had nothing interesting to watch When Scream s first weekend takings amounted to only million it was considered that this release date gamble had failed but the following week the takings did not drop but increased and continued the following week leading to a total U S gross of over million As Scream s box office takings grew a lawsuit would be filed against Dimension Films by Sony Pictures who claimed that the title Scream was too similar to that of Sony s own film Screamers The case was settled out of court with the details remaining secret but producer Marianne Maddalena would confirm that the production were able to use the current and potential future titles of Scream and Scream br A sequel was considered in January after the first film proceeded to gross more than million in its first month Scream was greenlit with a budget of million and was released before the first film s anniversary The production of the film suffered a significant setback when the script was leaked revealing plot details including the identity of the killers resulting in the script being modified to change many details In an interview Craven commented on the rushed schedule for the film starting in July with a December release date with many scenes in the script provided with only a loose outline forcing him to develop scenes on set Various titles were considered for the sequel at different points in the film s production including Scream Again Scream Louder and Scream The Sequel before the studio decided to simply use Scream br Scream was released just over two years after Scream with Craven again attached to direct the film on a greatly increased budget of million Shortly before production began on the film the Columbine incident occurred and with it came an increased scrutiny on the media and its effect on people particularly films There were considerations at the time about whether the studio should continue production of a third installment in the aftermath of the incident but the studio decided to continue albeit with changes The studio was much more apprehensive concerning violence and gore in the film than with previous installments with them pressing for a greater emphasis on the series humor while scaling back on the violence At one point in the production the studio demanded that the film feature no blood or on screen violence but Craven intervened stating that the film should either have the violence present in earlier Scream films or should be called something other than Scream As with production of Scream Craven would again state in an interview that issues with censorship and the MPAA made him consider leaving the horror genre br Production of a new film Scream was announced in July by The Weinstein Company who approached Williamson about formulating a new script with the intention of creating a new Scream trilogy if the fourth film proved successful By late Williamson managed to develop an idea for the film and potential sequels and began work on the script The film was given a budget of million and the principal cast were signed to the film in September followed by Craven as director in March In May Cathy Konrad producer on the original three films filed a million lawsuit against The Weinstein Company accusing them of violating an agreement that her company Cat Entertainment be given first rights to produce all Scream films in order to cut costs by getting a cheaper producer Craven s wife Iya Labunka not named in the suit In April it was reported that the Weinsteins had settled out of court with Conrad the details remaining confidential The Hollywood Reporter however claimed that Conrad received a cash payment and entitlement to a percentage of the profits derived from Scream In addition she was given an executive producer credit on the film Williamson and Bob Weinstein came into repeated conflict with each other during production with Williamson citing the creative direction of the film as the cause while Weinstein blamed the time constraints on the film s development Williamson and Weinstein did not speak to each other after Williamson left the production claiming other responsibilities and he had not seen the finished version of the film prior to its release br br br Filming br br Filming for Scream began on April and finished on June Filming was intended to take place in North Carolina but the location was deemed unsuitable with scouts unable to find useful locations that would not require extensive building or modification to make fit the requirements of the film The production instead turned to Vancouver Washington and Los Angeles before discovering Sonoma County California and the areas within it Santa Rosa Healdsburg and Tomales Bay The house used by Barrymore s character is situated on Sonoma Mountain Road opposite the house used in the horror film Cujo Before filming began the production approached Santa Rosa High School about using it as Woodsboro High School The school board insisted on seeing the script and objected to the content of the film s dialog and the foul mouthed aggressive character of Principal Himbry The matter reached local newspapers who also raised criticism but there the production received support from students of the school and local residents who supported the economic benefits of the film s presence and others who defended its First Amendment rights Opposition to the film came from those who deplored its content of violence against children teenagers as the area had suffered the tragic kidnap and murder of Polly Klaas three years prior The matter resulted in a three hour debate on the topic scheduled for April one day after filming was to begin Unwilling to be delayed Craven began filming as scheduled on April with the opening scene of the film featuring Barrymore which took five days to complete The result of the Santa Rosa debate was that permission be denied and the production was forced to find another location for the school ultimately being offered the Sonoma Community Center which appears as Woodsboro High School in Scream br For the film s killer Williamson s script had provided Craven only with the description masked killer forcing him and his design team to create the Ghostface costume from scratch to conceal the killer s identity While awaiting permission from Fun World creators of the Ghostface mask design Craven had the design team KNB Effects create an alternative that was used in two scenes before being replaced by the original Fun World design once permission was granted Bob Weinstein disliked the Ghostface mask believing it was not scary and the studio upon reviewing the dailies footage of the opening scene were concerned that it was progressing in a direction they did not want and there was consideration that Craven could ultimately be replaced To assuage their concerns the first thirteen minutes of the opening scene were compiled as a workprint a rough version of the finished film and upon seeing it the studio were content to let Craven continue and Weinstein was satisfied that the mask could be scary The third and final act of the film set at a house party was over forty minutes long and shot at a vacant property in Tomales over twenty one nights The scene was considered the most difficult to shoot as it took place entirely in one location yet featured the individual stories and deaths of multiple characters and as it was set at night meant that production had to halt at daybreak br After filming completed in June Craven spent two months editing the final product encountering repeated conflicts with the film rating body MPAA concerning the content of scenes being forced to tone down or obscure the more intense scenes and violence to avoid an NC Though Dimension Films had previously released NC films the rating made those films difficult to market and attract an audience and thus they were desperate for a less restrictive R rating For an early scene involving the death of the character Casey Becker Craven lied to the MPAA by claiming he had only one take of the scene and could not replace it with something less intense in order to keep it in the film In interviews Craven indicated that the conflict was enough that at the time he was considering leaving the horror genre stating br br I m a director who can do something very well but am not allowed to put it on screen And they ultimately get you as they did on this one on intensity They say it s not a specific shot it s not blood it s just too intense br In total Craven sent eight different cuts of the film to the MPAA before Bob Weinstein intervened and personally contacted the MPAA believing they misunderstood to which genre Scream belonged Weinstein explained to the organisation that although he agreed it was intense it also had comedic elements and satirized its content and was not just a horror film glorifying violence The MPAA reviewed their decision and granted the film an R rating br Production of a sequel Scream was greenlit in May with filming beginning on September with a budget of million and wrapping on October Filming took place largely in Atlanta Georgia over four weeks before moving to Los Angeles Agnes Scott College in Atlanta and University of California Los Angeles were used to represent the fictional Windsor College that appears in the film The opening scene featuring the premiere of the fictional Stab film was filmed over three days in the Vista theater on Sunset Drive Hollywood the exterior represented by the Rialto Theater in South Pasadena Due to the large number of extras present in the scene its details were leaked onto the Internet shortly after filming completed which Craven cited as the productions first experience of a major plot leak After his interactions with the MPAA in Scream Craven sent them a copy of the film that was intentionally much more graphically violent than they were planning to release featuring Omar Epps character being stabbed in the ear three times and an extended scene of Randy Meeks death Their idea was that the MPAA would force them to remove the content the production already did not want while keeping the content they did However the MPAA gave them an R rating for the more violent cut stating that they felt the message of the film was significant Following a script leak early into filming security around the production was significantly increased with a focus on closed film sets and strict restriction on what personnel could be present during filming and have access to the script and with all present required to sign non disclosure agreements The script was printed on specialty paper to prevent photocopying and was often destroyed after use br Filming for Scream began on July in and around Hollywood Los Angeles in the areas of San Fernando Valley Macarthur Park Beverly Hills Hollywood Hills and Silverlake with a million budget and wrapped on September The isolated home of Campbell s character is situated in Topanga Canyon and Cox s character is introduced in a classroom at UCLA A scene where Campbell s character is pursued through movie set replicas of locations from Scream was not scripted but the sets were built because Craven knew he wanted to revisit the original film in some way after which they wrote the scene around the set Due to the constantly changing script used for the film which would often be usable on the day of filming the production filmed large amounts of footage of different variations of the same scenes in order that should the script again change they would ideally have a scene they could use without having to film new ones at a later date In particular the opening scene had three variants and the three minute scene featuring the character of Randy Meeks had two hours of filmed footage The ending too was refilmed in January three months after principal photography finished adding in the character of Mark Kincaid Patrick Dempsey and having Campbell s character beaten and then shot by Ghostface after it was decided she defeated him too easily So in flux was the script that the final scene of the movie was filmed with three variants of Dempsey s character one with him absent one with his arm in bandages and one with him in a normal condition as they were unsure of what his fate would be br Principal photography for Scream began on June with a budget of million and concluded on September Filming took place in Michigan in the areas of Ann Arbor Dearborn Livonia and Northville In January the film underwent an additional four days of filming to reshoot two scenes following a test screening the opening scene and a later scene that took place in a parking garage with Alison Brie Amidst criticism that the reshoots meant the film was in trouble and the result of a negative response from the test audience director Craven countered br br They re not reshoots we had a couple test screenings and we saw two scenes where they had moments you could add to and we just saw a spectacular opportunity The two scenes were really good but we saw how they could be spectacular so we thought let s just go for it They were key moments of the script so we just decided to go back and go for the grand slam on them br Craven also complimented the film s ending labeling it kick ass and stated that it remained untouched as part of the reshoot process In an interview Craven also highlighted that the script was so long they had filmed many scenes which had to be cut from the final film to reduce its running time br br br Music br br The score for the Scream series was provided by Marco Beltrami starting with Scream in what was his feature film debut Beltrami was brought onto the production of Scream after Craven s assistant Julie Plec requested input on the now defunct site Hollywood Cafe asking for opinions on was new fresh and wonderful and was provided with Beltrami s name by several people Craven sent for samples of Beltrami s work and was impressed by what he heard bringing him to the set to view the first thirteen minutes of the film featuring the introduction and murder of the character Casey Becker Craven had Beltrami produce music based on this scene and then demonstrate it impressing Craven enough to hire him For Scream the decision was made to intentionally use music to raise the tension in scenes where it was unnecessary when the characters were entering a situation where the audience may expect a killer to suddenly appear only to not deliver on that expectation part of the film s theme of playing with horror conventions Craven and editor Patrick Lussier provided Beltrami with advice on how best to deliver the music during scary and tense scenes as Beltrami had no prior experience in developing a horror score Beltrami intentionally avoided conventional horror score styles and approached the film as a western taking influence from Ennio Morricone prolific composer of many western films in the creation of Scream s music When scoring a theme for the character of Dewey Beltrami approached him as a sheriff but also as a quirky character using a Morricone style guitar accompaniment to maintain the Western approach An acoustic cover of Blue yster Cult s Don t Fear the Reaper plays softly in the background to Sidney and Billy s discussion of their relationship which analyst Jeff Smith describes as br br An ironic comment on the brutality we have just seen in the opening sequence More importantly however the allusion to the Blue yster Cult classic recasts the song s title by literalizing its meaning While the title itself invokes the Reaper as a popular symbol for death the film presents us with an actual person who not only dresses as the Grim Reaper but also unleashes homicidal vengeance on the other characters of the film The irony here of course is that Billy himself proves to be one of the film s dual slashers and is in fact the Reaper to be feared br The theme tune of Sidney Prescott entitled Sidney s Lament became a signature track for the series variations of the tune appearing across the score of Scream Scream and Scream The track features a female choral arrangement expressing sorrow concerning the fate of the character In Scream Beltrami stated that the voice spoke for the character lamenting the loss of her mother In future films it went on to represent the murders and ensuing trauma inflicted on her Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks called the haunting vocals of the track the voice of the franchise The track Sid Wears a Dress features in the finale of Scream where the sorrowful chorus of Lament gradually shifts key to represent hope for the characters future following the resolution of her storyline in what was then the final film in the series The female voice would be accompanied by a male addition for the first time in Pied a Terror from Scream to represent the brother of the character br Beltrami returned for Scream leading the score though there would be a late inclusion by Danny Elfman in the form of the choral track Cassandra Aria In addition excerpts from the score of Broken Arrow by Hans Zimmer appeared in the film in particular guitar work by Duane Eddy for the character Dewey replacing many of the character s related tracks from the original Scream score Beltrami later explained that the Zimmer piece was used as a scratch track for test screening purposes before the score was finalized The test audience reaction to it influenced the studio keep the Zimmer piece reducing Dewey s Theme which Beltrami had composed to fill its place to minor use during more serious scenes involving the character The Zimmer piece would continue to be used in Scream during scenes concerning the evolving relationship between the characters of Dewey and Gale with Beltrami appropriating and adding his own influence to the piece to blend it into the thematic Scream score br For Scream Beltrami employed seven orchestrators to aid in scoring the extensive orchestral accompaniment featured in the film s score Additionally he experimented with new styles of sound production by recording instruments in abnormal circumstances such as inserting objects into a piano and recording at various velocities to create a distorted unnatural sound and modifying the results electronically br br br Reception br br br Box office performance br br To date the franchise has earned over million worldwide The

of the first film in with Kevin Thomas of The Los Angeles Times calling Scream a bravura provocative sendup of horror pictures while Empire s Adam Smith called it Clever quick and bloody funny Other

plot which deftly mixes irony self reference and wry social commentary with chills and blood spills Janet Maslin of The New York Times was less complimentary saying Craven wants things both ways capitalizing on lurid material while undermining it with mocking humor Not even horror fans who can answer all this film s knowing trivia questions may be fully comfortable with such an exploitative mix br Scream went on to rank No on Entertainment Weekly s list of the Best High School Movies and No on Bravo s The Scariest Movie Movements In Entertainment Weekly would add additional praise to the film listing it as No on their list of the Best Films of the Last years The film ranked No on Empire s list of The Greatest Movies of All Time Scream received several awards in including the Saturn

was also awarded the Best Movie by the MTV Movie Awards br Scream received equally positive critical response with some critics arguing that the film surpassed the original in scares and humor Both Gene Siskel and the New York Times Janet Maslin gave the sequel positive reviews despite their negative response to Scream The film failed to achieve the same success as the original in terms of awards however winning only the MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance for Campbell plus Saturn Award nominations for Best Actress Best Supporting Actress and Best Horror Film for Campbell Cox

characters Roger Ebert said they are so thin they re transparent but praised Campbell s appearance saying The camera loves her She could become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute Not all reviews were negative Kevin Thomas at the Los Angeles Times called it genuinely scary and also highly amusing and Tom Coates at the BBC stated that as the conclusion to the trilogy it works more effectively than anyone had a right to expect The movie and its themes were re evaluated and examined in the wake of the MeToo movement with many seeing the commentary on sexism and abuse in Hollywood as ahead of its time br Scream received mixed reviews at the time of its release While critics said it was an improvement over its predecessor they were divided over the humor kills and its use of clich s New York Daily News wrote that the film was dated and that its reliance on obvious clich s doesn t seem ironic anymore just easy Empire gave the film two out of five

Aedan Juvet of Screen Rant called the entry an excellent modern slasher and wrote Though the franchise has always been a distinguished property with pure perfection the recent return to Scream raises

the spark Bettinelli Olpin and Gillett brought to Ready or Not Scream is certainly funny and irreverent but where it falls over is that it s rarely scary br Scream VI received positive reviews from

a more mixed review Olly Richards reviewing the film for Empire gave it three out of five stars opining that it was still far more inventive and entertaining than most horror franchises of a similar
