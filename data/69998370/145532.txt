in college that I realized that there was a difference between Japanese and Japanese American That s important to realize It s not the same thing and then eventually with Linkin Park I toured in Japan I ve been there now I think four times I remember the first time I went how familiar it seemed just getting out of the plane it smelled like my aunt s house in the airport it smelled like Japan I don t know if anybody else even noticed it but I walked out of the plane and thought this is definitely familiar to me didn t even see anything yet And then going to Tokyo Osaka Kyoto Nagoya you just recognize things about the way people act the small things that people do such as how you ll grab a piece of paper There are things that are more obvious like taking somebody s business card with two hands You don t do that in the States When I saw somebody do that I went Oh yeah my uncle always does that you know There are little things that culturally come from Japan but they also exist in
