think it is the least bit accidental that Waters Gus s last name and Grace Hazel s middle name met in the sacred heart of Christ and thereby despite their shared suffering managed to give life to one another and so Hazel effectively repudiates her nihilism and materialism as she responds across the barrier of death to Gus s okay He also noted Is this film a satisfying presentation of Christianity
