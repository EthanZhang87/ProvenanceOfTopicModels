Mooniyaang which was the first stopping place in the Ojibwe migration story as related in the seven fires prophecy br In the Mohawk language the land is called Tiohti ke This is an abbreviation of Teionihtiohti kon which loosely translates as where the group divided parted ways br French settlers from La Fl che in the Loire valley first named their new town founded in Ville Marie City of Mary named for the Virgin Mary br The current form of the name Montr al is generally thought to be derived from Mount Royal Mont Royal in French the triple peaked hill in the heart of the city There are multiple explanations for how Mont Royal became Montr al In th century French the forms r al and royal were used interchangeably so Montr al could simply be a variant of Mont Royal In the second explanation the name came from an Italian translation Venetian geographer Giovanni Battista Ramusio used the name Monte Real to designate Mount Royal in his map of the region However the Commission de toponymie du Qu bec disputes this explanation br Historiographer Fran ois de Belleforest was the first to use the form Montr al with reference to the entire region in br br br History br br br Pre European contact br br Archaeological evidence in the region indicates that First Nations native people occupied the island of Montreal as early as years ago By the year AD they had started to cultivate maize Within a few hundred years they had built fortified villages The Saint Lawrence Iroquoians an ethnically and culturally distinct group from the Iroquois nations of the Haudenosaunee then based in present day New York established the village of Hochelaga at the foot of Mount Royal two centuries before the French arrived Archeologists have found evidence of their habitation there and at other locations in the valley since at least the th century br The French explorer Jacques Cartier visited Hochelaga on October and estimated the population of the native people at Hochelaga to be over a thousand people Evidence of earlier occupation of the island such as those uncovered in during the construction of Fort Ville Marie have effectively been removed br br br Early European settlement br In French explorer Samuel de Champlain reported that the St Lawrence Iroquoians and their settlements had disappeared altogether from the St Lawrence valley This is believed to be due to outmigration epidemics of European diseases or intertribal wars In Champlain established a fur trading post on the Island of Montreal on a site initially named La Place Royale At the confluence of Petite Riviere and St Lawrence River it is where present day Pointe Calli re stands On his map Champlain named the island Lille de Villemenon in honour of the sieur de Villemenon a French dignitary who was seeking the viceroyship of New France In J r me Le Royer de La Dauversi re obtained the Seigneurial title to the Island of Montreal in the name of the Notre Dame Society of Montreal to establish a Roman Catholic mission to evangelize natives br Dauversiere hired Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve then age to lead a group of colonists to build a mission on his new seigneury The colonists left France in for Quebec and arrived on the island the following year On May Ville Marie was founded on the southern shore of Montreal island with Maisonneuve as its first governor The settlement included a chapel and a hospital under the command of Jeanne Mance By Ville Marie had come under Iroquois raids In Maisonneuve returned to France to raise volunteers to bolster the colonial population If the effort had failed Montreal was to be abandoned and the survivors re located downriver to Quebec City Before these arrived in the fall of the population of Montreal was barely people br br By Ville Marie was home to some colonists most of them living in modest wooden houses Ville Marie became a centre for the fur trade and a base for further exploration In the English allied Iroquois attacked Lachine on the Island of Montreal committing the worst massacre in the history of New France By the early th century the Sulpician Order was established there To encourage French settlement it wanted the Mohawk to move away from the fur trading post at Ville Marie It had a mission village known as Kahnewake south of the St Lawrence River The fathers persuaded some Mohawk to make a new settlement at their former hunting grounds north of the Ottawa River This became Kanesatake In several Mohawk families moved upriver to create another settlement known as Akwesasne All three are now Mohawk reserves in Canada The Canadian territory was ruled as a French colony until when Montreal fell to a British offensive during the Seven Years War The colony then surrendered to Great Britain br Ville Marie was the name for the settlement that appeared in all official documents until when Montreal appeared for the first time although people referred to the Island of Montreal long before then br br br American occupation br br As part of the American Revolution the invasion of Quebec resulted after Benedict Arnold captured Fort Ticonderoga in present day upstate New York in May as a launching point to Arnold s invasion of Quebec in September While Arnold approached the Plains of Abraham Montreal fell to American forces led by Richard Montgomery on November after it was abandoned by Guy Carleton After Arnold withdrew from Quebec City to Pointe aux Trembles on November Montgomery s forces left Montreal on December and arrived there on December to plot to attack Quebec City with Montgomery leaving David Wooster in charge of the city Montgomery was killed in the failed attack and Arnold who had taken command sent Brigadier General Moses Hazen to inform Wooster of the defeat br Wooster left Hazen in command on March as he left to replace Arnold in leading further attacks on Quebec City On April Arnold arrived in Montreal to take over command from Hazen who remained as his second in command Hazen sent Colonel Timothy Bedel to form a garrison of men miles upriver in a garrison at Les C dres Quebec to defend Montreal against the British army In the Battle of the Cedars Bedel s lieutenant Isaac Butterfield surrendered to George Forster br Forster advanced to Fort Senneville on May By May Arnold was entrenched in Montreal s borough of Lachine Forster initially approached Lachine then withdrew to Quinze Ch nes Arnold s forces then abandoned Lachine to chase Forster The Americans burned Senneville on May After Arnold crossed the Ottawa River in pursuit of Forster Forster s cannons repelled Arnold s forces Forster negotiated a prisoner exchange with Henry Sherburne and Isaac Butterfield resulting in a May boating of their deputy Lieutenant Park being returned to the Americans Arnold and Forster negotiated further and more American prisoners were returned to Arnold at Sainte Anne de Bellevue Quebec Fort Anne on May delayed two days by wind br Arnold eventually withdrew his forces back to the New York fort of Ticonderoga by the summer On June Arnold s messenger approaching Sorel spotted Carleton returning with a fleet of ships and notified him Arnold s forces abandoned Montreal attempting to burn it down in the process prior to the June arrival of Carleton s fleet br The Americans did not return British prisoners in exchange as previously agreed due to accusations of abuse with Congress repudiating the agreement at the protest of George Washington Arnold blamed Colonel Timothy Bedel for the defeat removing him and Lieutenant Butterfield from command and sending them to Sorel for court martial The retreat of the American army delayed their court martial until August when they were convicted and cashiered at Ticonderoga Bedel was given a new commission by Congress in October after Arnold was assigned to defend Rhode Island in July br br br Modern history as city present br br Montreal was incorporated as a city in The opening of the Lachine Canal permitted ships to bypass the unnavigable Lachine Rapids while the construction of the Victoria Bridge established Montreal as a major railway hub The leaders of Montreal s business community had started to build their homes in the Golden Square Mile from about By it was the largest municipality in British North America and the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Canada br In the th century maintaining Montreal s drinking water became increasingly difficult with the rapid increase in population A majority of the drinking water was still coming from the city s harbour which was busy and heavily trafficked leading to the deterioration of the water within In the mid s the City of Montreal installed a water system that would pump water from the St Lawrence and into cisterns The cisterns would then be transported to the desired location This was not the first water system of its type in Montreal as there had been one in private ownership since In the middle of the th century water distribution was carried out by fontainiers The fountainiers would open and close water valves outside of buildings as directed all over the city As they lacked modern plumbing systems it was impossible to connect all buildings at once and it also acted as a conservation method However the population was not finished rising it rose from in to by br br Montreal was the capital of the Province of Canada from to but lost its status when a Tory mob burnt down the Parliament building to protest the passage of the Rebellion Losses Bill Thereafter the capital rotated between Quebec City and Toronto until in Queen Victoria herself established Ottawa as the capital due to strategic reasons The reasons were twofold First because it was located more in the interior of the Province of Canada it was less susceptible to attack from the United States Second and perhaps more importantly because it lay on the border between French and English Canada Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal Toronto Kingston and Quebec City which were all vying to become the young nation s official capital Ottawa retained the status as capital of Canada when the Province of Canada joined with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to form the Dominion of Canada in br An internment camp was set up at Immigration Hall in Montreal from August to November br After World War I the prohibition movement in the United States led to Montreal becoming a destination for Americans looking for alcohol Unemployment remained high in the city and was exacerbated by the Stock Market Crash of and the Great Depression br br During World War II Mayor Camillien Houde protested against conscription and urged Montrealers to disobey the federal government s registry of all men and women The federal government part of the Allied forces was furious over Houde s stand and held him in a prison camp until That year the government decided to institute conscription to expand the armed forces and fight the Axis powers See Conscription Crisis of br Montreal was the official residence of the Luxembourg royal family in exile during World War II br By Montreal s population had surpassed one million However Toronto s growth had begun challenging Montreal s status as the economic capital of Canada Indeed the volume of stocks traded at the Toronto Stock Exchange had already surpassed that traded at the Montreal Stock Exchange in the s The Saint Lawrence Seaway opened in allowing vessels to bypass Montreal In time this development led to the end of the city s economic dominance as businesses moved to other areas During the s there was continued growth as Canada s tallest skyscrapers new expressways and the subway system known as the Montreal Metro were finished during this time Montreal also held the World s Fair of better known as Expo br br The s ushered in a period of wide ranging social and political changes stemming largely from the concerns of the French speaking majority about the conservation of their culture and language given the traditional predominance of the English Canadian minority in the business arena The October Crisis and the election of the Parti Qu b cois which supported sovereign status for Quebec resulted in the departure of many businesses and people from the city In Montreal hosted the Summer Olympics While the event brought the city international prestige and attention the Olympic Stadium built for the event resulted in massive debt for the city During the s and early s Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities Montreal was the site of the cole Polytechnique massacre one of Canada s worst mass shootings where year old Marc L pine shot and killed people all of them women and wounded other people before shooting himself at cole Polytechnique br Montreal was merged with the surrounding municipalities on the Island of Montreal on January creating a unified city encompassing the entire island There was substantial resistance from the suburbs to the merger with the perception being that it was forced on the mostly English suburbs by the Parti Qu b cois As expected this move proved unpopular and several mergers were later rescinded Several former municipalities totalling of the population of the island voted to leave the unified city in separate referendums in June The demerger took place on January leaving municipalities on the island including Montreal Demerged municipalities remain affiliated with the city through an agglomeration council that collects taxes from them to pay for numerous shared services The mergers were not the first in the city s history Montreal annexed other cities towns and villages beginning with Hochelaga in with the last prior to being Pointe aux Trembles in br The st century has brought with it a revival of the city s economic and cultural landscape The construction of new residential skyscrapers two super
