away leaving it as is br br br Cast br br br Production br br br Development br Scream was released just over two years after Scream greenlit with a budget of million a significant increase over the budgets of Scream at million and Scream at million Williamson s involvement had been contracted while selling his Scream script to which he had attached two five page outlines for potential sequels which would become Scream and Scream hoping to entice buyers with the prospect of purchasing a franchise rather than a single script Craven too had been contracted for two potential sequels following a successful test screening of Scream and he returned to direct the third installment Shortly before production began on the film Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed students a teacher and themselves at their school in what became known as the Columbine High School massacre In the aftermath of the incident many parties began looking for rationales for their actions and this led to an increased scrutiny on the role of the media in society including video games and film and the influence it could have on an audience With the production of Scream not yet underway there were considerations about whether the film should be made at that time aware of the potential for negative attention but the studio decided to press forward albeit with changes The studio remained however much more apprehensive concerning violence and gore in Scream than with previous installments pressing for a greater emphasis on the series satiric humor while scaling back on the violence At one point in the production the studio went as far as demanding that the film feature no blood or on screen violence at all a drastic departure for the series but Craven directly intervened According to Kruger Craven said Be serious guys Either we make a Scream movie or we make a movie and call it something else But if it s a Scream movie it s going to have certain standards br br br Writing br Bob and Harvey Weinstein approached Williamson in early to pursue a full script for a third installment to the Scream franchise Scream However following his successes with the Scream series and other projects such as I Know What You Did Last Summer Williamson had become involved in multiple projects including the development of the short lived TV series Wasteland and directing his self penned film Teaching Mrs Tingle which Williamson had written prior to Scream and which had languished in development hell since Unable to develop a full script for the production Williamson instead wrote a page draft outline for the film that involved the return of Ghostface to the fictional town of Woodsboro where the Stab series a fictional series of films within a film that exist within the Scream universe and are based on the events of Scream would be filmed The Weinsteins hired Arlington Road scribe Ehren Kruger to replace Williamson and helm writing duties developing a script based on Williamson s notes br The environment for Scream s development had become more complicated than with previous films There was increased scrutiny on the effects of violence in media and the effect it could have on the public in the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre which occurred shortly before production would begin on the film In addition since the release of the original Scream films various acts of violence had taken place which had gained notoriety and media attention when they were linked to or blamed on the films Eager to avoid further criticism or connection to such incidents Williamson s notes were largely discarded as the studio insisted that the script should focus on the comedic elements of the series while significantly reducing the violence The setting of the film was changed from Woodsboro to Hollywood upon which Kruger commented that he believed the characters should be moving to bigger places from high school to college to the city of Hollywood Behind the scenes however the move away from Woodsboro was mandated as it was considered that a film containing violent acts of murder in and around the small town of Woodsboro and the associated school would attract significant negative criticism and attention that could be detrimental to the production and studio with the film set for release less than a year following the Columbine incident br Kruger agreed to develop the script for Scream primarily to work with Craven and the executives under Miramax he said of his decision to take on writing duties on the film br br When you re doing a rewrite script it s never totally coming from you It s never the same as writing an original So often what you look for is Well who am I going to be working with and Who am I going to be learning from The answers to those questions give you a lot of motivation for pursuing a project like this br To help in developing the script Kruger read copies of Williamson s scripts for Scream and Scream as well as watched the earlier films to better understand the characters and tone In an interview Kruger admitted that his lack of involvement with the development of the principal cast of Scream hampered his ability to portray them true to their previous characterization Early scripts for Scream had the character of Sidney Prescott much like Linda Hamilton in Terminator Judgment Day a more action orientated heroine at which point Craven would intervene and correct the script to bring the characters closer to their previous appearances Kruger admitted that despite not receiving any writing credit Craven had a significant hand in developing the script for Scream Like Scream the script for Scream was subject to repeated alterations with pages sometimes completed only on the day on which they were to be filmed Multiple scenes were rewritten to include previously absent characters or change elements of the plot when it was decided that they were not connecting with other scenes In a interview Williamson further detailed his original script which would have seen the killers be a Stab fan club of Woodsboro kids All the members of the club would have been involved in the killings and the final twist of the movie was when Sidney walked into the house after Ghostface had killed everyone and they all rose up None of them were actually dead and they d planned the whole thing Williamson later adapted this story for his TV series The Following br br br Casting br Neve Campbell Courteney Cox David Arquette and Liev Schreiber all returned to their roles as Sidney Prescott and news reporter Gale Weathers Dewey Riley and Cotton Weary now host of a TV show respectively for Scream their characters being the only central roles to survive the events of the previous two films In an interview Craven stated that convincing the central cast to return to film a new Scream film was not difficult but as with Scream their burgeoning fame and busy schedules made arranging their availability with the film s production period difficult The consequence of Campbell s commitments in particular meant she was only available to film her role for days forcing the script to reduce the series main character to a smaller role while focusing on the other characters played by Cox and Arquette Lynn McRee finally makes a physical appearance in the series as Maureen Prescott though only through a hallucination of Sidney and Sidney now is a crisis counselor Roger L Jackson again returned to voice the antagonist Ghostface and Jamie Kennedy reprised his role as Randy Meeks in spite of the character s death in Scream Negative feedback following the death of Randy had the production consider methods to have had his character survive to appear in Scream including having the character s family hide him away for safety while recuperating from his injuries but it was deemed too unbelievable and the idea was replaced with the character appearing in a minor role via a pre recorded video message br Many of the supporting cast played fictitious actors taking part in the film within a film Stab including Emily Mortimer as Angelina Tyler Parker Posey as Jennifer Jolie Matt Keeslar as Tom Prinze Jenny McCarthy as Sarah Darling and Deon Richmond as Tyson Fox with Scott Foley as the film s director Roman Bridger Additional cast included Lance Henriksen as film producer John Milton Patrick Dempsey as detective Mark Kincaid Patrick Warburton as bodyguard Steven Stone and Kelly Rutherford as Christine Hamilton girlfriend to Cotton Weary Rutherford was cast after filming had begun as the production was undergoing constant rewrites and the opening scene evolved from requiring only a female corpse to needing a live actress with whom Schreiber could interact Shortly after being cast Mortimer was found to lack the necessary work permit to allow her involvement in the film requiring her to be flown to Vancouver to obtain one Scream also featured the first live on screen appearance of Sidney Prescott s mother Maureen Prescott played by Lynn McRee the actress previously having represented the character in photographs during the previous films br Lawrence Hecht and C W Morgan appeared in minor roles reprising their characters of Sidney s father Neil Prescott and Hank Loomis respectively Nancy O Dell appeared as an unnamed reporter having previously appeared in Scream and would go on to appear in Scream in the same role Scream featured several cameo appearances including the fictional characters of Jay and Silent Bob from the film Clerks and sequels played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith and director Roger Corman as an on set studio executive Carrie Fisher made a cameo in the film as former actress Bianca Burnette at the suggestion of Bob Weinstein Fisher helped to write her character who makes reference to having almost been cast as Princess Leia br In a interview Matthew Lillard who played Stu Macher in Scream said that he had been contracted to reprise his role in Scream as the primary antagonist having survived his apparent death orchestrating new Ghostface attacks from prison on high school students and ultimately targeting Sidney Following the Columbine High School massacre shortly before production began the script was scrapped and re written without his character and this plot to avoid development of a film which associated violence and murder with a high school setting br br br Filming br Principal photography for Scream began on July in and around Hollywood Los Angeles on a budget of million and finished on September after twelve weeks Filming took place largely in the areas of San Fernando Valley Macarthur Park Beverly Hills Hollywood Hills and Silver Lake with the isolated home of Campbell s character situated in Topanga Canyon The opening scene involves Cotton Weary Schreiber driving before arriving home where he is murdered by the Ghostface character For the driving scene the production filmed on Hollywood Boulevard but the following scene in Cotton s apartment was changed frequently requiring alterations to the driving scene to maintain continuity modifying who speaks to Cotton by phone and what the conversation entailed Unable to return to Hollywood Boulevard the scene was reshot on a street outside of the production studio in San Fernando Valley and intermixed with footage taken on the Boulevard The opening attack scene was filmed partially at the exterior and interior of Harper House in West Hollywood but changes were made to the scene including introducing a live girlfriend for Cotton instead of her being dead when Cotton arrives It was later decided that the confrontation between Cotton and Ghostface featuring Cotton physically dominating the character and attempting to escape by skylight was unrealistic and made Ghostface appear weak and this scene was reshot Again however they were unable to return to Harper House to conduct filming and resorted to constructing a replica of the apartment interior to produce the necessary footage which had the Ghostface character appear more dominant and completely excised the attempted skylight escape Cox s character is introduced during a seminar which takes place within a classroom at UCLA a location previously used in Scream to represent the fictional Windsor College The film studio where the fictional Stab is filmed is represented by the CBS Studio Center in Studio City San Fernando Valley while scenes at the home of Posey s character were filmed in the Hollywood Hills at Runyon Ranch in Runyon Canyon Park The finale featuring the final attacks of the film and confrontation between the antagonist and Sidney was filmed at the Canfield Moreno Estate a mansion in Silverlake br A scene in the film involved Campbell being pursued by Ghostface through filmset replicas of locations from the original Scream including her character s home The scene was not present in the script itself but Craven paid to have the sets constructed knowing he wanted to revisit the original film in some manner After the construction of the sets the scene was then written around the resulting areas producing the scene in the final film The script underwent changes repeatedly as filming was conducted with pages regularly only available on the day of filming Additionally if the production decided to change a scene this sometimes meant refilming other scenes to maintain continuity requiring further rewrites The production team purposely filmed large amounts of footage containing different variations of each scene based on the different script developments in order that should the script further change they would ideally have a scene they could use without having to film new ones at a later date requiring them to obtain access to locations or build sets Additionally a three minute scene featuring the character of Randy Meeks had over two hours of footage filmed The script for the film was so in flux that the epilogue scene was filmed with three variants of Patrick Dempsey s character one with him absent one where his arm is bandaged and one with him in a normal condition as the production were not certain what his ultimate fate would be following the finalization of the film br br br Post production br In January three months after completing principal photography for Scream the ending was refilmed when it was decided to be an inadequate conclusion Originally the ending consisted of Sidney Campbell easily defeating Roman Scott Foley which led into an early morning scene of police arriving and then into the final scene of Sidney in her home The production considered that this amounted to essentially three endings damaging the pacing of the film and there was also consideration that being the concluding chapter of the trilogy the audience needed to believe that Sidney could lose and die something her easy victory did not achieve To create the alternate ending the fight scene between Sidney and Roman was extended and an addition involved Roman shooting Sidney seemingly to death where previously she had simply hidden from the character A major addition was the presence of the character Mark Kincaid Patrick Dempsey who had previously been completely absent from the finale after the production realized that his character simply disappeared from the plot and his story arc went nowhere br As with the production of Scream Craven encountered repeated conflicts over censorship with the MPAA regarding violence and the director stated in an interview that the issues made him consider leaving the horror genre br br br Music br br Marco Beltrami returned to score Scream having scored the previous two films in the series For the film Beltrami employed seven orchestrators to aid in scoring the extensive orchestral accompaniment featured in the film s score He experimented with new styles of sound production by recording instruments in abnormal circumstances such as inserting objects into a piano and recording at various velocities to create a distorted unnatural sound and modifying the results electronically Beltrami continued to incorporate a heavy vocal orchestra throughout the score as he had with the previous films There was consideration that Beltrami was forced to hire multiple orchestrators to complete the score to meet the film s deadline Beltrami took inspiration from other composers for the score again incorporating excerpts of the score to Broken Arrow by Hans Zimmer in the track Sid Wears a Dress br br br Reception br Scream held its premiere on February at the AMC Avco theater in Westwood Los Angeles California and was theatrically released the following day on February br br br Box office br The film set a record for the widest opening ever in the United States and Canada being released on screens br The film grossed million during its opening weekend ranking number one at the US box office It broke The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition s record for the highest weekend debut in February It also beat Scream s record for the highest weekend debut for a horror film and also for a Miramax film It went on to gross million in the United States and Canada and million in other territories for a world lifetime gross of million br br br Critical response br On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews and an average rating of The website s critical consensus reads Despite some surprising twists Scream sees the franchise falling back on the same old horror formulas and cliches it once hacked and slashed with postmodern abandon On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews On CinemaScore audiences gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br Time Out London was particularly critical of the film calling the film s metafiction commentary a poor imitation of Craven s own horror film Wes Craven s New Nightmare Of the characters Roger Ebert said the characters are so thin they re transparent but praised Campbell s appearance saying The camera loves her She could become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute br In a positive review the Los Angeles Times called the film Genuinely scary and also highly amusing and the BBC stated that as the conclusion to the trilogy it works more effectively than anyone had a right to expect Variety also praised the film as the end of the Scream trilogy saying Aficionados will be the best able to appreciate how wittily Craven has brought down the curtain on his much imitated genre reviving series while Empire called it satisfying though believed the premise of the series had worn thin br br br Post re evaluation br In the wake of the scandal involving the Scream films executive producer Harvey Weinstein several publications noted the parallels between Weinstein s behavior and the themes of abuse featured in the film particularly those involving Maureen Prescott the late mother of the film series protagonist Sidney In Kristen Yoonsoo Kim noted the scene in which John Milton portrayed by Lance Henriksen discusses taking advantage of aspiring actresses In the film s editor Patrick Lussier discussed those particular themes and Wes Craven s approach to them saying of Henriksen s character Wes I think was very interested in that character as not necessarily the villain he certainly is a villain but as a catalyst for the villain s motivation He s really the spark for the events or retconned that he is the spark for the events in the entire series br In Adam White wrote that the film was an angry indictment of sexual misconduct in Hollywood predatory men and the casting couch He noted several instances of transactional sex within the film including the characters Jennifer and Angelina both making references to having sex with filmmakers in order to secure roles in the fictional Stab film and Carrie Fisher in a cameo role as a lookalike of Fisher herself who claims that the role of Princess Leia in the Star Wars franchise was won by the one who slept with George Lucas White also noted that Rose McGowan who appeared in the first Scream film later accused Weinstein of raping her in a hotel room a year after the film was released McGowan revealed in that she received a settlement as a result of this attack br Writing for SyFy Wire Emma Fraser commented that throughout the series the late Maureen is slut shamed and victim blamed Fraser also lamented the film s lack of exploration of these themes stating that the film could have been a fascinating look at the crimes of this industry and the relationship horror has with sex br br br Home media br Scream was
