Pitt as they try to stop a serial killer from committing a series of murders based on the seven deadly sins br Walker an aspiring writer based Seven on his experiences of moving from a suburban setting to New York City during a period of rising crime and drug addiction in the late s His script was optioned by an Italian film company but following financial difficulties the rights were sold to New Line Cinema Studio executives were opposed to the script s bleak conclusion insisting on a more mainstream and optimistic outcome Fincher determined to re establish himself after a career setback with his directorial debut Alien was mistakenly sent Walker s original script and convinced of its merit committed to directing the project if the original ending remained intact Principal photography took place in Los Angeles between December and March on a million budget br Seven garnered middling test audience results and was not predicted to perform well due to its violent and mature content However it grossed million worldwide becoming a surprise success and the seventh highest grossing film of the year Contemporaneous reviews were generally positive praising the performances of the central cast and the ending Seven revitalized Fincher s career and helped Pitt move from roles based on his appearance to more serious dramatic roles br In the years since its release consensus on the movie has generally shifted to critical acclaim It has been influential in filmmaking inspiring many imitators of its aesthetic style soundtrack and premise of detectives investigating serial killers with distinctive methods and motives The film s title sequence which depicts the killer preparing for his actions later in the film is considered an important design innovation that sparked a renewed interest in title design while the film s twist ending has been named as one of the most shocking and unforgettable in cinematic history br br br Plot br In an unnamed city overcome with violent crime and corruption disillusioned police detective William Somerset is one week from retirement He is partnered with David Mills a young short tempered idealistic detective who recently relocated to the city with his wife Tracy On Monday Somerset and Mills investigate an obese man who was forced to eat until his stomach burst killing him The detectives find the word gluttony written on a wall Somerset considering the case too extreme for his last investigation asks to be reassigned but his request is denied The following day another victim who had been forced to cut one pound kg of flesh from his body is found the crime scene is marked greed Clues at the scene lead Somerset and Mills to the sloth victim a drug dealing pederast whom they find emaciated and restrained to a bed Photographs reveal the victim was restrained for exactly one year Somerset surmises the murders are based on the Christian concept of the seven deadly sins br Tracy invites Somerset to share supper with her and Mills helping the detectives overcome their mutual hostility On Friday Tracy meets privately with Somerset because she has no other acquaintances in the city She reveals her unhappiness at moving there especially after learning she is pregnant and believes the city is an unfit place to raise a child Somerset sympathizes with Tracy having persuaded his former girlfriend to abort their child for similar reasons and regretting it ever since he advises Tracy to inform Mills only if she intends to keep the child br A remark by Mills inspires Somerset to research libraries for anyone checking out books based on the seven deadly sins leading the pair to John Doe s apartment Unexpectedly Doe returns home and is pursued by Mills Doe incapacitates Mills by striking him with a tire iron and holds him at gunpoint but chooses to leave him alive and flees The police investigate Doe s apartment finding a large amount of cash hundreds of Doe s notebooks and photographs of some of his victims the cache includes images of Somerset and Mills by a person they believed was an intrusive journalist at the sloth crime scene Doe calls the apartment and speaks of his admiration for Mills br On Saturday Somerset and Mills investigate the fourth victim lust a prostitute who has been raped with a custom made bladed strap on by a man held at gunpoint The following day the pride victim is found a model whom Doe facially disfigured Unable to live without her beauty she committed suicide As Somerset and Mills return to the police station Doe arrives covered in blood and surrenders himself He threatens to plead insanity at his trial potentially escaping punishment unless Mills and Somerset escort him to an undisclosed location where they will find the envy and wrath victims During the drive Doe says he believes God has chosen him to send a message about the ubiquity of and apathy toward sin Doe has no remorse for his victims believing the shocking murders will force society to pay attention to him br Doe leads the detectives to a remote location where a delivery van approaches Somerset intercepts the vehicle whose driver was instructed to deliver a package to Mills at this specific time and location Somerset is horrified at the package s contents and tells Mills to put down his gun Doe reveals he himself represents envy because he envied Mills s life with Tracy and implies the package contains her severed head He urges Mills to become wrath telling him Tracy begged for her life and that of her unborn child and takes pleasure in realizing Mills was unaware of the pregnancy Despite Somerset s pleas Mills distraught and enraged shoots Doe dead completing Doe s plan Police remove the catatonic Mills and Somerset tells his

Alfonso appears as a fingerprint technician and columnist George Christy portrays the police department janitor scraping Somerset s name from his door br br br Production br br br Writing br In aspiring screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker moved from the suburbs of Pennsylvania to New York City and described the culture shock of living in a city undergoing significant rises in crime and drug abuse While working as a sales assistant for Tower Records in Walker began writing a spec script called Seven which is set in an unnamed bleak and gloomy city that was inspired by his depressing time in New York Walker said it s true that if I hadn t lived there I probably wouldn t have written Seven Film studios were eager for high concept spec scripts simple and succinct ideas that could be easily sold to audiences Walker believed his thriller about police officers pursuing a serial killer driven by the seven deadly sins would attract attention and help begin a professional writing career br Walker intended to leave the script s narrative open to interpretation to avoid invalidating the opinions of the prospective audience He wanted to defy audience expectations and leave them feeling violated and exhausted by the conclusion According to Walker there s lots of evil out there and you re not always going to get the satisfaction of having any sort of understanding of why that is That s one of the things that scares people the most about serial killers To shape the character of the killer Walker drew inspiration from his own experiences navigating city streets where he witnessed crimes and sins unfolding openly on every corner This exploration led him to contemplate the idea of an individual who deliberately fixated on these sins He had Doe surrender himself to the police because it would rob the audience and characters of the anticipated satisfaction opting instead to leave them in discomfort leading up to the finale br In the early s Italian company Penta Film under manager Phyllis Carlyle optioned the script Walker received the minimum fee permitted by the Writers Guild of America which proved sufficient to quit his job relocate to Los Angeles and dedicate himself to working on Seven br br br Development br br To lead the project Penta Film hired director Jeremiah S Chechik known for his recent success directing the comedy film National Lampoon s Christmas Vacation and seeking a more serious project Chechik and Penta Film insisted on several script changes including the removal of the bleak conclusion in which Tracy s severed head is delivered in a box Facing the ultimatum of complying with these requests or risking replacement or project cancellation Walker acquiesced and wrote a more mainstream ending in which the detectives confront Doe in a church described as either on fire or burned out In this revised script Doe embodies the sin of envy and kills Mills before being shot dead by Somerset while a pregnant Tracy leaves the city In a interview Walker said he felt he was ruining his script and should have left the project To meet the studio s demands Walker wrote a total of thirteen drafts br As the script option was due to expire and Penta Film was experiencing financial difficulties leading to its dissolution in the studio sold the rights to producer Arnold Kopelson who subsequently took it to New Line Cinema Chechik left the project and Guillermo del Toro and Phil Joanou were approached to replace him Joanou rejected the offer because he found the story too bleak br David Fincher was known mainly for directing popular music videos such as Vogue and Who Is It His only feature film Alien had been a negative experience as the studio edited it against Fincher s intent leading to him disowning the project stating I d rather die of colon cancer than make another movie Despite this Fincher s agent presented him with the Seven script Initially uninterested in the police procedural elements Fincher found himself captivated by the gradual revelation of Doe s plans admitting I found myself getting more and more trapped in this kind of evil and even though I felt uncomfortable about being there I had to keep going Fincher recognized the script aligned with his own creative sensibilities especially its exploration of evil and uncompromising ending in which the protagonists do not engage in a last minute action sequence to save Tracy because she is already dead Fincher expressed his interest to the studio which realized he had been sent Walker s original script New Line Cinema sent Fincher an up to date draft in which Tracy survives but Fincher insisted on directing the original script In discussions with Michael De Luca New Line Cinema s president of production both shared a preference for the original script They mutually decided to begin filming that version within six weeks wary that any further delay might attract unwanted executive attention and potential interference with their plan br Kopelson and studio executives continued efforts to lighten Seven s tone and change the ending Fincher was resistant to any changes and was unwilling to compromise his creative control and vision De Luca remained supportive of Fincher and the original ending gained further backing as the project secured prominent actors including Freeman Pitt and Spacey Pitt joined Seven on condition the head in the box ending be retained as he was upset that the original ending of his previous film Legends of the Fall had been cut in response to negative test audience responses He also insisted that Mills kill Doe believing it was important that Mills act out of passion instead of morality Kopelson supported Fincher after being reassured the severed head would not be shown Walker said changing the dark tone of the ending would remove the core of the story br Walker further refined the script His changes included extending a chase sequence depicting Mills cautiously pursuing Doe aiming to avoid typical cinematic chases in which characters frantically pursue their target saying that were he in that situation he would be wary to turn any corner A shooting script was completed by August br br br Casting br br Pitt had established himself as an in demand and highly paid film star following successes with Interview with the Vampire and Legends of the Fall but Fincher had not considered him to portray Mills because he felt Pitt did not fit the image he had for the character However after meeting Pitt Fincher believed he was charismatic and likeable enough that he could keep the audience on Mills s side regardless of the character s actions To help secure Pitt s involvement Kopelson shortened the pre production schedule from twelve weeks to five to accommodate Pitt s schedule Pitt rejected several offers from other films because he wanted to escape his typecasting as a romantic lead character in favor of something with a more documentary feel with urban settings and a focus on dialogue akin to thriller films such as The Conversation Pitt described Mills as a well intentioned idiot who speaks before he really knows what he s talking about He cut his hair for the role and lost weight to reduce the muscle he developed for Legends of the Fall Sylvester Stallone and Denzel Washington rejected the role br Walker named the character Somerset after writer W Somerset Maugham He envisioned William Hurt playing the character but Fincher cast Freeman the studio was concerned pairing a black detective with a white one would make Seven seem derivative of the action film Lethal Weapon Robert Duvall Gene Hackman and Al Pacino rejected the role The script was further modified after Pitt s and Freeman s castings to better match their acting styles Mills was made more verbose and Somerset s dialogue was reduced and made more precise and direct Robin Wright auditioned for the role of Tracy and Christina Applegate rejected it before Paltrow was cast Pitt had recommended Paltrow after being impressed by her audition for Legends of the Fall Fincher preferred Paltrow but initial discussions suggested that if approached she would not be interested in a film with a dark tone like Seven Fincher auditioned about people before Pitt contacted Paltrow to meet with them Fincher said that Tracy was important because she provides the film s only tonally positive elements and he thought Paltrow s previous performances demonstrated she could effectively convey this in Tracy s limited screentime br Fincher and Walker wanted Ned Beatty to play John Doe because of his resemblance to the composite sketch of the Zodiac Killer Beatty declined describing the script as the most evil thing I ve ever read Michael Stipe lead vocalist of rock band R E M was considered but filming dates conflicted with the band s tour Val Kilmer declined the role R Lee Ermey auditioned but Fincher found his portrayal unsympathetic and lacking depth Kevin Spacey was preferred by Pitt but executives refused to pay his asking price Doe s scenes were initially filmed with an unknown actor portraying Doe the filmmakers quickly decided to replace them and Pitt helped negotiate Spacey s involvement Spacey who filmed his scenes in twelve days received a Friday night call asking him to join and was filming by the following Tuesday Spacey wanted his name omitted from the film s marketing and opening credits to ensure the killer s identity remained secret He said br br I d just done Swimming with Sharks The Usual Suspects and Outbreak both I knew that if any of those movies did well my profile would be different If I m the third billed actor in a movie where the top two billings are trying to find somebody and they don t find that somebody until the last reel then it s obvious who that somebody is I felt very strongly that it was the right thing to do for the movie We finally won because it was a deal breaker I was either going to be on a plane to shoot the movie or I wasn t br The lb kg actor Bob Mack made his film debut as gluttony who was described as a very heavy guy face down in spaghetti Gene Borkan was cast to play the greed victim because the filmmakers wanted someone who resembled lawyer Robert Shapiro He did not realize his character would already be dead and refused a request to perform nude On the set when he realized what his scene entailed Borkan renegotiated his salary receiving five times the Screen Actors Guild day scale fee Michael Reid MacKay s audition for the sloth victim involved him portraying a corpse that slowly turned his head towards the camera his performance was deemed creepy enough Set decorator Cat Mueller portrayed the lust victim after Fincher s assistant said she had the personality and body to portray a dead prostitute She received for six hours of filming over two days but described being nude in front of Pitt as a perk Model Heidi Schanz was cast as the pride victim after the previous actor dropped out Fincher who was running low on time wanted a model with existing headshots and pictures that could be displayed in the character s apartment The film s content made casting and crewing Seven difficult Gary Oldman turned down an unspecified role Fincher s former costume designer declined to work on the film and talent agents refused to pass offers on to their clients describing Seven as evil and misogynistic br br br Filming br br Principal photography began on December and concluded on March Walker was on set throughout filming to provide suggestions or on spec rewrites but did not give Fincher much input believing he should adapt the script as he wanted Michael Alan Kahn served as assistant director br Location filming took place entirely in downtown Los Angeles Fincher wanted to film in Oakland California because of its aesthetically pleasing clapboard houses but the schedule would not allow for this Rain often fell during filming Fincher decided to film in rain to avoid continuity errors and because Pitt was only available for fifty five days before he began filming Monkeys Fincher also said the rain introduced an inescapable element for the characters because conditions were bad inside and outside and that the rain made the film s city appear less like Los Angeles which is associated with sunny weather br Seven s aesthetic was influenced by films such as All That Jazz The Silence of the Lambs and The French Connection as well as the over the shoulder viewpoint used in documentary television show Cops because of its implicit vulnerability Cinematographer Darius Khondji named the crime thriller Klute as a significant influence because of its use of toplight widescreen compositions for intimacy rather than big vistas the way that vertical strips of the city are shown in horizontal mode the fragments of faces and bodies the look of Se en has this heightened sense of realism a realism that s been kicked up several notches and becomes its own style Fincher chose one scene in Klute in which the only illumination is the character s flashlight saying he disliked other films in which characters state visibility is low but the audience can clearly see the scene Khondji used a mixture of lighting using the warm light of Chinese lanterns to represent the past and present and the cold light of Kino Flos to represent the future br The studio was unhappy with the darkness of the dailies Khondji suggested printing the footage brighter but Fincher refused to compromise Available footage was made into a well received promotional showreel for the theater owner convention ShoWest after which complaints about the darkness ceased Khondji used Panavision Primo lenses which offered a sharp image with good contrast and Kodak film stocks that could capture the gritty interiors and deep blacks for night time exteriors br Khondji described the scene in which Mills pursues Doe as one of the most difficult scenes to film due to its length fast camera movements in rain and tight barely lit interior spaces One segment had to be re filmed because the location was too dark for the camera to capture Freeman s face Pitt insisted on performing his own stunts for the scene he slipped on a rain slicked car bonnet crashing through the windshield and sustaining injuries including cut tendons and nerves in his left hand Fincher said he saw exposed bone Pitt returned to the set a few days later having received stitches and a forearm cast which had to be written into later scenes For scenes set prior to the chase Pitt would keep his hand in his pocket or otherwise obscured to hide the injury br The crew had to clear used condoms and crack pipes from the location of the sloth victim sequence replacing them with prop crack pipes and air fresheners The actors were not told the sloth victim was a person in costume McGinley s shock at the body s movement is real Lights with green color gels were shone through the window from the adjacent building to impart the scene with a green tint The ending was scripted to take place directly beneath transmission towers a location Doe selects to interfere with the police communications the towers however interfered with the film crew s radios and the actors had to use cell phones to communicate with the crew from afar br br br Ending and post production br The film s ending remained a point of contention between New Line Cinema and the filmmakers Fincher intending to stun the audience wanted to follow Mills s shooting of Doe with a sudden cut to black but executives believed this would alienate audiences Fincher instructed staff at a test screening to keep off the lights following the cut to black so the audience could take it in but his instructions were not followed After the screening one female audience member walking by Fincher said the people who made that movie should be killed According to Fincher the screening invitation only told audiences that the film would feature Pitt and Freeman both of whom were known for films very different in tone to Seven Executives wanted a mainstream conclusion in which Mills and Somerset pursue Doe and a kidnapped Tracy who would survive According to Pitt the studio wanted a more heroic ending for Mills in which he did not kill Doe and instead of Tracy s head being in the box for it to be the head of one of Mills s dogs Freeman preferred a storyboarded sequence of Somerset killing Doe sparing Mills from losing his career as well but Pitt believed Mills had to kill Doe and test audiences preferred that version Another alternative ending depicted Mills shooting Somerset to stop him killing Doe first Fincher and Pitt both refused to compromise with the studio s request to replace the head in the box ending but settled for a longer epilogue showing Mills being arrested and Somerset delivering a concluding narration offering some humanity br Pitt and Fincher were unhappy with the car ride scene leading into the ending because the dialogue had to be overdubbed after too much ambient sound had been picked up during filming Pitt believed this caused the scene to lose its momentum affecting the pacing and emotion The helicopter scenes were also filmed in post production because there was no time during principal photography the studio agreed the provision of extra time and funding for additional scenes if they were deemed necessary Because these scenes were filmed several months later than the rest of the film the green ground had turned brown and the ground based scenes had to be color corrected to match the new footage The opening credits were scripted to be set over footage of Somerset visiting a countryside home he intended to purchase for his retirement taking a piece of the wallpaper which he would carry through the film before returning to the city by train This was intended to create a stark contrast between the countryside and the darkness of the city but there was insufficient budget to film it As a result scenes of Somerset looking at the wallpaper piece had to be cut br Richard Francis Bruce edited the minute theatrical cut His style focused on having a motivated cut in which every cut had a specific purpose For the finale he introduced more rapid cuts to emphasize the tension as Doe s plan is revealed and a brief four frame insert of Tracy as Mills pulls the trigger to compensate for not showing the contents of the box To emphasize the darkness Fincher and Khondji used an expensive lengthy bleach bypass chemical process that retained some of the silver that would normally be removed from the film stock The silver created a luminous effect in light tones and deeper darker colors Of the prints sent to theaters only a few hundred used the process br Seven was budgeted at million but Fincher persuaded studio executives to provide further funding to achieve his vision for the film eventually pushing it million over budget to million making it New Line Cinema s most expensive film at that point A studio employee said executives would meet with Fincher adamant he would receive no further funding but his relentless and persuasive attitude would change their mind br br br Music and sound br br Fincher hired Howard Shore to score Seven based on his score for The Silence of the Lambs Shore said Fincher would attend recording sessions but rarely interfered with Shore s process The score which was performed by an orchestra of up to musicians combines elements of brass including trumpets percussion piano Portrait of John Doe serves as the central theme with two cue notes a rising version is used for Tracy s appearances Shore described the film s ending as having a visceral effect on him he incorporated his reaction into the sequence s score providing little accompaniment during the dialogue between Mills Somerset and Doe but using it to punctuate significant moments such as Somerset opening the box br Shore s opening theme The Last Seven Days a more upbeat piece was replaced with Nine Inch Nails s song Closer which was remixed by Coil and Danny Hyde David Bowie s song The Hearts Filthy Lesson is used for the end credits Seven features songs including In the Beginning by the Statler Brothers Guilty by Gravity Kills Trouble Man by Marvin Gaye Speaking of Happiness by Gloria Lynne Suite No in D Major BWV Air by Stuttgarter Kammerorchester and Karl M nchinger Love Plus One by Haircut One Hundred I Cover the Waterfront by Billie Holiday Now s the Time by Charlie Parker and Straight No Chaser by Thelonious Monk br Sound engineer Ren Klyce and Fincher inserted frequent diegetic background sounds such as rain or screaming to create a psychological impression that terrifying things are occurring off screen even when the audience cannot see or escape it Klyce and sound designer Steve Boedekker also produced the music that is heard at the entrance to the sex club where the lust victim is murdered br br br Design br br br Style and set design br Production designer Arthur Max costume designer Michael Kaplan Fincher and Khondji collaborated on establishing a unified vision for the art direction These guidelines established that the designs should represent a world where everything is corrupted dysfunctional and in a state of decay Fincher was influenced by the photography of William Eggleston and Robert Frank who focused on coolness making the visuals simultaneously gritty stylized classic and contemporary Khondji said Frank s style could be seen in Seven s very bright exteriors and dark interiors a visual contrast achieved by underexposing the film negative The final scene with Mills Somerset and Doe had inconsistent lighting because the actors were always lit from behind by the sun regardless of their placement in the scene br Fincher wanted precise staging for every scene to make the audience feel as if they were in the location Believing it was important to create limitations to challenge himself Fincher had sets built without removable walls and the crew had to film within their confines Doe s murder scenes were influenced by photography such as the work of Joel Peter Witkin The sloth scene in particular was influenced by the work of painter Edvard Munch drawing on the green and claustrophobic imagery br br br Victims br Rob Bottin led development of practical effects He researched crime scene photographs and police evidence files observed an autopsy and studied the effects of obesity to realize his designs For the gluttony victim Mack spent up to hours a day having makeup and prosthetics applied Mack said he was unaware he would be surrounded by live insects until reading the daily call sheet and noticing a cockroach wrangler A fiberglass replica of Mack was used for the character s autopsy br Bottin s team spent days experimenting on the aesthetic and prosthetics for the sloth victim MacKay was ft cm tall and weighed to lb about kg during filming offering a slight frame for the emaciated character The filmmakers asked him to lose more weight but he refused The effects team made a body cast of MacKay to develop rubber prosthetics that could be applied all over his body These prosthetics were painted to appear bruised and scarred MacKay s skin painted a pale white with highlighted veins and he was fitted with gelatin sores overgrown fingernails skeletal teeth and matted hair The process took up to hours requiring MacKay to begin at am to be ready for filming by pm He had to remain fairly still during four hours of filming having to limit his breathing to prevent his stomach rising and falling and the cold on set was worsened by makeup artists repeatedly spraying his body with water Unable to move he tensed his muscles to warm himself He described the relief that came when he was permitted to cough in McGinley s inspecting face because he could move and breathe again br For Schanz s pride victim Fincher added blood to her while her nose was taped to the side and her face was covered in gauze The Motion Picture Association of America MPAA mandated cuts to some scenes of Bottin s effects work to secure a film rating Fincher described Seven as psychologically violent implying violence without overtly showing it In the opening scene Walker portrays a corpse lying in a pool of blood he said the blood was very cold and he had a minor panic attack once in place because he was worried about moving and ruining the shot br br br Title credits br Following the removal of the planned opening train ride scene with Somerset Fincher needed a temporary title sequence to screen Seven for studio executives He recruited R GA designer Kyle Cooper and his team to assemble a montage reflecting Doe s perspective This helped to establish the character and the threat he poses prior to his appearance in the film s final act The sequence was set to the Closer remix at Fincher s request br The sequence was well received by executives who suggested retaining it for the theatrical release Fincher did not want to appear to be accepting their suggestion and instructed Cooper to develop a new concept Cooper persuaded Fincher to use a more elaborate and detailed version of the montage Cooper focused on Doe s elaborate journals briefly glimpsed in the film while Fincher suggested the sequence should depict Doe Fincher wanted Mark Romanek to direct the sequence being a fan of his music video for Closer and sharing similar design sensibilities but Cooper secured the role because of his previous experience on similar title sequences Fincher told Cooper all I want is for the audience to want to run screaming from the theater during the title section br The title sequence depicts Doe s preparations and routines for his murderous plans such as cutting off his fingertips processing photographs in his bathtub and making tea This was inspired by Cooper s appreciation for the elegant way Doe stirs his tea following his surrender The sequence focuses on Doe writing his journal and crossing out words such as pregnancy marriage and other elements representing a perfect life which he does not believe people deserve Fincher said it was a way of introducing the evil The idea was that you re watching title sequences from the mind of somebody who s lost it the audience won t understand while they re watching it but they ll get it later Clive Piercy and John Sabel made Doe s journals which cost tens of thousands of dollars each to fill with text and images about six complete journals were made supplemented by blank ones on shelves Artist Wayne Coe storyboarded the sequence which Harris Savides filmed and Angus Wall edited Cooper regularly conferred with Wall on ideas and spent the night before filming locating items such as fish hooks and loose hairs from his drain which he believed would make interesting inclusions br Filming took place over eight days including two days filming a hand model stand in for Doe Fincher was upset at the casting because the model s hands were shorter and chunkier than Spacey s A further five weeks were spent assembling the sequence Although digital options were available Cooper s team chose to assemble the sequence by hand believing any irregularities and accidents in the images would enhance the overall aesthetic and manually added scratches tears and pen marks directly to the film negative Fincher and Cooper devised a rough looking text for the credits to appear as if written by a disturbed hand The text was etched onto a black surfaced scratchboard and visually manipulated while being transferred to film to add a smear effect combined with variants of the same text achieved by placing the text over a light box and filming them over exposed creating an animation style effect Disquieting sounds were added throughout the sequence at a low frequency such as barking dogs and screams The title sequence cost br br br Release br br br Marketing br New Line Cinema had low expectations for Seven based on middling scores from test audiences The studio s marketing president Chris Pula called the advertising campaign for Seven risky because it had to prepare people for the film s dark violent content while making it a topic of discussion among potential audiences Early trailers and newspaper television and radio advertisements focused on the seven sins presenting Seven as an edgy prestige film rather than a jumpscare style horror Entertainment professionals believed violent or horrific films had a limited appeal and rarely received positive reviews Fincher s public image had also been tarnished by the failure of Alien and although Freeman and Pitt were proven stars who were capable of attracting audiences New Line Cinema struggled to capitalize on Pitt s popularity Pitt s core audience teenage girls were not the film s target audience and research showed young men would avoid taking a romantic partner to films featuring Pitt because they felt threatened by his appeal The positive word of mouth following Seven s release resulted in the marketing campaign shifting focus toward targeting Pitt s female fans br The premiere of Seven took place on September at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills California The event was attended by over guests including Fincher Freeman McGinley Spacey Tia Carrere Elliott Gould Matthew Modine Lori Petty Lou Diamond Phillips Michael Rapaport Eric Roberts Robert Rodriguez Steven Seagal John Singleton Christian Slater Quentin Tarantino and Jennifer Tilly br br br Box office br br Seven received a wide release in the United States and Canada on September During its opening weekend Seven grossed million across theaters an average of per theater making it the number one film of the weekend ahead of the debut of Showgirls million and To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything Julie Newmar million in its third week of release Seven had the highest grossing September opening weekend of its time replacing s Freddy s Dead The Final Nightmare million The successful opening was credited to Pitt s broad popularity a lack of competing action films and the marketing campaign overcoming audience skepticism around the premise Audiences polled by market research firm CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on a scale of A to F New Line Cinema distribution executive Mitch Goldman had moved forward the release date of Seven to avoid competition and strategically opened the film in more theaters than usual to target suburban and small town locations where Pitt s recent films had fared well br Seven remained number one in its second weekend ahead of the debuts of Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers million and Devil in a Blue Dress million and in its third weekend ahead of the debuting Assassins million and Dead Presidents million Seven remained the most popular film until its fifth weekend falling to number behind the debuts of Get Shorty million and Now and Then million and was among the ten highest grossing films for nine weeks Seven had grossed about million by the end of December when it received a wide re release in select locations to raise its profile during the nomination period for the Academy Awards The re release helped raise Seven s box office revenue to about million making it the ninth highest grossing film of ahead of Die Hard With a Vengeance million and behind Casper million According to estimates by industry experts as of the box office returns to the studio minus the theaters share was million br Seven also performed well in areas outside the U S and Canada receiving positive audience reactions and successful debuts in Australia million South Korea Seoul New Zealand and the Netherlands The film grossed a further million from these markets br In total Seven grossed an estimated worldwide total of million This made it the seventh highest grossing film of the year Seven was an unexpected hit becoming one of the most successful and profitable films of Literary critic John Kenneth Muir said that many horror films released in had failed at the box office despite their association with prominent genre directors like Wes Craven and John Carpenter Muir credited Seven s breakout success to its hybridization of horror police procedural and urban noir aesthetic as well as describing instead of showing much of the violent imagery leaving it to the audience s imaginations br br br Reception br br br Critical response br br Seven received generally positive reviews Critics such as Roger Ebert and Desson Howe described Seven as an intelligent well made film that could comfortably stand alongside other thrillers Others compared Seven unfavorably with The Silence of the Lambs and The Usual Suspects saying Seven lacks the other films intelligent narrative and takes itself too seriously as an examination of evil instead of a silly piece of pulp The Orlando Sentinel said however Seven offers a terrific film noir atmosphere and excellent performances with The Seattle Times saying the film would be unendurable without Freeman and Spacey br James Berardinelli and Janet Maslin among others praised Freeman s performance Terrence Rafferty and Kenneth Turan wrote Freeman s exceptional performance is mainly responsible for making Seven watchable in spite of itself Howe and Berardinelli said the performance elevated Pitt s own to appear actorly although Freeman often steals every scene in which he appears providing a fresh take on an otherwise clich role Reviews of Pitt s performance were polarized between those who found it energetic and impressive and those who believed the role was beyond his acting abilities Some reviewers said Pitt s performance continued his successful transition to more serious roles from those based mainly on his appearance although Howe said Pitt s presence does more for Seven than his acting The Orlando Sentinel said what could have been a clich role was saved by Mills not being inept or inexperienced just out of his depth in this case Jami Bernard and Turan described the character as underdeveloped pointless stupid and not particularly likeable remarking that Pitt s performance lacks the subtlety or effectiveness to compensate Several critics positively received Paltrow s performance saying she made the most of her limited screentime and was generally underused while considering the character a flimsy contrivance Spacey s performance was also praised for its creepy understated portrayal of an intelligent character who does not undermine himself with a moment of sheer stupidity br Fincher s directorial style was commended for its striking craftmanship and stunning visuals that often simultaneously thrill and exasperate the viewer In contrast Rafferty said his style is less effective when stretched over the film s runtime and that Fincher mistook darkness for profundity and chose style over coherence Although Gene Siskel considered Walker s script to be smartly written several critics were less enthusiastic finding the dialogue trite many scenes implausible and character motivations weak Bernard and Richard Schickel wrote Seven lacks many of the essentials prevalent in its genre such as suspense witty dialogue and cathartic humor and the psychological depth to match the intellectual thrills of The Silence of the Lambs br The violent content of Seven was generally negatively received Critics such as Berardinelli and Siskel found the gore excessive and gratuitous While some found the violent visuals to be tiresome and detracting others said Fincher skilfully avoided showing the violence that led to the deaths preventing them from distracting from Seven s more enjoyable aspects According to Ebert and Turan however Seven would be too disturbing for many viewers Fincher responded I didn t set out to piss off the people who are upset I was told that Michael Medved film critic at New York Post wrote that the movie was evil but I m sure he slows down when he passes an accident just like everyone else Death fascinates people but they don t deal with it Howe and Owen Gleiberman said the ending is like an act of treachery against the viewer undermining any hope for a positive outcome and Barry Norman said it denies the audience even of the final comfort they fully deserve Ebert however found the ending satisfying but underwhelming compared to the film s earlier events br br br Accolades br Seven received one

obvious by the higher resolution br br br Other media br A novelization of Seven that was written by Anthony Bruno was released alongside the film in November A seven issue comic book series was released between September and October by Zenescope Entertainment serving as a prequel to the film s events of the film the comic book focuses on Doe and the planning of his crimes br br br Thematic analysis br br br Apathy and hope br The apathy of the film s unnamed city s inhabitants is a central theme in Seven Somerset does not believe the city can be saved intending to retire beyond its confines and tells Mills that women are taught to yell fire rather than help because people are more likely to pay attention if they selfishly think themselves in danger Film scholar Amy Taubin described the city as an infection point for corruption in which signs of violence and decay are omnipresent in its dark corners rain television reports fights screams and children in impoverished apartments Richard Dyer draws parallels between the perpetual rain in Seven and films like Blade Runner emphasizing its relentless and pervasive nature In Seven the incessant rain symbolizes sin permeating every conceivable crevice The city s bleak aesthetic implies a moral decay and indifference by its inhabitants that enables Doe s plan which can be considered akin to the sloth sin br The city reflects a common trend in Hollywood cinema during the s and s portraying iconic American urban settings like New York City as nightmarish realms of criminality and moral chaos as seen in films such as Escape From New York Batman Darkman and The Crow Macek said such films articulate a pronounced anti urbanism surpassing the mere recycling of cultural imagery Despite their lack of realism these movies tap into the fantastical realm of horror and entertainment allowing them to express repressed fears and anxieties within viewers everyday lives Seven s city is presented as a blighted decaying zone of unfettered criminality and vice echoing a reactionary view of urban problems concerning segments of the contemporary American middle class According to Macek Seven validates suburban fears of inner city communities and the urban poor as unruly and beyond redemption Professor Kirsten Thompson characterizes the city as devoid of temporal or spatial markers with an absence of recognizable elements like street signs costumes or specific vehicles that could provide clues to its identity This intentional lack of distinct features creates an unsettling impression that the city exists in a perpetual state of ambiguity simultaneously everywhere and nowhere The narrative thus reinforces the notion that the city is trapped in a temporal loop condemned to endlessly repeat cycles of sin and corruption without the prospect of liberation or escape br Somerset has not stopped caring but has become resigned to the apathy of those around him and the futility of his efforts Seven underscores this in several scenes such as the dismissal of his concerns regarding a child witnessing a murder the police captain s indifference to a mugger stabbing his victim s eyes and the sex club manager who dislikes his role but sees no alternative Critic Matt Goldberg describes Mills and Tracy as na ve to the city s corruption for example they are tricked into renting an apartment that experiences constant shaking from nearby trains Thompson observes that Tracy unlike Mills possesses a more discerning perspective having already concluded that the city holds no promising future for her family and expresses her desire to return to their home outside its borders Somerset supports her hoping to spare Tracy and her unborn child from the influences of the city br Both Somerset and Doe perceive the ubiquity of sin and indifference toward it There are parallels between the characters both of whom live alone are devoted to their work and have no meaningful relationships Although there is mention of some acquaintances Somerset tells Tracy that those who spend time with him find him disagreeable Somerset and Doe differ in their response to sin Somerset has surrendered to apathy and despair whereas Doe feels contempt for society and has assumed the role of its punisher It is implied Somerset was passionate about his work until he realized the futility of effecting change while Doe remains dedicated and fervent believing in the transformative impact of his actions Somerset who has never taken a life retains a glimmer of hope for humanity s redemption while Doe in contrast freely commits murder convinced of humanity s irredeemable nature When confronted by Mills about the innocence of his victims Doe retorts that sin pervades the city to such an extent that innocence becomes trivial and tolerated br Walker described Mills as the optimist and Somerset as the pessimist The ending proves Mills optimism was misplaced but given the option to walk away from the problem as intended or stay Somerset remains Doe s plan works shocking Somerset out of his apathy and inspiring him to defer his retirement and fight for a better future Rosenbaum described it as an enduring belief in the ability of goodness to prevail once again tempered by the fact the hope is inspired by a self martyred serial killer He said Seven chose style over substance giving the overall message that nothing will really change br Writers Deborah Wills and Andrew Wilson concluded that despite the seemingly hopeless worlds depicted Seven challenges viewers to confront their complicity in everyday events and act differently and reconsider their outlook and approach to a world they deem worthy of redemption Released during a period of heightened anxiety leading up to the Millennium Seven tapped into prevalent fears and marked the two thousandth anniversary of Jesus Christ s birth intensifying apocalyptic speculations In the decade surrounding this transition many films addressed concerns about time running out reflecting a broader sense of societal decay Seven embodies this millennial sensibility portraying a world devoid of hope for a better future where individual detachment appears as the only distant prospect amid the prevailing chaos br br br Religion and order br Somerset characterizes Doe s murders as his sermons to the masses According to Dyer and author Matthew Saunders Doe conducts a violent crusade illustrating the consequences of moral decay and sin based on his interpretation of Christian ideology in a city similar to the biblical Sodom and Gomorrah Writer Patricia Moir suggests that theorists in the late s believed societal norms in North America were diminishing due to the decay of social meta narratives of order created by religion science and art and that in absence of these paradigms all that remains is the chaos of existence Somerset tries to create order using the ticking of a metronome to disguise the disordered noise of sirens and screams outside his apartment Dyer wrote that Somerset s smashing of the metronome signifies his acknowledgment of the city s darkness Doe creates order by filtering literature about the seven deadly sins and works by authors such as John Milton through a lens of religious fanaticism He believes his purpose is God given which is reflected in the opening credits depicting Doe cutting the word God from a dollar bill br Doe rationalizes that everyone is guilty of sin or wishing ill on other sinners including himself hence his plan involves his own death Goldberg suggests that Doe is the true sin of wrath evidenced by his violent acts His resigned acceptance of the envy sin after assigning wrath to Mills is according to Goldberg because there is no other sin for him to take and he is conscious sin will not end with his death Doe s transfer of wrath to Mills demonstrates the infectiousness and pervasiveness of sin Mills s killing of Doe can be considered an act of justice eliminating a remorseless force of evil although his motivation is purely for revenge br Professor Philippa Gates suggests that the greatest fear Doe represents is the possibility he is right as his challenging of sinners is informed by Roman Catholic doctrine Mills is ostensibly the hero and Doe the villain but from Doe s perspective his victims were not innocent drawing justification from biblical precedent The idea that Doe s crimes could be defended as a means of redeeming the city creates a paradox where Mills responsible for two deaths is portrayed as a hero while Doe a murderer is considered evil br br br Art and literature br According to Professor Thomas Fahy art literature music and high culture play pivotal roles in both Doe s mission and Somerset s investigation in Seven Doe strategically conceals a crucial clue to his plot at the greed murder scene by turning a piece of art upside down a detail discernible only by someone versed in art and reflecting the city s own upturned status Somerset engages in scholarly work at the library accompanied by Johann Sebastian Bach s Air as a thematic backdrop to the intellectual atmosphere of the setting Seven underscores the significance of knowledge and culture in comprehending Doe as Somerset delves into works such as The Parson s Tale by Geoffrey Chaucer and Dante Alighieri s Divine Comedy Despite its importance Somerset s intellectual and philosophical inclinations isolates him with fellow officers resenting his propensity for posing what they deem unnecessary questions In contrast Doe employs art for brutal purposes crafting murder set pieces that undermine Somerset s sense of security Mills however differs from both men demonstrating a less comprehensive education and rudimentary understanding of these more cultured themes which proves a disadvantage against the intellectual and well read Doe Writer Paul Gormley posited that Seven challenges racial stereotypes by affording Somerset a leading role with privileged knowledge juxtaposing him with the naive white protagonist Mills br Journalist Kim Newman describes Doe s murders as art installations intended for observation reminiscent of philosopher Michel Foucault s concept of spectacular punishment The victims are staged like models challenging the audience to perceive the murders as repulsive and compelling using art to express violence and highlighting the cultural divide between the educated and uneducated Doe s portrayal as an aesthete killer draws comparisons with characters like fictional killers such as Hannibal Lecter yet Doe does not define himself by high culture surrounding himself with his own art Some like Professor Jeremy Tambling find allegorical links between sins and murders to be forced questioning Doe s embodiment of envy and representing lust through the victimized prostitute br Seven also uses color to symbolize sins Writer Shaina Weatherhead said Seven foreshadows the importance of wrath represented by the color red and envy the color green throughout such as Somerset s red lamp and Mills s green mug Seven makes other references to art such as a stack of spaghetti cans resembling Campbell s Soup Cans by Andy Warhol br Seven includes subtle references to the number seven reinforcing the religious subtext Doe s plan culminates on a Sunday the seventh day of the week and the biblical day of rest on which Doe s package for Mills is delivered at pm Somerset s research references texts such as The Parson s Tale which discusses penance and a reference to seven children being slain Of particular focus is the Divine Comedy which depicts seven terraces of purgatory each relating to an individual sin and the nine circles of hell Professor Steve Macek interprets the unnamed city as an allegory for the hell in the Divine Comedy Author Valerie Allen further explores the Dantean parallels comparing Mills to the passionate and emotional Dante who is guided through hell by the wise and rational Somerset Virgil While Somerset like Virgil is somewhat saved by Seven s denouement Mills is denied the redemptive themes of Dante ending the film in despair Allen describes the moral landscape of the Divine Comedy as holding human actions accountable to reason emphasizing justice and mercy as a cosmic principle and distinguishing between the punishment of hell and penitence in Purgatorio While these humans can potentially purge themselves through virtuous acts Doe s punitive approach exacerbates the city s problems rather than bringing balance br br br Culture of celebrity br Moir and Professor James Oleson comment on the excesses of performance art and the culture of celebrity with Mills disdainfully labeling Doe as a movie of the week and a fucking T Shirt implying that Doe s legacy will be short lived eventually fading into obscurity While Moir proposes that the film leaves Doe s legacy open ended hinting at the potential for further deterioration Oleson argues that Doe s impact in the real world cannot be ignored asserting that discussing and studying Doe inadvertently validates his vision Oleson explores the societal phenomenon of glorifying serial killers citing notorious figures like Jack the Ripper Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer who attained widespread recognition as well as individuals who are sexually attracted to perpetrators of heinous crimes The cultural fascination extends to fictional serial killers like Doe Hannibal Lecter Dexter Morgan and John Kramer who are depicted as intelligent resourceful and endowed with unique motivations and methods br Dyer draws a parallel between Doe and Lecter highlighting their ability to outsmart and manipulate authorities while employing artistic methods in their murders However Dyer distinguishes their disparate social statuses Lecter an educated professional with refined tastes contrasts with Doe who appears self taught unemployed and fixated on his mission In contrast Rosenbaum contends that Seven avoids glorifying Doe through comedic moments or heroic portrayals Author Adam Nayman presents a critical view of Seven suggesting that the film elevates Doe as a figure with valid societal critiques br br br Characters br Writers Terri Murray and Lewis Rose highlight a thematic parallel between Somerset and Doe emphasizing their meticulous fastidious and patient natures contrasting with the brash and impulsive Mills who portrays himself as a crime fighting hero Critic Jonathan Rosenbaum observes that Mills and Somerset stand in stark contrast in terms of temperament morality intelligence and personal connections Somerset is analytical wise and experienced while Mills is young messy and inexperienced but full of potential Mills characterized by his optimism and relatively light hearted nature moves to the city with the belief that he can have a positive influence Tracy according to Dyer symbolizes potential virtue but her impact is reduced because her appearances are infrequent to conceal her eventual fate br Dr Denis Flannery identifies a homoerotic subtext among male characters particularly drawing parallels between David Mills and John Doe and the homoerotic undertones of David and Jonathan from the Hebrew Bible in which Jonathan also dies before David Additional allusions include Somerset being named after a gay author Tracy questioning Somerset s bachelor status and Mills intentionally positioning Somerset at the opposite side of a table to avoid assumptions about their relationship Flannery suggests a potential feminizing or transgendered implication for Doe given that Doe is also a term for a female deer and implications of romantic interest in Mills According to Flannery Spacey s portrayal includes stereotypical homosexual inflections and Doe s failed attempt at assuming a traditional husband role with Tracy hints at his sexual complexities or inadequacies br Allen acknowledges the difficulty in ascribing psychological truth to Doe Spacey sees Doe as a truly evil and psychologically unfathomable individual Author Shona Hill notes Somerset s rejection of the idea that Doe s actions are incomprehensible asserting that Doe is not the Devil but merely a man A key distinction lies in framing John Doe s actions within a biblical context giving them clear logic and purpose During the final scene s car ride Somerset detects a baser motive in Doe suggesting he takes pleasure in killing people Mills dismissive of Doe as a mentally unstable common criminal aligns with criminologist Cesare Lombroso s beliefs emphasizing psychological defects as the cause of criminal behavior Oleson argues that Doe is the true architect of their narrative universe dictating events while Mills and Somerset merely participate Doe s notebooks offer insight into his misanthropic worldview revealing disdain for the city and extreme reactions to mundane urban interactions Tambling interprets the name John Doe as an allegorical placeholder for Everyman obscuring any true identity Author David Deamer posits that Doe s true identity is inconsequential compared to his purpose br br br Legacy br br br Modern reception br In the years since its release Seven has grown in esteem receiving general critical praise and being described by the British Film Institute BFI as a groundbreaking thriller In a interview Walker said that he remained proud of Seven despite criticisms from some audiences In the BFI s retrospective on Seven identified it as a landmark serial killer film In the s MovieWeb and Stuff called Seven one of the most memorable and quintessential crime thrillers of the s representing a high point of the genre and filmmaking for the decade Assessments by NME and Collider wrote that Seven had an enduring appeal distinct from its contemporaries This distinction is attributed to its bleak and seldom matched ending as well as its stylized reality devoid of popular culture references or technological emphasis ensuring it does not reflect any particular time or place Richard Dyer featured Seven in the British Film Institute s Film Classics series in Seven was also highlighted by critic Roger Ebert in his series The Great Movies in and it is included in the film reference book Movies You Must See Before You Die br A poll of entertainment industry professionals

br Seven is considered influential on filmmaking Subsequent genre films and television shows have replicated Seven s grim aesthetic body horror imagery and the premise of disenchanted detectives pursuing criminals with distinctive killing methods and motivations Its influence can be seen in films such as The Bone Collector Along Came a Spider and the Saw series It also served as an inspiration for the superhero film The Batman Collider credited Seven with a contemporary resurgence in Christianity themed supernatural and apocalyptic mystery films Seven s use of non mainstream music by Nine Inch Nails is also seen as contributing to increased use of similar songs in films such as Final Destination and Resident Evil br The New York Times called the title credit sequence for Seven one of the most important design innovations of the s In Art of the Title described it as the beginning of a renaissance in title design particularly in the horror genre and its influence is evident many years after Seven s release In IFC ranked the sequence as the third best ever behind those of Vertigo and A Hard Day s Night and its style can be seen in the opening credits of films such as Red Dragon and Taking Lives br Seven revitalized Fincher s film career establishing him among the most iconoclastic Hollywood directors of his generation Over the next few years he directed The Game Fight Club and Panic Room and collaborated on several other projects with Walker and Shore Seven also helped Pitt s transition into more serious and dramatic acting roles including starring in Fincher s Fight Club Pitt and Paltrow also developed a romantic relationship while filming Seven Freeman s performance established him as a mentor type figure archetype which he would reprise in many later projects In a interview MacKay said Seven was still popular enough to be earning him healthy residual payments br The film s ending has been described as one of the most shocking and unforgettable twists in cinematic history Pitt s line What s in the box as he asks Somerset to confirm the contents of Doe s box has become iconic and is used in popular culture and internet memes Walker credited the twist as one of the primary reasons for Seven s success Although it is only implied that Tracy s head is in the box Fincher recalled an encounter with a woman who believed she had seen the contents of the box Fincher believed that leaving the implication to the audience s imagination had been more effective than showing a special effect Paltrow wore a replica box over her head as her Halloween costume in br br br Sequel br br In New Line Cinema proposed a sequel named Ei ht that would be based on a repurposed spec script titled Solace by Ted Griffin about a psychic serial killer who is pursued by a similarly psychic detective Somerset The idea was abandoned after principal Seven cast and crew including Freeman and Pitt expressed no intention to return for a sequel Fincher said I would be less interested in that than I would in having cigarettes put out in my eyes The script was made into the standalone thriller named Solace which was a critical and commercial
