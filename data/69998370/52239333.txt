help from May until Peter retrieves him While discussing their battles with Spider Man Osborn Octavius and Dillon realize they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths Strange

on making a new Spider Man suit and resuming his vigilantism in New York City br br br Cast br br Tom Holland as Peter Parker Spider Man A teenager and Avenger who received spider like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider The film explores the fallout of Spider Man Far From Home s mid credits scene in which Parker s identity as Spider Man is exposed and Parker is more pessimistic in contrast to previous Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU films Holland said Parker feels defeated and insecure and was excited to explore the darker side of the character The adjustment back to portraying Parker including raising his voice pitch and returning to the mindset of a na ve charming teenager was strange for Holland after taking on more mature roles such as in Cherry br Zendaya as Michelle MJ Jones Watson Parker s classmate and girlfriend The character s full name is revealed in the film having previously just been known as Michelle Jones bringing her closer to the comics counterpart Mary Jane Watson br Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Stephen Strange A neurosurgeon who became a Master of the Mystic Arts following a career ending car accident Holland felt Strange was not a mentor to Parker unlike Robert Downey Jr s Tony Stark in Spider Man Homecoming but instead saw them as colleagues and noted their relationship breaks down throughout the course of the film Cumberbatch felt there was a close relationship between Strange and Parker because both are neighborhood superheroes with a shared history Co writer Chris McKenna described Strange as the voice of reason in the film br Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds Parker s best friend Batalon lost pounds kg for his role in this film br Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan The head of security for Stark Industries and former driver and bodyguard of Tony Stark who looks after Parker br Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon Electro An Oscorp electrical engineer from an alternate reality who gained electric powers after an accident involving genetically modified electric eels Foxx reprises his role from Marc Webb s The Amazing Spider Man The character was redesigned for No Way Home forgoing his original blue Ultimate Marvel based design in favor of a yellow one more similar to his mainstream comic book appearance br Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn Green Goblin A scientist and the CEO of Oscorp from an alternate reality who tested an unstable strength enhancer on himself He developed an insane split personality as a result and uses advanced Oscorp armor and equipment Dafoe reprises his role from Sam Raimi s Spider Man trilogy Dafoe felt Green Goblin had advanced from his portrayal in Spider Man and had a few more tricks up his sleeves in this film Dafoe was digitally de aged for the role and the character also obtains upgrades to his costume to make him more closely resemble his comic book counterpart br Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius Doctor Octopus A scientist from an alternate reality with four artificially intelligent mechanical tentacles fused to his body after an accident Molina reprises his role from Raimi s Spider Man with this film continuing from the character s story prior to his death in that film Molina was surprised by this approach because he had aged in the years since he made that film digital de aging was also used to make him look physically the same as in Spider Man The mechanical tentacles were created completely through CGI rather than blending them with puppetry as in Spider Man br Benedict Wong as Wong Strange s mentor and friend who became the new Sorcerer Supreme during Strange s absence in the Blip br Tony Revolori as Eugene Flash Thompson Parker s classmate and former rival br Marisa Tomei as May Parker Parker s aunt While developing the story the writers realized that May would play a role similar to Uncle Ben s role in other incarnations of Spider Man As such the thematic and often paraphrasingly quoted idiom with great power there must also come great responsibility is said by May since she has been the moral guide for Parker in the MCU br Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker Spider Man An alternate version of Parker who is haunted by his failure to save his deceased girlfriend Gwen Stacy Garfield reprises his role from Webb s The Amazing Spider Man films The other Spider Men refer to him as Peter Three while Marvel s official website named him The Amazing Spider Man Garfield embraced his role as the middle brother of the group and was interested in exploring the idea of a tortured Parker following the events of The Amazing Spider Man including how lessons from those events could be passed to Holland s character He was grateful for the chance to tie up some loose ends for his incarnation of Parker and described working with Holland and Maguire as an opportunity to have deeper conversations about our experiences with the character Parker ends up saving MJ during the climax in a similar way to how he fails to save Stacy in The Amazing Spider Man McKenna and co writer Erik Sommers credited director Jon Watts for coming up with the idea while they watched a pre visualization reel showcasing ideas for the climactic battle br Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker Spider Man An alternate version of Parker who uses organic webbing instead of web shooters like his alternate counterparts Maguire reprises his role from Raimi s Spider Man trilogy The other Spider Men refer to him as Peter Two while Marvel s official website named him the Friendly Neighborhood Spider Man Maguire wanted the film to reveal only minimal details about what happened to his character after the events of Spider Man br Rhys Ifans reprises his role as Dr Curt Connors Lizard an Oscorp scientist from Webb s The Amazing Spider Man who transformed into a large reptilian monster while trying to regrow his missing arm Thomas Haden Church reprises his role as Flint Marko Sandman a small time thief from Raimi s Spider Man who received an ability to transform into sand Both Ifans and Church returned to voice the characters though footage at the end of the film when they revert to their human forms was archival footage from The Amazing Spider Man and Spider Man respectively Watts served as a stand in for Church on set by providing motion capture reference to the uncredited body double who physically replaced Church in the role Charlie Cox reprises his role as Matt Murdock from Marvel Television s Netflix series and Tom Hardy reprises his roles as Eddie Brock Venom from Sony s Spider Man Universe SSU in an uncredited cameo appearance in the mid credits scene br Reprising their roles from previous MCU Spider Man films are Angourie Rice as Betty Brant Parker s classmate and Ned s ex girlfriend Hannibal Buress as Coach Wilson Midtown School of Science

an MIT administrator Arian Moayed as DODC agent Cleary Mary Rivera as Ned s grandmother and Cristo Fern ndez as a bartender serving Brock Tom Holland s brother Harry Holland was set to make a cameo as a thief but his scenes were cut from the original theatrical release Lexi Rabe who portrayed Stark s daughter Morgan in Avengers Endgame also had an appearance that was not included in the theatrical release br br br Production br br br Development br br During production on Spider Man Homecoming two sequels were being planned by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures In June star Tom Holland explained that each film would take place during a different year of high school for Peter Parker Spider Man with the third being set during the character s senior year Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige noted in July that the third film would feature a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film due to the ending of the second film Spider Man Far From Home which publicly reveals that Parker is Spider Man br Development on third and fourth MCU Spider Man films had begun by August with Sony hoping Holland and director Jon Watts would return for both Holland was contracted to return for one more film while Watts had completed his two film deal and would need to sign on for any more films By then Marvel Studios and its parent company The Walt Disney Studios had spent several months discussing expanding their deal with Sony The existing deal had Marvel and Feige produce the Spider Man films for Sony and receive of their revenue Sony wanted to expand the deal to include more films while keeping the same terms of the original agreement Disney expressed concern with Feige s workload producing the Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU franchise already and asked for a stake in any future films Feige produced for Sony Unable to come to an agreement Sony announced that it would be moving forward on the next Spider Man film without Feige or Marvel s involvement Their statement acknowledged that this could change in the future thanked Feige for his work on the first two films and said they appreciated the path Feige has helped put us on which we will continue Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers were writing the screenplay for the third film by the time of Sony s announcement after also doing so for Far From Home but Watts was receiving offers to direct large films for other studios instead of returning to the franchise including potentially working on a different property for Marvel Studios and Feige br In September Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Tony Vinciquerra said that for the moment the door is closed on Spider Man returning to the MCU and confirmed that the character would be integrated with Sony s own shared universe Sony s Spider Man Universe SSU moving forward Responding to backlash from fans following the announcement Vinciquerra added that the Marvel people are terrific people we have great respect for them but on the other hand we have some pretty terrific people of our own Feige didn t do all the work we re pretty capable of doing what we have to do here However after this fan reaction continued at Disney s biennial convention D and at the urging of Holland who personally spoke to Disney CEO Bob Iger and Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairman Tom Rothman the companies returned to negotiations Sony and Disney announced a new agreement at the end of September which would allow Marvel Studios and Feige to produce another MCU Spider Man film for Sony with Amy Pascal scheduled for July Disney was reportedly co financing of the film in exchange for of its profits while retaining the character s merchandising rights Feige said he was thrilled that the character would remain in the MCU and said all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on the franchise The agreement also allowed Holland s Spider Man to appear in a future Marvel Studios film as well as crossing over to Sony s own shared universe with the latter interaction described as a call and answer between the two franchises as they acknowledge details between the two in what would loosely be described as a shared detailed universe Sony described their previous films with Marvel Studios as a great collaboration and said our mutual desire to continue was equal to that of the many fans At the time of the new agreement Watts was in final negotiations to direct the film br Discussing the new deal in October Iger attributed it to the efforts of Holland as well as the fan response to the end of the original deal He felt that both Sony and Disney had initially forgotten that there are other people who actually matter while they were negotiating Rothman said the deal was a win win win A win for Sony a win for Disney a win for the fans He felt the initial reports on the negotiations did not necessarily line up with the actual discussions that were taking place and said the final deal would have eventuated without the reports and fan discourse Zendaya was confirmed to be reprising her role as MJ from the previous films in the sequel br br br Pre production br McKenna and Sommers began working on the script in earnest by December They considered featuring Kraven the Hunter as the film s main antagonist an idea that Watts had expressed interest in and pitched to Holland but was abandoned because Sony wanted to first feature the character in a solo film before any other projects The plot subsequently gravitated towards a story idea similar to It s a Wonderful Life in which Parker makes a wish regarding his now public identity That idea introduced Dr Stephen Strange to the story and the duo began exploring the idea of the multiverse and potentially revisiting characters from past Spider Man films Initially they thought this would just be a tease for fans but they ultimately decided to fully integrate the past characters into the plot Sommers said Once it was collectively decided that we were going to take this swing we had to commit and we had to do what was right for the story They optimistically wrote for all the characters they wanted in the film before those actors were confirmed to be returning Initial drafts of the film included every major character from past Spider Man films returning but this was narrowed down because the pair felt they had bit ten off more than they could chew The duo worked hard to prevent the film from just being a bunch of fan service by using the returning characters to help tell Peter Parker s story instead of just creating curtain calls for everybody Norman Osborn Green Goblin from Sam Raimi s Spider Man trilogy was not the main villain of the film in the first version of the script despite still appearing as an antagonist after the film lost other characters McKenna and Sommers concluded that the Green Goblin had to be the main villain and rewrote the script to give him a second chance to replicate his actions in Spider Man but in a darker way related to Holland s version of Spider Man America Chavez had been considered to appear in the film at one point to serve in the sorcerer s apprentice type role that eventually became part of Ned Leeds s role in the film she would go on to appear in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness br By the end of filming was expected to begin in mid In April Sony rescheduled No Way Home s release to November due to the COVID pandemic Although the film was originally meant to be set after the events of Multiverse of Madness release date changes meant No Way Home would be released first which meant aspects of the plot had to be rewritten including Strange no longer having firsthand knowledge of the multiverse McKenna felt this made it even more frightening to start fooling around with these things because it s the fear of the unknown In June Marisa Tomei confirmed that she would return as May Parker along with Watts as director She was hopeful that May s work as a community organizer would be featured in the film Also in June Charlie Cox who portrayed Matt Murdock Daredevil in Marvel Television s Netflix series was contacted by Feige about reprising his role in upcoming Marvel Studios projects starting with appearances in No Way Home and the Disney series She Hulk Attorney at Law The next month Holland said production was planned to take place from late to February and Sony shifted the film s release date to December Tony Revolori was also confirmed to be reprising his role as Flash Thompson In early October Jacob Batalon and Benedict Cumberbatch were set to reprise their MCU roles of Ned Leeds and Strange while Jamie Foxx was set to return as Max Dillon Electro from Marc Webb s The Amazing Spider Man with filming beginning later in the month Immediately prior to the beginning of filming several other key actors in the film had yet to sign on According to Holland the film needed all or none of the actors to be produced br br br Filming br Second unit filming occurred from October to in New York City under the working title Serenity Now to capture visual effects plates and establishing shots Filming occurred in the Astoria Sunnyside and Long Island City neighborhoods in Queens On October filming occurred in Greenwich Village in Manhattan br The production moved to Atlanta by October with Holland Batalon and Zendaya joining for principal photography after Holland finished shooting Sony s Uncharted two days earlier Mauro Fiore served as cinematographer on the film replacing Seamus McGarvey who had to leave the production after contracting COVID McGarvey also had a conflict with the film Cyrano following No Way Home s pandemic caused production delay as principal photography was originally planned to start in July Shooting in Atlanta occurred at Trilith Studios with strict safety measures in place on the soundstages to prevent exposure to COVID To reduce interactions between cast and crew members on set during the pandemic the production reportedly relied on innovative new technology that scanned actors into a visual effects system that can apply make up and costumes to actors during post production A light system was also in place to signal when the cast could take off their masks for filming and when masks would be required for the cast and crew members to wear while set work was being done Cumberbatch began shooting his scenes in Atlanta by late November before beginning work on Multiverse of Madness which began filming that month in London Filming ran for seven to eight weeks using the working titles Serenity Now and The November Project before a break during the Christmas season br By December Alfred Molina was set to reprise his role as Otto Octavius Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi s Spider Man with Tobey Maguire reprising his role as Peter Parker Spider Man from Raimi s Spider Man film trilogy and Andrew Garfield returning as Peter Parker Spider Man from Webb s The Amazing Spider Man films A cameo appearance of Maguire and Garfield alongside Holland as their respective Spider Men had previously been considered for the Sony Pictures Animation film Spider Man Into the Spider Verse but was cut then because Sony felt at that moment that it would be too risky and confusing At that time Collider reported that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film alongside Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson from Raimi s Spider Man film trilogy and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy from the Amazing Spider Man films The first draft of the script included other characters from the Spider Man and Amazing Spider Man films but the writers felt that including too many characters would negatively affect the story The rumors about returning actors led to speculation and commentary with Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter believing that a crossover style film could lessen the impact of Sony s successful animated Into the Spider Verse film His colleague Graeme McMillan felt a Spider Verse crossover would allow Marvel to clean up some loose ends and fulfill some fan dreams in the process especially if Marvel and Sony s negotiations meant that they wanted to separate Spider Man from the MCU Film s Hoai Tran Bui feared the film was becoming over crowded and wished that Holland could lead a Spider Man film without a bigger A list star showing him the ropes while Adam B Vary of Variety noted that these reports were not confirmed and questioned whether the returning actors would be making more than cameo appearances Shortly after Holland denied that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film Many of the actors returning from previous Spider Man films were brought to set in cloaks to help prevent their involvements in the film from leaking Around Christmas McKenna and Sommers rewrote the introductions of Maguire and Garfield as well as much of the third act in time for those actors to start filming They had not been able to focus on those scenes earlier because they were busy during filming of much of the first and second acts in the previous months br Feige confirmed in December that the film would have connections to Multiverse of Madness A month later he discussed the fact that the film s title had not yet been announced acknowledging that it was being referred to by some as Spider Man and revealing that Marvel was referring to it as Homecoming internally Cox had shot material for the film by then An Atlanta set photo indicated that the film would be set during the Christmas season Filming occurred at Frederick Douglass High School from January to The next month Holland described it as the most ambitious standalone superhero film and again denied the rumors that Maguire and Garfield would appear At the end of February the film s title was revealed to be Spider Man No Way Home continuing the naming convention of the past two films of featuring home in the title Filming took place at Midtown High School from March to The Atlanta Public Schools system had stopped allowing buildings in the district for use as filming locations because of the COVID pandemic but gave this film an exception since both the Frederick Douglass and Midtown schools were previously used as filming locations in Spider Man Homecoming Hannibal Buress was revealed to be reprising his role as gym teacher Coach Wilson with Buress releasing a music video in August revealing that he had filmed scenes in Atlanta Holland said No Way Home had more visceral fight sequences than the previous two films with more hand to hand combat Filming wrapped on March br br br Post production br br In April Molina confirmed that he was appearing in the film explaining that he had been told not to talk about his role in the film during production but he realized that his appearance had been widely rumored and reported on Later that month J B Smoove revealed that he was returning as Julius Dell from Far From Home while Cox stated that he was not involved with the film In early May Garfield denied that he had been asked to appear in the film but later said never say never while Angourie Rice was revealed to be returning as Betty Brant Later that month Stone denied her involvement in the film br Sony Pictures Group President Sanford Panitch acknowledged in May that there had been confusion and frustration from fans regarding the relationship between the SSU and the MCU but stated that there was a plan to clarify this He believed it was already getting a little more clear for people as to where we re headed at that time and added that the release of No Way Home would reveal more of this plan Vary commented that the apparent introduction of multiverse elements in No Way Home could be what would allow Holland to appear in both the MCU and the SSU The official trailer for No Way Home confirmed the involvements of Jon Favreau as Harold Happy Hogan and Benedict Wong as Wong reprising their roles from past MCU films as well as J K Simmons as J Jonah Jameson from Far From Home Simmons previously played a different version of the character in the Raimi trilogy as well It was also confirmed that the characters Electro and Green Goblin would appear in the film with the implication that this incarnation of Green Goblin would be Willem Dafoe s version from the Raimi films In September Garfield again denied he was in the film saying No matter what I say it s either going to be really disappointing for people or it s going to be really exciting Garfield later described his denials as rather stressful but also weirdly enjoyable br In early October many commentators expected Tom Hardy to reprise his roles as Eddie Brock and Venom from Venom and Venom Let There Be Carnage after the Let There Be Carnage mid credits scene showed the characters being transported from their universe the SSU to the MCU Feige said there was a lot of coordination between the Let There Be Carnage and No Way Home teams to create the scene which was directed by Watts during the production of No Way Home Hardy ultimately appeared as Brock in the film s mid credits scene though there had been discussions about integrating him into the film s final battle Later that month Empire s issue on No Way Home stated that the film would include the returns of Doctor Octopus Electro Dafoe s Green Goblin Thomas Haden Church s Flint Marko Sandman from Raimi s Spider Man and Rhys Ifans s Curt Connors Lizard from Webb s The Amazing Spider Man Church s role in the film was originally meant to be larger counting with a subplot of his own about Sandman s relationship with his daughter Penny who was previously portrayed by Perla Haney Jardine but the COVID pandemic and the script being rewritten led to his role s reduction only providing scratch dialogue and some motion capture at a San Antonio Texas parking lot Watts said these were still unconfirmed rumors and was in no hurry to confirm or deny appearances of the characters while Feige said the rumors were fun for fans but audiences should not expect them all to come true The film s second trailer confirmed the involvements of Dafoe Church and Ifans Paul Giamatti s Aleksei Sytsevich Rhino from The Amazing Spider Man and Jake Gyllenhaal s Quentin Beck Mysterio from Far From Home were also considered for inclusion with McKenna and Sommers playing with the idea of a Sinister Six forming Rhino Mysterio and the Sinister Six ultimately did not appear in the film Michael Keaton s Adrian Toomes Vulture from Homecoming was considered to appear in the film before being rejected as well br At the beginning of November Jorge Lendeborg Jr revealed that he would be reprising his role as Jason Ionello from Homecoming and Far From Home in a similar role to those films that would have very little to do with the core story By the middle of the month additional photography had been completed for the film Pascal described No Way Home as the culmination of the Homecoming trilogy and Arian Moayed revealed that he had a role in the film Dunst said she was not in the film but would never say no to reprising her role of Mary Jane Watson A teaser trailer for Multiverse of Madness was included at the end of the film as a post credits scene before being released online shortly after No Way Home s theatrical release Jeffrey Ford and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as the film s editors The visual effects were provided by Cinesite Clear Angle Studios Crafty Apes Digital Domain Folks VFX Framestore Luma Pictures Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies Mr X Perception Secret Lab Sony Pictures Imageworks and SSVFX br br br Music br br In November Homecoming and Far From Home composer Michael Giacchino was confirmed to be returning for No Way Home The film s score album was released digitally on December with a track titled Arachnoverture released as a single on December and another titled Exit Through the Lobby released the following day Giacchino references themes from previous Spider Man films by Hans Zimmer James Horner Christopher Young and Danny Elfman as well as his own themes from Doctor Strange Regarding the use of these other themes Giacchino did not want their use to be fan service and finding ways to include them in a very targeted way He and Watts were very much in alignment in terms of when to use them and when not to use them for their maximum effect br br br Marketing br In May Sony entered a promotional partnership with Hyundai Motor Group to showcase their new models and technologies in the film Hyundai later released a commercial titled Only Way Home that was directed by Watts to promote the film and the Ioniq electric powered SUV which appears in the film along with the Hyundai Tucson with Holland and Batalon starring In late February Holland Batalon and Zendaya released three stills featuring their characters from the film alongside fake logos with the titles Spider Man Phone Home Spider Man Home Wrecker and Spider Man Home Slice respectively The film s official title was announced the next day with a video showing Holland Batalon and Zendaya leaving Watts s office where they supposedly received the fake titles Batalon and Zendaya note that Holland could not be trusted with the actual title since he had accidentally revealed the second film s title The video ends on a whiteboard showing the film s true title among various other titles featuring the word home that were apparently considered Jennifer Bisset of CNET suggested the fake titles and logos could represent the villains in the film including Foxx s Electro and Molina s Doctor Octopus while TheWrap s Umberto Gonzalez called them funny bait and switch fakes and noted the Phone Home title referenced a line from E T the Extra Terrestrial Gregory Lawrence of Collider felt the Home Wrecker title could point to the film feeling like a s thriller film and said the fake titles were a solid goof to excite fans He also compared the stills to the terrifying awe inspiring wonder of Steven Spielberg films and The Goonies while Germain Lussier from io said they gave off subtle National Treasure Indiana Jones vibes In July Marvel revealed various toys and figurines for the film including Funko Pops Marvel Legends figures and Lego sets br At the end of August when asked about the lack of trailer and official images or descriptions for the film Feige stated that the film was not being any more or less secret than any of our other projects and reaffirmed that a trailer would be released before the film s premiere in theaters Though Sony handles the marketing for the film their marketing team is in coordination with Disney s to ensure each knows when the other is releasing MCU related content so it is a win win for everybody On August an apparent leak of the first trailer was shared on social media which The Hollywood Reporter deemed legitimate after Sony worked to have various copies of the trailer taken down Adam Chitwood at Collider noted the built up online fervor surrounding the trailer and felt that it would not be able to live up to the hype fans have built up in their minds Chitwood continued that the other film releases from Marvel Studios had not seen a similar level of demand as No Way Home pointing out that all of the rumored castings had positioned the film to be a once in a lifetime moviegoing experience if they were accurate He also wondered if Sony was wary of committing marketing that noted the film s December release date amid the resurgence of the COVID Delta variant br The film s teaser trailer was officially released on August during Sony s CinemaCon panel Entertainment Weekly s Devan Coggan noted that the trailer confirmed the multiverse s role in the film including elements from the Raimi and Webb films while Ethan Anderton from Film called the trailer nothing short of thrilling since it confirmed many of the previous rumors about the film Austen Goslin at Polygon conversely felt much of what had been rumored did not get revealed in the trailer feeling that the rumors were either false or Marvel was still intending to keep them a secret Anderton s colleague Joshua Meyer called the trailer a doozy packed with jaw dropping moments and noted how the film would be adapting the One More Day comic book storyline Newby had previously noted the apparent adaption of One More Day and One Moment in Time storylines following the reveal of Cumberbatch s casting Many commentators noted the possible teases of Spider Man villains Sandman and the Lizard in the trailer as an indication of the Sinister Six forming in the film Vinnie Mancuso at Collider was excited to see the return of Molina and the potential for Dafoe s involvement but called it a cheap pop since it was doing a disservice to the stories you re trying to tell in the present by reminding the audience how much better things used to be He also felt the trailer played into Marvel s ongoing reluctance to let Tom Holland s Spider Man star in his own Spider Man movies since the trailer gave Parker zero memorable moments among all of its elements The trailer had million global views in its first hours becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period This surpassed the record of Avengers Endgame million views and more than doubled the views for the Spider Man Far From Home trailer million It also generated the largest hour social media conversation volume of all time globally with million mentions made up of million in the United States and million internationally these both exceeded Avengers Endgame s mentions million in the United States million internationally br The second official trailer premiered at a fan screening at the Regal Sherman Oaks theater in Los Angeles on November Goslin felt the trailer reveals the full extent of Marvel s Spider Man multiverse while his colleague Matt Patches noted the missing appearance of Maguire s or Garfield s Spider Man in the trailer but felt that it was entirely possible the actors appear in No Way Home Jason Robbins of Collider was disappointed by the trailer saying it was what we expected but less since it just showed the returning villains and had no confirmation of Maguire or Garfield or further insight into the multiverse Some commentators said parts of the trailer appeared as though Maguire and Garfield had been edited out of the footage such as a shot in which the Lizard appears to be struck by an invisible force On November Sony began releasing several videos on TikTok as part of their The Daily Bugle viral marketing campaign featuring Simmons and Rice In December the first minute of the film premiered exclusively on Late Night with Seth Meyers while a newsstand for The Daily Bugle was set up in New York City in partnership with Liberty Mutual to promote the film Other marketing partners include the video games Fortnite and PUBG Mobile which featured special in

to do so as Black Widow Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Eternals were not released in the country though as of February there had been no release date in part because of diplomatic tensions between the country and the United States which stemmed in part from the U S diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics In May Chinese authorities had reportedly requested for the Statue of Liberty to be removed from the film for it to be released in the country but Sony refused br In March Sony announced that all of their live action Spider Man films would be re released in

F scale the first live action Spider Man film and the fourth MCU film overall to earn the score after The Avengers Black Panther and Avengers Endgame PostTrak reported of audience members gave it a positive score with saying they would definitely recommend it br Amelia Emberwing of IGN gave the film out of stating that its impact on the universe as a whole as well as the overall emotional beats all feel earned while praising the performances of Dafoe Molina and Foxx Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood praised Watts s direction and wrote Holland Zendaya and Batalon are a priceless trio and the various villains and others who pop in and out make this pure movie fun of the highest order Fans will be in heaven Peter Debruge of Variety praised Garfield s and Maguire s performances and felt the film provides enough resolution for the past two decades of Spider Man adventures that audiences who ve tuned out along the way will be rewarded for giving this one a shot Writing for Den of Geek Don Kaye gave the film out of stars for its action sequences performances and chemistry of the cast stating that No Way Home channels the entire spectrum of Spider Man movies while setting the character on a course all his own at last Jennifer Bisset of CNET praised the action sequences performances and story writing A Russo Brothers influence can almost be felt ushering Holland s third Spider Man movie into new weightier territory If the character is to become the next Tony Stark this is the way to etch a few more scars into a more interesting hero s facade If you came for the biggest movie of the year you ll definitely leave satisfied br Kevin Maher of The Times gave the film out of stars saying that it was As satisfying to watch as it is perilous to discuss and described it as a dynamite blast of smarty pants postmodernism that never once abandons its emotional core Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film out of stars praising Watts for bringing back numerous baddies from the previous Spider Man universes delivering a propulsive slickly choreographed adventure that will appease a broad fanbase this Christmas but feeling that the script lacks the expected fizz that sense of shaggy fun struggling to break through a more robotic plot Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a B feeling that Watts s work was satisfying emotional and occasionally unsteady She found that the script spent far too long dwelling on the machinations of people and plans we already know throwing in some awkward misdirection and simply delaying the inevitable The Hollywood Reporter s John DeFore felt that the inclusion of multiversal mayhem addressed the Iron Man ification of the character that made Holland centric films least fun br CNN s Brian Lowry praised the humor and wrote What s already apparent though is that this movie was conceived to be savored and enjoyed And in what has become an increasingly elusive phenomenon that will include whoops and hollers from appreciative fans in theaters where Spider Man will first reveal its secrets and then more than likely shows off its legs Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun Times gave the film out of and praised the performances of Holland and Zendaya writing There s nothing new or particularly memorable about the serviceable CGI and practical effects but we remain invested in the outcome in large part because Holland remains the best of the cinematic Spider Men while Zendaya lends heart and smarts and warmth to every moment she s onscreen We continue to root for these two to make it even if the multiverse isn t always on their side In contrast Bilge Ebiri of Vulture called the film aggressively mediocre criticizing the action comedy and writing but praising Dafoe describing him as once again gets to have some modest fun with his character s divided self and Garfield calling him a genuine delight and naming his the film s best performance Hannah Strong of Little White Lies criticized the film for poor character development particularly in regard to Holland s Peter Parker character stating It s grating seeing the same character repeatedly fail to learn any lessons or show even a modicum of personal growth The same review was also generally critical of the film prioritizing fan service over good storytelling br br br Accolades br br No Way Home was nominated for an Academy Award three Visual Effects Society

Home was being treated as the end of a franchise that began with Homecoming with any additional solo films featuring the MCU Spider Man characters to be different from the first trilogy of films and feature a tonal change A month later Holland said he was unsure if he should continue making Spider Man films and felt he would have done something wrong if he was still portraying the character in his thirties He expressed interest in a film focusing on the Miles Morales version of Spider Man instead Despite this Pascal hoped to continue working with Holland on future Spider Man films Later in

Marvel Studios The Fantastic Four to take a break from blockbuster films Deadline Hollywood reported that Sony still expected Watts along with Holland and Zendaya to eventually return for the next MCU Spider Man film Feige said in February that they had a story for the film with big ideas and that writers had begun work on it Pascal said at the end of May that the film was still in development but that work was put on hold because of the Writers Guild of America strike that began earlier that month and that work would resume after the strike concluded By that time Holland reiterated that the film was in early stages of development and that he had been involved in meetings about it which were also put on hold because of the writers strike In November Holland again noted he was part of
