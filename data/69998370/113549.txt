Scream is a American slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson It stars David Arquette Neve Campbell Courteney Cox Matthew Lillard Rose McGowan Skeet Ulrich and Drew Barrymore Set in the fictional town of Woodsboro California Scream s plot follows high school student Sidney Prescott Campbell and her friends who on the anniversary of her mother s murder become the targets of a costumed serial killer known as Ghostface br Williamson who was struggling to get his projects off the ground was inspired by reports of a series of murders by the Gainesville Ripper as he wrote a screenplay that satirized the clich s of the slasher genre popularized in films such as Halloween Friday the th and A Nightmare on Elm Street Developed under the title Scary Movie Williamson s script became the subject of an intense bidding war from multiple studios before Miramax Films purchased the rights Craven despite turning down the opportunity multiple times agreed to direct the film after he had read the script as he was determined to re establish himself after several career setbacks The involvement of Barrymore and Cox helped secure more support from the studio Principal photography took place from April to June in California on a budget of million Craven trimmed down the violence in the film after being involved in a tense conflict with the Motion Picture Association of America over the desired R rating br Released on December Scream was not expected to perform well due to concerns over releasing a slasher film in a time normally reserved for holiday entertainment but it went on to gross approximately million worldwide through the strength of word of mouth becoming a surprise success and one of the highest grossing films of the year Reviews praised the performances of its cast and its unique meta humor but criticized its excessive violence and lack of suspense in favor of that humor The film helped elevate Williamson s career as a writer and raised the profiles of the rest of the cast br Scream is now regarded as one of the greatest horror and slasher films ever made It has been credited with rekindling interest in the horror genre during the s following a decline in the genre s popularity It has remained influential as Barrymore s involvement helped make participating in horror films more acceptable to prominent actors and increased horror films appeal with younger audiences The success of the film launched a multimedia franchise which comprises the sequels Scream Scream Scream Scream and Scream VI as well as an anthology television series br br br Plot br In the small town of Woodsboro California high school student Casey Becker is home alone when she receives a phone call from an unknown person They discuss

several affairs including one with Cotton and that he was wrongly accused of her murder Sidney stays at Tatum s home but receives another taunting call from the killer The calls are traced to Neil s

Himbry Linda Blair as Obnoxious Reporter casting director Lisa Beach as a reporter and director Wes Craven appears as Freddy the janitor an homage to iconic horror character Freddy Krueger br br br Production br br br Writing br br In Kevin Williamson was a novice and financially struggling screenwriter having recently sold his first script Killing Mrs Tingle While house sitting Williamson watched a Turning Point documentary about serial killer Danny Rolling which he said left him unsettled Williamson later noticed an open window armed himself with a knife and called his friend for support The pair began discussing horror characters that had resonated with them such as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees The following morning Williamson was woken by a nightmare and used the experience as inspiration for the opening home invasion of Scream He was also influenced by a one act play he wrote in college about an unknown caller taunting a young girl br Williamson spent the next three days writing a script for a slasher film he called Scary Movie while listening to the score to Halloween for further inspiration He also drafted two five page outlines for possible sequels He developed much of the script around a single line of dialogue movies don t create psychos movies make psychos more creative This was his response to contemporary concerns about the influence of cinematic violence on audience and he thought it was a great line Williamson s script drew upon many of his favorite horror films such as Halloween Friday the th Prom Night and A Nightmare on Elm Street At the time the successful slasher films of the s and s had fallen out of favor in part because of increasingly poorly received sequels to long running horror franchises br His characters were intentionally designed to be knowledgeable about these horror films and their typical elements with the intention of creating a unique killer who was not only aware of horror film clich s but also exploited them for his own advantage Williamson expressed his approach I thought if you could expose the rules and play with them then the audience doesn t know what they re going to get Suddenly they re on edge I started playing with the tropes and the rules were part of that The opening scene depicting Casey Becker s death emulates that of Janet Leigh s character in Psycho by killing off a possible main character early on Williamson believed it would hook studio executives and leave audiences unsure how the plot would progress Williamson set the script in his hometown of Bayboro North Carolina believing its quiet atmosphere would provide a strong contrast with a serial killer s actions br Williamson pursued Scary Movie because it was the type of horror film he enjoyed as a child but believed were no longer being made Even so he did not believe studios would develop and intended to use it to garner attention and secure other work Williamson s agent had him scale back the gore removing descriptions such as the insides are slowly rolling down her leg because it would make it difficult to sell the script Williamson refused to cut any dialogue however believing it set it apart from similar films br br br Development br br By several studios were competing to secure the rights to Scary Movie including Morgan Creek Entertainment Paramount Pictures Universal Pictures and filmmaker Oliver Stone The script came to the attention of producer Cathy Konrad of Woods Entertainment which had a development deal with production studio Miramax She brought it to Richard Potter the director of development for Miramax s genre film focused subsidiary Dimension Films Potter expected a stupid spoof but was drawn in by the opening scene and recommended Miramax chairman Bob Weinstein pursue the rights He agreed considering it an opportunity to produce films instead of distributing those of others Although others offered larger figures Williamson s lawyer advised him take Weinstein s offer because Dimension was willing to make the film immediately br Williamson revised the script based on studio input removing some gorier content such as exposed internal organs and severed limbs and adding the murder of principal Himbry because Weinstein said there was too long a period following the opening without any deaths This solved a separate difficulty Williamson was having explaining why all but the core group of characters leave Stu s party in the finale as they go to see Himbry s corpse The Scary Movie title was also changed to Scream late in production because Weinstein was concerned Scary Movie would lead audiences to believe it was a comedy instead of a horror br The search for a director took over two months with Danny Boyle Tom McLoughlin Sam Raimi Robert Rodriguez George A Romero Quentin Tarantino and Anthony Waller being considered No agreements were secured because they interpreted the script as a comedy instead of a horror satire Wes Craven was discounted by the studio due to his lack of experience directing satires Craven liked the script but he wanted to work on less gory and more mainstream content including a film adaptation of the novel The Haunting of Hill House because of the negative public perception of him based on his previous films Craven s assistant Julie Plec and producer Marianne Maddalena continued to push Scream to Craven His interest was renewed after The Haunting of Hill House adaptation was cancelled and he experienced the personal disappointment of his failed horror comedy Vampire in Brooklyn After reading the script Plec said Craven suggested the studio make him an offer he can t refuse And so Dimension did And he took it The deal also offered Craven his choice of other projects to direct after Scream br Williamson met Craven to discuss the script believing he would request substantial rewrites but Craven s notes related mainly to typos and some minor additions including restoring some of the gorier content and refining the ending which was not yet fully realized Williamson said The story stayed pretty much intact but we added some scares and shortened it Wes reworked some of the action sequences and we would argue and go back and forth but there s a point where I had to realize that Wes is more experienced than I am Describing the script Craven said what it forces you to do is sort of look at the reality of things we typically look at as amusing like the Friday the th type of deaths where people have arrows through their heads and kids scream and laugh But that suddenly starts happening in their actual lives br br br Casting br br Atypical for the genre at the time Scream featured a cast of established stars such as Drew Barrymore and Courteney Cox as well as relatively unknown actors Executive producer Cary Woods used his friendship with Barrymore s agent to approach her for the lead role of Sidney Prescott but she requested the smaller role of Casey Becker because that s the part I love the most Maddalena suggested that Barrymore had wanted to leave the project entirely but took the smaller role to avoid disappointing Bob Weinstein and his brother Harvey The filmmakers agreed to the change believing it would be impactful to kill off their most well known actor during Scream s opening and convince audiences that no character was safe Vinessa Shaw and Reese Witherspoon were also considered for Sidney Prescott Witherspoon was discounted because she looked too young compared to the other cast and Williamson s choice Molly Ringwald believed she was too old for the part The final choices came down to Alicia Witt Brittany Murphy and Campbell According to Williamson Campbell swiftly emerged as the favored choice among the principal crew and to improve her chances they filmed her screen test first forcing the other contenders to try and surpass her performance Beach and Maddalena said Campbell brought athleticism from her dancing background with a combination of strength and vulnerability Describing what attracted her to the role Campbell said Sidney was a fantastic character for any kind of movie who transitions from tormented traumatized insecure young woman to overwhelmingly empowered and strong br Woods suggested Courteney Cox for the cold and calculating Gale Weathers believing it would be interesting to play against her typical personable characters in series such as Family Ties and Friends Craven did not believe Cox could play the part and so she wrote a letter assuring him that being a bitch wouldn t be a stretch at all Brooke Shields and Janeane Garofalo were considered but a more established actress was preferred David Arquette auditioned for unspecified younger characters but he was attracted to the role of Dewey and acting against Cox The character was written as a dumb jock but Arquette interpreted it as a position of authority getting no respect He wants to be John Wayne He wants to be this tough guy but he s just got a heart of gold Rose McGowan s agent jeopardized her chance to play Tatum by insisting on a payment of instead of the offered which was lower than the received by some other principal actors As a result McGowan had to reaudition for the role twice McGowan influenced Tatum s design dying her hair blonde to avoid having two dark haired main female characters removing an Indigo Girls poster from Tatum s bedroom because she would not listen to the relatively older band and rejecting costuming suggestions in favor of her self bought outfits Thora Birch and Natasha Lyonne also auditioned for the role Lyonne was the preferred choice but as she was under could not consent to joining without parental permission br Believing he was rising in popularity Vince Vaughn was the studio s preferred choice for Billy Loomis but he was too ill to audition Ulrich did not attend auditions because of scheduling conflicts but his girlfriend did and mentioned Ulrich brought her Beach went out to meet him personally Ulrich liked playing a serial killer after more innocent and naive previous roles To develop his character Ulrich researched serial murders psychological profiles and outfitted one of his hotel rooms to the Billy persona to help him get into character outfitting it with punk rock posters and blacklights He said I was into punk music in my teens and really just trying to recapture that angst I would sit in there and read about serial killers and watch Faces of Death anything to get into that gory mindset Ulrich and Campbell starred together in The Craft which they believed fostered a natural relationship between their characters Lillard auditioned for Billy but the casting directors did not consider him the right actor to make out with Campbell and had him audition as Stu for Craven who immediately offered him the part br Seth Green Jason Lee and Breckin Meyer were all preferred for Randy the lanky gangly opinionated fifth wheel who really has a love and passion for movies but Craven and Williamson appreciated the innocence and comedy Kennedy brought to his portrayal Kennedy credited Craven for supporting his casting W Earl Brown and Craven were friends and he was not required to audition but did have to gain about lb kg he originally wanted to portray Dewey Roger L Jackson was hired based on his voice work for Mars Attacks He recounted overhearing his competitors discussing the Ghostface as the new Freddy Krueger but Jackson interpreted it as a more subtle role which required charisma and sexiness to keep his target on the phone even though they want to hang up Barrymore wanted someone to act against in her scene instead of the character s lines being read to her and while the filmmakers intended to dub over Jackson s voice with Tom Kane Craven liked his performance Henry Winkler shared an agent with Craven and made his cameo appearance as a favor Lynn McCree Sidney s mother was a Sonoma local she spent two hours taking pictures with Campbell for the role but had no knowledge of the character s backstory Liev Schreiber took the part of Cotton Weary for during an unrelated meeting with Bob Weinstein Extras were drawn from locals including the owners of a restaurant frequented by the cast and crew br br br Pre production br br It was determined early on that Scream required too many different interior and exterior locations to be filmed on sets Production designer Bruce Miller explained that it was important to portray the characters as vulnerable in their homes which made it essential that they could film inside and outside the properties Scouts researched locations in the United States and Canada but struggled to locate a house for the opening scene which featured plentiful windows and visibility Craven initially researched Wilmington North Carolina but it failed to meet his expectations I wanted to have very American looking houses and a lot of the houses there were very dark brown or brick and that didn t look attractive to me Locations near Vancouver were discounted for similar reasons as was Napa County California br Santa Rosa in Sonoma County California offered most features the filmmakers required but Harvey Weinstein rejected the additional million required to film there until the filmmakers convinced him that Craven s name would attract enough audiences to compensate for the added cost The opening scene used a house in Glen Ellen Production designer Bruce Miller said We didn t want homes that looked like castles or that you could really protect yourself in so if somebody was going to be stalking them they could get to them very quickly Other Santa Rosa locations used in Scream include Sidney s House at Calistoga Road interiors of Tatum s house at McDonald Avenue and the Bradley Video store where Randy works The Healdsburg California town square appears as the location of the Woodsboro Town Square the fountain and the exterior of the town police station br Stu s home was an unoccupied property in Tomales which offered a dark and isolated atmosphere for the finale Cinematographer Mark Irwin unsuccessfully argued against using the property because it was on top of a hill introducing logistical challenges for accessing trailers and equipment Production designer Bruce Alan Miller built a facade of barns in front of the house so trailers could be sited closer while remaining concealed The art department extensively modified the house adding Gothic elements such as beams and stained glass windows to give it a haunted feel painting the walls red although they realized later this made the blood stand out less and adding a white picket fence The farmhouse style home offered a convoluted layout for a convincing setting where the murders could occur without the other characters realizing The production crew also added a volleyball net to make it appear as if a teenager lived there br Ten days of filming were to take place at Santa Rosa High School in early June at a cost of up to but permission was revoked just before filming began in March by the Santa Rosa district The change was ostensibly because of the disruption filming would cause during school hours but locals also protested against the use of the school in a violent film and Craven s horror film legacy The Sonoma Community Center served as a replacement but scenes had to be rewritten to accommodate the new location and additional costs to transform the former elementary school into one appropriate for young adults including larger desks and installing lockers Craven estimated the disruption and location changes caused by the Santa Rosa district s decision cost the production including the the center was paid for three days of filming The disruption to filming by the school was not forgotten with the film s credits stating No thanks whatsoever to the Santa Rosa city school district governing board br Williamson only described Ghostface as ghost mask killer Maddalena discovered a mask while location scouting and was immediately taken in by it The design featuring a white shroud was designed by Brigitte Sleiertin as The Peanut Eyed Ghost for the novelty company Fun World in Craven asked Dimension to license the design but Fun World s price was steep and the studio also wanted full ownership of the mask Special effects company KNB EFX Group was commissioned to create similar but legally distinct alternatives Dozens of designs were developed resulting in gargoyle ish witch and goblin like masks The filmmakers did not like the replacements and made a version close to the Fun World design but with minor changes such as stretching the nose and chin to avoid copyright issues The killer was given a black shroud to avoid their clothing or movements hinting at their identity br br br Filming br Principal photography began on April on a million budget The first week was spent filming the Casey Becker scenes To elicit the necessary emotions Barrymore recalled a sad story developed with Craven and made herself hyperventilate To enhance her performance Jackson was situated outside the house so that he could see Barrymore while making the calls but she could not see him Jackson was used similarly for other Ghostface call scenes and never met the cast in person He said the scariest monsters are the monsters you don t see but the monsters you make in your mind So just having the voice to react to made it larger in their minds For safety stunt people portrayed the killer in costume although Craven portrays the killer in parts of the opening The first few days of filming used a custom mask designed for Scream but Craven did not like it and reshot various scenes with the Fun World design before it was licensed Because the hung Casey was to appear gutted from chest to waist effects artist Howard Berger decided against applying prosthetics to Barrymore in favor of a mannequin that could be hollowed out showing her spine holding her upper and lower parts together The effect was enhanced with various rubber and vinyl guts For Steve Orth s death KNB created an open back chair allowing the actor to kneel behind a hollowed out anatomical mannequin torso cut open at the abdomen and filled with latex rubber and gelatin intestines br After viewing the dailies raw footage the Weinsteins criticized the quality of Craven s work as workmanlike at best believing it lacked tension and had an inconsistent tone The Weinsteins were critical of the Fun World Mask believing it was flat and not scary suggesting various alternatives and said Barrymore lacked sex appeal because of the pageboy hairstyle she had chosen Williamson recounted Craven receiving a call from the brothers and seeing his back slump He just started sliding down the chair The studio considered abandoning filming or firing Craven and sent him footage from other films such as Nightwatch to demonstrate what they wanted for Scream br Konrad defended Craven to the brothers and in response Bob Weinstein sent Dimension executives Cary Granat and Andrew Rona to the set to directly intervene Craven Konrad Maddalena and line producer Stuart M Besser met with Granat who wanted the opening reshot with each of the Weinstein s alternative mask suggestions Instead they offered to edit together the existing footage to prove the scene and mask worked and if it did not then the project would be cancelled Editor Patrick Lussier worked with Craven to piece together most of the opening adding temporary music and sound effects The Weinsteins barred Craven and the producers from attending screening of the footage Afterward Bob Weinstein told the filmmakers What do I know about dailies Keep going and provided additional financing as well as licensing Fun World s design The producers suggested Weinstein had an ulterior motive to force the filmmakers to complete the footage the upcoming Milan Film Festival as edited footage was not typically allowed to be screened until eight weeks after filming concluded br The next main scene filmed was of the central cast sitting around a fountain Ulrich admitted he did not realize Scream was intended to be a horror with comedic elements and was confused by Lillard s and Kennedy s humorous moments believing they were ruining the movie Like This isn t funny This isn t supposed to be funny And man was I wrong Craven encouraged improvisation throughout filming much of it coming from Arquette and Lillard with Williamson acknowledging that Lillard s ad libs improved the script br br br The finale br br The film s minute end sequence set at Stu s party were filmed at night over three weeks Issues filming at the location including difficulties with providing proper lighting because of the uneven landscape exacerbated tensions between Craven and Irwin regarding the quality of Irwin s footage Scream was filmed with an anamorphic lens which distorts and stretches the image to achieve a specific aspect ratio However neither Craven nor Irwin had much experience with this type of lens The crew including Lussier had raised concerns about lens flares and out of focus images partially blaming the focus puller hired by Irwin Lussier explained You can often tell your focus is supposed to be on somebody s eye usually and the focus puller just hasn t moved with the actor As a result there were limited options during the editing process due to the inconsistent focus Irwin said he was informed that all filmed footage was unusable and that days of scenes needed to be reshot After an argument with Maddalena Irwin was immediately fired and replaced by Peter Deming for the final three weeks of filming Irwin believed he was made a scapegoat for the film s behind schedule status risking Craven forfeiting his salary but Konrad refuted this br Kennedy s horror rules scene was initially performed in a single take but he requested additional takes feeling he could enhance the performance Craven ultimately chose the third take During Tatum s death scene McGowan had trouble staying in the pet door as the garage door rose To address this the crew nailed her shirt to the frame to hold her in place Craven found it challenging managing the scene s tone aiming to avoid trivializing Tatum s death while paying homage to other horror films McGowan improvised the screams for her mother to give the character more humanity When Gale drives a van with Kenny s corpse on top Brown was on top of the van but the unprepared stunt driver accelerated at full speed When he hit the brakes Brown fell off the side of the van and the stunt coordinator grabbed Brown s pants and ankle saving him from harm br Five nights were spent on the kitchen confrontation between Billy Stu and Sidney By the time they had filmed Gale returning with a gun Ulrich said he and Lillard were roaming around like caged animals to keep the intensity of their performances high to the point Craven asked them to relax because they were scaring Cox Lillard described maintaining that level of adrenaline as exhausting Campbell Kennedy Lillard and Ulrich endured multiple nights covered in fake blood and the costumes could not be washed to maintain continuity they were dampened each night to make the blood appear fresh When Ulrich stabs a sofa the filmmakers were unaware it was stuffed with feathers which stuck to the fake blood Maddalena considered Craven nuts for keeping the feathers in the scene Lillard improvised lines such as My mom s gonna be so mad at me and You fucking hit me with the phone you dick the latter taking place when Ulrich threw a phone near him as intended but the sticky blood caused it to veer off and inadvertently hit Lillard Ulrich suggested Billy cracking his neck before shooting Gale and the sound was added in post production Campbell s stuntwoman accidentally stabbed Ulrich with an umbrella tip missing the protective vest he was wearing and hitting the site of an open heart surgery Ulrich had as a child br Filming concluded on June The cast spoke fondly of the summer camp atmosphere during filming and the camaraderie they formed The main cast and select crew members including Craven often gathered together in the early mornings after filming for meals activities and socializing Arquette s hotel room was transformed into a makeshift club where they would congregate However due to complaints from other residents they eventually relocated their early morning gatherings to a nearby barn br br br Post production br The Scary Movie title remained late into production appearing on the cast and crew gifts for completing filming Harvey Weinstein suggested Scream based on the Michael and Janet Jackson song of the same name Many of the cast and crew were initially unhappy with the change Sony Pictures filed a lawsuit against Dimension and Miramax claiming Scream infringed on their copyright of Screamers The case was settled out of court with Dimension being able to use Scream going forward Although Arquette s and Kennedy s characters were killed in the script alternate scenes were filmed showing them survive in case they proved popular with test screening audiences The successful screenings also resulted in Miramax asking Craven to direct two Scream sequels br Scream was rated NC by the Motion Picture Association of America MPAA restricting its audience to those over years of age which was considered box office suicide by industry experts The MPAA told Craven that Scream would never receive a more commercial R rating allowing younger people to see the film when accompanied by an adult Craven said I m a director who can do something very well but am not allowed to put it on screen And they ultimately get you as they did on this one on intensity They say it s not a specific shot it s not blood it s just too intense The filmmakers eventually convinced the MPAA that Scream was a spoof believing they were too focused on the horror aspects It took up to nine cuts to address the MPAA s complaints including removing any movement of Steve Orth s internal organs trimming Kenny s throat being slit because the actor s pained expression was too disturbing moving Billy and Stu stabbing each other off screen and reducing scenes of Casey s hanging body and Tatum s crushed head The slow motion stabbing of Casey was considered too brutal but was allowed with only a few frames removed because there was no alternate footage to use The final cut runs for minutes br The marketing for Scream positioned Barrymore as the lead character to intentionally shock the audience with her death During a promotional interview Ulrich inadvertently revealed he portrayed one of the killers and called his agent to get the story blocked br br br Music br br Despite having no background in film scoring or an interest in the horror genre Marco Beltrami was recommended to Plec and Craven who found his music samples original compared with Beltrami s contemporaries Craven grave Beltrami a weekend to compose The Cue from Hell the score for the film s opening sequence which secured his hiring Beltrami wrote the piece from Casey s perspective and used an operatic style employing a range of instruments including piano and brass Beltrami described himself as bumbling through the scoring process acknowledging his limited knowledge of horror music styles He incorporated elements of the western genre particularly for Dewey s theme and took cues from composers including Elliot Goldenthal Ennio Morricone Eric Serra Christopher Young and Hans Zimmer br Due to budget constraints Beltrami had to work with a small orchestra of fewer than performers To compensate for the lack of string harmonics he instructed the string players to whistle and asked Craven Lussier Maddalena and Woods to join and boost their numbers Beltrami identified most with Sidney s character and considered her theme Sidney s Lament to be one of the score s crucial pieces He chose not to assign a distinctive motif to Ghostface to avoid hinting at the killer s identity Licensed music for Scream was provided by TVT Records and includes covers of Don t Fear The Reaper by Gus Black and Birds Fly Whisper to a Scream by Soho School s Out by Alice Cooper First Cool Hive by Moby and Drop Dead Gorgeous by Republica Excepts from the Halloween score are also present br br br Release br br br Context br br The theatrical year of was projected to record a billion domestic box office record after twelve films grossed over million with Independence Day and Twister each earning over million However individual successes were hindered by the high number of releases competing for audiences resulting in several box office flops and studio bankruptcies This was compounded by rising production costs and high salaries for stars such as Jim Carrey Tom Cruise Arnold Schwarzenegger and Julia Roberts prompting many studios to cut their film slate by fifty percent Even so over forty films were scheduled for release in late including Beavis and Butt Head Do America Jerry Maguire Mars Attacks Ransom Space Jam and Star Trek First Contact br Bob Weinstein opted to release Scream in December as counterprogramming offering teenagers an alternative to more traditional holiday fare The decision was unpopular with the cast and crew with Williamson expecting the film to fail Weinstein explained people said we were crazy to put out Scream over Christmas It was a thriller it didn t have big stars it couldn t compete Well after Beavis and Butt Head where is that audience going to go br br br Box office br The premiere of Scream took place on December at the AVCO theater in Westwood Los Angeles It was released in the United States and Canada on December During its opening weekend the film grossed million across theaters an average of per theater making it the fourth highest grossing film of the weekend behind Dalmatians million Jerry Maguire million and the debut of Beavis and Butt Head Do America million The performance was considered a failure by industry professionals resulting in Variety labeling Scream dead on arrival Maddalena recounted herself and Craven observing a raucous audience for Beavis and Butt Head Do America while Scream had maybe seven people in there No one was laughing or screaming We went away so dejected However Scream received positive audience word of mouth and exit polling responses leading the studio to increase the marketing and distribution budget This contributed to Scream s performance improving in the following weeks Although it fell to fifth place in its second weekend it increased its weekend gross to million and again in its third weekend rising to third place with million Scream remained in the top ten highest grossing films for nine weeks in total becoming a surprise success and grossing a total of million This figure made it the number highest grossing film of and highest grossing slasher film of its time until Halloween It was Miramax s second film to gross million in the United States and Canada after Pulp Fiction The film was most successful with teenagers and young people in their s br Outside of the U S and Canada Scream is estimated to have grossed a further million including million in the United Kingdom making it the number highest grossing film This gives Scream a cumulative worldwide total of million making it the number highest grossing film of the year After four weeks of release it became the highest grossing horror film in France with a gross of million million French Francs In Japan the release date was postponed from May to August after the murder of a year old boy whose killer was apparently obsessed with horror movies br Industry analysis showed that most of the films released toward the end of the year were box office failures including both big budget fare and a surge of films targeted toward women Only a few were seen as successes including Dalmatians Beavis and Butt Head Do America Jerry Maguire Ransom Scream and Star Trek First Contact The success of Scream resulted in additional financial compensation for the principal crew and cast triggered by the box office surpassing million and subsequent increments of million up to million Kennedy noted that his first residual check was double his salary br br br Reception br br br Critical response br br Scream received generally positive reviews Critics such as Roger Ebert James Berardinelli and Owen Gleiberman praised Scream s meta commentary about its horror predecessors and its self referential humor while also writing that the self parody diluted any suspense and criticizing the excessive violence Some critics said that the film s intelligence and wit beneath the gore would be appreciated by sophisticated viewers but Ebert was unsure if the degree of violence was defused by the ironic way the film uses it and comments on it br Janet Maslin wrote that while Scream offered original ideas for the genre it quickly exhausted them John Hartl offered a similar sentiment believing Scream was so focused on referencing other films that it did not know when to settle down to tell a coherent story Bill Stamets considered these references insightful particularly the killers motives saying Killers without motives are far more scary br Critics such as Berardinelli Thomas and Leonard Klady wrote positively of the ensemble cast and their instrumentality in the film s success Peter Stack and Dave Kehr praised Campbell for her standout performance that successfully carried the central focus on her character portraying a tough capable heroine who avoids the damsel in distress archetype While some reviewers appreciated Cox for delivering a strong performance in an against type role others criticized her for being unconvincing as a tough and career obsessed reporter Thomas and John Hartl wrote that Arquette delivered a goofily charming performance Lisa Alspector described Ulrich as the only cast member capable of balancing genuine characterization with self parody br The film s opening sequence received praise for building tension and suspense Gleiberman and Richard Harrington appreciated the absence of gratuitous nudity in the scene which was atypical for the genre Kevin Thomas credited Irwin s resourcefulness and Lussier s razor sharp editing as key to Scream s success br br br Accolades br At the rd Saturn Awards in Scream won awards for Best Actress Campbell Best Writing Williamson and Best Horror Film

br br br Thematic analysis br br br Themes br Scream is influenced by and pays many homages to the history of the horror genre including a school janitor referencing Freddy Krueger a cameo appearance by Linda Blair famed for her appearance in The Exorcist and the killers admonishing the police for not watching Prom Night for advice In a meta reference Randy recounts the rules of the genre to survive a horror film characters cannot sin by drinking taking drugs or having sex and they cannot say I ll be right back Because you won t be back This self reference is extended when Randy Jamie Kennedy watches Halloween and yells at the lead character Laurie Jamie Lee Curtis to look behind her oblivious to the killer approaching himself from behind Further Kenny futilely yells at Randy to look behind him while observing via a remote camera When Sidney confronts Billy and Stu she says You ve seen one too many movies to which Billy replies Movies don t create psychos movies make psychos more creative Writer Kate Gardener believed this dialogue rejects the blame on horror films for inspiring real world violence Lussier said the MPAA had objected to this dialogue because you can t speak that kind of truth br Writers Adam White and Michelle Delgado wrote that Scream is an exploration of the exploitative nature of the news media using traumatic events as entertainment The debut of Scream coincided with growing discourse in the United States on the impact of on screen violence and its potential consequences for society During this time the Clinton administration introduced the V chip a device designed to enable parents to block mature television content However news programs remained exempt from the ratings system which Delgado said continued to exploit violent incidents to captivate audiences Gale portrays a relentless television reporter who used Maureen s murder to further her own career and seeks to do the same with the Woodsboro murders Although Gale advocates for the innocence of Cotton Weary in Maureen s death she does so both because she believes he is innocent and to secure a lucrative book deal While Gale s actions revolve around profiting from the suffering of others she is depicted not as a villain but a careerist and an antagonist to Sidney who evolves into a heroic figure aiding in the deaths of Billy and Stu Gardener wrote that making a living from murder is not morally equal to committing murder but that it represents the commodification of crime and female trauma Scream acknowledges the audience s voyeuristic interest in murder and horror underscoring the monetary value placed on sensationalized crimes br White described Williamson s script as emblematic of its time featuring a picture perfect mother raped and murdered in American suburbia and the stalking of her daughter one year later He compared it to contemporary sensationalized cases such as the Murder trial of O J Simpson Lorena Bobbit s assault of her husband the Long Island Lolita case and the Gainesville Ripper The Ripper s defence included his assertion of being influenced by films such as The Exorcist III Despite public concerns about the influence of violent media instances of violent crime were decreasing when Scream was released and there remained no direct link between violent media content and real life crimes Even so public fascination with these media portrayals created a form of celebrity for the victims or perpetrators with dramatic events being turned into documentaries and films In Scream Sidney jokes that a film will be made about the traumatic events of her life and in the sequels the film within a film Stab horror series is created based partly on the events of each preceding Scream entry br br br Analysis br Author Padraic Maroney wrote that Scream was pro feminism depicting several final girls who fight the killer instead of submitting The success of Scream demonstrated to studios that although typically seen as fare for young males horror films had an untapped female market Writer Aime Simon said Sidney like Craven s Nancy Thompson is allowed to develop as a character by surviving successive films The Scream films often explore female trauma through characters such as Sidney and Gale including the dangers posed by angry males who feel rejected Gardener said that although this may not have been Craven s intention the film s narrative effectively conveys this theme She continued that the male killers in Scream enact violence and intimidation primarily on women including Casey who romantically rejects Stu before the events of the film and Sidney s mother Maureen as Billy blames her for the end of his parents marriage Maureen is not responsible for his mother leaving but Billy blames her takes his anger out on her directly and then abuses Sidney s emotional vulnerability caused by her death In this way the portrayal of Billy and Stu as angry entitled men seeking revenge is more relatable and realistic than supernatural horror villains br Scream has been analyzed for homosexual or queer undertones influenced by Williamson s own experiences as a gay man He has expressed how his personal struggles informed Sidney s character because he identified parallels between her survival tactics and those of young gay individuals In a interview he said as a gay kid I related to the final girl and to her struggle because it s what one has to do to survive as a young gay kid too Subconsciously I think the Scream movies are coded in gay survival Several publications have highlighted the positive response from gay fans of the franchise to these underlying themes br Some writers such as Maroney Brant Lewis and Joe Lipsett have discussed the theory that Billy and Stu are in a homosexual relationship or that Stu held unrequited feelings for Billy Professor David Greven wrote that Billy and Stu are representative of the changing notions of masculinity and the underlying currents of queer desire in s films The interactions between them throughout the movie contain themes of homoeroticism such as when Stu playfully touches Randy s earlobe or leans on Billy during the climax before they stab each other with phallic weapons Greven believed that although it is easy to assign homosexuality to Stu because of his lack of motive to kill and apparent willingness to please his friend Billy also features homoerotic characteristics such as the gay trope of fixating on his maternal relationship similar to Norman Bates in Psycho and Billy s visual styling resembling actor James Dean considered a queer icon Williamson loosely based the characters on Leopold and Loeb queer individuals who committed murder to prove their intellectual superiority In a interview he said he was very hesitant to present the gay side of me in Scream and that any queerness in Billy s and Stu s characters was a little coded and maybe accidental br br br Legacy br br br Cultural influence br In the decades following its release Scream has remained an enduringly popular horror film and launched a successful film franchise It is credited with revitalizing the horror genre which had significantly declined in popularity by the early s Far Out and MTV described Scream as a ground breaking slasher film that successfully crossed over into the mainstream because of its deft blend of traditional horror with self aware commentary and satire Vox wrote that Scream mainstreamed metatextual storytelling and made that analytical understanding of the genre mainstream in a lot of ways Studios rushed to capitalize on Scream s success with teen centric horror films and television series leading into the s such as I Know What You Did Last Summer Urban Legend and Cherry Falls as well as sequels to popular but diminished franchises such as Halloween H Years Later and Bride of Chucky both Scream also serves as the subject of the parody film Scary Movie which in turn launched its own franchise of horror spoofs Director Jordan Peele has credited Scream as a direct inspiration for his own influential horror film Get Out in manipulating the audience s expectations of the modern horror genre br Scream helped launch or bolster the careers of its principal stars including Campbell Ulrich Lillard McGowan Kennedy and Arquette Williamson became an in demand screenwriter contributing to horror films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer and television series Dawson s Creek Scream helped revitalize Craven s career after several career setbacks and a string of poor performances Lussier credited his work on Scream s opening with his transition to director beginning with Dracula Barrymore s involvement helped raised the profile of the horror genre making it a more attractive prospect for prominent actors instead of relative unknowns In a interview Kennedy said he was still approached by fans about his horror rules monologue Lillard described Scream as a seminal moment of his career He and Campbell began a two year relationship during filming while Cox and Arquette married and eventually divorced br Scream has often been referenced in popular culture in and outside the horror genre The Ghostface killer is considered to be among the most iconic cinematic horror villains As of Lillard s improvised dialogue My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me was still quoted to him by fans br In the years since its release Scream was cited as an influence in several violent crimes and murders with perpetrators sometimes dressing as Ghostface as in the murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart Following the Columbine High School massacre in an increasing media and public scrutiny on the influence of violent films games and other media on society the United States Senate Commerce committee reviewed the marketing of films to youths specifically the horror genre Scream s opening was shown as an example of negative media which may be viewed by children The use of Caller ID to identify incoming callers also increased by following Scream s release br br br Retrospective assessments br Scream is regarded as a classic of the horror genre and among the greatest horror and slasher films ever made Several publications have also listed it among the best films of the s Williamson believed Scream s success was due in part to fitting the contemporary zeitgeist when everyone wanted to have scary and fun in their life If the movie had been released at any other time I m not sure that would ve been the case Campbell believed it connected with audiences because of a deft combination of humor horror and intelligence As of Scream remains the highest grossing film in the Scream film series and is generally considered to be the best film in the series The franchise is also among the highest grossing horror franchises alongside Halloween Saw and The Conjuring Universe br In Empire ranked the film number on its list of The Greatest Movies of All Time and Entertainment Weekly listed Scream as one of the Best High School movies and among the best films of the preceding years On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of from the aggregated reviews of critics with an average score of The consensus reads Horror icon Wes Craven s subversive deconstruction of the genre is sly witty and surprisingly effective as a slasher film itself even if it s a little too cheeky for some The film has a score of out of on Metacritic based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews The British Film Institute BFI called the opening scene one of the all time great pre credit scenes an unforgettable masterclass of building tension heart stopping terror and shocking images The scene appeared at number on Bravo s list of the Scariest Movie Moments br br br Sequels br br Due to the success of Scream development of a sequel began while the original was still in theaters Scream achieved similar financial and critical success as Scream Williamson was unavailable to write Scream the trilogy s concluding chapter and was replaced with Ehren Kruger The film fared less well than its predecessors commercially and critically and is regarded as the franchise s most divisive entry Williamson returned to the series with the reboot film Scream While Scream has grown in esteem since its release its modest box office and critical reception as well as Craven s death placed the franchise on hold br A television adaptation Scream ran for three seasons The Weinsteins refused to license the Fun World costume for the show or allow references to the films which was controversial with fans and contributed to the series low ratings poor reception and eventual cancellation br The film series was relaunched with Scream and its success led to immediate development of a sixth installment Scream VI Both films are directed by Matt Bettinelli Olpin and Tyler Gillett and written by James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick These films focus on a younger cast including Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega with Campbell Cox and Arquette appearing in supporting legacy roles Scream VI is the first film in the series to not feature Arquette or Campbell who declined to return following a dispute over pay A seventh film is in development as of with Campbell reprising her role as Sidney Prescott and Kevin Williamson directing the project br
