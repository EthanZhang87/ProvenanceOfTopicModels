Angelina Jolie Scarlett Johansson and Alicia Silverstone Rachel True and Fairuza Balk were the first to be cast in their respective roles The character of Rochelle was re written to be black when True was cast and a racism subplot was incorporated as the character s major conflict Robin Tunney was initially cast in the role of Bonnie but the producers decided she would be better in the starring role of Sarah which she was persuaded to accept despite preferring the former Neve Campbell the most well known of the four actresses for her role on Party of Five was then cast as Bonnie Tunney had shaved her head for her role in Empire Records and had to wear a wig throughout filming br Production enlisted a real life Wiccan named Pat Devin to act as an on set advisor for the film She wrote the

soundstage at Culver City Studios The occult bookstore was shot at the El Adobe Marketplace in Hollywood Boulevard The room was repainted and enhanced and occult icons such as candles stigmas religious statues masks and tribal dolls were added for effect Jensen s Recreation Center in Echo Park was chosen to avoid overuse of frequently seen Los Angeles locations During filming an unrelated accident occurred in which a child was injured the production s medic saw this and called paramedics The makeshift altar was set in Wood Ranch a location that Dobrowolski called the hardest to find Dobrowolski wanted to avoid manicured parks like Griffith Park The beach summoning took place at Leo Carrillo State Park which was chosen because its crest made it seem less visually boring br The
