would a complex David O Russell character br Writing for The Village Voice Stephanie Zacharek praised Jennifer Lawrence s performance writing that the actress is both on fire and in the process of

worth a handful of sequels And Lawrence lights up the screen You ll follow her anywhere He also commended supporting actors Sam Claflin and Jena Malone Reviewing on Roger Ebert s website Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today awarded the film three out of four stars praising the acting of Jeffrey Wright Amanda Plummer and Jena Malone and referring to the challenges of the arena as visually intriguing Wloszczyna writes the one truly fresh invention and the one that matters most is Katniss herself With each on screen chapter the poor girl from District continues to fulfill her destiny as an inspiration and a rebel fighter Ian Nathan of Empire gave the film stars out of and noted that it was even better than the first film He praised director Lawrence for taking a more muscular approach and sensibly downplaying the love triangle noting that neither Peeta nor Gale quite frankly are fit to lay a pinky on Katniss quiver One fault he did find was in Philip Seymour Hoffman s surprisingly ineffective performance br A negative review came from Sophie Monks Kaufman of Little White Lies who praised Lawrence s performance but criticized the dilution of the ingredients that made The Hunger Games so gripping She also found fault with the lumbering plot the hamminess of President Snow and Plutarch Heavensbee and the lackluster and unconvincing script culled from a dramatically difficult book David Denby of The New Yorker argued that the premise doesn t make a lot of sense He praised the impressive first act and Jennifer Lawrence for project ing the kind of strength that Katharine Hepburn had when she was young Denby found the second act attenuated and rhythmless and criticised the incoherent finale that will send the audience scurrying back to the book to find out what s supposed to be going on br br br br In July Lionsgate announced that two films based on the final book in The Hunger Games trilogy Mockingjay were scheduled to be released The first
