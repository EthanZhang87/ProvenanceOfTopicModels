Richard Ruccolo as Hank br Nathan and Nicolas Myers as Kyle Charles br br The concept of Obsessed was thought up by Clint Culpepper president of Screen Gems and was shared with David Loughery who then wrote the screenplay taking basic inspiration from the similar stalker thriller Fatal Attraction Producer William Packer read the script and signed on executive producers for the film were Glenn S Gainor Jeff Graup Earvin Magic Johnson Beyonc Mathew Knowles Damon Lee and Loughery while Nicholas Stern and George Flynn served as co producer and associate producer respectively Director Steve Shill signed on after reading the script and hearing that Beyonc was on board Part of the reason Elba joined in was that the black white theme was ignored It s not mentioned in the film it s never an issue and I think that s phenomenal To me that was very refreshing that the studio execs didn t want to make an issue of it Obsessed was allocated a production budget of million Shill stated that the intended effect of the film was to have the audience discuss the characters motivations Writer David Loughery designed Lisa as not a villain in a traditional sense she s not setting out to wreck a marriage or ruin somebody s life She really believes that Derek is in love with her Lisa s past was deliberately omitted from the film explaining It s scarier if we never really know how she s developed this personality that can go from very loving to ultimately deadly br br The casting directors for Obsessed were Ron Digman and Valorie Massalas According to Packer Elba and Zoe Saldana were the favorite actors for their respective lead roles he stated that they both brought the right amount of depth and sex appeal to the film He emphasized the need for actors who were relatable and who can handle that type of human interplay that we have in the film Packer showed the film script to Beyonc s talent agent who suggested that Beyonc play the role of Sharon The producers immediately fell in love with that idea once she suggested Beyonc nobody else could play the role Packer said that Beyonc became interested in working on Obsessed because the film was not focused on the music industry and that it was the first time she played a non singer Packer also reported that she was looking for that challenge and welcomed this opportunity Beyonc stated that she found it challenging to concentrate purely on the emotion and the psychology of the relationship Beyonc had never taken part in a fight scene but she was able to learn how to perform the scenes quickly because they were similar to dance choreography with which she was familiar Obsessed was filmed over the summer of and the final fight scene between Sharon and Lisa was shot over one week br br Shill and cinematographer Ken Seng were inspired by Roman Polanski and Alfred Hitchcock when constructing the set and attempted to make it look both frightening and suburban Shill stated It didn t look like typical Hollywood it didn t look cosmetic The Charles family home was set in a Altadena California house however the action scenes were shot on a separate purpose built set The set was customized from a house built for The Stepfather which in turn was adapted from a block of apartments for Quarantine The Charles living room had a ceiling feet m high and a custom built chandelier for the climactic ending of the film According to Gainor the house is symbolic of the family s aspirations and is intentionally too large for the three occupants he said It s a little awkward and a little bit eerie The fight scene was filmed on a sound stage set rather than in the house for safety and practicability reasons br Costume designer Maya Lieberman attempted to contrast the costumes of Sharon and Lisa to reinforce the conflict between the two characters She said With Ali our discussion started with wanting really clean classic and sharp lines whereas Beyonc s character wore more soft more textural cashmeres and knits Sharon wore clothes designed by Zac Posen Yves Saint Laurent Jimmy Choo Diane von F rstenberg Valentino Stella McCartney and Missoni while Lisa wore Gucci Dolce Gabbana and Burberry outfits Derek was dressed in Dolce Gabbana and Versace suits with Thomas Pink shirts to create a prestigious yet contemporary look br br The film score for Obsessed was written by James

toothless thriller both instantly predictable and instantly forgettable Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating generally unfavorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br A common complaint about the film was that unlike most deranged stalker themed films Obsessed did not explain why Lisa was so determined to seduce Derek who showed no interest in her at all Variety s John Anderson and The Hollywood Reporter s Kirk Honeycutt criticized Lisa s lack of motive and backstory Stella Papamichael of Digital Spy called the film predictable and blamed the well defined morality of the characters She wrote Unlike the bunny boiling s classic Fatal Attraction the characters are drawn in D They are either good or bad and there is absolutely no attempt to understand what drives them either way Liz Braun from Jam lambasted the lack of character development in Obsessed and called it a chemistry free movie Jason McKiernan of Filmcritic com described the film as so steeped in the formula of the psycho sexual suspense flick that it works as both a thriller and a comedy and very good trash br Reviewers also noted that the potential for interracial conflict remained unexplored Entertainment Weekly s Owen Gleiberman wrote The movie wants to tease us with intimations of a steamy biracial liaison it just doesn t want to actually go there Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe was disappointed that Obsessed basically plays it safe The obvious racial buttons are never pushed Greg Quill from the Toronto Star agreed and wrote that Shill and Loughery stripped the drama of its potentially gripping and obvious racial overtones However Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer pointed out that having the two female roles of differing races creates racial tension and noted similarities to the racially charged Lakeview Terrace which Loughery also wrote Braun was of the impression that a well written script was replaced by the film s racial politics When Derek confronts Lisa at the business conference she threatens him with a sexual harassment complaint Sady Doyle from The Guardian wrote that this alludes to the history of black men being lynched for their perceived threat to white women Doyle pointed out that historically white women are more revered for their beauty than black women which is a side theme of the fight between Sharon and Lisa Melissa Anderson of LA Weekly suggested that awkwardness of the interracial relationship of Derek and Lisa as a reason why the filmmakers did not have the two characters partake in any sexual activity br br Critics drew close comparisons between Obsessed and Adrian Lyne s stalker thriller Fatal Attraction However two distinctions noted were that Obsessed contains no bunny boiling like incidents and that Derek and Lisa did not actually have sexual intercourse John Anderson of Variety wrote If Derek had actually slept with Lisa a la Michael Douglas in Fatal Attraction Obsessed would at least have had the spurned woman gambit to play however hoary Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film zero out of four stars and wrote that Derek s lack of interest in Lisa allowed for no conflict in the film Travers concluded Everything you need to know is in the trailer The Daily Telegraph s Tim Robey thought that Obsessed would have been more entertaining had Lisa s character been fiercer like Alex Forrest in Fatal Attraction Rickey opined that while the lack of infidelity made the film less thrilling it is about the sanctity of marriage rather than the shame of adultery br The final fight scene between Sharon and Lisa was lauded by critics Marjorie Baumgarten from The Austin Chronicle stated that despite the predictability of its plot Obsessed caters to the American moviegoers appetite for a juicy catfight E Online s Natasha Vargas Cooper lauded the choreography and noted the scene as the highlight of the film McKiernan called it the best knock down drag out girlfight of However Alex Navarro from Screened called the fight boring because of the filming and editing of the scene br
