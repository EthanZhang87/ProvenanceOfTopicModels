book series New Moon Eclipse and Breaking Dawn On November one day after the theatrical release of Twilight Summit confirmed that they would begin working on New Moon Author Stephenie Meyer said I don t think any other author has had a more positive experience with the makers of her movie adaptation than I have had with Summit Entertainment In early December it was announced that Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke would not be returning to direct the sequel Hardwicke cited time restrictions as the reason behind her leaving the project On December it was announced that Chris Weitz had been hired to direct New Moon Weitz released a statement shortly after the announcement assuring fans that he would protect on their behalf the characters the themes and story they love He continued by saying This is not a task to be taken lightly and I will put every effort into realizing a beautiful film to stand alongside a beautiful book br Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg had been working on adapting the novel prior to Twilight s release and handed in the draft for New Moon during Twilight s opening weekend in November adding I would sit down at ten o clock in the morning and work on the script until six o clock in the evening Rosenberg spent the months of June through October alternating between writing for the Showtime television series Dexter and writing New Moon on weekends She and Meyer kept in touch during this five month period br br Due to major physical changes that occur in the character of Jacob Black between Twilight and New Moon Weitz considered replacing Taylor Lautner in the sequel with an actor who could more accurately portray the new larger Jacob Black In an attempt to keep the role Lautner weight trained extensively and gained approximately pounds In January Weitz and Summit Entertainment announced that Lautner would continue to play the role of Jacob in the sequel In an interview fellow cast member Kristen Stewart talked about Lautner s transformation saying He s an entirely different person physically br In late March Summit Entertainment released a list of the actors who would be portraying the wolf pack alongside Lautner The casting for the rest of the Quileute tribe was headed by casting director Rene Haynes who has worked on films with large Native American casts such as Dances with Wolves and Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee A casting call was also held in Vancouver in February specifically asking for any first nations aboriginal actors and actresses between the ages of and br br Pre production for New Moon began in December Principal photography was scheduled to begin on March in Vancouver but began a few days early Weitz envisioned a warm color palette for the sequel contrary to the first film in the series whose blue tones were prevalent His intention resulted in golden tones a change that was inspired by Italian paintings and ultimately served as the basis for the crew s collaborative work The approach also included the use of specific colors at certain points in the movie For example although Jacob s house is red the color does not dominate until the climax of the movie The director noted that The square becomes a flood of red that s how conscious we were of every visual aspect br The use of film rather than digital cameras added to the old fashioned nature of the production Two main Panavision cameras a high speed Arri camera capable of shooting at frames per second a Steadicam and VistaVision cameras for visual effect shots were among the equipment used to bring the book to the big screen As with the use of specific colors the different cameras and shooting setups would help serve the story points When Bella was with Edward the camera was moved on a dolly in a very rigid straight line to reflect how their relationship was perfect When Bella is with Jacob the Steadicam provides a fluid and organic style and when she is with her schoolmates a slangy visual language is reflected by a handheld br Once the film went into production the decision to shoot in Vancouver rather than in Portland came after a debate on how to match the locations that were introduced in the first film One member involved in the decision process pointed out that Vancouver had been scouted as a potential setting for Twilight and it was only because the U S dollar had at that time dropped below the Canadian dollar that Oregon drew Twilight principal photography to Portland and its surrounding areas Vancouver was chosen because it allowed a higher production value while the surrounding areas contained beautiful forests and gray weather With this decision however came the issue of reconstructing key sets that were used in the first film For the exterior of Forks High School crew members were able to find a parking lot but the school s steps needed to be filmed with a greenscreen backing to match those that were originally presented in Twilight David Thompson Secondary School would then be able to serve as the interior for the high school scenes br The Cullen house was one of the major match assignments mainly because of the Portland area location s unique design The production team agreed to find a house in the Vancouver area with an interior that emulated the high ceilings glass walls and forest surroundings of the first location One location was positively compared to the one in Portland and therefore Weitz and the production team filmed portions of the film there To keep with the design of the original house portions of the story that took place in New Moon were moved to different sections of the house that were not seen before br br After scouting Vancouver for a place to film scenes that involved the Swan house the decision was made to recreate the house on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road The production team was able to rearrange the exterior of the house to match that in the first movie When faced with creating the interior the team measured the house in Portland and built various pieces of the house on the lot and on a stage in Vancouver The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella s room which as seen in the first film seemed to be located in the front of the house when in reality it was on the right hand side Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilight s release which took away the aging the house had come to depict in the film When recreating the house the production team referenced the first film on high definition Blu ray Disc br As a director Weitz had the pleasure of introducing and filming on new locations and sets Of particular interest was the Quileute reservation and Jacob s house Using the Quileute country in Washington as a basis the production team decided to place Jacob s house on the edges of the territory rather than in the community because of Jacob s attachment to the wolves To Weitz Jacob s house was the stepping stone into the forest world where the reality of the werewolves is hidden The production designer was faced with a real world versus book world challenge when the barn they located described in the book as a red barn was green Initially bordered by a green fence the decision of painting the barn aging it and renovating the exterior proved to be a layout that fit well with Jacob s character br After scouting more than twelve possible locations to film scenes that would take place in Volterra Italy the scouting team selected the town of Montepulciano which they believe was the best representation of Meyer s description in the book Principal photography concluded with the scenes that were filmed in this area from May through the For the face off between the Volturi and Edward the idea was to have a bigger bang rather than just the paralysis of Edward Initially what was a huge battle with vampires being thrown everywhere turned into a one on one fight between Felix and Edward after receiving a stamp of approval from Meyer The idea quickly changed from the typical outlandish battle to portraying Edward as an average guy caught in the middle of a bad situation for Bella conveying the feeling of being caught in the middle of a group of vampires fighting was important as well This scene also required special effects stunt work and figuring out how to portray vampires fighting at very fast speeds br br Overseeing the visual effects department for New Moon was Susan MacLeod who had previously worked with Weitz during the production of The Golden Compass MacLeod enlisted Tippett Studio to create the computer generated wolves while Prime Focus of Vancouver handled the effects of the vampires To prepare for the aggressive task of making the wolves look real Tippet artists studied wolf culture They also were able to reflect leadership and human muscle size by adjusting certain features of the wolves such as their fat and height In February a group of artists was able to travel to Wolf Mountain Sanctuary outside of Los Angeles and see real wolves The artists were able to observe the behavior of both the timber and arctic wolves who ran in packs of three to five The idea was to give everyone a deeper feeling of the creature that they were creating br br MacLeod explained that creating the shape shifting werewolves was not an easy task The wolf work included shooting plates or photographic imagery into which CG creations are integrated Since the book described the wolves as being as big as horses full scale aluminum and board wolf cutouts were used as a visual reference for both actors and crew members Once the actors had a reference the cutouts would be removed allowing the cameras to capture the scene In order for the CG wolves to be in sync with the live action cameras and actors movements the team used match movers a land surveying tool that recorded the shooting location s topography with reference marks br A raw D model of Jacob s wolf was the basis for creating the others A muscle system which gave the appearance of muscles firing and flexing contributed to this model From there the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom They also added characteristics such as wet hair clumping together and applied it to the fur They refined this look before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors br One challenge for the production team was how to convey Bella s depression once Edward departed In the novel these pages were filled with the names of the passing months and in the movie would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around Kristen Stewart The window that was used for the original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house The effect was one of the visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli It required matching two camera shots one that shot the actress in a chair and the other shooting the view outside the window as seen from the house built on location Using a greenscreen Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer generated leaves and falling snow br br The score for New Moon was composed by Alexandre Desplat while the rest of the soundtrack was chosen by music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas who also produced the Twilight soundtrack The Twilight Saga New Moon Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on October by Patsavas s Chop Shop label in conjunction with Atlantic Records It debuted at number two on the Billboard albums chart and climbed to number one a week later after selling copies in its first full week of release br br In February it was announced that the franchise would take the name The Twilight Saga with the book s title separated by a colon though the title that appears on screen is simply New Moon The first promotional poster was released on May On May Robert Pattinson Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner revealed the film s first trailer at the MTV Movie Awards Following the release of the trailer two scenes from the film were presented at the San Diego Comic Con A second preview of the second trailer was released online on August and the full length trailer was featured before theater showings of the film Bandslam The film s third trailer

romp to please anyone The Seattle Post Intelligencer gave the film a B grading and said the movie looks tremendous the dialogue works there are numerous well placed jokes the acting is on point br Time Out New York gave the film stars out of calling it acceptable escapism for those old enough to see it yet still young enough to shriek at undead dreamboats Jordan Mintzer from Variety stated Stewart is the heart and soul of the film and added that she gives both weight and depth to dialogue that would sound like typical chick lit blather in the mouth of a less engaging actress and she makes Bella s psychological wounds seem like the real deal br British film critic Mark Kermode gave the film a positive review saying After an initial minute dip when I thought This is actually going to be two hours of mopey mopey I thought it found its feet He also excused the film s characterization of Taylor Lautner s character saying The sight of the buff young guys running through the forest with their tops off was slightly smirk inducing But it s fine They know what their target audience is br Mick Lasalle from the San Francisco Chronicle responded with a more mixed review stating E xpect this film to satisfy its fans Everybody else get ready for a bizarre soap opera pageant consisting of a succession of static scenes with characters loping into the frame to announce exactly what they re thinking Digital Spy gave the film stars out of praising Kristen Stewart for carrying the film on her shoulders and once again bringing plenty of soul to a character who might otherwise come across as self indulgent but was critical of its lack of action ultimately calling it a draining experience Roger Ebert gave the film star out of and said that it takes the tepid achievement of
