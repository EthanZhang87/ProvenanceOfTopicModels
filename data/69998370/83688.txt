br Beyonc has received co writing credits for most of her songs In regards to the way she approaches collaborative songwriting Beyonc explained I love being around great writers because I m finding that a lot of the things I want to say I don t articulate as good as maybe Amanda Ghost so I want to keep collaborating with writers and I love classics and I want to make sure years from now the song is still something that s relevant Her early songs with Destiny s Child were personally driven and female empowerment themed compositions like Independent Women and Survivor but after the start of her relationship with Jay Z she transitioned to more man tending anthems such as Cater U br Beyonc s songwriting process is also known for combining parts of different tracks resulting in alteration of

and then manager Mathew Knowles in protest over the claim In Fusari told Billboard Knowles explained to me in a nice way he said People don t want to hear about Rob Fusari producer from Livingston N J No offense but that s not what sells records What sells records is people believing that the artist is everything However in an interview for Entertainment Weekly in Fusari said Beyonc had the Bootylicious concept in her head That was totally her She knew what she wanted to say It was very urban pop angle that they were taking on the record br br br Production br I am really passionate about all of the steps during the production I love to stack vocals and I love to create my own little Oreo with arrangements sometimes it can be thousands of vocals and then I go back and then kind of piece things together because usually the songs are way too long I go back and edit the structure of the song I make sure that every section has an intention so that takes months I hear certain elements of things that go with things that are opposites I am rarely happy with one track it s usually four or five things put together that again don t really go together I am so excited when I m able to adjust the tempo and key and mute certain elements that don t complement and put opposites together Sometimes it s just like the EQ of a synth or the warmth of a bass or the distortion of a bass that s on a different song and I can hear like Ah That s exactly what is missing to make the track full and complete br Beyonc s collaborators frequently mention her talent and involvement in the record production of her songs sometimes describing her as a genius in the skill She is known to have favorite saturation and distortion plug ins intentionality about stereo imaging and concentration
