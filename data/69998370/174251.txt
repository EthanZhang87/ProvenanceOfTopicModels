Extended Edition Jackson also has another unofficial cameo as Sam s hand stepping into view when he confronts Shelob Sean Astin s daughter played Sam and Rosie s older daughter Elanor in the last scene of the film in the same scene Sarah McLeod s daughter plays their younger son Jackson s children also cameo as Gondorian extras while Christian Rivers played a Gondorian soldier guarding the Beacon Pippin lights and is later seen wounded Royd Tolkien cameos as a Ranger in Osgiliath while in the Extended Edition Howard Shore appears as a celebrating soldier at Edoras Additionally four of the designers of The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game are featured as Rohirrim at the Pelennor At the end of the film during the closing credits each cast member gets a sketched portrait morphed with the real photograph beside their name which were sketched by Alan Lee an idea suggested by Ian McKellen br br br Comparison to the source material br br As with all of Peter Jackson s movie adaptions of The Lord of the Rings many events timelines and geographic distances are compressed or simplified Most major events from the books are included though some are significantly altered Some events and details seen in the film are not found in the books br The film version of The Return of the King contains major scenes from the middle of Tolkien s The Two Towers such as the attack by Shelob and the palant r subplot as Jackson realigned events of the film to fit the timeline from the book s Appendices rather than the interlaced order of the main narrative However the plot of the second half of Book III is either completely omitted chapter The Road to Isengard or only shown in one scene chapter The Voice of Saruman Saruman s murder by Gr ma seen only in the Extended Edition is moved into the Isengard visit because of the cutting of the Scouring of the Shire br The basis of Elrond and Arwen s subplot arguing about Arwen s fate is derived from the Appendices but it is largely extended in the film as is Arwen and Elrond s relevance to the story br In the film overwhelming grief over the death of Boromir has driven Denethor to despair and he has given up any hope of defeating Sauron before Gandalf arrives in Minas Tirith Thus the muster of Gondor is absent from the film In the book he has already ordered the lighting of the beacons before Gandalf s arrival while he refuses to light them in the film and the sequence where Pippin secretly lights them himself was invented for the movie The film only hints at Denethor s use of the palant r which drives him mad information revealed in the Pyre scene which includes Shadowfax and is more violent than the book Aware of the very long distance between Rath D nen and the front of the out thrust battlement Jackson has Denethor jump off the Citadel in addition to burning himself on the Pyre one of the earliest changes br The muster of Rohan and the subplot in which the Rohirrim are aided by the primitive Dr edain during their journey to the besieged Gondor are excised from the film The Red Arrow brought by a messenger from Gondor to ask for Rohan s aid is absent owyn s presence on the battlefield is unknown to the reader until she takes off her helmet but in the film the audience is aware as it would have been difficult to have Miranda Otto playing a man When hope seems lost Gandalf comforts Pippin by telling him of the Undying Lands based on a descriptive passage in the book s final chapter br The film altered the circumstances of Th oden s death his death speech in which he names omer the new king in the book is trimmed and delivered to owyn instead of Merry with an earlier scene in the Extended Edition even implying that owyn is next in line for the throne Th oden s rallying speech To death before the initial charge in the film is spoken by omer in the book when he believes that both Th oden and owyn have been killed in combat with the Witch King br The Extended Edition presents shortened scenes from the book s chapters in the Houses of Healing The Warden the talk of Athelas the comical conversation with the herb master the woman Ioreth and her saying about a King s healing hands and the subsequent realising of Aragorn s true identity are left out altogether The romance that develops between owyn and Faramir during their recoveries in the Houses of Healing is largely cut presumably to keep the focus on Aragorn and Arwen the subplot is briefly referenced in the Extended Edition with a scene where the two hold hands br Gollum s fall into the lava of Mount Doom was rewritten for the film as the writers felt that simply having Gollum slip and fall was anticlimactic Originally an even greater deviation was planned Frodo would heroically push Gollum over the ledge to destroy him and the Ring but the production team realised that that would make it look as if Frodo was murdering Gollum Instead they had Frodo and Gollum struggle for possession of the Ring br br In addition to the absent footage from the film are the other major attacks by Sauron on various regions of Middle earth referenced only briefly in the main text of The Return of the King and expanded upon in the Appendices the invasion of Rohan by the Orcs of Moria the attacks on Lothl rien and the Woodland Realm of Thranduil by the forces of Dol Guldur and the attack on Dale and the Lonely Mountain by a force of Easterlings events hinted at in a comment by Legolas in the book br There are several changes in the Battle of the Black Gate Merry is not present there in the book Pippin does not kill a troll as he does in the novel instead Aragorn fights one the eagles fight and defeat some of the mounted Nazg l and Aragorn kills the Mouth of Sauron in the extended edition of the film but not in the book br Although the film runs for another approximately minutes after the climactic Downfall of Barad d r many following events from the book are omitted or altered in the film Aragorn s coronation takes place in form of a great ceremony in the Citadel of Minas Tirith opposed to the book where Aragorn is crowned in his tent on the Pelennor Fields before entering the city Omitted entirely are the camp at the Field of Cormallen Aragorn s business in Minas Tirith Aragorn and Arwen s wedding Galadriel and Celeborn being present at the ceremonies and their subsequent travelling along with the company Th oden s funeral at Edoras the complete journey back to the Shire with stops at Rivendell and Bree and the Scouring of the Shire which was seen by the screenwriters as anticlimactic The film also left out the character epilogues br For example Samwise Gamgee stayed in the Shire when Gandalf and Frodo went to Valinor during which time he would make changes and additions to the Red Book of Westmarch which he inherited from Frodo just as in the film in which he would add a section titled Herb Lore of The Shire which was a section on Pipeweed the plant Hobbits and other folk of Middle Earth like Gandalf would smoke through pipes as well as various poems Shortly after his contribution to the Red Book he served seven consecutive seven year terms as mayor of the Shire during which he had children with Rosie Cotton who each took the last name of Gardner after their father s planting of the Mallorn Tree that replaced the Party Tree which was destroyed during the Scouring He did however go to Valinor after Rosie died and before he did he gave the Red Book to Elinor one of his daughters br The books also expanded on Aragorn s time as king of Gondor and Arnor post reuniting and reveals that Arwen accepted a life as a mortal and died shortly after Aragorn br Merry and Pippin also returned to the Shire but unlike Sam and Frodo they didn t eventually journey to Valinor Merry inherited his father s title as Master of Buckland and despite the perils he and Pippin endured that almost cost them their lives Merry still had his adventurous spirit He also reviewed many gifts from Eomer and his sister Eowyn and helped the Hobbits learn more about lands beyond the Shire through scholarly articles He even returned to Rivendell multiple times When he and Pippin died they were buried beside their friends Aragorn and Arwen in Minas Tirith where they spent some of their final days after a stint in Rohan br Legolas and Gimli make and keep promises in the books to show the other important places to them First Gimli shows Legolas the caverns of Aglarond which Legolas is stunned by then they walk in the Fangorn Forest where they then make their way to Isengard where they bid farewell to the Fellowship after which they would each go back to their own lands with Gimli even founding a Dwarven colony in the Glittering Caves They would however reunite to help with the rebuilding and improving of Minas Tirith They would be the last of the Fellowship to sail for Valinor departing after the death of their friend Aragorn Legolas would build a ship for him and Gimli to sail to Valinor br Lastly Frodo would serve as Deputy Mayor of The Shire until a wound caused by a stab from the Witch King which flared up every year on the anniversary of said stabbing forced him to resign after which he would sail to Valinor to receive healing and peace for the rest of his days br br br Production br br The production of The Lord of the Rings series was the first where three separate entries were written and shot simultaneously excluding pick up shoots Jackson found The Return of the King the easiest of the films to make because it contained the climax of the story The Return of the King was originally the second of two planned films under Miramax from January to August and more or less in its finished structure as the first film was to end with the Battle of Helm s Deep in The Two Towers Filming took place under multiple units across New Zealand between October and December with pick up shoots for six weeks in before the film s release br br br Design br br Jackson s Middle earth was primarily designed by Alan Lee and John Howe who had earlier illustrated editions of Tolkien s books It was created by Weta Workshop who handled all the trilogy s weapons armour miniatures prosthetics and creatures the Art Department built the sets Richard Taylor headed Weta while Grant Major and Dan Hennah organised the planning and building br The city of Minas Tirith glimpsed briefly in both the previous two films is seen fully in this film and with it the Gondorian civilisation The enormous soundstage was built at Dry Creek Quarry outside Wellington from the Helm s Deep set That set s gate became Minas Tirith s second while the Hornburg exterior became that of the Extended Edition s scene where Gandalf confronts the Witch king New structures included the m tall Gate with broken and unbroken versions with a working opening and closing mechanism with its engravings inspired by the Baptistry of San Giovanni There were also four levels of streets with heraldic motifs for every house as inspired by Siena br The Citadel s exterior was in the Stone Street Studios backlot using forced perspective It contained the withered White Tree built from polystyrene by Brian Massey and the Greens Department with real branches influenced by ancient and gnarled Lebanese olive trees The interior was within a three storey former factory in Wellington its colours influenced by Charlemagne s Chapel with a throne for Denethor carved from stone and polystyrene statues of past kings The Gondorian armour is designed to represent an evolution from the N men reans of the first film s prologue with a simplified sea bird motif th century Italian and German armour served as inspiration while civilians wear silver and blacks as designed by Ngila Dickson continuing an ancient medieval Mediterranean Basin look br Minas Morgul the Staircase and Tower of Cirith Ungol as well as Shelob s Lair were designed by Howe with the Morgul road using forced perspective into a bluescreened miniature Howe s design of Minas Morgul was inspired from the experience of having a wisdom tooth pulled out in the same way the Orcs have put their twisted designs on to a former Gondorian city Cirith Ungol was based on Tolkien s design but when Richard Taylor felt it as boring it was redesigned with more tipping angles The interior set like Minas Tirith was built as a few multiple levels that numerous camera takes would suggest a larger structure br The third film introduces the enormous spider Shelob Shelob was designed in with the body based on a tunnelweb spider and the head with numerous growths selected by Peter Jackson s children from one of many sculpts Jackson himself took great joy in planning the sequence being an arachnophobe himself Shelob s Lair was inspired by sandstone and sculpted from the existing Caverns of Isengard set br The Return of the King also brings into focus the Dead Men of Dunharrow and the evil Haradrim from the south of Middle earth men who ride the m makil The Dead Men have a Celtic influence as well as lines and symmetry to reflect their morbid state while their underground city is influenced by Petra The Haradrim were highly influenced by African culture until Philippa Boyens expressed concern over the possibility of offensiveness so the finished characters instead bear influence from Kiribati in terms of weaving armour from bamboo and the Aztecs in use of jewellery Also built was a single dead m mak Other minor cultures include the Corsairs with an exotic swarthy look and the Grey Havens Elven structures adapted to stone with influence from J M W Turner paintings br br br Principal photography br The Return of the King was shot during though Astin s coverage from Gollum s attempt to separate Frodo and Sam was filmed on November when floods in Queenstown interrupted the focus on The Fellowship of the Ring Some of the earliest scenes shot for the film were in fact shot last Hobbiton home of the Hobbits was shot in January with early scenes from The Fellowship of the Ring with the exterior shot at a Matamata farm while interior scenes were shot at Stone Street Studios in Wellington shared with the Grey Havens sequence Due to the high emotions of filming the scene the cast were in despair when they were required to shoot it three times due to a continuity flaw in Sean Astin s costume and then negatives producing out of focus reels Also shared with the previous films was the Rivendell interior in May br The Battle of the Black Gate was filmed in April at the Rangipo Desert a former minefield New Zealand soldiers were hired as extras while guides were on the lookout for unexploded mines Also a cause for concern were Monaghan and Boyd s scale doubles during a charge sequence In the meantime Wood Astin and Serkis filmed at Mount Ruapehu for the Mount Doom exteriors In particular they spent two hours shooting Sam lifting Frodo on to his back with cross camera coverage br Scenes shot in June were the Paths of the Dead across various locations including Putangirua Pinnacles In July the crew shot some Shelob scenes and in August and September time was spent on the scenes in Isengard Monaghan and Boyd tried numerous takes of their entrance stressing the word weed as they smoked pipe weed Christopher Lee spent his part of his scene mostly alone though McKellen and Hill arrived on the first day for a few lines to help br Edoras exteriors were shot in October The Ride of the Rohirrim where Th oden leads the charge into the Orc army was filmed in Twizel with extras on horseback The Battle of the Pelennor Fields has more extensive use of computer generated imagery in contrast to the more extensive use of live action in the Battle of Helm s Deep in the second film Also filmed were the attempts by Faramir to recapture Osgiliath as were scenes in the city itself At this point production was very hectic with Jackson moving around ten units per day and production finally wrapped on the Minas Tirith sets as well as second units shooting parts of the siege Just as the Hobbit actors first scene was hiding from a Ringwraith under a tree their last scene was the bluescreened reaction shot of the inhabitants of Minas Tirith bowing to them br br br Pick ups br The pick ups were filmed in the Wellington studio car park with many parts of sets and blue screens used to finish off scenes which the design team had to work hours to get the right sets ready for a particular day The shoot continued for two months and became an emotional time of farewells for the cast and crew The film has the most extensive list of re shoots given for the trilogy Jackson took his time to re shoot Aragorn s coronation rushed into a single day under the supervision of second unit director Geoff Murphy on December Jackson also re shot scenes in and around Mount Doom and Th oden s death right after Bernard Hill was meant to wrap br There was also the new character of Gothmog This was a major new design addition for the film as Jackson felt the Mordor Orcs were pathetic compared to the Uruk hai of the second film after watching assembly cuts and thus Weta Workshop created grotesque new ber Orcs as antagonists for the audience to focus on Christian Rivers also redesigned the Witch king and all of his scenes were re shot because of confusion from non readers over whether or not Sauron was on the battlefield br With the positive response to Bloom Legolas was given a fight with a m mak and Howard Shore also appeared in a cameo during Legolas and Gimli s drinking game at Edoras The final scenes shot were Aragorn escaping the Skull avalanche and Frodo finishing his book The cast also received various props associated with their characters although John Rhys Davies burned his final Gimli prosthetic Viggo Mortensen headbutted the stunt team goodbye Pick ups ended on June br Scenes shot afterwards included various live action shots of Riders for the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and a reaction shot of Serkis as Gollum finally realises Frodo intends to destroy the Ring shot in Jackson s house For the Extended DVD in March Jackson created a few shots of skulls rolling over for the avalanche scene this was the final piece of footage ever shot for the trilogy and Jackson noted that it must be the first time a director had shot scenes for a film after it had already won the Oscar br br br Editing br Post production began in November with the completion of the hour assembly cut of the film that Annie Collins had been completing over and from hour dailies For example Th oden leading the charge went from minutes of takes to a finished seconds Jackson reunited with longtime collaborator Jamie Selkirk to edit the final film Like The Two Towers they would have to deal with multiple storylines and Jackson paid attention to each storyline at a time before deciding where to intercut Most importantly they spent three weeks working on the last minutes of the film for appropriate intercutting and leaving out scenes such as the Mouth of Sauron and the fates of characters like Legolas Gimli owyn and Faramir The film inherited scenes originally planned to go into the second film including the reforging of Narsil Gollum s backstory and Saruman s exit But the Saruman scene posed a structural problem killing off the second film s villain when the plot has Sauron as the main villain Despite pick ups and dubs the scene was cut causing controversy with fans and Saruman actor Christopher Lee as well as a petition to restore the scene Lee nonetheless contributed to the DVDs and was at the Copenhagen premiere although he said he would never understand the reason for the cut and his relationship with Jackson was chilly They would however later reconcile upon Lee s casting in Jackson s Hobbit films Jackson only had a lock on out of reels and had to churn out reels in weeks to help finish the film It was finally completed on November Jackson never had a chance to view the film in full due to the hectic schedule and only saw the film from beginning to end on December at the Wellington premiere according to Elijah Wood his response was yup it s good pretty good br br br Visual effects br br The Return of the King contains visual effect shots nearly three times the number from the first film and almost twice that of the second As with the two previous films Jim Rygiel served as the visual effects supervisor Visual effects work began with Alan Lee and Mark Lewis compositing various photographs of New Zealand landscape to create the digital arena of the Pelennor Fields in November Jackson and Christian Rivers used computers to plan the enormous battle up until February when the shots were shown to Weta Digital To their astonishment planned shots had gone up to and characters were now Nevertheless they pressed on soon delivering shots a week a day and as the deadline neared within the last two months often working until am br For the battle they recorded motions for the MASSIVE digital horses though deaths were animated and also had to deal with late additions in the film such as Trolls bursting through Minas Tirith s gates as well as the creatures that pull Grond to the gate and redoing a shot of two m makil omer takes down that had originally taken six months in two days On a similar note of digital creatures Shelob s head sculpture was scanned by a Canadian company for times more detail than Weta had previously been able to capture br Like the previous films there are also extensive morphs between digital doubles for the actors This time there was Sam falling off Shelob where the morph takes place as Astin hits the ground Legolas attacking a m mak required numerous transitions to and fro and Gollum s shots of him having recovered the One Ring and falling into the Crack of Doom were fully animated For the latter scene as well as the scene in which Mount Doom erupts and Frodo and Sam escape from the volcano the help of the company Next Limit Technologies and their software RealFlow was required to simulate the lava The King of the Dead is played by an actor in prosthetics and his head occasionally morphs to a more skull like digital version depending on the character s mood The Mouth of Sauron also had his mouth enlarged for unsettling effect br The Return of the King also has practical effects In the Pyre of Denethor sequence as the Steward of Gondor throws Pippin out of the Tomb John Noble threw a size double named Fon onto a prostrate Billy Boyd who immediately pushed his head into camera to complete the illusion A few burning torches were also reflected off a plate of glass and into the camera for when Gandalf s horse Shadowfax kicks Denethor onto the pyre Because of Jackson s requirement for complete representation of his fantasy world numerous miniatures were built such as scale miniature of Minas Tirith which rises m high and is m in diameter scale sections of the city were also required and the Extended Edition scene of the collapsing City of the Dead has small skulls amounting in total to a single cubic meter The miniatures team concluded in November with the Black Gate after days of shooting and the final digital effects shot done was the Ring s destruction on November br br br Sound effects br The Sound department spent the early part of the year searching for the right sounds A Tasmanian devil was used to create Shelob s shriek which in turn gave inspiration for Weta s animators while the m makil is the beginning and end of a lion roar Human screams and a donkey screech were mixed into Sauron s fall and broken glass was used for the collapsing sounds For missile trading during Minas Tirith s siege construction workers dropped actual ton stone blocks previously lifted by a construction crane Mixing began at a new studio on August although unfinished building work caused some annoyances The mixers finished on November after three months of non stop work br br br Score br br The music was composed by Howard Shore who previously composed the first two parts of the trilogy Shore watched the assembly cut of the film and had to write seven minutes of music per day to keep up with the schedule The score sees the full introduction of the Gondor theme originally heard during Boromir s speeches at the Council of Elrond in The Fellowship of the Ring and at Osgiliath in The Two Towers Extended Edition Shore also used the Gondor theme with the new ascending coda which is unique to this film in his score for the trailer of the film br The score features the London Philharmonic Orchestra London Voices the London Oratory School Schola and featured vocal soloists The score is the most expansive of the three scoring effectively the entire movie length not including additional music written for the trailer and various alternate versions released to the public It also uses the biggest forces in the series sections of the score call for two sets of timpani eight trumpets and possibly a similar increase in the size of the horn trombone and tuba section as well singers in the mixed choir with additional players for all male and all female sections over fifty in the boy choir and many instrumentalist bands playing Celtic and eastern instruments such as tin whistle or pan flute on stage or off of it One piece of music required an instrument invented and crafted especially for the film a fiddle with four pairs of strings instead of single strings br Actors Billy Boyd Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler also contributed to the film s music Boyd sings on screen as Faramir charges towards Osgiliath Mortensen sings on screen as he is crowned King and in the Extended Edition Tyler sings as Aragorn heals owyn br Ren e Fleming Ben Del Maestro Sissel Kyrkjeb and James Galway also contribute to the soundtrack as featured soloists Fleming sings as Arwen has a vision of her son and when Gollum recovers the One Ring Del Maestro sings when Gandalf lights his staff to save fleeing Gondorian soldiers from Osgiliath as the Nazg l attack and as the eagles arrive at the Black Gates Galway plays the flute and whistle as Frodo and Sam climb Mount Doom and as they return to the shire Sissel sings Asea Aranion which was originally meant to score the Houses of Healing scene The end title song Into the West was composed by Shore with lyrics by Fran Walsh Annie Lennox formerly of Eurythmics performed it and also received songwriting credit The song was partially inspired by the premature death from cancer of a young New Zealand filmmaker named Cameron Duncan who had befriended Peter Jackson br br br Release br br br Theatrical br After two years of attention and acclaim since the release of The Fellowship of the Ring audience and critical anticipation for the final entry was extremely high The world premiere was held in Wellington s Embassy Theatre on December and was attended by the director and many of the stars It was estimated that over people lined the streets more than a quarter of the city s population br br br Home media br The theatrical edition of the film was released on VHS and DVD on May The DVD was a disc set with extras on the second disc The theatrical DVD sets for the two previous films were released eight months after the films were released but Return of the King s set was completed in five because it did not have to market a sequel the previous films had to wait for footage of their sequels to become available for a ten minute preview However it contained a seven minute trailer of the entire trilogy br The Return of the King followed the precedent set by its predecessors by releasing an Extended Edition minutes on December in the UK and US with new editing and added special effects and music along with four commentaries and six hours of supplementary material The final ten minutes comprises a listing of the charter members of the official fan club who had paid for three year charter membership br A collectors box set was also released which included the Extended Set plus a sculpture of

King is a moving and satisfying conclusion to a great trilogy Metacritic which uses a weighted average gives the film a score of out of based on reviews indicating universal acclaim Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of A on an A to F scale the highest grade in the trilogy br Alan Morrison of Empire gave the film a perfect score of five stars In his review he called the film the resounding climax to a landmark in cinema history and praised how Peter Jackson had kept the momentum of the series rolling on and on through the traditionally difficult middle part and weak finale delivering a climax to the story that s neater and more affecting than what Tolkien managed on the printed page Morrison also mentioned how fans of the films who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay off as well as the action peaks and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll Elvis Mitchell for The New York Times lauded the acting the craft of the technical crew and Jackson s direction describing The Return of the King as a meticulous and prodigious vision made by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special effects imagery Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four saying that it is such a crowning achievement such a visionary use of all the tools of special effects such a pure spectacle that it can be enjoyed even by those who have not seen the first two films Talking about the whole trilogy Ebert said that he admired it more as a whole than in its parts and that The Return of the King certified The Lord of the Rings as a work of bold ambition in a time of cinematic timidity In his review for The Times James Christopher praised The Return of the King as everything a Ring fan could possibly wish for and much more and described The Lord of the Rings as the greatest film trilogy ever mounted with some of the most amazing action sequences committed to celluloid Nev Pierce for the BBC gave the film five stars out of five judging it to be the best chapter of the trilogy since it combined the ooh factor of Fellowship with the zippy action of Towers Pierce described The Return of the King as Majestic moving and immense and an astonishing piece of storytelling Philip French reviewing it for The Observer lauded the narrative force the battle scenes the language and the visual style of the film which he related to the swirling battle paintings of Albrecht Altdorfer and Claude Lorrain s elegiac paintings of maritime departures inspired by classical poets French wrote about the whole trilogy Jackson s Lord of the Rings is indeed a very fine achievement moving involving and to many people even inspiring It redeems the debased cinematic notion of the epic br In her review for Entertainment Weekly Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film an A grade and wrote The conclusion of Peter Jackson s masterwork is passionate and literate detailed and expansive and it s conceived with a risk taking flair for old fashioned movie magic at its most precious as he has done throughout the director paces scenes of action intimacy and even panoramic geographical grandeur with the control of a superb choreographer Schwarzbaum also said of the whole series I can t think of another film trilogy that ends in such glory or another monumental work of sustained storytelling that surges ahead with so much inventiveness and ardor Richard Corliss of Time named The Return of the King the best film of the year and described the whole trilogy as The film event of the millennium Joe Morgenstern for The Wall Street Journal wrote Never has a filmmaker aimed higher or achieved more The third and last installment of the screen epic based on J R R Tolkien s literary classic redefines steeply upward the very notion of a major motion picture Peter Bradshaw who had been less enthusiastic about the first two chapters of the trilogy gave The Return of the King four stars out of five in his review for The Guardian commenting I started the series an atheist and finished an agnostic Bradshaw wrote of the film Technically it really is superb and commented Hours after watching the film I can close my eyes and see those incredible battle scenes pulsing and throbbing in my skull Maybe Kurosawa s battles will one day be described as proto Jacksonian br Some critics had negative opinions of the film Tom Charity observes in Time Out Some story strands are crudely abbreviated others fail to develop elements that were already well established Given the inordinate running time it s hard to avoid the feeling that we ve already been here done this Jonathan Romney noted in The Independent T here s something not quite palatable about all these intrepid largely beautiful Europeans boldly fending off the nameless numberless hordes from the other side of the world legions of dark skinned sans culottes with tribal drums Aside from this there s plenty to be offended by on an aesthetic level the film s self important solemnity its hyperbolic over insistence T here are no empty spaces no gaps for thought no real stimulus to the viewer s imagination The film has no idea when to stop either with its multiple codas and final dying fall into beatific cosiness And Antonia Quirke in the Evening Standard opined Viggo Mortensen s Aragorn is the good king of the title and while the actor may look fetching in a crown and cloak he doesn t have half of the gravitas of Sean Bean s Boromir in the first film Director Peter Jackson has been all but deified for his work on this particular ring cycle but there is not much personality behind the camera here merely rampant enthusiasm br The most common criticism of The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King was its running time particularly the epilogue even rave reviews for the film commented on its length Joel Siegel of Good Morning America said in his review for the film which he gave an A If it didn t take forty five minutes to end it d be my best picture of the year As it is it s just one of the great achievements in film history br In February a few months following release the film was voted eighth on Empire s Greatest Movies of All Time compiled from readers top ten lists This forced the magazine to abandon its policy of only
