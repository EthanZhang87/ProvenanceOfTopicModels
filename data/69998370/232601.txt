id: 232601
In a dramatic production an ensemble cast is one that comprises many principal actors and performers who are typically assigned roughly equal amounts of screen time The term is also used interchangeably to refer to a production typically film with a large cast or a cast with several prominent performers br br br Structure br In contrast to the popular model which gives precedence to a sole protagonist an ensemble cast leans more towards a sense of collectivity and community br br br Cinema br br Ensemble casts in film were introduced as early as September with D W Griffith s silent epic film Intolerance featuring four separate though parallel plots The film follows the lives of several characters over hundreds of years across different cultures and time periods The unification of different plot lines and character arcs is a key characteristic of ensemble casting in film whether it is a location event or an overarching theme that ties the film and characters together br Films that feature ensembles tend to emphasize the interconnectivity of the characters even when the characters are strangers to one another The interconnectivity is often shown to the audience through examples of the six degrees of separation theory and allows them to navigate through plot lines using cognitive mapping Examples of this method where the six degrees of separation is evident in films with an ensemble cast are in productions such as Love Actually Crash and Babel which all have strong underlying themes interwoven within the plots that unify each film br The Avengers X Men and Justice League are three examples of ensemble casts in the superhero genre Those three films all focus on teams of five or more protagonists instead of the standard one or two central protagonists Referential acting is a key factor in executing this balance as ensemble cast members play off each other rather than off reality br Hollywood movies with ensemble casts tend to use numerous actors of high renown and or prestige instead of one or two big stars and a lesser known supporting cast Filmmakers known for their use of ensemble casts include Quentin Tarantino Wes Anderson and Paul Thomas Anderson among others br br br Television br Ensemble casting also became more popular in television series because it allows flexibility for writers to focus on different characters in different episodes In addition the departure of players is less disruptive than would be the case with a regularly structured cast The television series The Golden Girls and Friends are archetypal examples of ensemble casts in American sitcoms The science fiction mystery drama Lost features an ensemble cast Ensemble casts of or more actors are common in soap operas a genre that relies heavily on the character development of the ensemble The genre also requires continuous expansion of the cast as the series progresses with soap operas such as General Hospital Days of Our Lives The Young and The Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful staying on air for decades br An example of a success for television in ensemble casting is the Emmy Award winning HBO series Game of Thrones The fantasy series features one of the largest ensemble casts on the small screen The series is notorious for major character deaths resulting in constant changes within the ensemble br Ensemble casts are also very common in children s television Unlike in other television genres children s shows make heavy use of non human characters such as animals dragons aliens usually Martians space cadets monsters fish and other marine creatures fairies superheroes many of which are non human ancient and martial arts warriors imaginary friends ninjas land air and aquatic vehicles vampires witches mummies zombies franken people pirates cowboys secret agents insects robots dinosaurs furry creatures puppets androids humanoids detectives mutants and even human animal hybrids among other non human creatures The casting process is only involved when there is an occasion of humans interacting with non human characters for the non human characters creation is usually from scratch by a team of writers then their sketches are sent to the creators for approval in animated series the characters are entirely created by writers except for comic book and story book based shows as there is usually no need for creating new characters though some are adapted to television audiences and not counting voice actors there was no need for any casting processes the Muppets that were intended for Sesame Street and
