but denied any intent to make it A seventh entry in the Skywalker Saga a nine part Star Wars series began development shortly after Lucas sold his production company Lucasfilm to the Walt Disney Company in October Speaking alongside Lucasfilm s new president Kathleen Kennedy Lucas said I always said I wasn t going to do any more and that s true because I m not going to do any more but that doesn t mean I m unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more br As creative consultant on the film Lucas attended early story meetings and advised on the details of the Star Wars universe Among the materials he turned over to the production team were his rough story treatments for Episodes VII IX which Lucas requested be read only by Kennedy Bob Iger Alan F Horn and Kevin A Mayer Lucas later said Disney had discarded his story ideas and that he had no further involvement with the film Lucas son Jett told The Guardian that his father was very torn about having sold the rights to the franchise and that his father was there to guide but that he wants to let it go and become its new generation br br The Force Awakens first screenplay was written by Michael Arndt At the time of his hiring Arndt was also tapped to pen story treatments for the following installments Arndt took part in a writers room with Simon Kinberg Lawrence Kasdan Pablo Hidalgo and Kiri Hart to discuss and plan the overall trilogy Early drafts had Luke Skywalker appear midway through the film but Arndt found that every time Luke came in and entered the movie he just took it over Suddenly you didn t care about your main character anymore The writers decided to use Luke as the film s MacGuffin and as something that the protagonists needed to find would not appear in person until the final scene Arndt also developed some backstory elements for the returning characters from the original trilogy such as how Leia was instrumental in rebuilding the Republic after the fall of the Empire before being discredited when it was publicly revealed that her biological father was Darth Vader this would go on to become a central plot point in the canonical novel Star Wars Bloodline br Several directors were considered including David Fincher Brad Bird Jon Favreau and Guillermo del Toro Bird was reportedly the top choice to helm the film but his commitments to Tomorrowland forced him to withdraw Matthew Vaughn was an early candidate for the job even dropping out of X Men Days of Future Past in favor for the film Colin Trevorrow was also under consideration by the studio while Ben Affleck and Neill Blomkamp passed on the project After a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy J J Abrams was named director in January with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants Kasdan worked to convince Abrams to direct the film after the filmmaker initially rejected the offer Arndt worked on the script for eight months but said he needed more which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him The production announced Arndt s exit from the project on October That same day Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties both of whom planned the story while walking in Santa Monica California New York City Paris and London The first draft was completed in six weeks Abrams said the key to the film was that it return to the roots of the first Star Wars films and be based more on emotion than explanation In January Abrams confirmed that the script was complete In April Lucasfilm clarified that Episodes VII IX would not feature storylines from the Star Wars expanded universe though other elements could be included as with the TV series Star Wars Rebels br Abrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from The Force Awakens such as Rey and Finn s last names and backgrounds Kennedy admitted that we haven t mapped out every single detail of the sequel trilogy yet but said that Abrams was collaborating with The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson and that Johnson would work with The Rise of Skywalker s then director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition and that everybody s got a say in how we move forward with this Daisy Ridley later recounted that J J Abrams had written drafts for episodes and br A fictional language was developed for use in the film by YouTube star Sara Forsberg who created the viral video series What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners Forsberg developed the language by studying various languages such as Hindi and Gujarati br In November Lucas recorded an hour long interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose in which he said Disney had not been keen to involve him and conceded If I get in there I m just going to cause trouble because they re not going to do what I want them to do and I don t have the control to do that any more and all it would do is just muck everything up He also said They wanted to do a retro movie I don t like that Every movie I worked very hard to make them different I made them completely different different planets different spaceships to make it new In early December Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and liked it In the same month at the Kennedy Center Honors Lucas stated I think the fans are going to love it It s very much the kind of movie they ve been looking for Abrams felt that as the first in a new trilogy the film

that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical traditional special effects saying I think people are coming back around to practical effects It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick Abrams intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars To that end the droid BB was a physical prop developed by Disney Research created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors The Holochess sequence was created using stop motion which
