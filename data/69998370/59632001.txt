Hollywood Critics Association In Hollywood Critics Association ceased operations and a new organization called Hollywood Creative Alliance took its place with its awards called the Astra Awards br br br History br Los Angeles Online Film Critics Society br In Scott Menzel Scott Mantz and Ashley Menzel noted that Los Angeles only had one film critic organization They founded the Los Angeles Online Film Critics Society to be a critics group that is diverse and supports underrepresented voices The group originally separated directing honors by gender There has been so much conversation about the power of female filmmakers and we wanted to embrace it said Scott Mantz br In early the organization had a film discussion podcast called Film Critics Weekly on the defunct online broadcasting network Popcorn Talk br Hollywood Critics Association br In the organization rebranded as Hollywood Critics Association br On January the Critics Choice Association reached out to its membership on advice of legal counsel after deeming it unacceptable for CCA members to also retain membership in another critics group known as the Hollywood Critics Association The letter continued by stating The CCA will be protecting its rights in this matter At this time you have the opportunity to choose to remain in the CCA Simply confirm that you choose to do so and that you have resigned from HCA And when it changes the offending name to something that reflects its laudable mission you can freely rejoin at that time while remaining a CCA member in good standing br On May the organization organized a Film Television Triviathon to collect funds for COVID recovery br On August The Hollywood Critics Association partnered with Petco Love and Big Love Animal Rescue to turn their television awards ceremonies into a two night rescue animal adoption event We hope to shine a spotlight on shelter dogs and help a few of them find their forever homes adds HCA Co Founder Ashley Menzel When you rescue a dog they are forever grateful Dogs know you saved them and they share their love unconditionally every single day We are so glad to be hosting this adoption event as it is a cause that is very near and dear to

the organization changed its name to Hollywood Creative Alliance with the guidance of corporate operation strategist Leslie Short of the Cavu Group Under Short s instruction the HCA was reformed as a c membership based non profit organization br On January The Hollywood Reporter reported that the board of the Critics Choice Association CCA enacted a new policy that prohibited members of the HCA from maintaining their membership in the CCA The CCA board explained in a message the reason CCA has taken this action is that we have evidence that a representative of the HCA has improperly suggested to at least one studio and we suspect more that it could influence Critics Choice Awards voting in a way that led that studio to reach out to CCA and request that action be taken to protect the integrity of our awards the message reads Of course that HCA threat was empty but CCA cannot ignore this As a result if members wish to remain a part of the CCA they had to inform them that they have successfully resigned from the HCA br On January the HCA issued a statement responding to Critics Choice Association s new policy The recent statement made by the Critics Choice Association CCA regarding the Hollywood Creative Alliance HCA is factually inaccurate At no time have we tried to influence the awards votes of our members or make any suggestion to talent or studios that we would or could exercise such influence During our awards outreach to studios networks and personal representatives we presented an opportunity to have their talent attend and or present at our ceremonies During these conversations we acknowledged that our awards ceremonies took place during a key voting period for various organizations and noted that several of our members belonged to several guilds and organizations ones that we champion and support br On January The Hollywood Reporter reported that on January HCA founder Scott Menzel sent an email declaring It s important to note to ALL TALENT that the Critics Choice voting opens this weekend and there are about members who are part of both groups I really would hammer that point home because it could be a make or break for a lot of people He also highlighted other organizations saying there are several other members who are in BAFTA SAG and the Academy br On January Variety revealed that the HCA is suing the Critics Choice Association for defamation in response to the org s recent call for members to resign from the HCA in order to stay members of the CCA On the same day The Wrap noted that the lawsuit accuses CCA of trade libel
