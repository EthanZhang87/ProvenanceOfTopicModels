id: 23572
In mathematics especially order theory a partial order on a set is an arrangement such that for certain pairs of elements one precedes the other The word partial is used to indicate that not every pair of elements needs to be comparable that is there may be pairs for which neither element precedes the other Partial orders thus generalize total orders in which every pair is comparable br Formally a partial order is a homogeneous binary relation that is reflexive antisymmetric and transitive A partially ordered set poset for short is an ordered pair br br br br P br br br X br br br br br br displaystyle P X leq br br consisting of a set br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br called the ground set of br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br and a partial order br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br on br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br When the meaning is clear from context and there is no ambiguity about the partial order the set br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br itself is sometimes called a poset br br br Partial order relations br The term partial order usually refers to the reflexive partial order relations referred to in this article as non strict partial orders However some authors use the term for the other common type of partial order relations the irreflexive partial order relations also called strict partial orders Strict and non strict partial orders can be put into a one to one correspondence so for every strict partial order there is a unique corresponding non strict partial order and vice versa br br br Partial orders br A reflexive weak or non strict partial order commonly referred to simply as a partial order is a homogeneous relation on a set br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br that is reflexive antisymmetric and transitive That is for all br br br br a br br b br br c br br P br br br br displaystyle a b c in P br br it must satisfy br br Reflexivity br br br br a br br a br br br displaystyle a leq a br br i e every element is related to itself br Antisymmetry if br br br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a leq b br br and br br br br b br br a br br br displaystyle b leq a br br then br br br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a b br br i e no two distinct elements precede each other br Transitivity if br br br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a leq b br br and br br br br b br br c br br br displaystyle b leq c br br then br br br br a br br c br br br displaystyle a leq c br br br A non strict partial order is also known as an antisymmetric preorder br br br Strict partial orders br An irreflexive strong or strict partial order is a homogeneous relation on a set br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br that is irreflexive asymmetric and transitive that is it satisfies the following conditions for all br br br br a br br b br br c br br P br br br br displaystyle a b c in P br br br Irreflexivity br br br br br br br br a br br a br br br br br br displaystyle neg left a a right br br i e no element is related to itself also called anti reflexive br Asymmetry if br br br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a b br br then not br br br br b br br a br br br displaystyle b a br br br Transitivity if br br br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a b br br and br br br br b br br c br br br displaystyle b c br br then br br br br a br br c br br br displaystyle a c br br br Irreflexivity and transitivity together imply asymmetry Also asymmetry implies irreflexivity In other words a transitive relation is asymmetric if and only if it is irreflexive So the definition is the same if it omits either irreflexivity or asymmetry but not both br A strict partial order is also known as an asymmetric strict preorder br br br Correspondence of strict and non strict partial order relations br br Strict and non strict partial orders on a set br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br are closely related A non strict partial order br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br may be converted to a strict partial order by removing all relationships of the form br br br br a br br a br br br br displaystyle a leq a br br that is the strict partial order is the set br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br P br br br br br displaystyle leq setminus Delta P br br where br br br br br br br P br br br br br br p br br p br br br p br br P br br br br displaystyle Delta P p p p in P br br is the identity relation on br br br br P br br P br br br displaystyle P times P br br and br br br br br br br br br displaystyle setminus br br denotes set subtraction Conversely a strict partial order on br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br may be converted to a non strict partial order by adjoining all relationships of that form that is br br br br br br br br br br br P br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle leq Delta P cup br br is a non strict partial order Thus if br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br is a non strict partial order then the corresponding strict partial order is the irreflexive kernel given by br br br br br a br br b br br if br br a br br b br br and br br a br br b br br br br displaystyle a b text if a leq b text and a neq b br br br Conversely if is a strict partial order then the corresponding non strict partial order br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br is the reflexive closure given by br br br br br a br br b br br if br br a br br b br br or br br a br br b br br br br displaystyle a leq b text if a b text or a b br br br br Dual orders br br The dual or opposite br br br br br R br br op br br br br br displaystyle R text op br br of a partial order relation br br br br R br br br displaystyle R br br is defined by letting br br br br br R br br op br br br br br displaystyle R text op br br be the converse relation of br br br br R br br br displaystyle R br br i e br br br br x br br R br br op br br br y br br br displaystyle xR text op y br br if and only if br br br br y br R br x br br br displaystyle yRx br br The dual of a non strict partial order is a non strict partial order and the dual of a strict partial order is a strict partial order The dual of a dual of a relation is the original relation br br br Notation br Given a set br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br and a partial order relation typically the non strict partial order br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br we may uniquely extend our notation to define four partial order relations br br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle geq br br and br br br br br br br displaystyle br br where br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br is a non strict partial order relation on br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br is the associated strict partial order relation on br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br the irreflexive kernel of br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br br br br br br br br displaystyle geq br br is the dual of br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br and br br br br br br br displaystyle br br is the dual of br br br br br br br displaystyle br br Strictly speaking the term partially ordered set refers to a set with all of these relations defined appropriately But practically one need only consider a single relation br br br br br P br br br br br br displaystyle P leq br br or br br br br br P br br br br br br displaystyle P br br or in rare instances the non strict and strict relations together br br br br br P br br br br br br br br displaystyle P leq br br br The term ordered set is sometimes used as a shorthand for partially ordered set as long as it is clear from the context that no other kind of order is meant In particular totally ordered sets can also be referred to as ordered sets especially in areas where these structures are more common than posets Some authors use different symbols than br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br such as br br br br br br br displaystyle sqsubseteq br br or br br br br br br br displaystyle preceq br br to distinguish partial orders from total orders br When referring to partial orders br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br should not be taken as the complement of br br br br br br br displaystyle br br The relation br br br br br br br displaystyle br br is the converse of the irreflexive kernel of br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br which is always a subset of the complement of br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br but br br br br br br br displaystyle br br is equal to the complement of br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br if and only if br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br is a total order br br br Alternative definitions br Another way of defining a partial order found in computer science is via a notion of comparison Specifically given br br br br br br br br br br br and br br br br br displaystyle leq geq text and br br as defined previously it can be observed that two elements x and y may stand in any of four mutually exclusive relationships to each other either x y or x y or x y or x and y are incomparable This can be represented by a function br br br br br compare br br br P br br P br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle text compare P times P to vert br br that returns one of four codes when given two elements This definition is equivalent to a partial order on a setoid where equality is taken to be a defined equivalence relation rather than set equality br Wallis defines a more general notion of a partial order relation as any homogeneous relation that is transitive and antisymmetric This includes both reflexive and irreflexive partial orders as subtypes br A finite poset can be visualized through its Hasse diagram Specifically taking a strict partial order relation br br br br br P br br br br br br displaystyle P br br a directed acyclic graph DAG may be constructed by taking each element of br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br to be a node and each element of br br br br br br br displaystyle br br to be an edge The transitive reduction of this DAG is then the Hasse diagram Similarly this process can be reversed to construct strict partial orders from certain DAGs In contrast the graph associated to a non strict partial order has self loops at every node and therefore is not a DAG when a non strict order is said to be depicted by a Hasse diagram actually the corresponding strict order is shown br br br Examples br br Standard examples of posets arising in mathematics include br br The real numbers or in general any totally ordered set ordered by the standard less than or equal relation is a partial order br On the real numbers br br br br br R br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br the usual less than relation is a strict partial order The same is also true of the usual greater than relation on br br br br br R br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br br By definition every strict weak order is a strict partial order br The set of subsets of a given set its power set ordered by inclusion see Fig Similarly the set of sequences ordered by subsequence and the set of strings ordered by substring br The set of natural numbers equipped with the relation of divisibility see Fig and Fig br The vertex set of a directed acyclic graph ordered by reachability br The set of subspaces of a vector space ordered by inclusion br For a partially ordered set P the sequence space containing all sequences of elements from P where sequence a precedes sequence b if every item in a precedes the corresponding item in b Formally br br br br br br br br a br br n br br

componentwise order br For a set X and a partially ordered set P the function space containing all functions from X to P where f g if and only if f x g x for all br br br br x br br X br br br br

relativity where for two events X and Y X Y if and only if Y is in the future light cone of X An event Y can be causally affected by X only if X Y br One familiar example of a partially ordered set is a collection of people ordered by genealogical descendancy Some pairs of people bear the descendant ancestor relationship but other pairs of people are incomparable with neither being a descendant of the other br br br Orders on the Cartesian product of partially ordered sets br br In order of increasing strength i e decreasing sets of pairs three of the possible partial orders on the Cartesian product of two partially ordered sets are see Fig br br the lexicographical order a b c d if a c or a c and b d br the product order a b c d if a c and b d br the reflexive closure of the direct product of the corresponding strict orders a b c d if a c and b d or a c and b d br All three can similarly be defined for the Cartesian product of more than two sets br Applied to ordered vector spaces over the same field the result is in each case also an ordered vector space br See also orders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets br br br Sums of partially ordered sets br br Another way to combine two disjoint posets is the ordinal sum or linear sum Z X Y defined on the union of the underlying sets X and Y by the order a Z b if and only if br br a b X with a X b or br a b Y with a Y b or br a X and b Y br If two posets are well ordered then so is their ordinal sum br Series parallel partial orders are formed from the ordinal sum operation in this context called series composition and another operation called parallel composition Parallel composition is the disjoint union of two partially ordered sets with no order relation between elements of one set and elements of the other set br br br Derived notions br The examples use the poset br br br br br br br P br br br br br x br br y br br z br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathcal P x y z subseteq br br consisting of the set of all subsets of a three element set br br br br br x br br y br br z br br br br br displaystyle x y z br br ordered by set inclusion see Fig br br a is related to b when a b This does not imply that b is also related to a because the relation need not be symmetric For example br br br br br x br br br br displaystyle x br br is related to br br br br br x br br y br br br br br displaystyle x y br br but not the reverse br a and b are comparable if a b or b a Otherwise they are incomparable For example br br br br br x br br br br displaystyle x br br and br br br br br x br br y br br z br br br br displaystyle x y z br br are comparable while br br br br br x br br br br displaystyle x br br and br br br br br y br br br br displaystyle y br br are not br A total order or linear order is a partial order under which every pair of elements is comparable i e trichotomy holds For example the natural numbers with their standard order br A chain is a subset of a poset that is a totally ordered set For example br br br br br br br br br br x br br br br x br br y br br z br br br br br displaystyle x x y z br br is a chain br An antichain is a subset of a poset in which no two distinct elements are comparable For example the set of singletons br br br br br br x br br br br y br br br br z br br br br br br displaystyle x y z br br br An element a is said to be strictly less than an element b if a b and br br br br a br br b br br br br displaystyle a neq b br br For example br br br br br x br br br br displaystyle x br br is strictly less than br br br br br x br br y br br br br br displaystyle x y br br br An element a is said to be covered by another element b written a b or a b if a is strictly less than b and no third element c fits between them formally if both a b and br br br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a neq b br br are true and a c b is false for each c with br br br br a br br c br br b br br br br displaystyle a neq c neq b br br Using the strict order the relation a b can be equivalently rephrased as a b but not a c b for any c For example br br br br br x br br br br displaystyle x br br is covered by br br br br br x br br z br br br br br displaystyle x z br br but is not covered by br br br br br x br br y br br z br br br br br displaystyle x y z br br br br Extrema br br There are several notions of greatest and least element in a poset br br br br P br br br br displaystyle P br br notably br br Greatest element and least element An element br br br br g br br P br br br displaystyle g in P br br is a greatest element if br br br br a br br g br br br displaystyle a leq g br br for every element br br br br a br br P br br br br displaystyle a in P br br An element br br br br m br br P br br br displaystyle m in P br br is a least element if br br br br m br br a br br br displaystyle m leq a br br for every element br br br br a br br P br br br br displaystyle a in P br br A poset can only have one greatest or least element In our running example the set br br br br br x br br y br br z br br br br displaystyle x y z br br is the greatest element and br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br is the least br Maximal elements and minimal elements An element br br br br g br br P br br br displaystyle g in P br br is a maximal element if there is no element br br br br a br br P br br br displaystyle a in P br br such that br br br br a br br g br br br br displaystyle a g br br Similarly an element br br br br m br br P br br br displaystyle m in P br br is a minimal element if there is no element br br br br a br br P br br br displaystyle a in P br br such that br br br br a br br m br br br br displaystyle a m br br If a poset has a greatest element it must be the unique maximal element but otherwise there can be more than one maximal element and similarly for least elements and minimal elements In our running example br br br br br x br br y br br z br br br br displaystyle x y z br br and br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br are the maximal and minimal elements Removing these there are maximal elements and minimal elements see Fig br Upper and lower bounds For a subset A of P an element x in P is an upper bound of A if a x for each element a in A In particular x need not be in A to be an upper bound of A Similarly an element x in P is a lower bound of A if a x for each element a in A A greatest element of P is an upper bound of P itself and a least element is a lower bound of P In our example the set br br br br br x br br y br br br br displaystyle x y br br is an upper bound for the collection of elements br br br br br br x br br br br y br br br br br br displaystyle x y br br br As another example consider the positive integers ordered by divisibility is a least element as it divides all other elements on the other hand this poset does not have a greatest element This partially ordered set does not even have any maximal elements since any g divides for instance g which is distinct from it so g is not maximal If the number is excluded while keeping divisibility as ordering on the elements greater than then the resulting poset does not have a least element but any prime number is a minimal element for it In this poset is an upper bound though not a least upper bound of the subset br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br which does not have any lower bound since is not in the poset on the other hand is a lower bound of the subset of powers of which does not have any upper bound If the number is included this will be the greatest element since this is a multiple of every integer see Fig br br br Mappings between partially ordered sets br br Given two partially ordered sets S and T a function br br br br f br br S br br T br br br displaystyle f S to T br br is called order preserving or monotone or isotone if for all br br br br x br br y br br S br br br br displaystyle x y in S br br br br br br x br br y br br br displaystyle x leq y br br implies f x f y br If U is also a partially ordered set and both br br br br f br br S br br T br br br displaystyle f S to T br br and br br br br g br br T br br U br br br displaystyle g T to U br br are order preserving their composition br br br br g br br f br br S br br U br br br displaystyle g circ f S to U br br is order preserving too br A function br br br br f br br S br br T br br br displaystyle f S to T br br is called order reflecting if for all br br br br x br br y br br S br br br br displaystyle x y in S br br f x f y implies br br br br x br br y br br br br displaystyle x leq y br br br If f is both order preserving and order reflecting then it is called an order embedding of S into T br In the latter case f is necessarily injective since br br br br f br br x br br br f br br y br br br br displaystyle f x f y br br implies br br br br x br br y br br and br br y br br x br br br displaystyle x leq y text and y leq x br br and in turn br br br br x br br y br br br displaystyle x y br br according to the antisymmetry of br br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br If an order embedding between two posets S and T exists one says that S can be embedded into T If an order embedding br br br br f br br S br br T br br br displaystyle f S to T br br is bijective it is called an order isomorphism and the partial orders S and T are said to be isomorphic Isomorphic orders have structurally similar Hasse diagrams see Fig a It can be shown that if order preserving maps br br br br f br br S br br T br br br displaystyle f S to T br br and br br br br g br br T br br U br br br displaystyle g T to U br br exist such that br br br br g br br f br br br displaystyle g circ f br br and br br br br f br br g br br br displaystyle f circ g br br yields the identity function on S and T respectively then S and T are order isomorphic br For example a mapping br br br br f br br br N br br br br P br br br br N br br br br br displaystyle f mathbb N to mathbb P mathbb N br br from the set of natural numbers ordered by divisibility to the power set of natural numbers ordered by set inclusion can be defined by taking each number to the set of its prime divisors It is order preserving if x divides y then each prime divisor of x is also a prime divisor of y However it is neither injective since it maps both and to br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br nor order reflecting since does not divide Taking instead each number to the set of its prime power divisors defines a map br br br br g br br br N br br br br P br br br br N br br br br br displaystyle g mathbb N to mathbb P mathbb N br br that is order preserving order reflecting and hence an order embedding It is not an order isomorphism since it for instance does not map any number to the set br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br but it can be made one by restricting its codomain to br br br br g br br br N br br br br br br displaystyle g mathbb N br br Fig b shows a subset of br br br br br N br br br br displaystyle mathbb N br br and its isomorphic image under g The construction of such an order isomorphism into a power set can be generalized to a wide class of partial orders called distributive lattices see Birkhoff s representation theorem br br br Number of partial orders br Sequence A in OEIS gives the number of partial orders on a set of n labeled elements br br Note that S n k refers to Stirling numbers of the second kind br The number of strict partial orders is the same as that of partial orders br If the count is made only up to isomorphism the sequence sequence A in the OEIS is obtained br br br Subposets br A poset br br br br br P br br br br br br br br X br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle P X leq br br is called a subposet of another poset br br br br P br br br X br br br br br br displaystyle P X leq br br provided that br br br br br X br br br br br br br displaystyle X br br is a subset of br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br and br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br is a subset of br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br The latter condition is equivalent to the requirement that for any br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br and br br br br y br br br displaystyle y br br in br br br br br X br br br br br br br displaystyle X br br and thus also in br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br if br br br br x br br br br br br br y br br br displaystyle x leq y br br then br br br br x br br y br br br displaystyle x leq y br br br If br br br br br P br br br br br br br displaystyle P br br is a subposet of br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br and furthermore for all br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br and br br br br y br br br displaystyle y br br in br br br br br X br br br br br br br displaystyle X br br whenever br br br br x br br y br br br displaystyle x leq y br br we also have br br br br x br br br br br br br y br br br displaystyle x leq y br br then we call br br br br br P br br br br br br br displaystyle P br br the subposet of br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br induced by br br br br br X br br br br br br br displaystyle X br br and write br br br br br P br br br br br br P br br br X br br br br br br br br displaystyle P P X br br br br br Linear extension br A partial order br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br on a set br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br is called an extension of another partial order br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br on br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br provided that for all elements br br br br x br br y br br X br br br br displaystyle x y in X br br whenever br br br br x br br y br br br br displaystyle x leq y br br it is also the case that br br br br x br br br br br br br y br br br br displaystyle x leq y br br A linear extension is an extension that is also a linear that is total order As a classic example the lexicographic order of totally ordered sets is a linear extension of their product order Every partial order can be extended to a total order order extension principle br In computer science algorithms for finding linear extensions of partial orders represented as the reachability orders of directed acyclic graphs are called topological sorting br br br In category theory br br Every poset and every preordered set may be considered as a category where for objects br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br and br br br br y br br br br displaystyle y br br there is at most one morphism from br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br to br br br br y br br br br displaystyle y br br More explicitly let hom x y x y if x y and otherwise the empty set and br br br br br y br br z br br br br x br br y br br br br x br br z br br br br br displaystyle y z circ x y x z br br Such categories are sometimes called posetal br Posets are equivalent to one another if and only if they are isomorphic In a poset the smallest element if it exists is an initial object and the largest element if it exists is a terminal object Also every preordered set is equivalent to a poset Finally every subcategory of a poset is isomorphism closed br br br Partial orders in topological spaces br br If br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br is a partially ordered set that has also been given the structure of a topological space then it is customary to assume that br br br br br br a br br b br br br a br br b br br br br displaystyle a b a leq b br br is a closed subset of the topological product space br br br br P br br P br br br br displaystyle P times P br br Under this assumption partial order relations are well behaved at limits in the sense that if br br br br br lim br br i br br br br br br a br br i br br br br a br br br br

br displaystyle i br br br br br br br a br br i br br br br br b br br i br br br br br br displaystyle a i leq b i br br then br br br br a br br b br br br br displaystyle a leq b br br br br Intervals br br A convex set in a poset P is a subset I of P with the property that for any x and y in I and any z in P if x z y then z is also in I This definition generalizes the definition of intervals of real numbers When there is possible confusion with convex sets of geometry one uses order convex instead of convex br A convex sublattice of a lattice L is a sublattice of L that is also a convex set of L Every nonempty convex sublattice can be uniquely represented as the intersection of a filter and an ideal of L br An interval in a poset P is a subset that can be defined with interval notation br br For a b the closed interval a b is the set of elements x satisfying a x b that is a x and x b It contains at least the elements a and b br Using the corresponding strict relation the open interval a b is the set of elements x satisfying a x b i e a x and x b An open interval may be empty even if a b For example the open interval on the integers is empty since there is no integer x such that x br The half open intervals a b and a b are defined similarly br Whenever a b does not hold all these intervals are empty Every interval is a convex set but the converse does not hold for example in the poset of divisors of ordered by divisibility see Fig b the set is convex but not an interval br An interval I is bounded if there exist elements br br br br a br br b br br P br br br displaystyle a b in P br br such that I a b Every interval that can be represented in interval notation is obviously bounded but the converse is not true For example let P as a subposet of the real numbers The subset is a bounded interval but it has no infimum or supremum in P so it cannot be written in interval notation using elements of P br A poset is called locally finite if every bounded interval is finite For example the integers are locally finite under their natural ordering The lexicographical order on the cartesian product br br br br br N br br br br N br br br br displaystyle mathbb N times mathbb N br br is not locally finite since br Using the interval notation the property a is covered by b can be rephrased equivalently as br br br br br a br br b br br br br a br br b br br br br br displaystyle a b a b br br br This concept of an interval in a partial order should not be confused with the particular class of partial orders known as the interval orders
