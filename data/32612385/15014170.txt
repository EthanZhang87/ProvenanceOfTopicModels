title: Judgment (mathematical logic)
id: 15014170
In mathematical logic a judgment or judgement or assertion is a statement or enunciation in a metalanguage For example typical judgments in first order logic would be that a string is a well formed formula or that a proposition is true Similarly a judgment may assert the occurrence of a free variable in an expression of the object language or the provability of a proposition In general a judgment may be any inductively definable assertion in the metatheory br Judgments are used in formalizing deduction systems a logical axiom expresses a judgment premises of a rule of inference are formed as a sequence of judgments and their conclusion is a judgment as well thus hypotheses and conclusions of proofs are judgments A characteristic feature of the variants of Hilbert style deduction systems is that the context is not changed in any of their rules of inference while both natural deduction and sequent calculus contain some context changing rules Thus if we are interested only in the derivability of tautologies not hypothetical judgments then we can formalize the Hilbert style deduction system in such a way that its rules of inference contain only judgments of a rather simple form The same cannot be done with the other two deductions systems as context is changed in some of their rules of inferences they cannot be formalized so that hypothetical judgments could be avoided not even if we want to use them just for proving derivability of tautologies br This basic diversity among the various calculi allows such difference that the same basic thought e g deduction theorem must be proven as a metatheorem in Hilbert style deduction system while it can be declared explicitly as a rule of inference in natural deduction br In type theory some analogous notions are used as in mathematical logic giving rise to connections between the two fields e g Curry Howard correspondence The abstraction in the notion of judgment in mathematical logic can be exploited also in foundation of type theory as well br br br See also br Simply typed lambda calculus br Mathematical logic br br br br Martin L f Per On the meanings of the logical constants and the justifications of the logical laws PDF Nordic Journal of Philosophical Logic ISSN br Dybjer Peter Intuitionistic Type Theory In Zalta Edward N ed Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy br Pfenning Frank Davies Rowan August A judgmental reconstruction of modal logic Mathematical Structures in Computer Science CiteSeerX doi S S CID br br br External links br Judgments in formal systems Everything br Pfenning Frank Spring Natural Deduction PDF Automated Theorem Proving br Martin L f Per On the meaning of the logical constants and the justifications of the logical laws Siena Lectures
