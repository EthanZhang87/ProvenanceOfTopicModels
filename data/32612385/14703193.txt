In type theory a branch of mathematical logic in a given typed calculus the type inhabitation problem for this calculus is the following problem given a type br br br br br br br displaystyle tau br br and a typing environment br br br br br br br displaystyle Gamma br br does there exist a br br br br br br br displaystyle lambda br br term M such that br br br br br br M br br br br br displaystyle Gamma vdash M tau br br With an empty type environment such an M is said to be an inhabitant of br br br br br br br displaystyle tau br br br br br Relationship to logic br In the case of simply typed lambda calculus a type has an inhabitant if and only if its corresponding proposition is a tautology of minimal implicative logic Similarly a System F type has an inhabitant if and only if its corresponding proposition is a tautology of intuitionistic second order logic br Girard s paradox shows that type inhabitation is strongly related to the consistency of a type system with Curry Howard correspondence To be sound such a system must have uninhabited types br br br Formal properties br For most typed calculi the type inhabitation problem is very hard Richard Statman proved that for simply typed lambda calculus the type inhabitation problem is PSPACE complete For other calculi like System F the problem is even undecidable br br br See also br Curry Howard isomorphism br br br
