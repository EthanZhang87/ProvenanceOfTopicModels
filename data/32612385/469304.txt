id: 469304
A lattice is an abstract structure studied in the mathematical subdisciplines of order theory and abstract algebra It consists of a partially ordered set in which every pair of elements has a unique supremum also called a least upper bound or join and a unique infimum also called a greatest lower bound or meet An example is given by the power set of a set partially ordered by inclusion for which the supremum is the union and the infimum is the intersection Another example is given by the natural numbers partially ordered by divisibility for which the supremum is the least common multiple and the infimum is the greatest common divisor br Lattices can also be characterized as algebraic structures satisfying certain axiomatic identities Since the two definitions are equivalent lattice theory draws on both order theory and universal algebra Semilattices include lattices which in turn include Heyting and Boolean algebras These lattice like structures all admit order theoretic as well as algebraic descriptions br The sub field of abstract algebra that studies lattices is called lattice theory br br br Definition br A lattice can be defined either order theoretically as a partially ordered set or as an algebraic structure br br br As partially ordered set br A partially ordered set poset br br br br br L br br br br br br displaystyle L leq br br is called a lattice if it is both a join and a meet semilattice i e each two element subset br br br br br a br br b br br br L br br br displaystyle a b subseteq L br br has a join i e least upper bound denoted by br br br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a vee b br br and dually a meet i e greatest lower bound denoted by br br br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a wedge b br br This definition makes br br br br br br br br br displaystyle wedge br br and br br br br br br br br br displaystyle vee br br binary operations Both operations are monotone with respect to the given order br br br br br a br br br br br br br a br br br br br br br displaystyle a leq a br br and br br br br br b br br br br br br br b br br br br br br br displaystyle b leq b br br implies that br br br br br a br br br br br br br b br br br br br br br a br br br br br br br b br br br br br br br displaystyle a vee b leq a vee b br br and br br br br br a br br br br br br br b br br br br br br br a br br br br br br br b br br br br br br br br displaystyle a wedge b leq a wedge b br br br It follows by an induction argument that every non empty finite subset of a lattice has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound With additional assumptions further conclusions may be possible see Completeness order theory for more discussion of this subject That article also discusses how one may rephrase the above definition in terms of the existence of suitable Galois connections between related partially ordered sets an approach of special interest for the category theoretic approach to lattices and for formal concept analysis br Given a subset of a lattice br br br br H br br L br br br br displaystyle H subseteq L br br meet and join restrict to partial functions they are undefined if their value is not in the subset br br br br H br br br br displaystyle H br br The resulting structure on br br br br H br br br displaystyle H br br is called a partial lattice In addition to this extrinsic definition as a subset of some other algebraic structure a lattice a partial lattice can also be intrinsically defined as a set with two partial binary operations satisfying certain axioms br br br As algebraic structure br A lattice is an algebraic structure br br br br br L br br br br br br br br displaystyle L vee wedge br br consisting of a set br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br and two binary commutative and associative operations br br br br br br br displaystyle vee br br and br br br br br br br displaystyle wedge br br on br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br satisfying the following axiomatic identities for all elements br br br br a br br b br br L br br br displaystyle a b in L br br sometimes called absorption laws br br br br br a br br br a br br b br br br a br br br displaystyle a vee a wedge b a br br br br br br a br br br a br br b br br br a br br br displaystyle a wedge a vee b a br br br The following two identities are also usually regarded as axioms even though they follow from the two absorption laws taken together These are called idempotent laws br br br br br a br br a br br a br br br displaystyle a vee a a br br br br br br a br br a br br a br br br displaystyle a wedge a a br br br These axioms assert that both br br br br br L br br br br br br displaystyle L vee br br and br br br br br L br br br br br br displaystyle L wedge br br are semilattices The absorption laws the only axioms above in which both meet and join appear distinguish a lattice from an arbitrary pair of semilattice structures and assure that the two semilattices interact appropriately In particular each semilattice is the dual of the other The absorption laws can be viewed as a requirement that the meet and join semilattices define the same partial order br br br Connection between the two definitions br An order theoretic lattice gives rise to the two binary operations br br br br br br br displaystyle vee br br and br br br br br br br br displaystyle wedge br br Since the commutative associative and absorption laws can easily be verified for these operations they make br br br br br L br br br br br br br br displaystyle L vee wedge br br into a lattice in the algebraic sense br The converse is also true Given an algebraically defined lattice br br br br br L br br br br br br br br br displaystyle L vee wedge br br one can define a partial order br br br br br br br displaystyle leq br br on br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br by setting br br br br br a br br b br br if br br a br br a br br b br br br or br br br br displaystyle a leq b text if a a wedge b text or br br br br br br a br br b br br if br br b br br a br br b br br br br displaystyle a leq b text if b a vee b br br br for all elements br br br br a br br b br br L br br br br displaystyle a b in L br br The laws of absorption ensure that both definitions are equivalent br br br br br a br br a br br b br br implies br br b br br b br br br b br br a br br br br a br br b br br br b br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a a wedge b text implies b b vee b wedge a a wedge b vee b a vee b br br br and dually for the other direction br One can now check that the relation introduced in this way defines a partial ordering within which binary meets and joins are given through the original operations br br br br br br br displaystyle vee br br and br br br br br br br br displaystyle wedge br br br Since the two definitions of a lattice are equivalent one may freely invoke aspects of either definition in any way that suits the purpose at hand br br br Bounded lattice br A bounded lattice is a lattice that additionally has a greatest element also called maximum or top element and denoted by br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br or by br br br br br br br displaystyle top br br and a least element also called minimum or bottom denoted by br br br br br br br displaystyle br br or by br br br br br br br displaystyle bot br br which satisfy br br br br br br br x br br br br br for every br br x br br L br br br br displaystyle leq x leq text for every x in L br br br A bounded lattice may also be defined as an algebraic structure of the form br br br br br L br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle L vee wedge br br such that br br br br br L br br br br br br br br displaystyle L vee wedge br br is a lattice br br br br br br br displaystyle br br the lattice s bottom is the identity element for the join operation br br br br br br br br displaystyle vee br br and br br br br br br br displaystyle br br the lattice s top is the identity element for the meet operation br br br br br br br br displaystyle wedge br br br br br br a br br br br a br br br displaystyle a vee a br br br br br br a br br br br a br br br displaystyle a wedge a br br br A partially ordered set is a bounded lattice if and only if every finite set of elements including the empty set has a join and a meet For every element br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br of a poset it is vacuously true that br br br br br br for all br br a br br br br x br br a br br br displaystyle text for all a in varnothing x leq a br br and br br br br br br for all br br a br br br br a br br x br br br br displaystyle text for all a in varnothing a leq x br br and therefore every element of a poset is both an upper bound and a lower bound of the empty set This implies that the join of an empty set is the least element br br br br br br br br br br br textstyle bigvee varnothing br br and the meet of the empty set is the greatest element br br br br br br br br br br textstyle bigwedge varnothing br br This is consistent with the associativity and commutativity of meet and join the join of a union of finite sets is equal to the join of the joins of the sets and dually the meet of a union of finite sets is equal to the meet of the meets of the sets that is for finite subsets br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br and br br br br B br br br displaystyle B br br of a poset br br br br L br br br br displaystyle L br br br br br br br br A br br B br br br br br br br A br br br br

B br br br br br br displaystyle bigwedge A cup B left bigwedge A right wedge left bigwedge B right br br br hold Taking br br br br B br br br displaystyle B br br to be the empty set br br br br br

br br A br br br br A br br br br displaystyle A cup varnothing A br br br Every lattice can be embedded into a bounded lattice by adding a greatest and a least element Furthermore every non empty finite lattice is bounded by taking the join respectively meet of all elements denoted by br br br br br br br L br br br a br br br br br br br br br a br br n br br br br br textstyle bigvee L a lor cdots lor a n br br respectively br br br br br br br L br br br a br br br br br br br br br a br br n br br br br br textstyle bigwedge L a land cdots land a n br br where br br br br L br br br br br br a br br br br br br br br br a br br n br br br br br br br br displaystyle L left a ldots a n right br br is the set of all elements br br br Connection to other algebraic structures br Lattices have some connections to the family of group like algebraic structures Because meet and join both commute and associate a lattice can be viewed as consisting of two commutative semigroups having the same domain For a bounded lattice these semigroups are in fact commutative monoids The absorption law is the only defining identity that is peculiar to lattice theory A bounded lattice can also be thought of as a commutative rig without the distributive axiom br By commutativity associativity and idempotence one can think of join and meet as operations on non empty finite sets rather than on pairs of elements In a bounded lattice the join and meet of the empty set can also be defined as br br br br br br br displaystyle br br and br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br respectively This makes bounded lattices somewhat more natural than general lattices and many authors require all lattices to be bounded br The algebraic interpretation of lattices plays an essential role in universal algebra br br br Examples br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br For any set br br br br A br br br br displaystyle A br br the collection of all subsets of br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br called the power set of br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br can be ordered via subset inclusion to obtain a lattice bounded by br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br itself and the empty set In this lattice the supremum is provided by set union and the infimum is provided by set intersection see Pic br For any set br br br br A br br br br displaystyle A br br the collection of all finite subsets of br br br br A br br br br displaystyle A br br ordered by inclusion is also a lattice and will be bounded if and only if br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br is finite br For any set br br br br A br br br br displaystyle A br br the collection of all partitions of br br br br A br br br br displaystyle A br br ordered by refinement is a lattice see Pic br The positive integers in their usual order form an unbounded lattice under the operations of min and max is bottom there is no top see Pic br The Cartesian square of the natural numbers ordered so that br br br br br a br br b br br br br c br br d br br br br displaystyle a b leq c d br br if br br br br a br br c br br and br br b br br d br br br br displaystyle a leq c text and b leq d br br The pair br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br is the bottom element there is no top see Pic br The natural numbers also form a lattice under the operations of taking the greatest common divisor and least common multiple with divisibility as the order relation br br br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a leq b br br if br br br br a br br br displaystyle a br br divides br br br br b br br br br displaystyle b br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br is bottom br br br br br br br displaystyle br br is top Pic shows a finite sublattice br Every complete lattice also see below is a rather specific bounded lattice This class gives rise to a broad range of practical examples br The set of compact elements of an arithmetic complete lattice is a lattice with a least element where the lattice operations are given by restricting the respective operations of the arithmetic lattice This is the specific property that distinguishes arithmetic lattices from algebraic lattices for which the compacts only form a join semilattice Both of these classes of complete lattices are studied in domain theory br Further examples of lattices are given for each of the additional properties discussed below br br br Examples of non lattices br br Most partially ordered sets are not lattices including the following br br A discrete poset meaning a poset such that br br br br x br br y br br br displaystyle x leq y br br implies br br br br x br br y br br br br displaystyle x y br br is a lattice if and only if it has at most one element In particular the two element discrete poset is not a lattice br Although the set br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br partially ordered by divisibility is a lattice the set br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br so ordered is not a lattice because the pair lacks a join similarly lacks a meet in br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br br The set br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br partially ordered by divisibility is not a lattice Every pair of elements has an upper bound and a lower bound but the pair has three upper bounds namely and none of which is the least of those three under divisibility and do not divide each other Likewise the pair has three lower bounds namely and none of which is the greatest of those three under divisibility and do not divide each other br br br Morphisms of lattices br br The appropriate notion of a morphism between two lattices flows easily from the above algebraic definition Given two lattices br br br br br br br L br br br br br L br br br br br br br L br br br br br br br br displaystyle left L vee L wedge L right br br and br br br br br br br M br br br br br M br br br br br br br M br br br br br br br br br displaystyle left M vee M wedge M right br br a lattice homomorphism from L to M is a function br br br br f br br L br br M br br br displaystyle f L to M br br such that for all br br br br a br br b br br L br br br br displaystyle a b in L br br br br br br f br br br br a br br br br L br br br b br br br br br f br br a br br br br br M br br br f br br b br br br br and br br br br displaystyle f left a vee L b right f a vee M f b text and br br br br br br f br br br br a br br br br L br br br b br br br br br f br br a br br br br br M br br br f br br b br br br br br displaystyle f left a wedge L b right f a wedge M f b br br br Thus br br br br f br br br displaystyle f br br is a homomorphism of the two underlying semilattices When lattices with more structure are considered the morphisms should respect the extra structure too In particular a bounded lattice homomorphism usually called just lattice homomorphism br br br br f br br br displaystyle f br br between two bounded lattices br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br and br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br should also have the following property br br br br br f br br br br br br L br br br br br br br br br M br br br br br and br br br br displaystyle f left L right M text and br br br br br br f br br br br br br L br br br br br br br br br M br br br br br br displaystyle f left L right M br br br In the order theoretic formulation these conditions just state that a homomorphism of lattices is a function preserving binary meets and joins For bounded lattices preservation of least and greatest elements is just preservation of join and meet of the empty set br Any homomorphism of lattices is necessarily monotone with respect to the associated ordering relation see Limit preserving function The converse is not true monotonicity by no means implies the required preservation of meets and joins see Pic although an order preserving bijection is a homomorphism if its inverse is also order preserving br Given the standard definition of isomorphisms as invertible morphisms a lattice isomorphism is just a bijective lattice homomorphism Similarly a lattice endomorphism is a lattice homomorphism from a lattice to itself and a lattice automorphism is a bijective lattice endomorphism Lattices and their homomorphisms form a category br Let br br br br br L br br br br displaystyle mathbb L br br and br br br br br br L br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb L br br be two lattices with and A homomorphism from br br br br br L br br br br displaystyle mathbb L br br to br br br br br br L br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb L br br is called separating if and only if br br br br br f br br br br br br br f br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle f f br br br br br br f br br br displaystyle f br br separates and br br br br br f br br br br br br br f br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle f f br br br br br br f br br br displaystyle f br br separates br br br Sublattices br A sublattice of a lattice br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br is a subset of br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br that is a lattice with the same meet and join operations as br br br br L br br br br displaystyle L br br That is if br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br is a lattice and br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br is a subset of br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br such that for every pair of elements br br br br a br br b br br M br br br displaystyle a b in M br br both br br br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a wedge b br br and br br br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a vee b br br are in br br br br M br br br br displaystyle M br br then br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br is a sublattice of br br br br L br br br br displaystyle L br br br A sublattice br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br of a lattice br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br is a convex sublattice of br br br br L br br br br displaystyle L br br if br br br br x br br z br br y br br br displaystyle x leq z leq y br br and br br br br x br br y br br M br br br displaystyle x y in M br br implies that br br br br z br br br displaystyle z br br belongs to br br br br M br br br br displaystyle M br br for all elements br br br br x br br y br br z br br L br br br br displaystyle x y z in L br br br br Properties of lattices br br We now introduce a number of important properties that lead to interesting special classes of lattices One boundedness has already been discussed br br br Completeness br br A poset is called a complete lattice if all its subsets have both a join and a meet In particular every complete lattice is a bounded lattice While bounded lattice homomorphisms in general preserve only finite joins and meets complete lattice homomorphisms are required to preserve arbitrary joins and meets br Every poset that is a complete semilattice is also a complete lattice Related to this result is the interesting phenomenon that there are various competing notions of homomorphism for this class of posets depending on whether they are seen as complete lattices complete join semilattices complete meet semilattices or as join complete or meet complete lattices br Partial lattice is not the opposite of complete lattice rather partial lattice lattice and complete lattice are increasingly restrictive definitions br br br Conditional completeness br br A conditionally complete lattice is a lattice in which every nonempty subset that has an upper bound has a join that is a least upper bound Such lattices provide the most direct generalization of the completeness axiom of the real numbers A conditionally complete lattice is either a complete lattice or a complete lattice without its maximum element br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br its minimum element br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br or both br br br Distributivity br br Since lattices come with two binary operations it is natural to ask whether one of them distributes over the other that is whether one or the other of the following dual laws holds for every three elements br br br br a br br b br br c br br L br br br br displaystyle a b c in L br br br br Distributivity of br br br br br br br displaystyle vee br br over br br br br br br br displaystyle wedge br br br br br br a br br br b br br c br br br br a br br b br br br br a br br c br br br br br displaystyle a vee b wedge c a vee b wedge a vee c br br br Distributivity of br br br br br br br displaystyle wedge br br over br br br br br br br displaystyle vee br br br br br br a br br br b br br c br br br br a br br b br br br br a br br c br br br br br displaystyle a wedge b vee c a wedge b vee a wedge c br br br A lattice that satisfies the first or equivalently as it turns out the second axiom is called a distributive lattice br The only non distributive lattices with fewer than elements are called M and N they are shown in Pictures and respectively A lattice is distributive if and only if it does not have a sublattice isomorphic to M or N Each distributive lattice is isomorphic to a lattice of sets with union and intersection as join and meet respectively br For an overview of stronger notions of distributivity that are appropriate for complete lattices and that are used to define more special classes of lattices such as frames and completely distributive lattices see distributivity in order theory br br br Modularity br br For some applications the distributivity condition is too strong and the following weaker property is often useful A lattice br br br br br L br br br br br br br br displaystyle L vee wedge br br is modular if for all elements br br br br a br br b br br c br br L br br br br displaystyle a b c in L br br the following identity holds br br br br br br a br br c br br br br b br br c br br br br br a br br c br br br b br br br c br br br br displaystyle a wedge c vee b wedge c a wedge c vee b wedge c br br Modular identity br This condition is equivalent to the following axiom br br br br br a br br c br br br displaystyle a leq c br br implies br br br br a br br br b br br c br br br br a br br b br br br c br br br br displaystyle a vee b wedge c a vee b wedge c br br Modular law br A lattice is modular if and only if it does not have a sublattice isomorphic to N shown in Pic br Besides distributive lattices examples of modular lattices are the lattice of submodules of a module hence modular the lattice of two sided ideals of a ring and the lattice of normal subgroups of a group The set of first order terms with the ordering is more specific than is a non modular lattice used in automated reasoning br br br Semimodularity br br A finite lattice is modular if and only if it is both upper and lower semimodular For a graded lattice upper semimodularity is equivalent to the following condition on the rank function br br br br r br br br br displaystyle r colon br br br br br br r br br x br br br r br br y br br br r br br x br br y br br br r br br x br br y br br br br br displaystyle r x r y geq r x wedge y r x vee y br br br Another equivalent for graded lattices condition is Birkhoff s condition br br for each br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br and br br br br y br br br displaystyle y br br in br br br br L br br br br displaystyle L br br if br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br and br br br br y br br br displaystyle y br br both cover br br br br x br br y br br br br displaystyle x wedge y br br then br br br br x br br y br br br displaystyle x vee y br br covers both br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br and br br br br y br br br br displaystyle y br br br A lattice is called lower semimodular if its dual is semimodular For finite lattices this means that the previous conditions hold with br br br br br br br displaystyle vee br br and br br br br br br br displaystyle wedge br br exchanged covers exchanged with is covered by and inequalities reversed br br br Continuity and algebraicity br In domain theory it is natural to seek to approximate the elements in a partial order by much simpler elements This leads to the class of continuous posets consisting of posets where every element can be obtained as the supremum of a directed set of elements that are way below the element If one can additionally restrict these to the compact elements of a poset for obtaining these directed sets then the poset is even algebraic Both concepts can be applied to lattices as follows br br A continuous lattice is a complete lattice that is continuous as a poset br An algebraic lattice is a complete lattice that is algebraic as a poset br Both of these classes have interesting properties For example continuous lattices can be characterized as algebraic structures with infinitary operations satisfying certain identities While such a characterization is not known for algebraic lattices they can be described syntactically via Scott information systems br br br Complements and pseudo complements br br Let br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br be a bounded lattice with greatest element and least element Two elements br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br and br br br br y br br br displaystyle y br br of br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br are complements of each other if and only if br br br br br x br br y br br br br br and br br br x br br y br br br br br displaystyle x vee y quad text and quad x wedge y br br br In general some elements of a bounded lattice might not have a complement and others might have more than one complement For example the set br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br with its usual ordering is a bounded lattice and br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle tfrac br br does not have a complement In the bounded lattice N the element br br br br a br br br displaystyle a br br has two complements viz br br br br b br br br displaystyle b br br and br br br br c br br br displaystyle c br br see Pic A bounded lattice for which every element has a complement is called a complemented lattice br A complemented lattice that is also distributive is a Boolean algebra For a distributive lattice the complement of br br br br x br br br br displaystyle x br br when it exists is unique br In the case that the complement is unique we write br br br br br x br br y br br br textstyle lnot x y br br and equivalently br br br br br y br br x br br br br textstyle lnot y x br br The corresponding unary operation over br

notions of importance to lattice theory In the following let br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br be an element of some lattice br br br br L br br br br displaystyle L br br br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br is called br br Join irreducible if br br br br x br br a br br b br br br displaystyle x a vee b br br implies br br br br x br br a br br or br br x br br b br br br br displaystyle x a text or x b br br for all br br br br a br br b br br L br br br br displaystyle a b in L br br If br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br has a bottom element br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br some authors require br br br br x br br br br br displaystyle x neq br br When the first condition is generalized to arbitrary joins br br br br br br br i br br I br br br br a br br i br br br br br br displaystyle bigvee i in I a i br br br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br is called completely join irreducible or br br br br br br br displaystyle vee br br irreducible The dual notion is meet irreducibility br br br br br br br displaystyle wedge br br irreducible For example in Pic the elements and are join irreducible while and are meet irreducible Depending on definition the bottom element and top element may or may not be considered join irreducible and meet irreducible respectively In the lattice of real numbers with the usual order each element is join irreducible but none is completely join irreducible br Join prime if br br br br x br br a br br b br br br displaystyle x leq a vee b br br implies br br br br x br br a br br or br br x br br b br br br br displaystyle x leq a text or x leq b br br Again some authors require br br br br x br br br br br displaystyle x neq br br although this is unusual This too can be generalized to obtain the notion completely join prime The dual notion is meet prime Every join prime element is also join irreducible and every meet prime element is also meet irreducible The converse holds if br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br is distributive br Let br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br have a bottom element An element br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br of br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br is an atom if br br br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br and there exists no element br br br br y br br L br br br displaystyle y in L br br such that br br br br br br y br br x br br br br displaystyle y x br br Then br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br is called br br Atomic if for every nonzero element br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br of br br br br L br br br br displaystyle L br br there exists an atom br br br br a br br br displaystyle a br br of br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br such that br br br br a br br x br br br br displaystyle a leq x br br br Atomistic if every element of br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br is a supremum of atoms br However many sources and mathematical communities use the term atomic to mean atomistic as defined above br The notions of ideals and the dual notion of filters refer to particular kinds of subsets of a partially ordered set and are
