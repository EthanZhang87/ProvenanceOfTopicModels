title: Rule of inference
id: 252311
In philosophy of logic and logic a rule of inference inference rule or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises analyzes their syntax and returns a conclusion or conclusions br For example the rule of inference called modus ponens takes two premises one in the form If p then q and another in the form p and returns the conclusion q The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic as well as the semantics of many other non classical logics in the sense that if the premises are true under an interpretation then so is the conclusion br Typically a rule of inference preserves truth a semantic property In many valued logic it preserves a general designation But a rule of inference s action is purely syntactic and does not need to preserve any semantic property any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference Usually only rules that are recursive are important i e rules such that there is an effective procedure for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule An example of a rule that is not effective in this sense is the infinitary rule br Popular rules of inference in propositional logic include modus ponens modus tollens and contraposition First order predicate logic uses rules of inference to deal with logical quantifiers br br br Standard form br In formal logic and many related areas rules of inference are usually given in the following standard form br Premise br Premise br br Premise n br Conclusion br This expression states that whenever in the course of some logical derivation the given premises have been obtained the specified conclusion can be taken for granted as well The exact formal language that is used to describe both premises and conclusions depends on the actual context of the derivations In a simple case one may use logical formulae such as in br br br br br A br br B br br br displaystyle A to B br br br br br br br br br A br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle underline A quad quad quad br br br br br br B br br br br displaystyle B br br br This is the modus ponens rule of propositional logic Rules of inference are often formulated as schemata employing metavariables In the rule schema above the metavariables A and B can be instantiated to any element of the universe or sometimes by convention a restricted subset such as propositions to form an infinite set of inference rules br A proof system is formed from a set of rules chained together to form proofs also called derivations Any derivation has only one final conclusion which is the statement proved or derived If premises are left unsatisfied in the derivation then the derivation is a proof of a hypothetical statement if the premises hold then the conclusion holds br br br Example Hilbert systems for two propositional logics br In a Hilbert system the premises and conclusion of the inference rules are simply formulae of some language usually employing metavariables For graphical compactness of the presentation and to emphasize the distinction between axioms and rules of inference this section uses the sequent notation br br br br br br br displaystyle vdash br br instead of a vertical presentation of rules br In this notation br br br br br br br br br br Premise br

classical propositional logic can be expressed using just negation implication and propositional symbols A well known axiomatization comprising three axiom schemata and one inference rule modus ponens is br br CA A B A br CA A B C A B A C br CA A B B A br MP A A B B br br It may seem redundant to have two notions of inference in this case and In classical propositional logic they indeed coincide the deduction theorem states that A B if and only if A B There is however a distinction worth emphasizing even in this case the first notation describes a deduction that is an activity of passing from sentences to sentences whereas A B is simply a formula made with a logical connective implication in this case Without an inference rule like modus ponens in this case there is no deduction or inference This point is illustrated in Lewis Carroll s dialogue called What the Tortoise Said to Achilles as well as later attempts by Bertrand Russell and Peter Winch to resolve the paradox introduced in the dialogue br For some non classical logics the deduction theorem does not hold For example the three valued logic of ukasiewicz can be axiomatized as br br CA A B A br LA A B B C A C br CA A B B A br LA A A A A br MP A A B B br br This sequence differs from classical logic by the change in axiom and the addition of axiom The classical deduction theorem does not hold for this logic however a modified form does hold namely A B if and only if A A B br br br Admissibility and derivability br br In a set of rules an inference rule could be redundant in the sense that it is admissible or derivable A derivable rule is one whose conclusion can be derived from its premises using the other rules An admissible rule is one whose conclusion holds whenever the premises hold All derivable rules are admissible To appreciate the difference consider the following set of rules for defining the natural numbers the judgment br br br br n br br br br br n br a br t br br br br br displaystyle n mathsf nat br br asserts the fact that br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br is a natural number br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br n br a br t br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br n br br br br br n br a br t br br br br br br br br br br s br br br n br br br br br br br br n br a br t br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle begin matrix begin array c hline mathbf mathsf nat end array begin array c n mathsf nat hline mathbf s n mathbf mathsf nat end array end matrix br br br The first rule states that is a natural number and the second states that s n is a natural number if n is In this proof system the following rule demonstrating that the second successor of a natural number is also a natural number is derivable br br br br br br br br br br n br br br br br n br a br t br br br br br br br br br br s br br s br br br n br br br br br br br br br n br a br t br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle begin array c n mathsf nat hline mathbf s s n mathbf mathsf nat end array br br br Its derivation is the composition of two uses of the successor rule above The following rule for asserting the existence of a predecessor for any nonzero number is merely admissible br br br br br br br br br br br s br br br n br br br br br br br br n br a br t br br br br br br br br br n br br br br br n br a br t br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle begin array c mathbf s n mathbf mathsf nat hline n mathsf nat end array br br br This is a true fact of natural numbers as can be proven by induction To prove that this rule is admissible assume a derivation of the premise and induct on it to produce a derivation of br br br br n br br br br br n br a br t br br br br br displaystyle n mathsf nat br br However it is not derivable because it depends on the structure of the derivation of the premise Because of this derivability is stable under additions to the proof system whereas admissibility is not To see the difference suppose the following nonsense rule were added to the proof system br br br br br br br br br br br br br br s br br br br br br br br br br n br a br t br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle begin array c hline mathbf s mathsf nat end array br br br In this new system the double successor rule is still derivable However the rule for finding the predecessor is no longer admissible because there is no way to derive br br br br br br br br br br br br n br a br t br br br br br displaystyle mathbf mathsf nat br br The brittleness of admissibility comes from the way it is proved since the proof can induct on the structure of the derivations of the premises extensions to the system add new cases to this proof which may no longer hold br Admissible rules can be thought of as theorems of a proof system For instance in a sequent calculus where cut elimination holds the cut rule is admissible br br br See also br Argumentation
