John Alan Robinson March August was a philosopher mathematician and computer scientist He was a professor emeritus at Syracuse University br Alan Robinson s major contribution is to the foundations of automated theorem proving His unification algorithm eliminated one source of combinatorial explosion in resolution provers it also prepared the ground for the logic programming paradigm in particular for the Prolog language br Robinson received the Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automated Reasoning br br br Life br Robinson was born in Halifax Yorkshire England in and left for the United States in with a classics degree from Cambridge University He studied philosophy at the University of Oregon before moving to Princeton University where he received his PhD in philosophy in He then worked at DuPont as an operations research analyst where he learned computer programming and taught himself mathematics He moved to Rice University in spending his summers as a visiting researcher at the Argonne National Laboratory s Applied Mathematics Division He moved to Syracuse University as Distinguished Professor of Logic and Computer Science in and became professor emeritus in br It was at Argonne that Robinson became interested in automated theorem proving and developed unification and the resolution principle Resolution and unification have since been incorporated in many automated theorem proving systems and are the basis for the inference mechanisms used in logic programming and the programming language Prolog br Robinson was the Founding Editor of the Journal of Logic Programming and has received numerous honours These include a Guggenheim Fellowship in the American Mathematical Society Milestone Award in Automatic Theorem Proving an AAAI Fellowship the Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automatic Reasoning and the Association for Logic Programming honorary title Founder of Logic Programming in He has received honorary Doctorates from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Uppsala University and Universidad Politecnica de Madrid Robinson died in Portland Maine on August from a ruptured aneurysm following surgery for pancreatic cancer br In he received the Humboldt Senior Scientist Award at the request of Wolfgang Bibel which included a six month stay at the Department of Computer Science of the Technische Universit t Darmstadt br br br Selected publications br Robinson J Alan Voronkov Andrei eds Handbook of Automated Reasoning MIT Press ISBN br Gabbay Dov M Hogger Christopher John Robinson J A eds Handbook of Logic in Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming Vols Oxford University Press br Arbib Michael A Robinson J Alan eds Natural and Artificial Parallel Computation MIT Press ISBN br Robinson J A Logic Form and Function Edinburgh University Press ISBN br Robinson John Alan January A Machine Oriented Logic Based on the Resolution Principle J ACM doi S CID br Robinson John Alan Causation Probability and Testimony PhD thesis Princeton University OCLC br br br See also br Robinson resolvent method an alternative to the Quine McCluskey algorithm for Boolean function minimization br br br Notes br br br External links br John Alan Robinson at DBLP Bibliography Server br Books listed by The MIT Press
