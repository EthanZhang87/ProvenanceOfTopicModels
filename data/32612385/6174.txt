In mathematics the cardinality of a set is a measure of the number of elements of the set For example the set br br br br A br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle A br br contains elements and therefore br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br has a cardinality of Beginning in the late th century this concept was generalized to infinite sets which allows one to distinguish between different types of infinity and to perform arithmetic on them There are two approaches to cardinality one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections and another which uses cardinal numbers br The cardinality of a set may also be called its size when no confusion with other notions of size is possible br The cardinality of a set br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br is usually denoted br br br br br br br A br br br br br br displaystyle A br br with a vertical bar on each side this is the same notation as absolute value and the meaning depends on context The cardinality of a set br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br may alternatively be denoted by br br br br n br br A br br br br displaystyle n A br br br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br br

of things or events compare with other groups by containing more fewer or the same number of instances is observed in a variety of present day animal species suggesting an origin millions of years ago Human expression of cardinality is seen as early as years ago with equating the size of a group with a group of recorded notches or a representative collection of other things such as sticks and shells The abstraction of cardinality as a number is evident by BCE in Sumerian mathematics and the manipulation of numbers without reference to a specific group of things or events br From the th century BCE the writings of Greek philosophers show hints of the cardinality of infinite sets While they considered the notion of infinity as an endless series of actions such as adding to a number repeatedly they did not consider the size of an infinite set of numbers to be a thing The ancient Greek notion of infinity also considered the division of things into parts repeated without limit In Euclid s Elements commensurability was described as the ability to compare the length of two line segments a and b as a ratio as long as there were a third segment no matter how small that could be laid end to end a whole number of times into both a and b But with the discovery of irrational numbers it was seen that even the infinite set of all rational numbers was not enough to describe the length of every possible line segment Still there was no concept of infinite sets as something that had cardinality br To better understand infinite sets a notion of cardinality was formulated c by Georg Cantor the originator of set theory He examined the process of equating two sets with bijection a one to one correspondence between the elements of two sets based on a unique relationship In with the publication of Cantor s diagonal argument he demonstrated that there are sets of numbers that cannot be placed in one to one correspondence with the set of natural numbers i e uncountable sets that contain more elements than there are in the infinite set of natural numbers br br br Comparing sets br br While the cardinality of a finite set is just the number of its elements extending the notion to infinite sets usually starts with defining the notion of comparison of arbitrary sets some of which are possibly infinite br br br Definition A B br Two sets A and B have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection a k a one to one correspondence from A to B that is a function from A to B that is both injective and surjective Such sets are said to be equipotent equipollent or equinumerous This relationship can also be denoted A B or A B br For example the set E of non negative even numbers has the same cardinality as the set N of natural numbers since the function f n n is a bijection from N to E see picture br For finite sets A and B if some bijection exists from A to B then each injective or surjective function from A to B is a bijection This is no longer true for infinite A and B For example the function g from N to E defined by g n n is injective but not surjective and h from N to E defined by h n n n mod is surjective but not injective Neither g nor h can challenge E N which was established by the existence of f br br br Definition A B br A has cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of B if there exists an injective function from A into B br br br Definition A B br A has cardinality strictly less than the cardinality of B if there is an injective function but no bijective function from A to B br For example the set N of all natural numbers has cardinality strictly less than its power set P N because g n n is an injective function from N to P N and it can be shown that no function from N to P N can be bijective see picture By a similar argument N has cardinality strictly less than the cardinality of the set R of all real numbers For proofs see Cantor s diagonal argument or Cantor s first uncountability proof br If A B and B A then A B a fact known as Schr der Bernstein theorem The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that A B or B A for every A B br br br Cardinal numbers br br In the above section cardinality of a set was defined functionally In other words it was not defined as a specific object itself However such an object can be defined as follows br The relation of having the same cardinality is called equinumerosity and this is an equivalence relation on the class of all sets The equivalence class of a set A under this relation then consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as A There are two ways to define the cardinality of a set br br The cardinality of a set A is defined as its equivalence class under equinumerosity br A representative set is designated for each equivalence class The most common choice is the initial ordinal in that class This is usually taken as the definition of cardinal number in axiomatic set theory br Assuming the axiom of choice the cardinalities of the infinite sets are denoted br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle aleph aleph aleph ldots br br br For each ordinal

displaystyle aleph alpha br br br The cardinality of the natural numbers is denoted aleph null br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle aleph br br while the cardinality of the real numbers is denoted by br br br br br br c br br br br br displaystyle mathfrak c br br a lowercase fraktur script c and is also referred to as the cardinality of the continuum Cantor showed using the diagonal

br br br br br br displaystyle aleph br br i e there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers The continuum hypothesis is independent of ZFC a standard axiomatization of set theory that is it is impossible to prove the continuum hypothesis or its negation from ZFC provided that ZFC is consistent For more detail see Cardinality of the continuum below br br br Finite countable and uncountable sets br If the axiom of choice holds the law of trichotomy holds for cardinality Thus we can make the following definitions br br Any set X with cardinality less than that of the natural numbers or X N is said to be a finite set br Any set X that has the same cardinality as the set of the natural numbers or X N br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle aleph br br is said to be a countably infinite set br Any set X with cardinality greater than that of the natural numbers or X N for example R br br br br br br c br br br br br displaystyle mathfrak c br br N is said to be uncountable br br br Infinite sets br Our intuition gained from finite sets breaks down when dealing with infinite sets In the late th century Georg Cantor Gottlob Frege Richard Dedekind and others rejected the view that the whole cannot be the same size as the part One example of this is Hilbert s paradox of the Grand Hotel br Indeed Dedekind defined an infinite set as one that can be placed into a one to one correspondence with a strict subset that is having the same size in Cantor s sense this notion of infinity is called Dedekind infinite Cantor introduced the cardinal numbers and showed according to his bijection based definition of size that some infinite sets are greater than others The smallest infinite cardinality is that of the natural numbers br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle aleph br br br br br Cardinality of the continuum br br One of Cantor s most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum br br br br br br c br br br br br displaystyle mathfrak c br br is greater than that of the natural numbers br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle aleph br br that is there are more real numbers R than natural numbers N Namely Cantor showed that br br br br br br c br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathfrak c aleph beth br

proof br The continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinal number between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers that is br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle aleph aleph br br br However this hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted ZFC axiomatic set theory if ZFC is consistent br Cardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a real number line is equal to the number of points in any segment of that line but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and indeed in any finite dimensional space These results are highly counterintuitive because they imply that there exist proper subsets and proper supersets of an infinite set S that have the same size as S although S contains elements that do not belong to its subsets and the supersets of S contain elements that are not included in it br The first of these results is apparent by considering for instance the tangent function which provides a one to one correspondence between the interval and R see also Hilbert s paradox of the Grand Hotel br The second result was first demonstrated by Cantor in but it became more apparent in when Giuseppe Peano introduced the space filling curves curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square or cube or hypercube or finite dimensional space These curves are not a direct proof that a line has the same number of points as a finite dimensional space but they can be used to obtain such a proof br Cantor also showed that sets with cardinality strictly greater than br br br br br br c br br br br br displaystyle mathfrak c br br exist see his generalized diagonal argument and theorem They include for instance br br the set of all subsets of R i e the power set of R written P R or R br the set RR of all functions from R to R br Both have cardinality br br br br br br br br br c br
