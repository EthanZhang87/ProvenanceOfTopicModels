In logic and model theory a valuation can be br br In propositional logic an assignment of truth values to propositional variables with a corresponding assignment of truth values to all propositional formulas with those variables br In first order logic and higher order logics a structure the interpretation and the corresponding assignment of a truth value to each sentence in the language for that structure the valuation proper The interpretation must be a homomorphism while valuation is simply a function br br br Mathematical logic br In mathematical logic especially model theory a valuation is an assignment of truth values to formal sentences that follows a truth schema Valuations are also called truth assignments br In propositional logic there are no quantifiers and formulas are built from propositional variables using logical connectives In this context a valuation begins with an assignment of a truth value to each propositional variable This assignment can be uniquely extended to an assignment of truth values to all propositional formulas br In first order logic a language consists of a collection of constant symbols a collection of function symbols and a collection of relation symbols Formulas are built out of atomic formulas using logical connectives and quantifiers A structure consists of a set domain of discourse that determines the range of the quantifiers along with interpretations of the constant function and relation symbols in the language Corresponding to each structure is a unique truth assignment for all sentences formulas with no free variables in the language br br br Notation br If br br br br v br br br displaystyle v br br is a valuation that is a mapping from the atoms to the set br br br br br t br br f br br br br displaystyle t f br br then the double bracket notation is commonly used to denote a valuation that is br br br br v br br br br br br br br br br br br br br v br br br br br displaystyle v phi phi v br br for a proposition br br br br br br br displaystyle phi br br br br br See also br Algebraic semantics br br br br br Rasiowa Helena Sikorski Roman The Mathematics of Metamathematics rd ed Warsaw PWN chapter Algebra of formalized languages br J Michael Dunn Gary M Hardegree Algebraic methods in philosophical logic Oxford University Press p ISBN
