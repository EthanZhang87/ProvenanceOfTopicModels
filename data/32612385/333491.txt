title: Primitive data type
id: 333491
In computer science primitive data types are a set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed Specifically it often refers to the limited set of data representations in use by a particular processor which all compiled programs must use Most processors support a similar set of primitive data types although the specific representations vary More generally primitive data types may refer to the standard data types built into a programming language built in types Data types which are not primitive are referred to as derived or composite br Primitive types are almost always value types but composite types may also be value types br br br Common primitive data types br The most common primitive types are those used and supported by computer hardware such as integers of various sizes floating point numbers and Boolean logical values Operations on such types are usually quite efficient Primitive data types which are native to the processor have a one to one correspondence with objects in the computer s memory and operations on these types are often the fastest possible in most cases Integer addition for example can be performed as a single machine instruction and some offer specific instructions to process sequences of characters with a single instruction But the choice of primitive data type may affect performance for example it is faster using SIMD operations and data types to operate on an array of floats br br br Integer numbers br br An integer data type represents some range of mathematical integers Integers may be either signed allowing negative values or unsigned non negative integers only Common ranges are br br br Floating point numbers br br A floating point number represents a limited precision rational number that may have a fractional part These numbers are stored internally in a format equivalent to scientific notation typically in binary but sometimes in decimal Because floating point numbers have limited precision only a subset of real or rational numbers are exactly representable other numbers can be represented only approximately Many languages have both a single precision often called float and a double precision type often called double br br br Booleans br br A Boolean type typically denoted bool or boolean is typically a logical type that can have either the value true or the value false Although only one bit is necessary to accommodate the value set true and false programming languages typically implement Boolean types as one or more bytes br Many languages e g Java Pascal and Ada implement Booleans adhering to the concept of boolean as a distinct logical type Some languages though may implicitly convert Booleans to numeric types at times to give extended semantics to Booleans and Boolean expressions or to achieve backwards compatibility with earlier versions of the language For example early versions of the C programming language that followed ANSI C and its former standards did not have a dedicated Boolean type Instead numeric values of zero are interpreted as false and any other value is interpreted as true The newer C added a distinct Boolean type Bool the more intuitive name bool as well as the macros true and false can be included with stdbool h and C supports bool as a built in type and true and false as reserved words br br br Specific languages br br br Java br The Java virtual machine s set of primitive data types consists of br br byte short int long char integer types with a variety of ranges br float and double floating point numbers with single and double precisions br boolean a Boolean type with logical values true and false br returnAddress a value referring to an executable memory address This is not accessible from the Java programming language and is usually left out br br br C basic types br br The set of basic C data types is similar to Java s Minimally there are four types char int float and double but the qualifiers short long signed and unsigned mean that C contains numerous target dependent integer and floating point primitive types C extended this set by adding the Boolean type Bool and allowing the modifier long to be used twice in combination with int e g long long int br br br XML Schema br The XML Schema Definition language provides a set of primitive data types br br string a string a sequence of Unicode code points br boolean a Boolean br decimal a number represented with decimal notation br float and double floating point numbers br duration dateTime time date gYearMonth gYear gMonthDay gDay and gMonth Calendar dates and times br hexBinary and base Binary binary data encoded as hexadecimal or Base br anyURI a URI br QName a qualified name br NOTATION a QName declared as a notation in the schema Notations are used to embed non XML data types This type cannot be used directly only derived types that enumerate a limited set of QNames may be used br br br JavaScript br In JavaScript there are primitive data types string number bigint boolean symbol undefined and null Their values are considered immutable These are not objects and have no methods or properties however all primitives except undefined and null have object wrappers br br br Visual Basic NET br In Visual Basic NET the primitive data types consist of integral types floating point types a byte decimal type a Boolean type a date time type a Unicode character type and a Unicode string type br br br Rust br Rust has primitive unsigned and signed fixed width integers in the format u or i respectively followed by any bit width that is a power of two between and giving the types u u u u u i i i i and i Also available are the types usize and isize which are unsigned and signed integers that are the same bit width as a reference with the usize type being used for indices into arrays and indexable collection types br Rust also has br br bool for the Boolean type br f and f for and bit floating point numbers br char for a unicode character Under the hood these are unsigned bit integers with values that correspond to the char s codepoint but only values that correspond to a valid unicode scalar value are valid br br br Built in types br Built in types are distinguished from others by having specific support in the compiler or runtime to the extent that it would not be possible to simply define them in a header file or standard library module Besides integers floating point numbers and Booleans other built in types include br br The void type and null pointer type nullptr t in C and C br Characters and strings see below br Tuple in Standard ML Python Scala Swift Elixir br List in Common Lisp Python Scheme Haskell br Fixed point number with a variety of precisions and a programmer selected scale br Complex number in C Fortran Common Lisp Python D Go This is two floating point numbers a real part and an imaginary part br Rational number in Common Lisp br Arbitrary precision Integer type in Common Lisp Erlang Haskell br Associative arrays records and or sets in Perl PHP Python Ruby JavaScript Lua D Go br Reference also called a pointer or handle or descriptor br Symbols in Lisp br First class function in all functional languages JavaScript Lua D Go and in newer standards of C Java C Perl br br br Characters and strings br A character type is a type that can represent all Unicode characters hence must be at least bits wide Some languages such as Julia include a true bit Unicode character type as primitive Other languages such as JavaScript Python Ruby and many dialects of BASIC do not have a primitive character type but instead add strings as a primitive data type typically using the UTF encoding Strings with a length of one are normally used to represent single characters br Some languages have character types that are too small to represent all Unicode characters These are more properly categorized as integer types that have been given a misleading name For example C includes a char type but it is defined to be the smallest addressable unit of memory which several standards such as POSIX require to be bits Recent versions of these standards refer to char as a numeric type char is also used for a bit integer type in Java but again this is not a Unicode character type br The term string also does not always refer to a sequence of Unicode characters instead referring to a sequence of bytes For example x has string instructions to move set search or compare a sequence of items where an item could be or bytes long br br br See also br Language primitive br List of data
