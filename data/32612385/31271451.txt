title: Completeness (logic)
id: 31271451
In mathematical logic and metalogic a formal system is called complete with respect to a particular property if every formula having the property can be derived using that system i e is one of its theorems otherwise the system is said to be incomplete br The term complete is also used without qualification with differing meanings depending on the context mostly referring to the property of semantical validity Intuitively a system is called complete in this particular sense if it can derive every formula that is true br br br Other properties related to completeness br br The property converse to completeness is called soundness a system is sound with respect to a property mostly semantical validity if each of its theorems has that property br br br Forms of completeness br br br Expressive completeness br A formal language is expressively complete if it can express the subject matter for which it is intended br br br Functional completeness br br A set of logical connectives associated with a formal system is functionally complete if it can express all propositional functions br br br Semantic completeness br Semantic completeness is the converse of soundness for formal systems A formal system is complete with respect to tautologousness or semantically complete when all its tautologies are theorems whereas a formal system is sound when all theorems are tautologies that is they are semantically valid formulas formulas that are true under every interpretation of the language of the system that is consistent with the rules of the system That is a formal system is semantically complete if br br br br br br br br br S br br br br br br br br br br br br S br br br br br br br br displaystyle models mathcal S varphi to vdash mathcal S varphi br br br For example G del s completeness theorem establishes semantic completeness for first order logic br br br Strong completeness br A formal system S is strongly complete or complete in the strong sense if for every set of premises any formula that semantically follows from is derivable from That is br br br br br br br br br br S br br br br br br br br br br br br br S br br br br br br br br displaystyle Gamma models mathcal S varphi to Gamma vdash mathcal S varphi br br br br Refutation completeness br A formal system S is refutation complete if it is able to derive false from every unsatisfiable set of formulas That is br br br br br br br br br br S br br br br br br br br br br br br S br br br br br br br br displaystyle Gamma models mathcal S bot to Gamma vdash mathcal S bot br br br Every strongly complete system is also refutation complete Intuitively strong completeness means that given a formula set br br br br br br br displaystyle Gamma br br it is possible to compute every semantical consequence br br br br br br br displaystyle varphi br br of br br br br br br br displaystyle Gamma br br while refutation completeness means that given a formula set br br br br br br br displaystyle Gamma br br and a formula br br br br br br br displaystyle varphi br br it is possible to check whether br br br br br br br displaystyle varphi br br is a semantical consequence of br br br br br br br displaystyle Gamma br br br Examples of refutation complete systems include SLD resolution on Horn clauses superposition on equational clausal first order logic Robinson s resolution on clause sets The latter is not strongly complete e g br br br br br a br br br a br br b br br br displaystyle a models a lor b br br holds even in the propositional subset of first order logic but

for each sentence closed formula of the language of the system either or is a theorem of S This is also called negation completeness and is stronger than semantic completeness In another sense a formal system is syntactically complete if and only if no unprovable sentence can be added to it without introducing an inconsistency Truth functional propositional logic and first order predicate logic are semantically complete but not syntactically complete for example the propositional logic statement consisting of a single propositional variable A is not a theorem and neither is its negation G del s incompleteness theorem shows that any computable system that is sufficiently powerful such as Peano arithmetic cannot be both consistent and syntactically complete br br br Structural completeness br br In superintuitionistic and modal logics a logic is structurally complete if every admissible rule is derivable br br br Model completeness br br A theory is model complete if and only if every embedding of its models is an elementary embedding br br br
