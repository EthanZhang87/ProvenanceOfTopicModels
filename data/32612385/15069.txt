id: 15069
In mathematics an identity function also called an identity relation identity map or identity transformation is a function that always returns the value that was used as its argument unchanged That is when f is the identity function the equality f x x is true for all values of x to which f can be applied br br br Definition br Formally if X is a set the identity function f on X is defined to be a function with X as its domain and codomain satisfying br br In other words the function value f x in the codomain X is always the same as the input element x in the domain X The identity function on X is clearly an injective function as well as a surjective function its codomain is also its range so it is bijective br The identity function f on X is often denoted by idX br In set theory where a function is defined as a particular kind of binary relation the identity function is given by the identity relation or diagonal of X br br br Algebraic properties br If f X Y is any function then f idX f idY f where denotes function composition In particular idX is the identity element of the monoid of all functions from X to X under function composition br Since the identity element of a monoid is unique one can alternately define the identity function on M to be this identity element Such a definition generalizes to the concept of an identity morphism in category theory where the endomorphisms of M need not be functions br br br Properties br The identity function is a linear operator when applied to vector spaces br In an n dimensional vector space the identity function is represented by the identity matrix In regardless of the basis chosen for the space br The identity function on the positive integers is a completely multiplicative function essentially multiplication by considered in number theory br In a metric space the identity function is trivially an isometry An object without any symmetry has as its symmetry group the trivial group containing only this isometry symmetry type C br In a topological space the identity function is always continuous br The identity function is idempotent br br br See also br Identity matrix br Inclusion map br Indicator function br br br
