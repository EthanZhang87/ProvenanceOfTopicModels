title: Pathological (mathematics)
id: 372742
In mathematics when a mathematical phenomenon runs counter to some intuition then the phenomenon is sometimes called pathological On the other hand if a phenomenon does not run counter to intuition it is sometimes called well behaved or nice These terms are sometimes useful in mathematical research and teaching but there is no strict mathematical definition of pathological or well behaved br br br In analysis br A classic example of a pathology is the Weierstrass function a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere The sum of a differentiable function and the Weierstrass function is again continuous but nowhere differentiable so there are at least as many such functions as differentiable functions In fact using the Baire category theorem one can show that continuous functions are generically nowhere differentiable br Such examples were deemed pathological when they were first discovered To quote Henri Poincar br br Logic sometimes breeds monsters For half a century there has been springing up a host of weird functions which seem to strive to have as little resemblance as possible to honest functions that are of some use No more continuity or else continuity but no derivatives etc More than this from the point of view of logic it is these strange functions that are the most general those that are met without being looked for no longer appear as more than a particular case and they have only quite a little corner left them br Formerly when a new function was invented it was in view of some practical end To day they are invented on purpose to show our ancestors reasonings at fault and we shall never get anything more than that out of them br br If logic were the teacher s only guide he would have to begin with the most general that is to say with the most weird functions He would have to set the beginner to wrestle with this collection of monstrosities If you don t do so the logicians might say you will only reach exactness by stages br Since Poincar nowhere differentiable functions have been shown to appear in basic physical and biological processes such as Brownian motion and in applications such as the Black Scholes model in finance br Counterexamples in Analysis is a whole book of such counterexamples br Another example of pathological function is Du Bois Reymond continuous function that can t be represented as a Fourier series br br br In voting br br Elections where voting systems exhibit counterintuitive or undesirable behavior are often called perverse or pathological The spoiler effect is a well known example of an electoral pathology Ranked choice voting the single transferable vote is commonly described as an unusually pathological social choice function because of its tendency to eliminate majority preferred candidates for winning too many votes br br br In topology br One famous counterexample in topology is the Alexander horned sphere showing that topologically embedding the sphere S in R may fail to separate the space cleanly As a counterexample it motivated mathematicians to define the tameness property which suppresses the kind of wild behavior exhibited by the horned sphere wild knot and other similar examples br Like many other pathologies the horned sphere in a sense plays on infinitely fine recursively generated structure which in the limit violates ordinary intuition In this case the topology of an ever descending chain of interlocking loops of continuous pieces of the sphere in the limit fully reflects that of the common sphere and one would expect the outside of it after an embedding to work the same Yet it does not it fails to be simply connected br For the underlying theory see Jordan Sch nflies theorem br Counterexamples in Topology is a whole book of such counterexamples br br br Well behaved br Mathematicians and those in related sciences very frequently speak of whether a mathematical object a function a set a space of one sort or another is well behaved While the term has no fixed formal definition it generally refers to the quality of satisfying a list of prevailing conditions which might be dependent on context mathematical interests fashion and taste To ensure that an object is well behaved mathematicians introduce further axioms to narrow down the domain of study This has the benefit of making analysis easier but produces a loss of generality of any conclusions reached br In both pure and applied mathematics e g optimization numerical integration mathematical physics well behaved also means not violating any assumptions needed to successfully apply whatever analysis is being discussed br The opposite case is usually labeled pathological It is not unusual to have situations in which most cases in terms of cardinality or measure are pathological but the pathological cases will not arise in practice unless constructed deliberately br The term well behaved is generally applied in an absolute sense either something is well behaved or it is not For example br br In algorithmic inference a well behaved statistic is monotonic well defined and sufficient br In B zout s theorem two polynomials are well behaved and thus the formula given by the theorem for the number of their intersections is valid if their polynomial greatest common divisor is a constant br A meromorphic function is a ratio of two well behaved functions in the sense of those two functions being holomorphic br The Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions are first order necessary conditions for a solution in a well behaved nonlinear programming problem to be optimal a problem is referred to as well behaved if some regularity conditions are satisfied br In probability events contained in the probability space s corresponding sigma algebra are well behaved as are measurable functions br Unusually the term could also be applied in a comparative sense br br In calculus br Analytic functions are better behaved than general smooth functions br Smooth functions are better behaved than general differentiable functions br Continuous differentiable functions are better behaved than general continuous functions The larger the number of times the function can be differentiated the more well behaved it is br Continuous functions are better behaved than Riemann integrable functions on compact sets br Riemann integrable functions are better behaved than Lebesgue integrable functions br Lebesgue integrable functions are better behaved than general functions br In topology continuous functions are better behaved than discontinuous ones br Euclidean space is better behaved than non Euclidean geometry br Attractive fixed points are better behaved than repulsive fixed points br Hausdorff topologies are better behaved than those in arbitrary general topology br Borel sets are better behaved than arbitrary sets of real numbers br Spaces with integer dimension are better behaved than spaces with fractal dimension br In abstract algebra br Groups are better behaved than magmas and semigroups br Abelian groups are better behaved than non Abelian groups br Finitely generated Abelian groups are better behaved than non finitely generated Abelian groups br Finite dimensional vector spaces are better behaved than infinite dimensional ones br Fields are better behaved than skew fields or general rings br Separable field extensions are better behaved than non separable ones br Normed division algebras are better behaved than general composition algebras br br br Pathological examples br br Pathological examples often have some undesirable or unusual properties that make it difficult to contain or explain within a theory Such pathological behaviors often prompt new investigation and research which leads to new theory and more general results Some important historical examples of this are br br Ranked choice voting is commonly described as a pathological social choice function because of its tendency to eliminate candidates for winning too many votes br The discovery of irrational numbers by the school of Pythagoras in ancient Greece for example the length of the diagonal of a unit square that is br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle sqrt br br br The discovery of complex numbers in the th century in order to find the roots of cubic and quartic polynomial functions br Some number fields have rings of integers that do not form a unique factorization domain for example the extended field br br br br br Q br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb Q sqrt br br br The discovery of fractals and other rough geometric objects see Hausdorff dimension br Weierstrass function a real valued function on the real line that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere br Test functions in real analysis and distribution theory which are infinitely differentiable functions on the real line that are everywhere outside of a given limited interval An example of such a function is the test function br br br br br br t br br br br br br br br br br e br br br br br br br br br br br t br br br br br br br br br br br br br br t br br br br br br br br br br br br br

almost everywhere br Satisfaction classes containing intuitively false arithmetical statements can be constructed for countable recursively saturated models of Peano arithmetic br The Osgood curve is a Jordan curve unlike most space filling curves of positive area br An exotic sphere is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the standard Euclidean n sphere br At the time of their discovery each of these was considered highly pathological today each has been assimilated into modern mathematical theory These examples prompt their observers to correct their beliefs or intuitions and in some cases necessitate a reassessment of foundational definitions and concepts Over the course of history they have led to more correct more precise and more powerful mathematics For example the Dirichlet function is Lebesgue integrable and convolution with test functions is used to approximate any locally integrable function by smooth functions br Whether a behavior is pathological is by definition subject to personal intuition Pathologies depend on context training and experience and what is pathological to one researcher may very well be standard behavior to another br Pathological examples can show the importance of the assumptions in a theorem For example in statistics the Cauchy distribution does not satisfy the central limit theorem even though its symmetric bell shape appears similar to many distributions which do it fails the requirement to have a mean and standard deviation which exist and that are finite br Some of the best known paradoxes such as Banach Tarski paradox and Hausdorff paradox are based on the existence of non measurable sets Mathematicians unless they take the minority position of denying the axiom of choice are in general resigned to living with such sets br br br Computer science br In computer science pathological has a slightly different sense with regard to the study of algorithms Here an input or set of inputs is said to be pathological if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm such as a violation of its average case complexity or even its correctness For example hash tables generally have pathological inputs sets of keys that collide on hash values Quicksort normally has br br br br O br br n br log br br br n br br br br br displaystyle O n log n br br time complexity but deteriorates to br br br br O br br br n br br br br br br br br displaystyle O n br br when it is given input that triggers suboptimal behavior br The term is often used pejoratively as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice compare with Byzantine On the other hand awareness of pathological inputs is important as they can be exploited to mount a denial of service attack on a computer system Also the term in this sense is a matter of subjective judgment as with its other senses Given enough run time a sufficiently large and diverse user community or other factors an input which may be dismissed as pathological could in fact occur as seen in the first test flight of the Ariane br br br Exceptions br br A similar but distinct phenomenon is that of exceptional objects and exceptional isomorphisms which occurs when there are a small number of exceptions to a general pattern such as a finite set of exceptions to an otherwise infinite rule By contrast in cases of pathology often most or almost all instances of a phenomenon are pathological e g almost all real numbers are irrational br Subjectively exceptional objects such as the icosahedron or sporadic simple groups are generally considered beautiful unexpected examples of a theory while pathological phenomena are often considered ugly as the name implies Accordingly theories are usually expanded to include exceptional objects For example the exceptional Lie algebras are included in the theory of semisimple Lie algebras the axioms are seen as good the exceptional objects as unexpected but valid br By contrast pathological examples are instead taken to point out a shortcoming in the axioms requiring stronger axioms to rule them out For example requiring tameness of an embedding of a sphere in the Sch nflies problem In general one may study the more general theory including the pathologies which may provide its own simplifications the real numbers have properties very different from the rationals and likewise continuous maps have very different properties from smooth ones but also the narrower theory from which the original examples were drawn br br br See also br Fractal curve br
