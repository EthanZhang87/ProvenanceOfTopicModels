opponents and knock them out of the arena As a character s damage percentage increases they fly back further when attacked and may eventually be knocked far enough out of the playing field to be knocked out To assist players during a battle items sometimes appear on the battlefield most of which represent the various video games represented in the series An item called a Smash Ball allows players to use a powerful character specific attack known as a Final Smash Another item is an Assist Trophy which summons various non playable characters from a represented series onto the field to assist the summoner Like its predecessors Super Smash Bros features collectible in game trophies based on characters or items seen in various Nintendo or third party games Each stage now features an alternate Omega form which replaces the stage s layout with a flat surface with ledges on both sides and removes all stage hazards similar to the stage Final Destination a flat medium sized stage with no hazards Certain stages collectible trophies and game features are exclusive to each version with the Wii U version primarily featuring elements taken from home console titles and the DS version taking elements primarily from handheld titles Both games feature revisited stages from past entries in the series and new stages representing newly introduced properties or recent entries in existing ones br New to the series is the ability to customize both existing characters and custom Mii Fighters altering their attacks and giving them unique power ups These characters can be transferred between the DS and Wii U versions of the game as well as certain items earned in specific modes Additionally players can use Amiibo to train computer controlled players and import them into a match

can make the game more difficult by spending in game currency to earn greater rewards The Home Run Contest game from Melee also returns with a competitive variation for up to four players Both versions share two new modes Target Blast has players beat up a ticking bomb before launching it into a set of targets to earn as many points as possible by causing chain reactions Trophy Rush has players clear out falling crates to build up a Fever meter and quickly earn new trophies and customization items br In addition to a moderation system to prevent griefing the game features an online ranking system called Global Smash Power for a player s solo mode score which shows how many other players someone has outscored rather than listing their position on a leaderboard Although the game does not feature a ranking system for online matches matchmaking between players of similar skill levels was introduced Online also features Spectator Mode where spectators can place bets on other

Squirtle and Ivysaur in the Pok mon Trainer s team in Brawl Dr Mario who first appeared in Super Smash Bros Melee makes his return to the roster after his absence in Brawl The Ice Climbers were

Downloadable characters br In addition to the main roster seven additional characters including three returning characters and four newcomers were released as downloadable content between April and February Mewtwo who last appeared in Melee was released on April but was made available on April for Club Nintendo members who purchased and registered both DS and Wii U versions of the game before March Roy from Fire Emblem The Binding Blade who last appeared in Melee and Lucas from Mother who last appeared in Brawl along with Ryu from Capcom s Street Fighter franchise were released on June Cloud Strife from Square Enix s Final Fantasy VII was released on December following increasing requests for Final Fantasy series characters Finally Corrin from Fire Emblem Fates and Bayonetta from Sega and Nintendo s Bayonetta series were released on February in North America and in Europe and Japan the next day Bayonetta was chosen as the overall winner worldwide among negotiable and realizable characters in a player nominated ballot which ran between April and October ranking first in Europe and among the top five in North America Sakurai and former Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata decided not to reveal the top requested fighters of the poll believing if they had people might demand them from the respective game companies which would cause some inconvenience to any negotiations In October Sakurai revealed that Sora from the Kingdom Hearts series and Banjo and Kazooie from the Banjo Kazooie series had been the two top requested fighters in the poll both were ultimately added to the series as DLC characters for Super Smash Bros Ultimate Corrin was developed as a downloadable character in response to the critical and commercial success of Fire Emblem Fates in Japan and in anticipation for the game s worldwide localization br The downloadable content is no longer available to purchase due to the closure of the Nintendo eShop for Nintendo DS and Wii U in March Previously purchased DLC for the Nintendo DS version of the game was no longer reinstallable due an issue related to the Nintendo Network shutdown on April this issue was fixed by April br br br Development br Former Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata first announced that a new Super Smash Bros game was planned for Nintendo DS and Wii U at E in June but development only officially began following the completion of series creator Masahiro Sakurai s other project Kid Icarus Uprising in March The game was later revealed to be a joint project between Bandai Namco Studios and Sora Ltd with various staff members from Bandai Namco s Soulcalibur and Tekken series assisting Sakurai in development Other companies also assisted with its development such as tri Crescendo Sakurai who was previously the sole person responsible for balance in the series multiple fighters has involved more staff to further improve the game s competitive balance The game was officially revealed at E on June during a Nintendo Direct Along with screenshots being posted each weekday on the game s official website and Miiverse community various cinematic trailers were released introducing each of the brand new fighters Sakurai chose to use these trailers which benefit from Internet sharing as opposed to including a story campaign similar to the Subspace Emissary mode featured in Brawl as he believed the impact of seeing the mode s cinematic cutscenes for the first time was ruined by people uploading said scenes to video sharing websites br At E Sakurai stated that the tripping mechanic introduced in Brawl had been omitted with him also stating that the gameplay was between the fast paced and competitive style of Melee and the slower and more casual style of Brawl While the game does not feature cross platform play between the Wii U and DS due to each version featuring certain exclusive stages and game modes there is the option to transfer customized characters and items between the two versions The game builds upon the previous game s third party involvement with the addition of third party characters such as Capcom s Mega Man and Bandai Namco s Pac Man as well as the return of Sega s Sonic the Hedgehog This involvement expands beyond playable characters as other third party characters such as Ubisoft s Rayman are also included in the game as trophies The addition of Mii characters was made in response to the growing number of requests from fans to have their dream characters included in the game To prevent potential bullying as well as to maintain game balance online Mii Fighters cannot be used in online matches against strangers The decision to release the Wii U version at a later date from the DS version was made to allow each version to receive a dedicated debugging period Hardware limitations on the Nintendo DS led to various design choices such as the removal of mid match transformations the lack of Circle Pad Pro support and the absence of the Ice Climbers from the NES game Ice Climber who were previously playable in both Melee and Brawl br In late August a series of allegedly leaked photos and videos of the DS version were uploaded to the Internet revealing at the time several unannounced fighters The original videos were removed shortly thereafter citing a copyright claim by Nintendo of America These leaks were confirmed on September when various gamers in Japan and Taiwan obtained the DS version two days prior to its release date and streamed footage of the game on Twitch br br br Music br Like previous games in the series Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U features many original and re arranged musical pieces from various gaming franchises Both versions have multiple musical tracks that can be selected and listened to using the My Music feature including pieces taken from earlier Super Smash Bros games The DS version features less music altogether than the Wii U version however and only has two songs per stage because of size limitations The DS version also has a Play in Sleep Mode option allowing players to listen to the game s music from the sound menu while the system is in sleep mode br Various well known video game composers and musicians such as Masashi Hamauzu Yuzo Koshiro Yasunori Mitsuda Motoi Sakuraba Yoko Shimomura Mahito Yokota Akari Kaida Michiru Yamane Koji Kondo Kazumi Totaka and Masafumi Takada among many others contributed arrangements for the game while the original score was written by Bandai Namco s internal sound team A two disc promotional soundtrack featuring certain selections from the game was available for Club Nintendo members who registered both versions of the game before January br br br Release br In an announcement for the Super Smash Bros Invitational a tournament which was held at E Nintendo revealed an official GameCube controller adapter for the Wii U which allows players to use GameCube controllers with the game as well as a Smash Bros themed game controller The
