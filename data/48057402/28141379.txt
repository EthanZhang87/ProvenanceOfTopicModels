Street Fighter X Tekken pronounced Street Fighter Cross Tekken is a crossover fighting game developed and published by Capcom and released in March for the PlayStation and Xbox in May for Windows and in October for the PlayStation Vita The game features characters from both the Street Fighter franchise and Namco s Tekken series In the game each player selects two characters respectively and face other as duos in tag team fighting matches with the objective to knock out one of the members from the opposing team deplete the opponent s health In addition to the game s multiplayer modes the game also features a single player Story mode with a plot revolving around a mysterious object called the Pandora br The game is the product of a partnership between Namco and Capcom that previously produced the role playing game Namco Capcom As Street Fighter X Tekken was made by Capcom with Namco being involved more in the licensing of the Tekken cast the gameplay is based on the D gameplay of Street Fighter with projectile moves such as the Hadouken as opposed to the Tekken series Unique features in Street Fighter X Tekken include the Gem System which allows players to equip special gems to power up various character attributes and Pandora Mode in which a character s strength and abilities are temporarily augmented Namco was also set to produce their own take on the crossover Tekken X Street Fighter which would follow their D style of gameplay however development has been on hold since br The game was well received by critics who complimented the roster and deep game mechanics Nevertheless it fell short of Capcom s sales expectations In addition Capcom s release of downloadable content DLC for the game was met with criticism when it was revealed that the company was charging for access to characters that were already on the game disc br br br Gameplay br br Developed by Capcom the core gameplay is similar to that of the Street Fighter series incorporating elements such as Super Combos and EX Attacks Players each choose two fighters from the Street Fighter and Tekken series Both sets of characters are controlled using the Street Fighter six button system but the Tekken characters are able to perform Tekken style combos using the primary four buttons in a similar fashion to the Tekken four button system These fighters can be switched out normally or during certain combos As fights go on players build up power in a three sectioned meter at the bottom of the screen referred to as the Cross Gauge which allow the player to perform various techniques depending on how much of the gauge is filled such as EX Attacks Cancels Super Arts and various Cross techniques detailed below Additionally each fighter possesses one special attack that can be charged into an EX Attack or Super Art without any cost to the Cross Gauge As opposed to the other crossover fighting games released by Capcom in which the player must eliminate all the opponent s fighters to win victory conditions are more similar to Tekken Tag Tournament in which the first player to have one of their fighters health bars reduced to zero loses the round thereby the player who wins the most rounds wins the match br The tag team element of the game is heavily emphasized with players being able to switch between the two characters in their team in a variety of manners Switch Cancel allows players to switch partners in the middle of a combo whilst Cross Rush combos involve launching the opponent into the air before swapping partners and continuing the combo Cross Arts which require a full Cross Gauge allows players to chain together each character s Super Combo in one straight attack whilst the Cross Assault mechanic allows players to simultaneously control both characters in their team until the Cross Gauge runs out br The game also has two new game mechanics the Gem System and Pandora Mode Players equip up to three gems to their characters which provide different stat boosts depending on the type of gem Six varieties of gems exist attack defense speed vitality assist and Cross Gauge Each gem and its effects are designated by a specific color and will activate as the players fulfill certain conditions during battle When a character on a player s team has less than health remaining that character can be sacrificed in order to activate Pandora Mode which gives the remaining fighter increased strength and an infinite Cross Gauge However this state has a time limit and the player automatically loses the round if they cannot defeat the opponent before the Pandora state runs out br br The game features a basic color edit mode It also has various online options Two players can battle on the same team one controlling each character and face off in four player matches Scramble mode allows four players to fight simultaneously in pairs of two The game also supported online training modes which can be played competitively or cooperatively with two players as well as support the Fight Request feature br br br Plot br The center of the conflict between the Street Fighter and Tekken universes is a cubical object that crash lands in Antarctica The object is of a mysterious origin and researchers worldwide are unable to determine what purpose it serves The only thing that can be understood is that when beings come into conflict around this object it releases a water like energy that brings more power to the combatants Due to the object s tendency to react to conflict between beings they name it Pandora Whilst a standard story is given to most combinations of fighters specific teams such as Ryu and Ken or Kazuya and Nina receive their own unique story elements and rival battles cutscenes br br br Characters

brilliantly robust there are loads of new moves to master and the Tekken characters slot in more comfortably than a bum in a favourite armchair br PC Gamer said that Visually it s an astounding
