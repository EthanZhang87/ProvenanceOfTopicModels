the ghosts and their leader the Ghost Lord and transforming into Pac Man The game was made to break the mold of previous Pac Man games such as having a grittier look Namco s Japanese division put pressure on the project with strict guidelines Anderson recalls being unable to use a D render of the character as a reference requiring the team to make it themselves Development was assisted by designer Scott Rogers with music composed by Tommy Tallarico When the prototype was presented to Namco they became unhappy with it and cancelled it for quality reasons firing the entire development

Pac In Time During development Rogers noted that trying to live up to the game s source material put a large amount of pressure on the team claiming that most players were only familiar with the original Pac Man and Ms Pac Man with no memories for later games in the series which left the team having to make the game appeal to players of those two games The game originally featured cameos from other Namco characters including Taizo Hori from Dig Dug and Valkyrie from Valkyrie no Densetsu however these were replaced with members of Pac Man s family in the final version a Pooka from Dig Dug

Dennis composing the music The game was first shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo E tradeshow in Atlanta Georgia under the working title Pac Man D Rogers recalls it being a popular title saying
