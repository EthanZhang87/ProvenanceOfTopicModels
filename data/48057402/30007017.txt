Namco Generations from the game br br br History br The Namco Generations series was led by chief producer Hideo Yoshizawa A highly respected game developer in Japan he is best known as the creator of Klonoa and Mr Driller two widely successful series for developer Namco The idea for the project came from an attempt by Namco Bandai Games to recreate the healthy proximity between developers and consumers which was a common trait of the original Namco company Namco Bandai also saw it as an opportunity to revive and modernize many of their older intellectual properties and to revive interest in them The name and idea of the label is derived from the video game newsletter Namco Community Magazine NG published in Japan throughout the s and early s as a way for Namco to connect with their fans and provide news on their upcoming titles Assisting in production of the series came from Tadashi Iguchi the designer for Pac Man Championship Edition and Galaga Legions both of which were successful updates of classic arcade games br When laying down the foundations for the brand the company focused primarily on allowing consumers to interact directly with developers through digital newsletters and social media platforms which they felt would allow for more feedback on projects Namco Bandai Games America vice president Carlson Choi told IGN that the brand was to solidify NAMCO BANDAI Games commitment to provide high quality and compelling content through the digital space The company also wanted the branded games to raise the bar in terms of content and to allow players to experience these older games in a brand new way br Namco Bandai officially unveiled the Namco Generations brand on November Three games were announced for release under the label Pac Man Championship Edition DX and Galaga Legions DX both being updates of Iguchi s previous projects and Aero Cross a modernized remake of Metro Cross Each game featured an option to view a special NG News digital newsletter which featured developer interviews gameplay tips and information regarding upcoming titles Pac Man Championship Edition DX was released a day later on November for the Xbox and PlayStation to critical acclaim being listed among the greatest video game remakes of all time and as a good example on how to successfully revive a classic video game Galaga Legions DX was published several months later on June also to positive reception specifically towards its unique gameplay and presentation In June Namco Bandai unveiled a fourth game under the brand a reboot of the Japan exclusive arcade game Dancing Eyes Due to the game s strong sexual nature and for being rather obscure it was met with dire confusion from publications Siliconera speculated that modern remakes of Battle City Rally X and Starblade were also in the works br Updates on the project began to slow down by the end of with the company posting very little information regarding the brand and the games under production for it In April Japanese magazine Famitsu reported that Namco Bandai decided to cancel the reboot of Dancing Eyes In December Aero Cross and subsequently the Namco Generations label as a whole were also cancelled Namco Bandai cited various circumstances as the reason for the project s termination Publications have speculated the lack of interest and a wider audience caused the brand to be discontinued The DX versions of Pac Man Championship Edition and Galaga Legions are still available on their respective platforms the former removing the Namco Generations newsletter entirely when it was updated in br Video game publications have deemed the Namco Generations brand as a failure saying that a general lack of a large audience and silence towards the project were factors in its downfall JG Fletcher of Engadget blamed the cancellation of the remaining two games and a general lack of updates from Bandai Namco for the Namco Generations label being discontinued He noted the company s unusual quiet nature towards the project in general as well as commenting that neither of the cancelled titles lived up to the expectations of the first two games Fletcher also felt that Dancing Eyes felt more like a tribute to an amusing idea rather than an attempt to truly resurrect an older IP writing I m not overly interested in seeing increasing amounts of polygonal skin Rather than prurient interest in cartoon women my fascination with Dancing Eyes is more about seeing Namco pay tribute to something that was at best an amusing idea and at worst something Namco had no sense reminding people of Siliconera showed disappointment towards the project s cancellation for being the end of an era for the company saying With no more Namco Generations titles in the pipeline it looks like the age of modernized Namco arcade games is over br br br See also br ShiftyLook br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Official website
