Pac Man The New Adventures known in Japan as Hello Pac Man Har Pakkuman is a side scrolling point and click adventure game in the Pac Man series developed and published by Namco Instead of being a maze game like the majority of its predecessors Pac Man incorporates light point and click adventure game elements The game borrows its structure and certain elements from Pac Land and also appears to contain certain elements from the animated series such as Pac Man s family and a main villain commanding the ghosts br The game was released in for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and was released for the Sega Genesis exclusively in the US br br br Gameplay br br Pac Man The New Adventures is a graphic adventure game a vast departure from its predecessors Players assume the role of Pac Man as he must carry out different quests given to him by other characters Many of these involve retrieving a specific item such as a bottle of milk or a flower Unlike other adventure games players cannot control Pac Man directly who will wander and interact with the in game world at his own pace Instead players use a slingshot to guide or influence Pac Man to his destination or to attract his attention towards a specific object The player is able to also use the slingshot on Pac Man which can result in various changes to Pac Man s current mood or can wake him up after fainting br In each quest the player will need to solve puzzles to progress The solutions to these puzzles are based on Pac Man s moods which differ based on the player s actions For example the player can shoot down an apple from a tree which Pac Man will eat and makes him happier while shooting Pac Man in the face will make him irritated or depressed Pac Man s moods will also determine how cooperative he becomes for instance making Pac Man too happy will cause him to become smug and cocky and as a result less willing to follow the orders of the player Some sections of the game follow Pac Man riding on a hang glider or in a minecart through chase scenes which require fast reflexes from the player Pac Man may sometimes encounter his enemies Blinky Pinky Inky and Clyde where he will immediately become frightened and run around the screen Feeding Pac Man a Power Pellet stored in an inventory at the bottom corner of the screen will transform him into Super Pac Man giving him the ability to fly at high speeds and eat the ghosts If the player visits an arcade they can play the original Pac Man Finding three game cartridges across locations in the game will allow them to play Ms Pac Man in the SNES version or a new original game titled Pac Jr in the Sega Genesis version br br br Plot br After an introductory sequence in which Pac Man introduces himself and the game s mechanics the plot

Ghost Witch in which a final battle between Super Pac Man and the Gum Monster takes place Super Pac Man defeats the Gum Monster with the Ghost Witch and her minions fleeing to plan their next scheme Despite not being able to save the children s ABC gum Pac Man is congratulated by the town and his family as a hero br br br Reception br br The game received mixed to positive reviews when it was first released br GamePro held that on the one hand the game is innovative intriguing and sometimes fun but on the other hand the inability to control Pac Man directly can be annoying and the game sometimes makes one wish for the simplicity of the original Pac Man Their review of the Genesis version was more positive While the reviewer acknowledged that the gameplay is an acquired taste he wholeheartedly approved of the innovative challenge and also praised the game s humorous animations and gibberish voicing In November Famitsu magazine s Reader Cross Review gave the Super Famicom version of the game a out of br Entertainment Weekly gave the game a C and wrote that Of course there s nothing wrong with updating old boomer faves but some games don t translate as well as others The original Pac Man for instance was wonderfully algebraic in its simplicity An animated yellow dot scoots around a maze gobbling up or running away from pursuing ghosts Pac Man The New Adventures is a Super Mario type action game hampered by what Namco calls its character guidance interface Players can t control Pac directly they influence his actions by calling attention to obstacles Sound frustrating It is I needed a dozen tries just to figure out how to play this game br br br br br br External links br Pac Man The New Adventures at GameFAQs br Game commentary column at CNN com
