Pac Pal is a maze chase arcade game developed and published by Namco It is part of the company s Pac Man series and the third to have been produced in house Players control Pac Man as he must eat the items in an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts that pursue him Pac Man is assisted by a green colored creature named Miru also called Mil the titular Pal who brings the items back to the center box Pac Man can also collect power ups that allow him to briefly stun the ghosts br Pac Pal is largely based on Super Pac Man Namco s attempt at making a follow up to the original Pac Man When Super Pac Man proved to be unsuccessful Pac Pal was created to refine many of its mechanics and build on its concept The game was intended to be released in North America by Midway Games under the name Pac Man Chomp Chomp which replaced Miru with Pac Man s dog from the Hanna Barbera cartoon series Chomp Chomp was never released in America and was limited to a run of machines produced for several European countries Retrospectively it has received attention for its premise and differences compared to its predecessors and has been listed among the strangest games in the Pac Man franchise It is included in several Namco compilations for various platforms br br br Gameplay br br Controls consist of a four position joystick and a button Using the joystick the player guides Pac Man through an enclosed maze in which several items are locked behind doors Several face down cards are scattered throughout the maze when Pac Man runs over one of these it flips over to reveal one of the items which becomes unlocked so Pac Man can eat it Two items in each maze are power ups which correspond to S cards Upon eating one of these Pac Man temporarily turns blue and grows larger the player can now press the button to fire a beam that briefly stuns the ghosts Items include a flagship from Galaxian a red car from Rally X a trumpet a snowman and a miniature Pac Man The items are simply different cosmetically and all of them have the same effect br Assisting Pac Man is the titular Pal character Miru a green colored creature with a pink bow Whenever any items are unlocked Miru will try to pick one up and carry it toward the center box if Pac Man does not catch up to her and eat the item before she enters the box it disappears Once all the items are gone the level ends and the player earns bonus points for each item eaten receiving a larger bonus for preventing Miru from taking any of them into the box An orange area immediately below the center box causes the ghosts to slow down whenever they are inside and obscures both them and Pac Man leaving only the ghosts eyes visible The third level and every fourth level thereafter is a bonus stage with cards and no ghosts one card shows Miru one shows the ghost Blinky and the other eight have dollar signs Points are awarded for each card flipped and Miru s card doubles the total The stage ends immediately if Blinky is found but the player earns a larger bonus for finding him last The player loses one life whenever Pac Man touches a non stunned ghost but can safely run through Miru at any time When all lives are lost the game ends br br br Development and release br Pac Pal was developed and published by Namco in July in Japan It is the third game in the Pac Man series that was made by Namco themselves as Pac Man s North American distributor Midway Games had produced many of their own sequels that Namco had little involvement with Pac Pal is largely based on Super Pac Man Namco s own sequel to the original and retains a similar graphical style and many of its mechanics With the Pac Man brand increasing in popularity in Japan Namco sought to produce a follow up that matched its success Super Pac Man was largely unsuccessful so Pac Pal was made to improve on its flaws and update its core features Yuriko Keino who is best known for her work on games such as Dig Dug and Xevious composed the soundtrack Namco and Midway had plans to release Pac Pal in North America under the new name Pac Man Chomp Chomp which replaced Miru with Pac Man s spherical dog from the Hanna Barbera cartoon series Pac Man Chomp Chomp was never released in North America due to the market being over saturated with Pac Man games A limited run of arcade units was produced for several European countries br Pac Pal never saw a home release until where it was included in the Japan exclusive arcade collection Namco History Vol for Windows Toy manufacturer Jakks Pacific included the game in many of their Pac Man branded plug n play controllers throughout the mid s Pac Pal is also included in a few Namco compilations such as Namco Museum Remix Namco Museum Virtual Arcade and Namco Museum Megamix To commemorate the launch of the Pac Man and the Ghostly Adventures television series Bandai added Pac Pal to their Pac Man Connect Play controller in Pac Pal is included in Pac Man Museum alongside several other games in the series In Arcade UP released a Pac Man counter cade arcade machine that includes the original Pac Man and Pac Pal Pac Pal is included in Pac Man Museum as a unlockable title br br br Reception br br While Pac Pal saw success in its first few months on the market it was relatively a commercial failure and remained obscure for many years The game s drastic differences compared to the original Pac Man and Super Pac Man and its limited production run have been attributed to its downfall Retrospectively Pac Pal has gained attention for its many changes to the gameplay of its predecessors and is seen among the stranger entries in the Pac Man franchise br In Anthony Baize of Allgame was largely critical of the game He described its gameplay as horrible and criticized it for being too distant from the gameplay of the original Pac Man He wrote Overall Pac Pal is a travesty In my mind it holds the title as worst and weirdest Pac Man sequel ever unleashed upon the world Avoid this game In his review of the Xbox version of Pac Man Museum Hardcore Gamer s Jahanzeb Khan called it a far more unusual sequel to Pac Man and criticized Miru for being more of a hindrance than an aid to the player Writing for Paste Preston Burt listed it among the weirdest Pac Man sequels for the addition of a second player character and its premise saying that If you have no idea what s happening in this game you re not alone br Jeremy Parish of USgamer retrospectively reviewed Pac Pal in commemoration of its th anniversary in He claimed that it made for one of the stranger entries in the series for its substantially different gameplay compared to Pac Man and Ms Pac Man Parish also said that many of the game s additions namely Miru and the power up items detracted from Pac Man s more minimalist approach and appeal Ultimately Parish said that the new mechanics and difference in play made it a much more difficult and stressful game compared to its predecessors feeling that players would have a hard time succumbing to its strange ideas and gameplay that had a more action oriented pace to it He concluded his review with While Namco clearly hoped to sustain Pac Man s tremendous legacy with an inventive follow up Pac Pal hastened the series demise Pac Pal was one in a string of duds and doesn t hold up very well in retrospect it s a real oddball of a game Sometimes though weirdness is just as interesting in hindsight as true significance Bobinator of Hardcore Gaming argued that the difference in gameplay made Pac Pal standout from other Pac Man sequels and that it helped make the game feel fresh and unique He also believed that it represents Namco s willingness to experiment with the mechanics and concepts established in the original Bobinator wrote Sadly this would be the last time Namco would ever experiment quite this much with their well used maze game formula While Pac Man would soon move into new genres entirely later maze games would choose to play it safe Experimentation like this would never be seen in the series again br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Pac Pal at the Killer List of Videogames
