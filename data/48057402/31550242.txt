id: 31550242
World s Biggest Pac Man is a browser game created by Australian website designer Soap Creative along with Microsoft and Namco Bandai Games It is a Pac Man game which differed from the original by having multiple players play together in a series of user created customizable and interlocking mazes The game was announced at the Microsoft MIX Developer Conference on April br The game was built as a HTML project for Microsoft s then new Internet Explorer as well as to commemorate the th anniversary of Pac Man A week after launching it had user designed mazes and nearly million dots eaten Created as a community tribute to the original Pac Man arcade game it followed the guidelines that Namco Bandai originally set for Pac Man The project was designed to be community driven and a team of moderators were implemented to keep an eye out for any offensive mazes that might be created br Although no login is required to play the game users who wish to create their own mazes or post high scores have to sign in using Facebook Connect Although created with Internet Explorer in mind World s Biggest Pac Man is playable on any browser supporting HTML br Around June the site went down showing just a blank page and later a database error The site was back up by July br br br Gameplay br The gameplay for World s Biggest Pac Man is similar to classic Pac Man but with a few differences As before the goal is to eat all of the dots and power pellets in the maze without being caught by the ghosts roaming through it The number of power pellets is not fixed at four but instead determined by the user who created that particular maze In addition there are no tunnels instead doorways at each edge of the screen allow Pac Man to travel to an adjacent maze with a new arrangement of dots and obstacles Every maze has a fresh set of four ghosts but they do not use the doorways The player has the ability to move to a new maze without clearing the current one so they can return to any unfinished maze at a later time The game continues until the player runs out of lives br Another distinct feature in World s Biggest is the ability to construct new mazes adjacent to pre existing ones To build a maze a Facebook account is required and is accessed via the Facebook Connect platform The game also has two high score leader boards one where players could competing against each other for the top of the leader board and the other where countries were ranked based on their players total high score The player also has the option to display high scores online via Facebook br br br Ghosts br One aim of the game besides eating all the Pac Dots is avoiding any of the four ghosts roaming through the maze Running into a ghost will kill Pac Man on contact unless Pac Man consumed a Power Pellet These pellets which can be freely placed when creating a maze a minimum of and a maximum of per maze will turn the tables completely for a period of time by causing the ghosts to turn blue and run away from Pac Man allowing him to eat them In the original game the ghost AI was programmed in a well defined pattern of Scatter Chase and Repeat Unlike the original the time the ghosts remained vulnerable does not diminish as the game progresses to the point where the ghosts could merely reverse direction If the player left a maze without completing it the ghosts will stay where they left off in that maze until Pac Man returned to that maze after which they will begin chasing him again br br br Fruits br The fruits on World s Biggest Pac Man are a potent means to earn additional points The fruits appear upon consuming a certain number of pellets on the current maze and the player can retrieve them as long as they show up but otherwise do not affect the completion of the level By default the fruit will be a point cherry and for every maze cleaned of pellets the next maze attempted will advance to the next fruit and remain until the player finishes another board and the fruit value further increases Once the player has cleared seven boards the bonus fruit will be indefinitely locked at the point key until the game ended br br Cherry or points br Strawberry or points br Peach or points br Apple or points br Melon or points br Galaxian or points br Bell or points br Key points br br br Maze Creation br br World s Biggest Pac Man has a unique feature that distinguishes it from the original game in which users are able to create their own mazes This feature requires Facebook Connect To create a maze users can highlight a square in the maze grid When creating a maze users are able to add walls power pellets delete any excesses or mistakes or simply reset the maze to start over Once the maze is completed users can submit it to add it to the grid alongside other user created mazes At the moment the game has a grid of over x supporting over million mazes Dan Kitzler of West Covina California USA was the first to reach the edge of the supposed X grid on November He went beyond that grid number shattering the illusion that the grid only contains million mazes Dan contacted Ashley Ringrose website creator who admitted he had no idea about the actual size of the maze grid The maze grid was made up of X maze quadrants br br br Reception br The Guardian has called the game an internet hit while ABC News has called it a web sensation br br br High Scores br There was a Guinness World Record for The highest score on World s Biggest Pac Man At the time it was points which was set by Stephen Kish on August They no longer hold such a category on their website That high score was beaten unofficially by a Twitch streamer known as NewTxtDoc He reached a score of over a hour period from the November to November br br br See also br Super Mario
