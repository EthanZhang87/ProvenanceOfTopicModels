akin to a male character but with a bow or dress would be regressive The Guardian columnist Charlie Brooker noted how where Pac Man did not have explicit male identifiers in his design Ms Pac Man had to have female identifiers like lipstick a beauty mark and a bow He commented that despite her portrayal possibly coming off as patronizing it was a more progressive depiction than many female characters in the early s specifically arguing that the industry tended to depict women as damsels or hypersexualized br br br
