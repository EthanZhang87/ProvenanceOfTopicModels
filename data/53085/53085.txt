Toy Story is a American animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures The first installment in the franchise of the same name it was the first entirely computer animated feature film as well as the first feature film from Pixar The film was directed by John Lasseter in his feature directorial debut written by Joss Whedon Andrew Stanton Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow based on a story by Lasseter Stanton Pete Docter and Joe Ranft produced by Bonnie Arnold and Ralph Guggenheim and features the voices of Tom Hanks Tim Allen Annie Potts John Ratzenberger Don Rickles Wallace Shawn and Jim Varney br Taking place in a world where toys come to life when humans are not present the plot of Toy Story focuses on the relationship between an old fashioned pullstring cowboy doll named Woody and a modern space cadet action figure Buzz Lightyear as Woody develops jealousy towards Buzz when he becomes their owner Andy s favorite toy br Following the success of Tin Toy a short film that was released in Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer animated feature film that was told from a small toy s perspective Lasseter Stanton and Docter wrote early story treatments which were rejected by Disney who wanted the film s tone to be edgier After several disastrous story reels production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired toys deeply want children to play with them and this desire drives their hopes fears and actions The studio then consisting of a relatively small number of employees produced Toy Story under minor financial constraints br Toy Story premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November and was released in theaters in North America on November of that year It was the highest grossing film during its opening weekend eventually grossing over million worldwide making it the second highest grossing film of The film received critical acclaim with

of Toy Story launched a multimedia franchise spawning three sequels and a planned fourth sequel beginning with Toy Story a spin off film Lightyear and numerous short films The film also had a theatrical D re release in as part of a double feature with the second film br br br Plot br A group of sentient toys who pretend to be lifeless when humans are around are preparing to move into a new house with their young owner Andy Davis his infant sister Molly and their single mother Mrs Davis Learning that Andy s birthday party has been unexpectedly moved to an earlier date several toys

Sheriff Woody Andy s favorite toy and their de facto leader sends Sarge and his green army men to spy on Andy s birthday party with a baby monitor Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure who believes he is an actual Space Ranger and does not know he is really a toy Buzz impresses the others with his high tech features and becomes Andy s new favorite toy provoking Woody s jealousy br Two days before the move Andy s family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet To ensure Andy brings him along and not Buzz Woody tries knocking Buzz behind the desk with the radio controlled car RC However Buzz is accidentally knocked out of the bedroom window instead and most of the other toys believe Woody has deliberately killed Buzz Andy takes Woody with him but Buzz furiously confronts him in the car The two fight fall out of the car and are left behind after a further quarrel they hitch a ride to the restaurant on a Pizza Planet delivery truck br At Pizza Planet Buzz mistakes a claw crane full of Little Green Men for a rocket and climbs in pursued by Woody Sid Phillips Andy s sadistic next door neighbor takes the two from the crane to his house where they encounter his Bull Terrier Scud and his mutant toys made from parts of other toys he has destroyed br Buzz after watching a television commercial promoting him realizes he is a toy after all He attempts to fly but falls breaks

others also toss him out of the truck Woody and Buzz pursue the truck on RC and the other toys see them and realize their mistake RC s batteries run out forcing Woody to ignite the rocket strapped to Buzz Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes he and Woody glide through the sunroof of Mrs Davis car landing safely inside br As the toys listen in on the Christmas gift

br br Production br br br Development br br John Lasseter s first experience with computer animation was during his work as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation when two of his friends showed him the light cycle scene from Tron It was an eye opening experience that awakened Lasseter to the possibilities offered by the new medium of computer generated animation Lasseter tried to pitch The Brave Little Toaster as a fully computer animated film to Disney but the idea was rejected and Lasseter was fired He then went on to work at Lucasfilm and in he became a founding member of Pixar In Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and Apple Inc co founder Steve Jobs At Pixar Lasseter created short computer animated films to show off the Pixar Image Computer s capabilities In Lasseter produced the short film Tin Toy which was told from the perspective of a toy referencing Lasseter s love of classic toys Tin Toy won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film the first computer generated film to do so br Tin Toy gained Disney s attention and the new team at The Walt Disney Company CEO Michael Eisner and chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg in the film division sought to get Lasseter to come back Lasseter grateful for Jobs faith in him felt compelled to stay with Pixar telling co founder Ed Catmull I can go to Disney and be a director or I can stay here and make history Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film Disney had always made all their movies in house and refused to change this But when Tim Burton who used to work at Disney wanted to buy back the rights to The Nightmare Before Christmas Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney film outside the studio This allowed Pixar to make their movies outside Disney br Both sides were willing Catmull and fellow Pixar co founder Alvy Ray Smith had long wanted to produce a computer animated feature but only by the early s were the computers cheap and powerful enough to make this possible In addition Disney had licensed Pixar s Computer Animation Production System CAPS and that made it the largest customer for Pixar s computers Jobs made it apparent to Katzenberg that although Disney was happy with Pixar it was not the other way around We want to do a film with you said Jobs That would make us happy br Catmull Smith and head of animation Ralph Guggenheim met with Walt Disney Feature Animation president Peter Schneider in the summer of to discuss making a feature film but they found the atmosphere to be puzzling and contentious They later learned that while Katzenberg was pushing the idea of working with Pixar Schneider did not want to bring in a non Disney animation studio Katzenberg arranged to meet directly with the Pixar contingent this time including Lasseter and Jobs The Pixar team proposed a Christmas television special A Tin Toy Christmas as a first step but Katzenberg countered that as long as they were gearing up to transition from second commercials to a half hour special they might as well go all the way and make a feature length film br Katzenberg also made it clear that he was only working with Pixar to get access to Lasseter s talents and that the Pixar team would be signing up to work with a self described tyrant and micro manager However he invited them to talk with Disney s animators and get their opinions on working under him and Lasseter was impressed with what he heard The two companies began negotiations although they disagreed on key points including whether Disney would get the rights to Pixar s animation technology or whether Pixar would retain partial ownership of the films characters and home video and sequel rights As Pixar was nearing bankruptcy and desperate for funds they settled on a deal that would allow Disney to have complete ownership and control of the films and characters including the rights to make sequels without Pixar s involvement while Pixar would get approximately of ticket sales These early negotiations became a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years br An agreement to produce a feature film based on Tin Toy with a working title of Toy Story was finalized and production began soon thereafter br br br Writing br Originally Toy Story was going to feature Tinny the wind up one man band toy from the Tin Toy short film along with the dummy a ventriloquist s dummy While the film s premise was still about toys desire to be played with by children the rest of the film s script which involved Tinny being left behind at a gas station meeting up with the dummy and having a series of adventures before finding their way into a kindergarten classroom where they can be played with every day was quite different Katzenberg was unhappy with the treatment drafted by Lasseter Andrew Stanton and Pete Docter as the two character s motivations were too similar Instead he encouraged them to write it as a buddy film giving the two main characters contrasting personalities and having them only become friends after being forced to work together Lasseter Stanton and Docter delivered a revised treatment in September that more closely resembles the final version of the film Tinny replaces the ventriloquist dummy as a child s favorite toy their bickering causes them to be left behind at a gas station they almost catch up to the family at a pizza restaurant they have to escape a kid that mutilates toys and the movie ends with a chase scene as the two toys try to catch up to the family s moving van br The script went through many changes before the final version of it Lasseter decided Tinny was too antiquated the character was first changed to a military action figure in the likes of G I Joe and was then given a space theme Tinny s name changed to Lunar Larry then Tempus from Morph and eventually Buzz Lightyear after astronaut Buzz Aldrin Lightyear s design was modeled on the suits worn by Apollo astronauts as well as the aforementioned G I Joe action figures Also the green and purple color scheme on Lightyear s suit was inspired by Lasseter and his wife Nancy whose favorite colors are green and purple respectively Woody was inspired by a Casper the Friendly Ghost doll that Lasseter had when he was a child he was a ventriloquist s dummy with a pull string hence the name Woody This was until character designer Bud Luckey suggested that Woody could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy Lasseter liked the contrast between the Western and the science fiction genres and the character immediately changed Eventually all of the ventriloquist dummy aspects of the character were deleted as the dummy looked sneaky and mean However they kept the name Woody to pay homage to the Western actor Woody Strode The story department drew inspiration from films such as Midnight Run and The Odd Couple and Lasseter screened Hayao Miyazaki s Castle in the Sky for further influence br Since Toy Story s script writers had little experience with feature films they attended a seminar given by screenwriter Robert McKee They were inspired by his guidance based on Aristotle s Poetics that the main character in a story should be defined by how they react to the obstacles they face and that it is those obstacles that make characters interesting Disney also appointed the duo Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow and later Joss Whedon to help develop the script Whedon thought that while the script did not work it had a great structure He added the character of Rex and sought a pivotal role for a Barbie doll the latter transformed into Bo Peep as Mattel would not license the character Whedon also re visioned Buzz Lightyear from being a dim witted but cheerful and self aware character to an action figure who isn t aware that he s a toy an epiphany that transformed the film A brainstorming session with members of Disney Animation s creative team resulted in the addition of the three eyed squeaky toy aliens br br br Casting br br Katzenberg approved the script on January at which point voice casting began Paul Newman who subsequently accepted the role of Doc Hudson in the Pixar film Cars was considered for the role of Woody Robin Williams and Clint Eastwood were also considered for Woody but Lasseter always wanted Tom Hanks to play the role Lasseter claimed that Hanks has the ability to take emotions and make them appealing Even if the character like the one in A League of Their Own is down and out and despicable To gauge how an actor s voice might fit with a character Lasseter borrowed a common Disney technique animate a vocal monologue from a well established actor to meld the actor s voice with the appearance or actions of the animated character This early test footage using Hanks voice from Turner Hooch convinced Hanks to sign on to the film br Billy Crystal was approached to play Buzz and was given his own monologue utilizing dialogue from When Harry Met Sally However he turned down the role believing the film would be unsuccessful due to its animation Crystal regretted this upon seeing the film he subsequently accepted the role of Mike Wazowski in the Pixar film Monsters Inc In addition to Crystal Bill Murray Chevy Chase and Jim Carrey along with a number of other actors including Jason Alexander Dan Aykroyd Matthew Broderick Kevin Costner Michael J Fox Richard Gere David Hasselhoff Michael Keaton Wayne Knight Bill Paxton Dennis Quaid Kurt Russell Adam Sandler and John Travolta were also considered for the role of Buzz Lasseter took the role to Tim Allen who was appearing in Disney s Home Improvement and he accepted Crystal later stated in an interview that he would not have been right as Buzz and that Allen was fantastic in the role Before Wallace Shawn and Jim Varney were cast as Rex and Slinky Dog Rick Moranis and John Cleese were originally considered for the roles br To cast Andy Pixar held an open call for young male actors to bring a toy with them John Morris who voices Andy in the film brought multiple toys specifically X Men figures contrary to the instructions of bringing just one and Pixar reacted to his dumping of the toys with laughter br Toy Story was both Hanks and Allen s first animated film and they recorded their lines together to make their characters chemistry and interactions realistic br br br Production shutdown br br Every couple of weeks Lasseter and his team showed Disney their latest storyboards or footage Disney was impressed by Pixar s technical innovation but less so of the plot Katzenberg discarded most of Pixar s script ideas giving his own extensive notes Katzenberg primarily wanted to add more edginess to the two main characters as Disney wanted Toy Story to appeal to both children and adults and they asked for adult references to be added to the film The characters ended up being stripped of their charm with Hanks while recording Woody s dialogue for the story reels pointed out that the Woody character had been made into a real jerk Pixar screened the first half of the film for Disney executives on November an event they later dubbed the Black Friday Incident The results were disastrous and Disney s head of feature animation Peter Schneider halted production Katzenberg asked colleague Thomas Schumacher why the reels were bad to which Schumacher answered Because it s not their movie anymore it s completely not the movie that John set out to make br Lasseter was embarrassed by the current state of the film later recalling It was a story filled with the most unhappy mean characters that I ve ever seen Katzenberg allowed him to take the script back to Pixar for rewrites and the production crew shifted to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script being funded personally by Jobs until Disney resumed production Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant the production shutdown was a very scary time according to story department manager BZ Petroff Schneider appealed directly to Eisner to cancel the project altogether Stanton and the other story artists worked to quickly produce new script pages with help from consultants such as Whedon and the first revisions were completed in two weeks as promised br Pixar s script rewrites took three months and saw Woody transformed from a tyrant to a wise leader It also included a more adult oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than the juvenile group discussion that had existed in earlier drafts Buzz Lightyear s character was also changed to make it more clear to the audience that he genuinely doesn t know he s a toy Katzenberg and Schneider resumed production with the new script by February and the voice actors returned one month later to record their new lines The crew grew from people to and now included animators and technical directors In comparison The Lion King released in required a staff of In the early budgeting process Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost cutting However the million production budget was no longer going to be sufficient and Jobs requested more funds from Disney to compensate them for the time lost in rewrites based on Katzenberg s notes Catmull was able to reach a compromise on a new budget but the incident led Jobs to rethink their deal with Disney br br br Animation br br Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk the magnet for talent was not mediocre pay but the allure of taking part in the first computer animated feature Lasseter said of the challenges of computer animation We had to make things look more organic Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created We had to give the world a sense of history So the doors are banged up the floors have scuffs The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters animators worked on the film using computer models to animate the characters Each character was first either created out of clay or modeled from a computer drawn diagram before reaching the computer animated design br Once the animators had a model its articulation and motion controls were coded this allowed each character to move in a variety of ways such as talking walking or jumping Out of all of the characters Woody was the most complex as he required motion controls including for his face and for his mouth The first piece of animation a second test was delivered to Disney in June when the company requested a sample of what the film would look like Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with several things in the test that could not be done in traditional hand drawn animation such as Woody s yellow plaid shirt with red stripes the reflections in Buzz s helmet and the decals on his spacesuit or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy s room br There were eight teams that were responsible for different aspects of all of the shots The art department was responsible for determining the overall color and lighting scheme The layout department was responsible for determining the position of all elements of the shot as well as programming the virtual camera s position and movements The animation department created the movements of the characters generally with one animator being assigned to animate an entire shot but occasionally with each character having its own animator The shading team used Pixar s RenderMan software to assign surface textures and reflectivity properties to objects The lighting team placed global spot and flood lighting within the scenes The Render Farm used Sun Microsystems computers running around the clock to produce the final frames of the film The camera team recorded the finished frames which had been rendered at a resolution of by onto film stock Finally Skywalker Sound mixed sound effects the musical score and the dialogue to create the audio for the film br In order to make the film feel as realistic as possible the layout department led by Craig Good avoided the sweeping camera shots popular in computer animation at the time and instead focused on emulating what would have been possible had the film been shot in live action with real film cameras The animation department led by Rich Quade and Ash Brannon used Pixar s Menv software to hand pose the characters at key frames based on videotape of the actors recording their lines and let the software do the inbetweening To sync the characters mouths and facial expressions to the actors recorded voices animators spent a week per eight seconds of animation as Lasseter felt that automatic lip syncing would not properly convey a character s emotions The shading team led by Tom Porter used scans of real objects as well as textures drawn by artists and created with procedural generation algorithms to dress the objects in the film br The film required machine hours and frames of animation in total divided between shots that totaled over minutes Pixar was able to render less than seconds of the film per day br br br Music br br Lasseter did not want to make Toy Story into a musical as he felt that it would make the film feel less genuine Whedon later agreed saying It would have been a really bad musical because it s a buddy movie It s about people who won t admit what they want much less sing about it Buddy movies are about sublimating punching an arm I hate you It s not about open emotion However Disney preferred to make it a musical as they had had much success with incorporating Broadway style musical numbers into their animated films and encouraged Pixar to do the same As a compromise although the characters would not sing the movie would feature non diegetic songs as background music Despite this not happening the first musical number is seen at the end of Toy Story and Toy Story The Musical is the first version of the original to actually feature the cast of characters singing br Randy Newman was hired and composed three original songs for the film The film s signature song You ve Got a Friend in Me was written in one day The song Hakuna Matata from The Lion King is heard briefly during the climax when Woody and Buzz are trying to get into the truck while riding RC br On Newman Lasseter said His songs are touching witty and satirical and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene The soundtrack for Toy Story was produced by Walt Disney Records and was released on November the week of the film s release br br br Editing and pre release br The film s editors including Lee Unkrich worked on Toy Story up until the September deadline to deliver a final cut for scoring and sound design According to Unkrich a scene removed from the original final edit featured Sid torturing Buzz and Woody violently at his house before the scene where Sid interrogates Woody with a magnifying glass The torture scene was removed because the crew thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point and couldn t bear to see them be subjected to such violent torture Another scene in which Woody tries to get Buzz s attention when he was stuck in the box crate while insincerely apologizing for accidentally getting him knocking out of the window was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the film A test screening in July received encouraging responses from the audience but the film was not rated as highly as had been hoped leading to another last minute round of edits Eisner who attended the screening suggested that the final shot of the film should be of both Woody and Buzz leading to the film s final shot of the two worried about the arrival of Andy s new puppy br The crew had difficulty analysing the film s quality due to footage being in scattered pieces Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion and he announced a United States release date of November coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season br Sources indicate that Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production and had been exploring the possibility of selling Pixar to companies such as Hallmark Cards and Microsoft However as the film progressed Jobs like Schneider became increasingly passionate about the film and the transformative nature of what Pixar might be able to accomplish Eager for Pixar to have the funds necessary to negotiate with Disney as an equal partner and optimistic about the impact the finished film would have Jobs decided that he would schedule an initial public offering IPO of Pixar just a week after the film s November release br br br Release br br Both Disney and Pixar held separate premieres for Toy Story with Disney holding theirs at their flagship El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November and Pixar holding theirs the following night at the Regency Center in San Francisco According to David Price s book The Pixar Touch the film deeply resonated with audiences with even the adults being noticeably moved by the film br In some international territories the theatrical release of the film was preceded by a re release of the Roger Rabbit short Roller Coaster Rabbit br In addition to showing at the El Capitan where tickets included admission to the Totally Toy Story funhouse that Disney had built in the Hollywood Masonic Temple next door the film opened on screens on the nd and later expanded to br The film was also shown at the Berlin International Film Festival out of competition from February to Elsewhere the film opened in March br br br Marketing br Marketing for Toy Story included million spent by Disney for advertising as well as advertisers such as Burger King PepsiCo Coca Cola and Payless ShoeSource paying million in promotions for the film Marketing consultant Al Ries reflected on the promotion This will be a killer deal How can a kid sitting through a one and a half hour movie with an army of recognizable toy characters not want to own one Despite this Disney Consumer Products was slow to see the potential of Toy Story When the Thanksgiving release date was announced in January many toy companies were accustomed to having eighteen months to two years of lead time and passed on the project Disney shopped the film at the Toy Fair trade show in February where only the small Canadian company Thinkway Toys was interested in licensing the toy rights for the Toy Story characters Disney promoted the film by inserting its trailer into the home video re release of Cinderella showing a behind the scenes documentary on the Disney Channel and incorporating the characters into a parade at the Disney MGM Studios theme park in Florida br It was screenwriter Joss Whedon s idea to incorporate Barbie as a character who could rescue Woody and Buzz in Toy Story s final act The idea was dropped after Mattel objected and refused to license the toy Producer Ralph Guggenheim claimed that Mattel did not allow the use of the toy as They Mattel philosophically felt girls who play with Barbie dolls are projecting their personalities onto the doll If you give the doll a voice and animate it you re creating a persona for it that might not be every little girl s dream and desire Hasbro likewise refused to license G I Joe mainly because Sid was going to blow one up prompting the filmmakers to instead use a fictional toy Combat Carl but they did license Mr Potato Head The only real life toy in the film that was not in production was Slinky Dog which had been discontinued since the s When designs for Slinky were sent to Betty James Slinky inventor Richard James s wife she said that Pixar had improved the toy and that it was cuter than the original br br br D re release br On October Toy Story was re released in Disney Digital D The film was also released with Toy Story as a double feature for a two week run which was extended due to its success In addition the film s second sequel Toy Story was also released in the D format Lasseter commented on the new D re release br br The Toy Story films and characters will always hold a very special place in our hearts and we re so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy in a whole new way thanks to the latest in D technology With Toy Story shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz Woody and the gang from Andy s room we thought it would be great to let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way br br Translating the film into D involved revisiting the original computer data and virtually placing a second camera into each scene creating left eye and right eye views needed to achieve the perception of depth Unique to computer animation Lasseter referred to this process as digital archaeology The process took four months as well as an additional six months for the two films to add the D The lead stereographer Bob Whitehill oversaw this process and sought to achieve an effect that affected the emotional storytelling of the film br br When I would look at the films as a whole I would search for story reasons to use D in different ways In Toy Story for instance when the toys were alone in their world I wanted it to feel consistent with a safer world And when they went out to the human world that s when I really blew out the D to make it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming br br Unlike other countries the United Kingdom received the films in D as separate releases Toy Story was released on October Toy Story was instead released January The re release performed well at the box office opening with in its opening weekend placing at the third

Reception br br br Box office br Before the film s release executive producer and Apple Inc co founder Steve Jobs stated If Toy Story is a modest hit say million at the box office we ll Pixar and Disney both break even If it gets million we ll both make money But if it s a real blockbuster and earns million or so at the box office we ll make good money and Disney will make a lot of money Upon its release on November Toy Story managed to gross more than million worldwide Disney chairman Michael Eisner stated I don t think either side thought Toy Story would turn out as well as it has The technology is brilliant the casting is inspired and I think the story will touch a nerve Believe me when we first agreed to work together we never thought their first movie would be our holiday feature or that they could go public on the strength of it br The film s first five days of domestic release on Thanksgiving weekend earned it million Moreover Toy Story earned a total of million from ticket sales combined with the five day Wednesday opening It would go on to hold this record until Independence Day took it the next year The film placed first in the weekend s box office with million

Particular praise was offered for the film s D animation Leonard Klady of Variety commended its razzle dazzle technique and unusual look and said that the camera loops and zooms in a dizzying fashion that fairly takes one s breath away Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times compared the animation to Disney s Who Framed Roger Rabbit saying that both movies take apart the universe of cinematic visuals and put it back together again allowing us to see in a new way Due to the film s creative animation Richard Corliss of TIME claimed that it was the year s most inventive comedy br The voice cast was also praised by various critics Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today approved of the selection of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen for the lead roles Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated that Starting with Tom Hanks who brings an invaluable heft and believability to Woody Toy Story is one of the best voiced animated features in memory with all the actors making their presences strongly felt br Several critics also recognized the film s ability to appeal to various age groups Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote It has the purity the ecstatic freedom of imagination that s the hallmark of
