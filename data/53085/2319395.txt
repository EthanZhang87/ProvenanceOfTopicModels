a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts of which he had had a hit recording in Bowman and actor Rob Lowe then sang a reworked version of Creedence Clearwater Revival s Proud Mary with lyrics rewritten to refer to the film industry it is this song for which the act is infamously remembered br br br Critical reviews and public reaction br The majority of media outlets panned the show Los Angeles Times television

and inspired no confidence in Hollywood s future Television editor Tony Scott of Variety complained The st Annual Academy Awards extravaganza seen in different countries including for the first time

President Richard Kahn immediately issued an apology to the studio and the lawsuit was subsequently dropped br Bowman has claimed that she was made to sign a gag order the next day prohibiting her
