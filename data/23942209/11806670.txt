required to sing is displayed as horizontal grey bars which function similar to a musical stave with corresponding lyrics displayed at the bottom of the screen The game analyses a player s pitch and timing which is compared to the original track with players scoring points based on how accurate their singing is Different modes of SingStar may vary this basic pattern but the principle is similar throughout br SingStar includes a variety of game modes The standard singing mode allows one or two people to sing simultaneously either competitively or in a duet The game also offers a Pass the Mic mode which allows up to eight people to play a series of rounds in two teams The original SingStar for PlayStation also featured Star Maker a single player career mode but this was dropped in subsequent releases due to the popularity of the multiplayer and party modes br br br Track lists br br Most SingStar games for PlayStation differ only in the track list contained on the game disc SingStar games typically ship with songs Individual SingStar games are loosely based upon genres such as rock or pop music SingStar Rocks and SingStar Pop respectively SingStar games were sometimes localised for release in different regions with customised track lists to suit foreign markets and territories In addition a number of non English language SingStar games have been released exclusively in some European countries br All SingStar games except the original SingStar and Singalong with Disney for PlayStation allow players to swap out the current disc called the master disc for another SingStar disc This allows access to the songs on other versions without the need to reset the console it also allows PS SingStar discs to be played on a PS regardless of its PS backwards compatibility status by starting with a PS master disc When a new disc is swapped in the game retains the functionality and appearance of the master disc By starting with a new version players can swap in their old SingStar disc and experience them with the functionality and cosmetics of the master disc br br br Network features br The PlayStation version of SingStar introduced a number of online features accessed through the PlayStation Network Users were able to purchase songs online from the SingStore allowing them to expand their current music selection The SingStore launched with songs with further songs for download All music videos are in standard definition although videos were offered in high definition if possible br My SingStar Online was the online community component of SingStar for the PlayStation The idea for My SingStar Online was inspired by people uploading photos and videos of SingStar parties to websites such as Flickr and YouTube The game could record photos and videos of players singing with the PlayStation Eye or other compatible USB camera then be saved to the PlayStation s HDD or uploaded to the My SingStar Online network Users could rate each other s performances and leave comments on other people s profiles br As of January GMT the SingStore servers were shut down All online functionality network features and digital music downloads were

English titles have been released exclusively in some European countries including Austria Belgium Croatia Germany Spain France Italy Norway Poland Portugal Sweden Finland and The Netherlands While the majority of SingStar titles are for PlayStation platform a number were released for the PlayStation A game titled SingStar Ultimate Party was also released for both PlayStation and PlayStation The latest title SingStar Celebration was released for PlayStation on October br br br SingStar Dance and SingStar Guitar br Sony expanded SingStar brand with the release of SingStar Dance and SingStar

was released in October while Dance was released the following month No further titles have been released in either series However SingStar Dance did have a spin off series of dancing games called DanceStar Party br br br Free to play br In autumn SingStar was made as free to play via a then free SingStar application included in the PlayStation software update New features included the ability to use the PlayStation Eye as a microphone and new Trophies Songs can be played from PlayStation and PlayStation retail discs but cannot be copied onto the Hard Drive as well as songs bought from the SingStore br PlayStation firmware was released on October This release caused some complaints as the application icon was made mandatory for all European PlayStation users and cannot be removed from the XMB menu Various petitions have been started in response to the new icon but no changes had been made except on October when the XMB icon was updated The icon still appears as of today but can now be deleted by the user br br br Development br br br Initial design br The technology behind SingStar began as a research project into sound input by London Studio s prototyping department The project was initially focused on developing a pitch detection system and game concepts aimed at a children s audience Two main game concepts were developed Songlines a third person adventure game in which the player would sing to unlock new environments and SingAlong Safari where players would complete missions by singing along with animals br In the game underwent a direction change The new concept featured contemporary music videos and would use two microphones to allow for multiplayer scenarios A prototype game was developed which included pitch detection technology a basic interface display a scoring system and samples of then unlicensed music The first game demonstration took place at a Team SCEE conference in Paris featuring the songs Wonderwall by Oasis and Independent Women by Destiny s Child br br br Hardware br br The SingStar games require SingStar branded microphones one red and one blue which connect to the PlayStation console via a single USB converter The USB converter was required so that both microphones would use a single USB port the PlayStation and later versions of the PlayStation only have two USB ports and the second port needed to remain free for camera functionality The PlayStation Headset was originally considered as an alternative to microphones however the headset was not technically sufficient and London Studio felt that handheld microphones were important to the authentic experience br Wireless microphones with a GHz receiver attached to the PS or PS by USB became available in Europe in March Bluetooth microphones were originally planned to launch with the PS version of SingStar but running two Bluetooth microphones together was found to be difficult so the PS game launched with the same USB microphones as the PS game br From May users of the PlayStation could use their smartphones as a microphone This feature was also available for the PlayStation version br br br Audio technology br The microphones detect pitch using digital signal processing which analyses the frequency of the incoming signal via Fast Fourier transform The frequency is then compared to stored information to evaluate if the note is correct Regular singing segments do not feature speech recognition and so humming into the microphones at the correct pitch will also score points Rap sections use a combination of speech recognition and rhythm detection br Tracks on the original SingStar for PlayStation were mixed from master records which allowed the artist s voice to be completely removed from the song This feature was dropped in subsequent games because the requirement for master tracks would have restricted the studio s choice of songs SingStar for PlayStation introduced the ability to digitally suppress vocals using ADRess Azimuth Discrimination and Resynthesis technology developed by Dan Barry at the Audio Research Group based in the Dublin Institute of Technology The ADRess settings vary for each track and the technology is able to successfully remove the vocal tracks from of songs br The PlayStation version also includes various VST plugins developed by Sound Forge adapted to run natively on the console The input signal undergoes a vocal signal chain which includes high pass filter wave hammer compressor and a reverb with a second decay Users are able to control the audio processing during playback adding features such as pitch shifting br br br PlayStation Home br In September London Studio launched a themed space in the PlayStation s online community based service PlayStation Home The space is called The SingStar Rooms and featured a dance floor a jukebox and different rewards for the users It was available to the European and North American versions of PlayStation Home br There was also a VIP Room used for events The first event was for the UK rapper Dizzee Rascal a Mercury Award Winner and occurred from September to October Dizzee performed for the PS Home SingStar community and answered questions for an hour after the performance There were also limited time items at this space like a Dizzee Mask This was available to the European and North American versions of PlayStation Home however Dizzee only appeared in the European version to answer questions br The VIP Room reopened on December until January for Christmas with a new mini game and a reward br br br Marketing br The SingStar series has been promoted through a number of advertising platforms including television and cinema print and digital advertising SingStar advertisements are designed to convey the social aspects of the game The advertisement for the PAL release SingStar Rocks features two men singing Song by Blur on a public rooftop while onlookers watch in surprise Tony McTear creative director of the advert said that the commercial really captures the spirit of the game Similar style advertisements were created for the American launch of SingStar Rocks which feature public performances in a mall a subway and a fire escape br In September SingStar took part in a television sponsorship deal with MTV in the United Kingdom SingStar sponsored MTV s Throwdown program which consisted of a minute clip of viewers lip syncing to a song Viewers were requested to upload a video of themselves singing to the SingStar branded MTV Flux website with a compilation of the most viewed videos being shown on Throwdown The campaign ran until February and resulted in a boost in SingStar sales br In during the airing of Australian Idol in Australia Singstar was advertised every time the show aired br In Julian Hill became A Guinness World record holder for his hours minutes continuous play of SingStar games This charity Event Known as SingStar The Endurance Challenge raised over for Great Ormond Street Children s Hospital and made Julian Hill an Internet Celebrity br SingStar s advertising campaigns have targeted a variety of demographics typically ignored by the gaming industry The games have received coverage in women s and girls magazines including Heat and Harpers and Queen in the United Kingdom In Sony PlayStation launched its first online advertising campaign targeted towards teenage girls and in ran an advertisement in Attitude targeted towards gay males br br br Reception br br The SingStar series has been largely successful in Europe and Australia and has collectively sold over million units in the PAL region and an additional million units in the United States Over million songs have been downloaded from the online SingStore In SingStar and SingStar Party jointly received the award for originality at the BAFTA Games Awards The game SingStar Celebration was nominated for Best Family Social Game at the Titanium Awards and for Family Game of the Year at the st Annual D I C E Awards br br br Critical reception br The first SingStar game was well received by gaming critics Eurogamer described it as the definitive social game and commented that the game was buffed polished and arranged to generate the maximum degree of entertainment They did however criticise the scoring system for occasionally getting out of sync with the song Australian website PALGN described the single player as a little lacklustre but praised the multiplayer component as the best asset of SingStar and described the game as addictive br SingStar debuted in the US with the release of SingStar Rocks where it was compared against the Karaoke Revolution series IGN criticised the lack of ability to remove the artists vocals and said that the use of original music videos hurt the ability to really get lost in the song They also described SingStar s interface as a crude hacked together system compared to the scrolling timeline interface of Karaoke Revolution UP criticised the lack of character generation rewards and unlockable features and said SingStar lacks the game feel of Karaoke Revolution br A number of PlayStation titles have offered additional gameplay features The duet mode added in SingStar Party was described as hit and miss with some songs split into fun bits and boring bits seemingly on purpose The rapping segments introduced in SingStar Pop were described as the hardest parts of the entire game and were a feature which added variety to the series SingStar Pop also introduced Medleys which consist of a random combination of song choruses The new medleys were described as funny to watch and intense to play although potentially frustrating br The main difference between PlayStation SingStar titles is the track list contained on the game disc Some SingStar track lists have been better received than others Eurogamer described the UK track list for SingStar Legends as simultaneously eclectic and fantastic whereas SingStar Pop Hits felt like a loosely thrown together collection of what the charts say is cool with little regard for what will make for a fun karaoke party The localisation of some SingStar games also has played a part in their reception PALGN praised the localised Australian content in SingStar Rocks whereas it panned SingStar Pop Hits which featured an almost identical track list to the UK release saying that it had songs few Australians had ever heard of br The Academy of Interactive Arts Sciences nominated SingStar Rocks for Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack at the th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards br br br See also br Karaoke br Karaoke Revolution br Lips br UltraStar An open source clone of the SingStar engine br br br br br br External links br Official SingStar
