usual formula to feature a current widespread issue Whenever possible GamePro contacted the relevant game company and a company representative would directly answer the reader s query sometimes with the editor putting in additional advice or critical comments if he considered the company s response inadequate This was the only Gamepro column to be authored by the same editor since its debut in

Doom had a caption for an image of one of the game s bosses as PROTIP To defeat the Cyberdemon shoot at it until it dies The apparent advice which is common sense and self evident for players of first
