herself in a subsequent interview with PBS s PBS NewsHour br br br Impact br The turmoil is larger than just video game journalism it s the Internet We re at a time of great change what advertising means on the Internet is changing in a very big way sort of like you re seeing on television with DVRs making standard ads obsolete Business is going to have to change and we re all going to have to adapt to move forward and keep going for the years to come People that stand by as existing ad formats get less and less useful are going to feel the brunt of stuff like this br Giant Bomb is credited with being an innovator within video game journalism avoiding many of its downfalls and continuing growth where other companies in the medium have had to downsize or close down completely Due to ad filtering the advertisements that have been common in video game journalism websites are becoming less viable Websites such as Giant Bomb ScrewAttack and Penny Arcade have received praise for their success in their paid subscription models In addition as print based gaming journalism was superseded by web based gaming journalism large gaming journalism websites such as IGN and GameSpot are now under threat from YouTube celebrities and video game players creating their own live streaming channels on Twitch br br This is the reality of the current industry we are in and it s something that Jeff Gerstmann predicted back in the day when he talked about the byline and the fact that the person writing the review was just as if not more important than the actual text of the review itself or of course the video of it It seems that some sites are attempting to adapt to the modern landscape by either creating personalities or pushing already existing nascent personalities on their staff Either the most camera friendly person or the most interesting person giving them a show or along those lines We see sites like GameSpot doing that a lot they re really chasing after the dream of what Giant Bomb did years ago and it s the reason why Giant Bomb is extremely relevant at this point because they saw that coming br br br br br br External links br Official website
