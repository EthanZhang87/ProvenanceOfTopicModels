Texas TEK s ss locally also TEK siz Spanish Texas or Tejas pronounced texas is the most populous state in the South Central region of the United States It borders Louisiana to the east Arkansas to the northeast Oklahoma to the north New Mexico to the west and the Mexican states of Chihuahua Coahuila Nuevo Le n and Tamaulipas to the south and southwest Texas has a coastline on the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast Covering square miles km and with over million residents as of it is the second largest U S state by both area and population br Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State for its former status as an independent republic The Lone Star can be found on the Texas state flag and the Texas state seal Spain was the first European country to claim and control the area of Texas Following a short lived colony controlled by France Mexico controlled the territory until when Texas won its independence becoming the Republic of Texas In Texas joined the United States as the th state The state s annexation set off a chain of events that led to the Mexican American War in Following victory by the United States Texas remained a slave state until the American Civil War when it declared its secession from the Union in early before officially joining the Confederate States of America on March After the Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation br Historically five major industries shaped the Texas economy prior to World War II cattle bison cotton timber and oil Before and after the Civil War the cattle industry which Texas came to dominate was a major economic driver and created the traditional image of the Texas cowboy In the later th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative Ultimately the discovery of major petroleum deposits Spindletop in particular initiated an economic boom that became the driving force behind the economy for much of the th century Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry during the mid th century As of it has the most Fortune company headquarters in the United States With a growing base of industry the state leads in many industries including tourism agriculture petrochemicals energy computers and electronics aerospace and biomedical sciences Texas has led the U S in state export revenue since and has the second highest gross state product br The Dallas Fort Worth metroplex and Greater Houston areas are the nation s fourth and fifth most populous urban regions respectively Its capital city is Austin Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U S Southern and the Southwestern regions Most population centers are in areas of former prairies grasslands forests and the coastline Traveling from east to west terrain ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods to rolling plains and rugged hills to the desert and mountains of the Big Bend br br br Etymology br The name Texas based on the Caddo word t y sha t j a friend was applied in the spelling Tejas or Texas by the Spanish to the Caddo themselves specifically the Hasinai Confederacy br During Spanish colonial rule in the th century the area was known as Nuevas Filipinas New Philippines and Nuevo Reino de Filipinas New Kingdom of the Philippines or as provincia de los Tejas province of the Tejas later also provincia de Texas or de Tejas province of Texas It was incorporated as provincia de Texas into the Mexican Empire in and declared a republic in The Royal Spanish Academy recognizes both spellings Tejas and Texas as Spanish language forms of the name br The English pronunciation with ks is unetymological contrary to the historical value of the letter x in Spanish orthography Alternative etymologies of the name advanced in the late th century connected the name Texas with the Spanish word teja meaning roof tile the plural tejas being used to designate Indigenous Pueblo settlements A s map by Jacques Nicolas Bellin shows a village named Teijas on the Trinity River close to the site of modern Crockett br br br History br br br Precontact era br br Texas lies between two major cultural spheres of Pre Columbian North America the Southwestern and the Plains areas Archaeologists have found that three major Indigenous cultures lived in this territory and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact These were the Ancestral Puebloans from the upper Rio Grande region centered west of Texas the Mississippian culture also known as Mound Builders which extended along the Mississippi River Valley east of Texas and the civilizations of Mesoamerica which were centered south of Texas Influence of Teotihuacan in northern Mexico peaked around AD and declined between the th and th centuries br When Europeans arrived in the Texas region the language families present in the state were Caddoan Atakapan Athabaskan Coahuiltecan and Uto Aztecan in addition to several language isolates such as Tonkawa Uto Aztecan Puebloan and Jumano peoples lived neared the Rio Grande in the western portion of the state and the Athabaskan speaking Apache tribes lived throughout the interior The agricultural mound building Caddo controlled much of the northeastern part of the state along the Red Sabine and Neches River basins Atakapan peoples such as the Akokisa and Bidai lived along the northeastern Gulf Coast the Karankawa lived along the central coast At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans the Aranama lived in southern Texas This entire culture group primarily centered in northeastern Mexico is now extinct br No culture was dominant across all of present day Texas and many peoples inhabited the area Native American tribes who have lived inside the boundaries of present day Texas include the Alabama Apache Atakapan Bidai Caddo Aranama Comanche Choctaw Coushatta Hasinai Jumano Karankawa Kickapoo Kiowa Tonkawa and Wichita Many of these peoples migrated from the north or east during the colonial period such as the Choctaw Alabama Coushatta and Delaware br The region was primarily controlled by the Spanish until the Texas Revolution They were most interested in relationships with the Caddo who were like the Spanish a settled agricultural people Several Spanish missions were opened in Caddo territory but a lack of interest in Christianity among the Caddo meant that few were converted Positioned between French Louisiana and Spanish Texas the Caddo maintained relations with both but were closer with the French After Spain took control of Louisiana most of the missions in eastern Texas were closed and abandoned The United States obtained Louisiana following the Louisiana Purchase and began convincing tribes to self segregate from whites by moving west facing an overflow of native peoples in Missouri and Arkansas they were able to negotiate with the Caddo to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas These included the Muscogee Houma Choctaw Lenape and Mingo Seneca among others who came to view the Caddoans as saviors br The temperament of Native American tribes affected the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow local crops prepare foods and hunt wild game Warlike tribes resisted the settlers Prior treaties with the Spanish forbade either side from militarizing its native population in any potential conflict between the two nations Several outbreaks of violence between Native Americans and Texans started to spread in the prelude to the Texas Revolution Texans accused tribes of stealing livestock While no proof was found those in charge of Texas at the time attempted to publicly blame and punish the Caddo with the U S government trying to keep them in check The Caddo never turned to violence because of the situation except in cases of self defense br By the s the U S had drafted the Indian Removal Act which was used to facilitate the Trail of Tears Fearing retribution Indian Agents all over the eastern U S tried to convince all Indigenous peoples to uproot and move west This included the Caddo of Louisiana and Arkansas Following the Texas Revolution the Texans chose to make peace with the Indigenous people but did not honor former land claims or agreements The first president of Texas Sam Houston aimed to cooperate and make peace with Native tribes but his successor Mirabeau B Lamar took a much more hostile stance Hostility towards Natives by white Texans prompted the movement of most Native populations north into what would become Indian Territory modern Oklahoma Only the Alabama Coushatta would remain in the parts of Texas subject to white settlement though the Comanche would continue to control most of the western half of the state until their defeat in the s and s br br br Colonization br br The first historical document related to Texas was a map of the Gulf Coast created in by Spanish explorer Alonso lvarez de Pineda Nine years later shipwrecked Spanish explorer lvar N ez Cabeza de Vaca and his cohort became the first Europeans in what is now Texas Cabeza de Vaca reported that in when the Spanish landed in the area half the natives died from a disease of the bowels and blamed us Cabeza de Vaca also made observations about the way of life of the Ignaces Natives of Texas Francisco V zquez de Coronado described another encounter with native people in br The expedition of Hernando de Soto entered into Texas from the east seeking a route to Mexico They passed through the Caddo lands but turned back after reaching the River of Daycao possibly the Brazos or Colorado beyond which point the Native peoples were nomadic and did not have the agricultural stores to feed the expedition br European powers ignored the area until accidentally settling there in Miscalculations by Ren Robert Cavelier de La Salle resulted in his establishing the colony of Fort Saint Louis at Matagorda Bay rather than along the Mississippi River The colony lasted only four years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives A small band of survivors traveled eastward into the lands of the Caddo but La Salle was killed by disgruntled expedition members br In Spanish authorities concerned that France posed a competitive threat constructed several missions in East Texas among the Caddo After Caddo resistance the Spanish missionaries returned to Mexico When France began settling Louisiana in Spanish authorities responded by founding a new series of missions in East Texas Two years later they created San Antonio as the first Spanish civilian settlement in the area br br Hostile native tribes and distance from nearby Spanish colonies discouraged settlers from moving to the area It was one of New Spain s least populated provinces In the Spanish peace treaty with the Lipan Apache angered many tribes including the Comanche Tonkawa and Hasinai The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in and later helped to defeat the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes With numerous missions being established priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes By the end of the th century only a few nomadic tribes had not converted br br When the United States purchased Louisiana from France in American authorities insisted the agreement also included Texas The boundary between New Spain and the United States was finally set in at the Sabine River the modern border between Texas and Louisiana Eager for new land many U S settlers refused to recognize the agreement Several filibusters raised armies to invade the area west of the Sabine River Marked by the War of some men who had escaped from the Spanish held Old Philippines had immigrated to and also passed through Texas New Philippines and reached Louisiana where Philippine exiles aided the United States in the defense of New Orleans against a British invasion with Filipinos in the Saint Malo settlement assisting Jean Lafitte in the Battle of New Orleans br In the Mexican War of Independence included the Texas territory which became part of Mexico Due to its low population the territory was assigned to other states and territories of Mexico the core territory was part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas but other parts of today s Texas were part of Tamaulipas Chihuahua or the Mexican Territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo M xico br Hoping more settlers would reduce the near constant Comanche raids Mexican Texas liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain Large swathes of land were allotted to empresarios who recruited settlers from the United States Europe and the Mexican interior primarily the U S Austin s settlers the Old Three Hundred made places along the Brazos River in The population of Texas grew rapidly In Texas had about people with most of Mexican descent By the population had grown to about people with only of Mexican descent br Many immigrants openly flouted Mexican law especially the prohibition against slavery Combined with United States attempts to purchase Texas Mexican authorities decided in to prohibit continued immigration from the United States However illegal immigration from the United States into Mexico continued to increase the population of Texas New laws also called for the enforcement of customs duties angering native Mexican citizens Tejanos and recent immigrants alike br The Anahuac Disturbances in were the first open revolt against Mexican rule coinciding with a revolt in Mexico against the nation s president Texians sided with the federalists against the government and drove all Mexican soldiers out of East Texas They took advantage of the lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom Texians met at the Convention of to discuss requesting independent statehood among other issues The following year Texians reiterated their demands at the Convention of br br br Republic br br Within Mexico tensions continued between federalists and centralists In early wary Texians formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety The unrest erupted into armed conflict in late at the Battle of Gonzales This launched the Texas Revolution Texians elected delegates to the Consultation which created a provisional government The provisional government soon collapsed from infighting and Texas was without clear governance for the first two months of br br Mexican President Antonio L pez de Santa Anna personally led an army to end the revolt General Jos de Urrea defeated all the Texian resistance along the coast culminating in the Goliad massacre L pez de Santa Anna s forces after a thirteen day siege overwhelmed Texian defenders at the Battle of the Alamo News of the defeats sparked panic among Texas settlers br br The newly elected Texian delegates to the Convention of quickly signed a declaration of independence on March forming the Republic of Texas After electing interim officers the Convention disbanded The new government joined the other settlers in Texas in the Runaway Scrape fleeing from the approaching Mexican army br After several weeks of retreat the Texian Army commanded by Sam Houston attacked and defeated L pez de Santa Anna s forces at the Battle of San Jacinto L pez de Santa Anna was captured and forced to sign the Treaties of Velasco ending the war The Constitution of the Republic of Texas prohibited the government from restricting slavery or freeing slaves and required free people of African descent to leave the country br Political battles raged between two factions of the new Republic The nationalist faction led by Mirabeau B Lamar advocated the continued independence of Texas the expulsion of the Native Americans and the expansion of the Republic to the Pacific Ocean Their opponents led by Sam Houston advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co existence with Native Americans The conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the Texas Archive War With wide popular support Texas first applied for annexation to the United States in but its status as a slaveholding country caused its admission to be controversial and it was initially rebuffed This status and Mexican diplomacy in support of its claims to the territory also complicated Texas s ability to form foreign alliances and trade relationships br The Comanche Indians furnished the main Native American opposition to the Texas Republic manifested in multiple raids on settlements Mexico launched two small expeditions into Texas in The town of San Antonio was captured twice and Texans were defeated in battle in the Dawson massacre Despite these successes Mexico did not keep an occupying force in Texas and the republic survived The cotton price crash of the s depressed the country s economy br br br Statehood br br Texas was finally annexed when the expansionist James K Polk won the election of On December the U S Congress admitted Texas to the U S br After Texas s annexation Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States While the United States claimed Texas s border stretched to the Rio Grande Mexico claimed it was the Nueces River leaving the Rio Grande Valley under contested Texan sovereignty While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims the United States had the military strength and the political will to do so President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor south to the Rio Grande on January A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the Thornton Affair starting the Mexican American War The first battles of the war were fought in Texas the Siege of Fort Texas Battle of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma After these decisive victories the United States invaded Mexican territory ending the fighting in Texas br br The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the two year war In return for US Mexico gave the U S undisputed control of Texas ceded the Mexican Cession in most of which today is called the American Southwest and Texas s borders were established at the Rio Grande br The Compromise of set Texas s boundaries at their present position Texas ceded its claims to land which later became half of present day New Mexico a third of Colorado and small portions of Kansas Oklahoma and Wyoming to the federal government in return for the assumption of million of the old republic s debt Post war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans whose numbers tripled in the state from to from to br br br Civil War to late th century br br Texas re entered war following the election of During this time Black people comprised percent of the state s population and they were overwhelmingly enslaved When Abraham Lincoln was elected South Carolina seceded from the Union five other Deep South states quickly followed A state convention considering secession opened in Austin on January On February by a vote of the convention adopted an Ordinance of Secession Texas voters approved this Ordinance on February Texas joined the newly created Confederate States of America on March ratifying the permanent C S Constitution on March br Not all Texans favored secession initially although many of the same would later support the Southern cause Texas s most notable Unionist was the state governor Sam Houston Not wanting to aggravate the situation Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops to keep him in office After refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy Houston was deposed br While far from the major battlefields of the American Civil War Texas contributed large numbers of soldiers and equipment Union troops briefly occupied the state s primary port Galveston Texas s border with Mexico was known as the backdoor of the Confederacy because trade occurred at the border bypassing the Union blockade The Confederacy repulsed all Union attempts to shut down this route but Texas s role as a supply state was marginalized in mid after the Union capture of the Mississippi River The final battle of the Civil War was fought at Palmito Ranch near Brownsville Texas and saw a Confederate victory br Texas descended into anarchy for two months between the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia and the assumption of authority by Union General Gordon Granger Violence marked the early months of Reconstruction Juneteenth commemorates the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Galveston by General Gordon Granger almost two and a half years after the original announcement President Johnson in declared the civilian government restored in Texas Despite not meeting Reconstruction requirements Congress resumed allowing elected Texas representatives into the federal government in Social volatility continued as the state struggled with agricultural depression and labor issues br Like most of the South the Texas economy was devastated by the War However since the state had not been as dependent on slaves as other parts of the South it was able to recover more quickly The culture in Texas during the later th century exhibited many facets of a frontier territory The state became notorious as a haven for people from other parts of the country who wanted to escape debt war tensions or other problems Gone to Texas was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states Nevertheless the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more legitimate interests br The cattle industry continued to thrive though it gradually became less profitable Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various regions Railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at Galveston as commerce expanded The lumber industry quickly expanded and was Texas largest industry prior to the th century br br br Early to mid th century br br In Texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in U S history during the Galveston hurricane On January the first major oil well in Texas Spindletop was found south of Beaumont Other fields were later discovered nearby in East Texas West Texas and under the Gulf of Mexico The resulting oil boom transformed Texas Oil production averaged three million barrels per day at its peak in br In the Democratic dominated state legislature passed a bill requiring payment of a poll tax for voting which effectively disenfranchised most Black and many poor White and Latino people In addition the legislature established white primaries ensuring minorities were excluded from the formal political process The number of voters dropped dramatically and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties The Socialist Party became the second largest party in Texas after coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the United States during fierce battles in the labor movement and the popularity of national heroes like Eugene V Debs The socialists popularity soon waned after their vilification by the federal government for their opposition to U S involvement in World War I br The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl dealt a double blow to the state s economy which had significantly improved since the Civil War Migrants abandoned the worst hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years Especially from this period on Black people left Texas in the Great Migration to get work in the Northern United States or California and to escape segregation In Texas was White Black and Hispanic br World War II had a dramatic impact on Texas as federal money poured in to build military bases munitions factories detention camps and Army hospitals Texans left for service the cities exploded with new industry and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left the fields for much better paying war jobs never to return to agriculture Texas manufactured percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II ranking eleventh among the states br Texas modernized and expanded its system of higher education through the s The state created a comprehensive plan for higher education funded in large part by oil revenues and a central state apparatus designed to manage state institutions more efficiently These changes helped Texas universities receive federal research funds br br br Mid th to early st century br Beginning around the mid th century Texas began to transform from a rural and agricultural state to one urban and industrialized The state s population grew quickly during this period with large levels of migration from outside the state As a part of the Sun Belt Texas experienced strong economic growth particularly during the s and early s Texas s economy diversified lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry By Hispanics and Latino Americans overtook Blacks to become the largest minority group Texas has the largest Black population with over million br During the late th century the Republican Party replaced the Democratic Party as the dominant party in the state Beginning in the early st century metropolitan areas including Dallas Fort Worth and Greater Austin became centers for the Texas Democratic Party in statewide and national elections as liberal policies became more accepted in urban areas br From the mid s to Texas gained an influx of business relocations and regional headquarters from companies in California Texas became a major destination for migration during the early st century and was named the most popular state to move for three consecutive years Another study in determined Texas s growth rate at people per day br During the COVID pandemic in Texas the first confirmed case of the virus in Texas was announced on March On April Governor Greg Abbott announced phase one of re opening the economy Amid a rise in COVID cases in autumn Abbott refused to enact further lockdowns In November Texas was selected as one of four states to test Pfizer s COVID vaccine distribution As of February there had been over million confirmed cases in Texas with at least deaths br During February the state faced a major weather emergency as Winter Storm Uri hit the state as well as most of the Southeastern and Midwestern United States Historically high power usage across the state caused the state s power grid to become overworked and ERCOT the main operator of the Texas Interconnection grid declared an emergency and began to implement rolling blackouts across Texas causing a power crisis Over million Texans were without power and over million were under boil water notices br br br Geography br br Texas is the second largest U S state by area after Alaska and the largest state within the contiguous United States at square miles km If it were an independent country Texas would be the th largest It ranks th worldwide amongst country subdivisions by size br Texas is in the south central part of the United States The Rio Grande forms a natural border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua Coahuila Nuevo Le n and Tamaulipas to the south The Red River forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas to the north The Sabine River forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east The Texas Panhandle has an eastern border with Oklahoma at W a northern border with Oklahoma at N and a western border with New Mexico at W El Paso lies on the state s western tip at N and the Rio Grande br With climatic regions soil regions and distinct ecological regions regional classification becomes complicated with differences in soils topography geology rainfall and plant and animal communities One classification system divides Texas in order from southeast to west into the following Gulf Coastal Plains Interior Lowlands Great Plains and Basin and Range Province br The Gulf Coastal Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast section of the state Vegetation in this region consists of thick piney woods The Interior Lowlands region consists of gently rolling to hilly forested land and is part of a larger pine hardwood forest The Cross Timbers region and Caprock Escarpment are part of the Interior Lowlands br br The Great Plains region in Central Texas spans through the state s panhandle and Llano Estacado to the state s hill country near Lago Vista and Austin This region is dominated by prairie and steppe Far West Texas or the Trans Pecos region is the state s Basin and Range Province The most varied of the regions this area includes Sand Hills the Stockton Plateau desert valleys wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands br Texas has named streams and major rivers with the Rio Grande as the largest Other major rivers include the Pecos the Brazos Colorado and Red River While Texas has few natural lakes Texans have built more than a hundred artificial reservoirs br The size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation debatable it can be considered a Southern or a Southwestern state or both The vast geographic economic and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a recognized region of the United States Notable extremes range from East Texas which is often considered an extension of the Deep South to Far West Texas which is generally acknowledged to be part of the interior Southwest br br br Geology br br Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico The continental crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about million years old br This margin existed until Laurasia and Gondwana collided in the Pennsylvanian subperiod to form Pangea Pangea began to break up in the Triassic but seafloor spreading to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid and late Jurassic The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the Gulf of Mexico s passive margin began to form Today to miles to km of sediments are buried beneath the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining US oil reserves are here The incipient Gulf of Mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of Jurassic age These salt deposits formed salt dome diapirs and are found in East Texas along the Gulf coast br East Texas outcrops consist of Cretaceous and Paleogene sediments which contain important deposits of Eocene lignite The Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sediments in the north Permian sediments in the west and Cretaceous sediments in the east along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas continental shelf contain oil Oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west Texas in the Big Bend area A blanket of Miocene sediments known as the Ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer Located far from an active plate tectonic boundary Texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes br br br Wildlife br br Texas is the home to species of mammals species of reptiles and amphibians including the American green tree frog and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States native species in all At least species have been introduced and now reproduce freely in Texas br Texas plays host to several species of wasps including an abundance of Polistes exclamans and is an important ground for the study of Polistes annularis br During the spring Texas wildflowers such as the state flower the bluebonnet line highways throughout Texas During the Johnson Administration the first lady Lady Bird Johnson worked to draw attention to Texas wildflowers br br br Climate br br The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather The Panhandle of the state has colder winters than North Texas while the Gulf Coast has mild winters Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns El Paso on the western end of the state averages inches mm of annual rainfall while parts of southeast Texas average as much as inches mm per year Dallas in the North Central region averages a more moderate inches mm per year br Snow falls multiple times each winter in the Panhandle and mountainous areas of West Texas once or twice a year in North Texas and once every few years in Central and East Texas Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only in rare circumstances Of note is the Christmas Eve snowstorm when inches mm of snow fell as far south as Kingsville where the average high temperature in December is F br Night time summer temperatures range from the upper s F C in the West Texas mountains to F C in Galveston br The table below consists of averages for August generally the warmest month and January generally the coldest in selected cities in various regions of the state br br br Storms br br Thunderstorms strike Texas often especially the eastern and northern portions of the state Tornado Alley covers the northern section of Texas The state experiences the most tornadoes in the United States an average of a year These strike most frequently in North Texas and the Panhandle Tornadoes in Texas generally occur in April May and June br Some of the most destructive hurricanes in U S history have impacted Texas A hurricane in killed about people in Indianola followed by another hurricane in that destroyed the town These events allowed Galveston to take over as the chief port city The Galveston hurricane subsequently devastated that city killing about people or possibly as many as in the deadliest natural disaster in U S history In Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Rockport as a Category Hurricane causing significant damage there Its unprecedented amounts of rain over the Greater Houston area resulted in widespread and catastrophic flooding that inundated hundreds of thousands of homes Harvey ultimately became the costliest hurricane worldwide causing an estimated billion in damage surpassing the cost of Hurricane Katrina br Other devastating Texas hurricanes include the Galveston hurricane Hurricane Audrey in Hurricane Carla in Hurricane Beulah in Hurricane Alicia in Hurricane Rita in and Hurricane Ike in Tropical storms have also caused their share of damage Allison in and again during Claudette in and Tropical Storm Imelda in br There is no substantial physical barrier between Texas and the polar region Although it is unusual it is possible for arctic or polar air masses to penetrate Texas as occurred during the February North American winter storm Usually prevailing winds in North America will push polar air masses to the southeast before they reach Texas Because such intrusions are rare and perhaps unexpected they may result in crises such as the Texas power crisis br br br Greenhouse gases br br As of Texas emitted the most greenhouse gases in the U S As of the state emits about billion pounds million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually As an independent state Texas would rank as the world s seventh largest producer of greenhouse gases Causes of the state s vast greenhouse gas emissions include the state s large number of coal power plants and the state s refining and manufacturing industries In there were emission events which poured million pounds metric tons of contaminants into the Texas sky br br br Administrative divisions br br The state has three cities with populations exceeding one million Houston San Antonio and Dallas These three rank among the most populous cities of the United States As of six Texas cities had populations greater than Austin Fort Worth and El Paso are among the largest U S cities Texas has four metropolitan areas with populations greater than a million Dallas Fort Worth Arlington Houston Sugar Land The Woodlands San Antonio New Braunfels and Austin Round Rock San Marcos The Dallas Fort Worth and Houston metropolitan areas number about million and million residents as of respectively br Three interstate highways I to the west Dallas Fort Worth to San Antonio with Austin in between I to the east Dallas to Houston and I to the south San Antonio to Houston define the Texas Urban Triangle region The region of square miles km contains most of the state s largest cities and metropolitan areas as well as million people nearly percent of Texas s total population Houston and Dallas have been recognized as world cities These cities are spread out amongst the state br In contrast to the cities unincorporated rural settlements known as colonias often lack basic infrastructure and are marked by poverty The office of the Texas Attorney General stated in that Texas had about colonias and estimates about lived in the colonias Hidalgo County as of has the largest number of colonias Texas has the largest number of people living in colonias of all states br Texas has counties more than any other state Each county runs on Commissioners Court system consisting of four elected commissioners one from each of four precincts in the county roughly divided according to population and a county judge elected at large from the entire county County government runs similar to a weak mayor council system the county judge has no veto authority but votes along with the other commissioners br Although Texas permits cities and counties to enter interlocal agreements to share services the state does not allow consolidated city county governments nor does it have metropolitan governments Counties are not granted home rule status their powers are strictly defined by state law The state does not have townships areas within a county are either incorporated or unincorporated Incorporated areas are part of a municipality The county provides limited services to unincorporated areas and to some smaller incorporated areas Municipalities are classified either general law cities or home rule A municipality may elect home rule status once it exceeds population with voter approval br Texas also permits the creation of special districts which provide limited services The most common is the school district but can also include hospital districts community college districts and utility districts Municipal school district and special district elections are nonpartisan though the party affiliation of a candidate may be well known County and state elections are partisan br br br Demographics br br The resident population of Texas was in the census a increase since the census At the census the apportioned population of Texas stood at The Texas Population Estimate program estimated the population was on July In Texas had a census population of Texas is the second most populous state in the United States after California

in Texas from less than up to years An estimated lived in Texas from to and years or more br Texas s Rio Grande Valley has seen significant migration from across the U S Mexico border During the crisis many Central Americans including unaccompanied minors traveling alone from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador reached the state overwhelming Border Patrol resources for a time Many sought asylum in the United States br Texas s population density as of is people per square mile people km which is slightly higher than the average population density of the U S as a whole at people per square mile people km In contrast while Texas and France are similarly sized geographically the European country has a population density of people per square mile people km Two thirds of all Texans

broader category of American English known as Southern American English Creole language is spoken in some parts of East Texas In some areas of the state particularly in the large cities Western American English and General American English is increasingly common Chicano English due to a growing Hispanic population is widespread in South Texas while African American English is especially notable in historically minority areas of urban Texas br At the American Community Survey s estimates of the population spoke only English and spoke a language other than English Roughly of the total population spoke Spanish By approximately Texans spoke French or a French creole language German and other West Germanic languages were spoken by residents Russian Polish and other Slavic languages by
