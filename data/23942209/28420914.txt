for Retro City Rampage originally came from a homebrew project that began in In his spare time game programmer Brian Provinciano constructed his own Nintendo Entertainment System development kit and set about remaking one of his favourite titles Grand Theft Auto III with bit sprite graphics under the codename of Grand Theftendo At the Game Developers Conference he revealed his methods showing how over several years he built advanced software tools to help him overcome the limitations of Nintendo Entertainment System hardware before eventually shifting development to the PC br At one point in the process he started to add characters and locations from other games he enjoyed from his childhood This ultimately inspired him to work on the project full time but instead of using scenarios from GTA III he decided to create an entirely new game with original content in which would be released as a downloadable title for consoles He used a real time map editor to adjust and debug on the fly and also integrated several suggestions from playtesters br For most of the project he had worked completely independently on the design coding and art Later in development he hired a pixel artist to assist with the visual design of the game and went through revisions He also brought in three renowned videogame composers Leonard FreakyDNA Paul Jake Virt Kaufman and Matt Norrin Radd Creamer to create chiptune songs for the game s soundtrack Provinciano stated that the game contains roughly two and a half hours of chiptune music On February the Retro City Rampage soundtrack was released on
