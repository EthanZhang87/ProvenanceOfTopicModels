brothers Yuji and Hiroshi Kudo The founders grew up admiring trains and named the business after their favourite the Hudson locomotives called the and especially Japanese C br Hudson began as an amateur radio shop called CQ Hudson CQ selling radio telecommunications devices and art photographs Yuji Kudo had originally planned to start a coffee shop but there was already one in the same building resulting in the decision to change to a wireless radio shop at the eleventh hour Although the Kudo brothers had university education neither had studied in business management That factor combined with the difficulty to find trustworthy people to accompany the Kudos in their venture meant that Hudson was almost always in the red each month during its era exclusively as a radio shop br In September Hudson began selling personal computer related products and in March started developing and selling video game packages At that time many amateur radio shops were switching to the sales of personal computers because they deal with the same electronic equipment CQ Hudson would continue to operate for decades in Sapporo until Hudson Soft closed the shop in May br In the late s and early s Hudson Soft favoured a quantity over quality approach for the marketing of video games At one point the company released up to different computer software titles per month none of which were hugely successful Things changed in late when Hudson started to prioritise quality over quantity Hudson became Nintendo s first third party software vendor for the Family Computer and its title for this console Lode Runner sold million units after its release br The business continued developing video games on the Famicom and computer platforms MSX NEC PC and ZX Spectrum among others Bomberman was released in December of this year on the Famicom and was considered a big hit by Hudson Soft br In July Hudson developed the C System and collaborated with NEC to develop the PC Engine video game console It achieved a second best success to Famicom in Japan but its release as the TurboGrafx in North America had less market share than Nintendo s new Super NES or Sega s new Genesis In Hudson Soft developed and published video games for an array of systems In the bit semiconductor chip HuC was independently developed by Hudson and used in NEC s PC FX video game console br In Hudson started a joint venture with Flying Tiger Entertainment for titles br Hudson Soft relocated its main office to Tokyo in although the Sapporo headquarters remained in operation as a secondary office br Hudson Soft lost several key people starting in the mid s Co founder Hiroshi Kudo left the company in November following financial losses Shinichi Nakamoto who was with the company since and creator of the Bomberman series followed suit in Veteran Takahashi Meijin resigned in May he had joined Hudson Soft in Around many employees migrated to Nintendo s restructured NDCube studio which was headed by Hidetoshi Endo himself a former Hudson Soft president br br br Relation with Konami br The relation between Hudson Soft and Konami can be traced to at least as early as when Hudson ported Konami s arcade game Pooyan to the MSX and Famicom But the acquisition process of Hudson Soft by Konami would only begin in br Hudson Soft was severely hit by the collapse of its main bank Hokkaido Takushoku Seeking new financing alternatives Hudson Soft entered the stock market for the first time in December listing on the NASDAQ Japan Exchange This led to Konami purchasing a stock allocation of million shares in August becoming the company s largest shareholder Within the terms of this purchase Hudson acquired the Sapporo division of Konami Computer Entertainment Studio renaming it Hudson Studio br In April capital was increased via an allocation of million shares from a third party Konami Corporation holding of all Hudson stock became Hudson s majority shareholder and parent company Hudson Soft continued to publish video games while working closely with Konami who became Hudson s distributor in Japan br In April Hudson Soft became a wholly owned subsidiary of Konami Its American division Hudson Entertainment was liquidated in the process br On March Hudson Soft officially ceased to exist following a merger with Konami Digital Entertainment with its music business being absorbed into KME Corporation The move was not a unilateral decision from Konami but rather a voluntary merger agreed by the two companies during a board meeting held on January The main reason for the dissolution of Hudson Soft was the consolidation of the operations of Hudson and Konami into a single company br Despite the demise of Hudson Soft Konami had planned for products to continue being developed and offered under the Hudson brand The Hudson website was even initially retained and maintained by Konami By early however Konami had retired the website The pre headquarters of Hudson Soft in Sapporo continued to operate as a branch of Konami well after the absorption until it closed in In Konami sold the Sapporo building that had long been the headquarters of Hudson Soft br br br Caravan

around a single game with all of the initial years of to except being shoot em ups During these years the Caravan can be seen as a hallmark of Hudson s popularity Later Caravans were less popular and featured less punishing games Several of these later Caravans focused on Hudson Softs popular Bomberman series br Many of the early shoot em up games used for the Caravan competition included two minute and five minute modes built into the cartridges to allow potential competitors to practice prior to the competitions br br Star Force for the Famicom became the first game featured for the summer competitions held within Japan br Star Soldier for the Famicom became the second competition game br Starship Hector In Japan simply Hector was the third and last Famicom game featured as the Hudson Caravan moved onto the newer PC Engine The first three were reproduced in Hudson Caravan Collection for the Super Famicom and Hudson Best Collection for the Game Boy Advance br Power League World Class Baseball in the USA became the first PC Engine competition game unusual for the competition being a sports game rather than a shooter br Gunhed Blazing Lazers for the PC Engine was the competition game A small number of cartridges were produced for the competition under the name Gunhed Taikai Special Edition and are very rare and expensive for the most hardcore of collectors to find br Super Star Soldier for the PC Engine br Final Soldier for the PC Engine br Soldier Blade for the PC Engine would be the last of the popular caravan competitions as later events were held using the more casual Bomberman and other games fittingly popular at the time The PC Engine games from and were re released as the PC Engine Best Collection Soldier Collection for the PSP br br br Subsidiaries
