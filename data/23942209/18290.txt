id: 18290
A light emitting diode LED or an electroluminescent diode ELD is a semiconductor device that emits light when current flows through it Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes releasing energy in the form of photons The color of the light corresponding to the energy of the photons is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor White light is obtained by using multiple semiconductors or a layer of light emitting phosphor on the semiconductor device br Appearing as practical electronic components in the earliest LEDs emitted low intensity infrared IR light Infrared LEDs are used in remote control circuits such as those used with a wide variety of consumer electronics The first visible light LEDs were of low intensity and limited to red br Early LEDs were often used as indicator lamps replacing small incandescent bulbs and in seven segment displays Later developments produced LEDs available in visible ultraviolet UV and infrared wavelengths with high low or intermediate light output for instance white LEDs suitable for room and outdoor lighting LEDs have also given rise to new types of displays and sensors while their high switching rates are useful in advanced communications technology with applications as diverse as aviation lighting fairy lights strip lights automotive headlamps advertising general lighting traffic signals camera flashes lighted wallpaper horticultural grow lights and medical devices br LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources including lower power consumption a longer lifetime improved physical robustness smaller sizes and faster switching In exchange for these generally favorable attributes disadvantages of LEDs include electrical limitations to low voltage and generally to DC not AC power the inability to provide steady illumination from a pulsing DC or an AC electrical supply source and a lesser maximum operating temperature and storage temperature br LEDs are transducers of electricity into light They operate in reverse of photodiodes which convert light into electricity br br br History br br br Discoveries and early devices br br Electroluminescence as a phenomenon was discovered in by the English experimenter H J Round of Marconi Labs using a crystal of silicon carbide and a cat s whisker detector Russian inventor Oleg Losev reported the creation of the first LED in His research was distributed in Soviet German and British scientific journals but no practical use was made of the discovery for several decades partly due to the very inefficient light producing properties of silicon carbide the semiconductor Losev used br br In Georges Destriau observed that electroluminescence could be produced when zinc sulphide ZnS powder is suspended in an insulator and an alternating electrical field is applied to it In his publications Destriau often referred to luminescence as Losev Light Destriau worked in the laboratories of Madame Marie Curie also an early pioneer in the field of luminescence with research on radium br Hungarian Zolt n Bay together with Gy rgy Szigeti pre empted LED lighting in Hungary in by patenting a lighting device based on silicon carbide with an option on boron carbide that emitted white yellowish white or greenish white depending on impurities present Kurt Lehovec Carl Accardo and Edward Jamgochian explained these first LEDs in using an apparatus employing SiC crystals with a current source of a battery or a pulse generator and with a comparison to a variant pure crystal in br Rubin Braunstein of the Radio Corporation of America reported on infrared emission from gallium arsenide GaAs and other semiconductor alloys in Braunstein observed infrared emission generated by simple diode structures using gallium antimonide GaSb GaAs indium phosphide InP and silicon germanium SiGe alloys at room temperature and at kelvins In Braunstein further demonstrated that the rudimentary devices could be used for non radio communication across a short distance As noted by Kroemer Braunstein had set up a simple optical communications link Music emerging from a record player was used via suitable electronics to modulate the forward current of a GaAs diode The emitted light was detected by a PbS diode some distance away This signal was fed into an audio amplifier and played back by a loudspeaker Intercepting the beam stopped the music We had a great deal of fun playing with this setup This setup presaged the use of LEDs for optical communication applications br br In September while working at Texas Instruments in Dallas Texas James R Biard and Gary Pittman discovered near infrared nm light emission from a tunnel diode they had constructed on a GaAs substrate By October they had demonstrated efficient light emission and signal coupling between a GaAs p n junction light emitter and an electrically isolated semiconductor photodetector On August Biard and Pittman filed a patent titled Semiconductor Radiant Diode based on their findings which described a zinc diffused p n junction LED with a spaced cathode contact to allow for efficient emission of infrared light under forward bias br After establishing the priority of their work based on engineering notebooks predating submissions from G E Labs RCA Research Labs IBM Research Labs Bell Labs and Lincoln Lab at MIT the U S patent office issued the two inventors the patent for the GaAs infrared light emitting diode U S Patent US the first practical LED Immediately after filing the patent Texas Instruments TI began a project to manufacture infrared diodes In October TI announced the first commercial LED product the SNX which employed a pure GaAs crystal to emit an nm light output In October TI announced the first commercial hemispherical LED the SNX br In the s several laboratories focused on LEDs that would emit visible light A particularly important device was demonstrated by Nick Holonyak on October while he was working for General Electric in Syracuse New York The device used the semiconducting alloy gallium phosphide arsenide GaAsP It was the first semiconductor laser to emit visible light albeit at low temperatures At room temperature it still functioned as a red light emitting diode GaAsP was the basis for the first wave of commercial LEDs emitting visible light It was mass produced by the Monsanto and Hewlett Packard companies and used widely for displays in calculators and wrist watches br br M George Craford a former graduate student of Holonyak invented the first yellow LED and improved the brightness of red and red orange LEDs by a factor of ten in In T P Pearsall designed the first high brightness high efficiency LEDs for optical fiber telecommunications by inventing new semiconductor materials specifically adapted to optical fiber transmission wavelengths br br br Initial commercial development br br Until visible and infrared LEDs were extremely costly on the order of US per unit and so had little practical use The first commercial visible wavelength LEDs used GaAsP semiconductors and were commonly used as replacements for incandescent and neon indicator lamps and in seven segment displays first in expensive equipment such as laboratory and electronics test equipment then later in such appliances as calculators TVs radios telephones as well as watches br The Hewlett Packard company HP was engaged in research and development R D on practical LEDs between and by a research team under Howard C Borden Gerald P Pighini at HP Associates and HP Labs During this time HP collaborated with Monsanto Company on developing the first usable LED products The first usable LED products were HP s LED display and Monsanto s LED indicator lamp both launched in br Monsanto was the first organization to mass produce visible LEDs using Gallium arsenide phosphide GaAsP in to produce red LEDs suitable for indicators Monsanto had previously offered to supply HP with GaAsP but HP decided to grow its own GaAsP In February Hewlett Packard introduced the HP Model Numeric Indicator the first LED device to use integrated circuit integrated LED circuit technology It was the first intelligent LED display and was a revolution in digital display technology replacing the Nixie tube and becoming the basis for later LED displays br In the s commercially successful LED devices at less than five cents each were produced by Fairchild Optoelectronics These devices employed compound semiconductor chips fabricated with the planar process developed by Jean Hoerni The combination of planar processing for chip fabrication and innovative packaging methods enabled the team at Fairchild led by optoelectronics pioneer Thomas Brandt to achieve the needed cost reductions LED producers continue to use these methods br The early red LEDs were bright enough for use as indicators as the light output was not enough to illuminate an area Readouts in calculators were so small that plastic lenses were built over each digit to make them legible Later other colors became widely available and appeared in appliances and equipment br Early LEDs were packaged in metal cases similar to those of transistors with a glass window or lens to let the light out Modern indicator LEDs are packed in transparent molded plastic cases tubular or rectangular in shape and often tinted to match the device color Infrared devices may be dyed to block visible light More complex packages have been adapted for efficient heat dissipation in high power LEDs Surface mounted LEDs further reduce the package size LEDs intended for use with fiber optics cables may be provided with an optical connector br br br Blue LED br The first blue violet LED using magnesium doped gallium nitride was made at Stanford University in by Herb Maruska and Wally Rhines doctoral students in materials science and engineering At the time Maruska was on leave from RCA Laboratories where he collaborated with Jacques Pankove on related work In the year after Maruska left for Stanford his RCA colleagues Pankove and Ed Miller demonstrated the first blue electroluminescence from zinc doped gallium nitride though the subsequent device Pankove and Miller built the first actual gallium nitride light emitting diode emitted green light br In the U S Patent Office awarded Maruska Rhines and Stanford professor David Stevenson a patent for their work in U S Patent US A Today magnesium doping of gallium nitride remains the basis for all commercial blue LEDs and laser diodes In the early s these devices were too dim for practical use and research into gallium nitride devices slowed br In August Cree introduced the first commercially available blue LED based on the indirect bandgap semiconductor silicon carbide SiC SiC LEDs had very low efficiency no more than about but did emit in the blue portion of the visible light spectrum br In the late s key breakthroughs in GaN epitaxial growth and p type doping ushered in the modern era of GaN based optoelectronic devices Building upon this foundation Theodore Moustakas at Boston University patented a method for producing high brightness blue LEDs using a new two step process in In a US court ruled that three Taiwanese companies had infringed Moustakas s prior patent and ordered them to pay licensing fees of not less than US million br Two years later in high brightness blue LEDs were demonstrated by Shuji Nakamura of Nichia Corporation using a gallium nitride GaN growth process These LEDs had efficiencies of In parallel Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Nagoya University were working on developing the important GaN deposition on sapphire substrates and the demonstration of p type doping of GaN This new development revolutionized LED lighting making high power blue light sources practical leading to the development of technologies like Blu ray br Nakamura was awarded the Millennium Technology Prize for his invention br Nakamura Hiroshi Amano and Isamu Akasaki were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in for the invention of efficient blue light emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy saving white light sources br In Alberto Barbieri at the Cardiff University Laboratory GB investigated the efficiency and reliability of high brightness LEDs and demonstrated a transparent contact LED using indium tin oxide ITO on AlGaInP GaAs br In and processes for growing gallium nitride GaN LEDs on silicon were successfully demonstrated In January Osram demonstrated high power InGaN LEDs grown on silicon substrates commercially and GaN on silicon LEDs are in production at Plessey Semiconductors As of some manufacturers are using SiC as the substrate for LED production but sapphire is more common as it has the most similar properties to that of gallium nitride reducing the need for patterning the sapphire wafer patterned wafers are known as epi wafers Samsung the University of Cambridge and Toshiba are performing research into GaN on Si LEDs br Toshiba has stopped research possibly due to low yields Some opt for epitaxy which is difficult on silicon while others like the University of Cambridge choose a multi layer structure in order to reduce crystal lattice mismatch and different thermal expansion ratios to avoid cracking of the LED chip at high temperatures e g during manufacturing reduce heat generation and increase luminous efficiency Sapphire substrate patterning can be carried out with nanoimprint lithography br GaN on Si is difficult but desirable since it takes advantage of existing semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure It allows for the wafer level packaging of LED dies resulting in extremely small LED packages br GaN is often deposited using metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy MOCVD and it also uses lift off br br br White LEDs and the illumination breakthrough br Even though white light can be created using individual red green and blue LEDs this results in poor color rendering since only three narrow bands of wavelengths of light are being emitted The attainment of high efficiency blue LEDs was quickly followed by the development of the first white LED In this device a Y Al O Ce known as YAG or Ce YAG phosphor cerium doped phosphor coating produces yellow light through fluorescence The combination of that yellow with remaining blue light appears white to the eye Using different phosphors produces green and red light through fluorescence The resulting mixture of red green and blue is perceived as white light with improved color rendering compared to wavelengths from the blue LED YAG phosphor combination br br The first white LEDs were expensive and inefficient The light output then increased exponentially The latest research and development has been propagated by Japanese manufacturers such as Panasonic and Nichia and by Korean and Chinese manufacturers such as Samsung Solstice Kingsun Hoyol and others This trend in increased output has been called Haitz s law after Roland Haitz br Light output and efficiency of blue and near ultraviolet LEDs rose and the cost of reliable devices fell This led to relatively high power white light LEDs for illumination which are replacing incandescent and fluorescent lighting br Experimental white LEDs were demonstrated in to produce lumens per watt of electricity lm W some can last up to hours Commercially available LEDs have an efficiency of up to lm W as of A previous record of lm W was achieved by Nichia in Compared to incandescent bulbs this is a huge increase in electrical efficiency and even though LEDs are more expensive to purchase overall lifetime cost is significantly cheaper than that of incandescent bulbs br The LED chip is encapsulated inside a small plastic white mold although sometimes an LED package can incorporate a reflector It can be encapsulated using resin polyurethane based silicone or epoxy containing powdered Cerium doped YAG phosphor particles The viscosity of phosphor silicon mixtures must be carefully controlled After application of a phosphor silicon mixture on the LED using techniques such as jet dispensing and allowing the solvents to evaporate the LEDs are often tested and placed on tapes for SMT placement equipment for use in LED light bulb production Some remote phosphor LED light bulbs use a single plastic cover with YAG phosphor for one or several blue LEDs instead of using phosphor coatings on single chip white LEDs Ce YAG phosphors and epoxy in LEDs can degrade with use and is more apparent with higher concentrations of Ce YAG in phosphor silicone mixtures because the Ce YAG decomposes with use br The output of LEDs can shift to yellow over time due to degradation of the silicone There are several variants of Ce YAG and manufacturers in many cases do not reveal the exact compoosition of their Ce YAG offerings Several other phosphors are available for phosphor converted LEDs to produce several colors such as red which uses nitrosilicate phosphors and many other kinds of phosphor materials exist for LEDs such as phosphors based on oxides oxynitrides oxyhalides halides nitrides sulfides quantum dots and inorganic organic hybrid semiconductors A single LED can have several phosphors at the same time Some LEDs use phosphors made of glass ceramic or composite phosphor glass materials Alternatively the LED chips themselves can be coated with a thin coating of phosphor containing material called a conformal coating br The temperature of the phosphor during operation and how it is applied limits the size of an LED die Wafer level packaged white LEDs allow for extremely small LEDs br br br Polychromatic br In QPixel introduced as polychromatic LED that could replace the subpixel model for digital displays The technology uses a gallium nitride semiconductor that emits light of different frequencies modulated by voltage changes A prototype display achieved a resolution of PPI or k x k pixels br br br Physics of light production and emission br br In a light emitting diode the recombination of electrons and electron holes in a semiconductor produces light be it infrared visible or UV a process called electroluminescence The wavelength of the light depends on the energy band gap of the semiconductors used Since these materials have a high index of refraction design features of the devices such as special optical coatings and die shape are required to efficiently emit light br Unlike a laser the light emitted from an LED is neither spectrally coherent nor even highly monochromatic Its spectrum is sufficiently narrow that it appears to the human eye as a pure saturated color Also unlike most lasers its radiation is not spatially coherent so it cannot approach the very high intensity characteristic of lasers br br br Single color LEDs br br By selection of different semiconductor materials single color LEDs can be made that emit light in a narrow band of wavelengths from near infrared through the visible spectrum and into the ultraviolet range As the wavelengths become shorter because of the larger band gap of these semiconductors the operating voltage of the LED increases br br Blue LEDs have an active region consisting of one or more InGaN quantum wells sandwiched between thicker layers of GaN called cladding layers By varying the relative In Ga fraction in the InGaN quantum wells the light emission can in theory be varied from violet to amber br Aluminium gallium nitride AlGaN of varying Al Ga fraction can be used to manufacture the cladding and quantum well layers for ultraviolet LEDs but these devices have not yet reached the level of efficiency and technological maturity of InGaN GaN blue green devices If unalloyed GaN is used in this case to form the active quantum well layers the device emits near ultraviolet light with a peak wavelength centred around nm Green LEDs manufactured from the InGaN GaN system are far more efficient and brighter than green LEDs produced with non nitride material systems but practical devices still exhibit efficiency too low for high brightness applications br With AlGaN and AlGaInN even shorter wavelengths are achievable Near UV emitters at wavelengths around nm are already cheap and often encountered for example as black light lamp replacements for inspection of anti counterfeiting UV watermarks in documents and bank notes and for UV curing Substantially more expensive shorter wavelength diodes are commercially available for wavelengths down to nm As the photosensitivity of microorganisms approximately matches the absorption spectrum of DNA with a peak at about nm UV LED emitting at nm are expected in prospective disinfection and sterilization devices Recent research has shown that commercially available UVA LEDs nm are already effective disinfection and sterilization devices br UV C wavelengths were obtained in laboratories using aluminium nitride nm boron nitride nm and diamond nm br br br White LEDs br There are two primary ways of producing white light emitting diodes One is to use individual LEDs that emit three primary colors red green and blue and then mix all the colors to form white light The other is to use a phosphor material to convert monochromatic light from a blue or UV LED to broad spectrum white light similar to a fluorescent lamp The yellow phosphor is cerium doped YAG crystals suspended in the package or coated on the LED This YAG phosphor causes white LEDs to appear yellow when off and the space between the crystals allow some blue light to pass through in LEDs with partial phosphor conversion Alternatively white LEDs may use other phosphors like manganese IV doped potassium fluorosilicate PFS or other engineered phosphors PFS assists in red light generation and is used in conjunction with conventional Ce YAG phosphor br In LEDs with PFS phosphor some blue light passes through the phosphors the Ce YAG phosphor converts blue light to green and red yellow light and the PFS phosphor converts blue light to red light The color emission spectrum or color temperature of white phosphor converted and other phosphor converted LEDs can be controlled by changing the concentration of several phosphors that form a phosphor blend used in an LED package br The whiteness of the light produced is engineered to suit the human eye Because of metamerism it is possible to have quite different spectra that appear white The appearance of objects illuminated by that light may vary as the spectrum varies This is the issue of color rendition quite separate from color temperature An orange or cyan object could appear with the wrong color and much darker as the LED or phosphor does not emit the wavelength it reflects The best color rendition LEDs use a mix of phosphors resulting in less efficiency and better color rendering br The first white light emitting diodes LEDs were offered for sale in the autumn of Nichia made some of the first white LEDs which were based on blue LEDs with Ce YAG phosphor Ce YAG is often grown using the Czochralski method br br br RGB systems br br Mixing red green and blue sources to produce white light needs electronic circuits to control the blending of the colors Since LEDs have slightly different emission patterns the color balance may change depending on the angle of view even if the RGB sources are in a single package so RGB diodes are seldom used to produce white lighting Nonetheless this method has many applications because of the flexibility of mixing different colors and in principle this mechanism also has higher quantum efficiency in producing white light br There are several types of multicolor white LEDs di tri and tetrachromatic white LEDs Several key factors that play among these different methods include color stability color rendering capability and luminous efficacy Often higher efficiency means lower color rendering presenting a trade off between the luminous efficacy and color rendering For example the dichromatic white LEDs have the best luminous efficacy lm W but the lowest color rendering capability Although tetrachromatic white LEDs have excellent color rendering capability they often have poor luminous efficacy Trichromatic white LEDs are in between having both good luminous efficacy lm W and fair color rendering capability br One of the challenges is the development of more efficient green LEDs The theoretical maximum for green LEDs is lumens per watt but as of few green LEDs exceed even lumens per watt The blue and red LEDs approach their theoretical limits br Multicolor LEDs offer a means to form light of different colors Most perceivable colors can be formed by mixing different amounts of three primary colors This allows precise dynamic color control Their emission power decays exponentially with rising temperature br resulting in a substantial change in color stability Such problems inhibit industrial use Multicolor LEDs without phosphors cannot provide good color rendering because each LED is a narrowband source LEDs without phosphor while a poorer solution for general lighting are the best solution for displays either backlight of LCD or direct LED based pixels br Dimming a multicolor LED source to match the characteristics of incandescent lamps is difficult because manufacturing variations age and temperature change the actual color value output To emulate the appearance of dimming incandescent lamps may require a feedback system with color sensor to actively monitor and control the color br br br Phosphor based LEDs br br This method involves coating LEDs of one color mostly blue LEDs made of InGaN with phosphors of different colors to form white light the resultant LEDs are called phosphor based or phosphor converted white LEDs pcLEDs A fraction of the blue light undergoes the Stokes shift which transforms it from shorter wavelengths to longer Depending on the original LED s color various color phosphors are used Using several phosphor layers of distinct colors broadens the emitted spectrum effectively raising the color rendering index CRI br Phosphor based LEDs have efficiency losses due to heat loss from the Stokes shift and also other phosphor related issues Their luminous efficacies compared to normal LEDs depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the LED itself For example the luminous efficacy of a typical YAG yellow phosphor based white LED ranges from to times the luminous efficacy of the original blue LED because of the human eye s greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue as modeled in the luminosity function br Due to the simplicity of manufacturing the phosphor method is still the most popular method for making high intensity white LEDs The design and production of a light source or light fixture using a monochrome emitter with phosphor conversion is simpler and cheaper than a complex RGB system and the majority of high intensity white LEDs presently on the market are manufactured using phosphor light conversion br br Among the challenges being faced to improve the efficiency of LED based white light sources is the development of more efficient phosphors As of the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor with less than Stokes shift loss Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another to of efficiency loss Currently in the area of phosphor LED development much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures For instance the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor Conformal coating process is frequently used to address the issue of varying phosphor thickness br Some phosphor based white LEDs encapsulate InGaN blue LEDs inside phosphor coated epoxy Alternatively the LED might be paired with a remote phosphor a preformed polycarbonate piece coated with the phosphor material Remote phosphors provide more diffuse light which is desirable for many applications Remote phosphor designs are also more tolerant of variations in the LED emissions spectrum A common yellow phosphor material is cerium doped yttrium aluminium garnet Ce YAG br White LEDs can also be made by coating near ultraviolet NUV LEDs with a mixture of high efficiency europium based phosphors that emit red and blue plus copper and aluminium doped zinc sulfide ZnS Cu Al that emits green This is a method analogous to the way fluorescent lamps work This method is less efficient than blue LEDs with YAG Ce phosphor as the Stokes shift is larger so more energy is converted to heat but yields light with better spectral characteristics which render color better Due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet LEDs than of the blue ones both methods offer comparable brightness A concern is that UV light may leak from a malfunctioning light source and cause harm to human eyes or skin br A new style of wafers composed of gallium nitride on silicon GaN on Si is being used to produce white LEDs using mm silicon wafers This avoids the typical costly sapphire substrate in relatively small or mm wafer sizes The sapphire apparatus must be coupled with a mirror like collector to reflect light that would otherwise be wasted It was predicted that since of all GaN LEDs are made with GaN on Si Manufacturing large sapphire material is difficult while large silicon material is cheaper and more abundant LED companies shifting from using sapphire to silicon should be a minimal investment br br br Mixed white LEDs br br There are RGBW LEDs that combine RGB units with a phosphor white LED on the market Doing so retains the extremely tunable color of RGB LED but allows color rendering and efficiency to be optimized when a color close to white is selected br Some phosphor white LED units are tunable white blending two extremes of color temperatures commonly K and K to produce intermediate values This feature allows users to change the lighting to suit the current use of a multifunction room As illustrated by a straight line on the chromaticity diagram simple two white blends will have a pink bias becoming most severe in the middle A small amount of green light provided by another LED could correct the problem Some products are RGBWW i e RGBW with tunable white br A final class of white LED with mixed light is dim to warm These are ordinary K white LED bulbs with a small red LED that turns on when the bulb is dimmed Doing so makes the color warmer emulating an incandescent light bulb br br br Other white LEDs br Another method used to produce experimental white light LEDs used no phosphors at all and was based on homoepitaxially grown zinc selenide ZnSe on a ZnSe substrate that simultaneously emitted blue light from its active region and yellow light from the substrate br br br Organic light emitting diodes OLEDs br br In an organic light emitting diode OLED the electroluminescent material composing the emissive layer of the diode is an organic compound The organic material is electrically conductive due to the delocalization of pi electrons caused by conjugation over all or part of the molecule and the material therefore functions as an organic semiconductor The organic materials can be small organic molecules in a crystalline phase or polymers br The potential advantages of OLEDs include thin low cost displays with a low driving voltage wide viewing angle and high contrast and color gamut Polymer LEDs have the added benefit of printable and flexible displays OLEDs have been used to make visual displays for portable electronic devices such as cellphones digital cameras lighting and televisions br br br Perovskite Light emitting diodes PeLEDs br Perovskite light emitting diodes PeLEDs have emerged as promising candidates for next generation display and lighting technologies In recent years researchers have shown a growing interest in perovskite light emitting diodes PeLEDs owing to their capacity for emitting light with narrow bandwidth adjustable spectrum ability to deliver high color purity and cost effective solution fabrication br br br Green PeLEDs br When it comes to efficiency PeLEDs have not surpassed commercial organic light emitting diodes OLEDs because specific critical parameters such as charge carrier transport and optical output coupling efficiency have not been thoroughly optimized br In response to this challenge the development of ultra efficient green PeLEDs with a external quantum efficiency EQE exceeding the remarkable milestone was reported by Bai and his colleagues on May This achievement was made by strategic adjustments in charge carrier transport and the distribution of near field light These optimizations effectively reduced electron leakage and resulted in an exceptional light output coupling efficiency of A Ni Mg Ox film with high refractive index and increased hole carrier mobility was used as a hole injection layer to balance charge carrier injection and a polyethylene glycol layer was inserted between the hole transport layer and the perovskite emission layer to prevent electron leakage and minimize photon loss br The modified structure of green PeLED enabled it to achieve a world record external quantum efficiency of with a mean of at a brightness level of cd m This pioneering work introduces a compelling approach to building ultra efficient PeLEDs by effectively balancing electron hole recombination and enhancing light outcoupling br However expanding the effective area of perovskite LEDs can lead to a significant drop in their performance To address this issue Sun et al introduced L methionine NVAL to construct an intermediate phase with low formation enthalpy and COO coordination This new intermediate phase altered the crystallization pathway effectively inhibiting phase segregation Consequently high quality large area quasi D perovskite films were achieved They further fine tuned the film s composite dynamics leading to high efficiency quasi D perovskite green LEDs with an effective area of cm An external quantum efficiency EQE of was attained at n making it the most efficient large area perovskite LED Moreover a luminance of cd m was achieved in the n films br br br Blue PeLEDs br On March Zhou et al published a study demonstrating their successful control of ion behavior to create highly efficient sky blue perovskite light emitting diodes They achieved this by utilizing a bifunctional passivator which consisted of Lewis base benzoic acid anions and alkali metal cations This passivator had a dual role it effectively passivated the deficient lead atom while inhibited the migration of halide ions The outcome of this innovative approach was the realization of an efficient perovskite LED that emitted light at a stable wavelength of nm The LED exhibited a commendable external quantum efficiency EQE of with a peak EQE reaching Through optical coupling enhancement the EQE was further boosted to br br br Red PeLEDs br One of the most crucial aspects of lighting and display technology is the efficient generation of red emission Quasi D perovskites have demonstrated potential for high emission efficiency due to robust carrier confinement However the external quantum efficiencies EQE of most red quasi D PeLEDs are not optimal due to different n value phases within complex quasi D perovskite films br To address this challenge Jiang et al published their findings in Advanced Materials on July Their research focused on strategically incorporating large cations to enhance the efficiency of red light perovskite LEDs By introducing phenethylammonium iodide PEAI fluorophenylethylammonium iodide m F PEA and naphthylmethylammonium iodide NMAI they achieved precise control over the phase distribution of quasi D perovskite materials This approach effectively reduced the prevalence of smaller n index phases and concurrently addressed lead and halide defects in the perovskite films The outcome of this research was the development of perovskite LEDs capable of achieving an EQE of at nm accompanied by a peak brightness of cd m br br br White PeLEDs br High performance white perovskite LED with high light extraction efficiency can be constructed through near field optical coupling The near field optical coupling between blue perovskite diode and red perovskite nanocrystal was achieved by a reasonably designed multi layer translucent electrode LiF Al Ag LiF The red perovskite nano crystalline layer allows the waveguide mode and surface plasmon polarization mode captured in the blue perovskite diode to be extracted and converted into red light emission increasing the light extraction efficiency by At the same time the complementary emission spectra of blue photons and down converted red photons contribute to the formation of white LEDs Finally the off device quantum efficiency exceeds and the brightness exceeds cd m which are both the highest in white PeLEDs br br br Lifetime br Preparing high quality all inorganic perovskite films through solution based methods remains a formidable challenge primarily attributed to the rapid and uncontrollable crystallization of such materials The key innovation involved controlling the crystal orientation of the all inorganic perovskite along the plane through a low temperature annealing process C This precise control led to the orderly stacking of crystals which significantly increased surface coverage and reduced defects within the material After thorough optimization the well oriented CsPbBr perovskite LED achieved an external quantum efficiency EQE of up to a remarkable brightness of cd m and a lifespan of hours when initially operated at a brightness level of cd m br On September the team led by Sargent et al from the University of Toronto published their research findings in the Journal of the American Chemical Society JACS on bright and stable light emitting diodes LEDs based on perovskite quantum dots within a perovskite matrix The research reported that perovskite quantum dots remain stable in a precursor solution thin film of perovskite and drive the uniform crystallization of the perovskite matrix using strain quantum dots as nucleation centers The type I band alignment ensures that quantum dots act as charge acceptors and radiative emitters br The new material exhibits suppressed biexciton Auger recombination and bright luminescence even at high excitation W cm The red LEDs based on the new material demonstrate an external quantum efficiency of and maintain high performance at a brightness exceeding cd m The new material extends the LED s operating half life to hours at an initial brightness of cd m br br br Types br br LEDs are made in different packages for different applications A single or a few LED junctions may be packed in one miniature device for use as an indicator or pilot lamp An LED array may include controlling circuits within the same package which may range from a simple resistor blinking or color changing control or an addressable controller for RGB devices Higher powered white emitting devices will be mounted on heat sinks and will be used for illumination Alphanumeric displays in dot matrix or bar formats are widely available Special packages permit connection of LEDs to optical fibers for high speed data communication links br br br Miniature br br These are mostly single die LEDs used as indicators and they come in various sizes from mm to mm through hole and surface mount packages Typical current ratings range from around mA to above mA Multiple LED dies attached to a flexible backing tape form an LED strip light br Common package shapes include round with a domed or flat top rectangular with a flat top as used in bar graph displays and triangular or square with a flat top The encapsulation may also be clear or tinted to improve contrast and viewing angle Infrared devices may have a black tint to block visible light while passing infrared radiation br Ultra high output LEDs are designed for viewing in direct sunlight br V and V LEDs are ordinary miniature LEDs that have a series resistor for direct connection to a V or V supply br br br High power br br High power LEDs HP LEDs or high output LEDs HO LEDs can be driven at currents from hundreds of mA to more than an ampere compared with the tens of mA for other LEDs Some can emit over a thousand lumens LED power densities up to W cm have been achieved Since overheating is destructive the HP LEDs must be mounted on a heat sink to allow for heat dissipation If the heat from an HP LED is not removed the device fails in seconds One HP LED can often replace an incandescent bulb in a flashlight or be set in an array to form a powerful LED lamp br Some HP LEDs in this category are the Nichia series Lumileds Rebel Led Osram Opto Semiconductors Golden Dragon and Cree X lamp As of September some HP LEDs manufactured by Cree exceed lm W br Examples for Haitz s law which predicts an exponential rise in light output and efficacy of LEDs over time are the CREE XP G series LED which achieved lm W in and the Nichia series with a typical efficacy of lm W released in br br br AC driven br LEDs developed by Seoul Semiconductor can operate on AC power without a DC converter For each half cycle part of the LED emits light and part is dark and this is reversed during the next half cycle The efficiency of this type of HP LED is typically lm W A large number of LED elements in series may be able to operate directly from line voltage In Seoul Semiconductor released a high DC voltage LED named Acrich MJT capable of being driven from AC power with a simple controlling circuit The low power dissipation of these LEDs affords them more flexibility than the original AC LED design br br br Strip br br br Application specific br br Flashing br Flashing LEDs are used as attention seeking indicators without requiring external electronics Flashing LEDs resemble standard LEDs but they contain an integrated voltage regulator and a multivibrator circuit that causes the LED to flash with a typical period of one second In diffused lens LEDs this circuit is visible as a small black dot Most flashing LEDs emit light of one color but more sophisticated devices can flash between multiple colors and even fade through a color sequence using RGB color mixing Flashing SMD LEDs in the and other size formats have been available since early br Flickering br Integrated electronics Simple electronic circuits integrated into the LED package have been around since at least which produce a random LED intensity pattern reminiscent of a flickering candle Reverse engineering in has suggested that some flickering LEDs with automatic sleep and wake modes might be using an integrated bit microcontroller for such functionally br Bi color br Bi color LEDs contain two different LED emitters in one case There are two types of these One type consists of two dies connected to the same two leads antiparallel to each other Current flow in one direction emits one color and current in the opposite direction emits the other color The other type consists of two dies with separate leads for both dies and another lead for common anode or cathode so that they can be controlled independently The most common bi color combination is red traditional green Others include amber traditional green red pure green red blue and blue pure green br RGB tri color br Tri color LEDs contain three different LED emitters in one case Each emitter is connected to a separate lead so they can be controlled independently A four lead arrangement is typical with one common lead anode or cathode and an additional lead for each color Others have only two leads positive and negative and have a built in electronic controller RGB LEDs consist of one red one green and one blue LED By independently adjusting each of the three RGB LEDs are capable of producing a wide color gamut Unlike dedicated color LEDs these do not produce pure wavelengths Modules may not be optimized for smooth color mixing br Decorative multicolor br Decorative multicolor LEDs incorporate several emitters of different colors supplied by only two lead out wires Colors are switched internally by varying the supply voltage br Alphanumeric br Alphanumeric LEDs are available in seven segment starburst and dot matrix format Seven segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters Starburst displays can display all letters Dot matrix displays typically use pixels per character Seven segment LED displays were in widespread use in the s and s but rising use of liquid crystal displays with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays br Digital RGB br Digital RGB addressable LEDs contain their own smart control electronics In addition to power and ground these provide connections for data in data out clock and sometimes a strobe signal These are connected in a daisy chain which allows individual LEDs in a long LED strip light to be easily controlled by a microcontroller Data sent to the first LED of the chain can control the brightness and color of each LED independently of the others They are used where a combination of maximum control and minimum visible electronics are needed such as strings for Christmas and LED matrices Some even have refresh rates in the kHz range allowing for basic video applications These devices are known by their part number WS being common or a brand name such as NeoPixel br Filament br An LED filament consists of multiple LED chips connected in series on a common longitudinal substrate that forms a thin rod reminiscent of a traditional incandescent filament These are being used as a low cost decorative alternative for traditional light bulbs that are being phased out in many countries The filaments use a rather high voltage allowing them to work efficiently with mains voltages Often a simple rectifier and capacitive current limiting are employed to create a low cost replacement for a traditional light bulb without the complexity of the low voltage high current converter that single die LEDs need Usually they are packaged in bulb similar to the lamps they were designed to replace and filled with inert gas at slightly lower than ambient pressure to remove heat efficiently and prevent corrosion br Chip on board arrays br Surface mounted LEDs are frequently produced in chip on board COB arrays allowing better heat dissipation than with a single LED of comparable luminous output The LEDs can be arranged around a cylinder and are called corn cob lights because of the rows of yellow LEDs br br br Considerations for use br br br Power sources br br The current in an LED or other diodes rises exponentially with the applied voltage see Shockley diode equation so a small change in voltage can cause a large change in current Current through the LED must be regulated by an external circuit such as a constant current source to prevent damage Since most common power supplies are nearly constant voltage sources LED fixtures must include a power converter or at least a current limiting resistor In some applications the internal resistance of small batteries is sufficient to keep current within the LED rating br br br Electrical polarity br br Unlike a traditional incandescent lamp an LED will light only when voltage is applied in the forward direction of the diode No current flows and no light is emitted if voltage is applied in the reverse direction If the reverse voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage which is typically about five volts a large current flows and the LED will be damaged If the reverse current is sufficiently limited to avoid damage the reverse conducting LED is a useful noise diode br By definition the energy band gap of any diode is higher when reverse biased than when forward biased Because the band gap energy determines the wavelength of the light emitted the color cannot be the same when reverse biased The reverse breakdown voltage is sufficiently high that the emitted wavelength cannot be similar enough to still be visible Though dual LED packages exist that contain a different color LED in each direction it is not expected that any single LED element can emit visible light when reverse biased br It is not known if any zener diode could exist that emits light only in reverse bias mode Uniquely this type of LED would conduct when connected backwards br br br Safety and health br Certain blue LEDs and cool white LEDs can exceed safe limits of the so called blue light hazard as defined in eye safety specifications such as ANSI IESNA RP Recommended Practice for Photobiological Safety for Lamp and Lamp Systems One study showed no evidence of a risk in normal use at domestic illuminance and that caution is only needed for particular occupational situations or for specific populations In the International Electrotechnical Commission published IEC Photobiological safety of lamps and lamp systems replacing the application of early laser oriented standards for classification of LED sources br While LEDs have the advantage over fluorescent lamps in that they do not contain mercury they may contain other hazardous metals such as lead and arsenic br In the American Medical Association AMA issued a statement concerning the possible adverse influence of blueish street lighting on the sleep wake cycle of city dwellers Industry critics claim exposure levels are not high enough to have a noticeable effect br br br Advantages br Efficiency LEDs emit more lumens per watt than incandescent light bulbs The efficiency of LED lighting fixtures is not affected by shape and size unlike fluorescent light bulbs or tubes br Color LEDs can emit light of an intended color without using any color filters as traditional lighting methods need This is more efficient and can lower initial costs br Size LEDs can be very small smaller than mm and are easily attached to printed circuit boards br Switch on time LEDs light up extremely quickly A typical red indicator LED achieves full brightness in under a microsecond LEDs used in communications devices can have even faster response times br Cycling LEDs are ideal for uses subject to frequent on off cycling unlike incandescent and fluorescent lamps that fail faster when cycled often or high intensity discharge lamps HID lamps that require a long time to warm up to full output and to cool down before they can be lighted again if they are being restarted br Dimming LEDs can very easily be dimmed either by pulse width modulation or lowering the forward current This pulse width modulation is why LED lights particularly headlights on cars when viewed on camera or by some people seem to flash or flicker This is a type of stroboscopic effect br Cool light In contrast to most light sources LEDs radiate very little heat in the form of IR that can cause damage to sensitive objects or fabrics Wasted energy is dispersed as heat through the base of the LED br Slow failure LEDs mainly fail by dimming over time rather than the abrupt failure of incandescent bulbs br Lifetime LEDs can have a relatively long useful life One report estimates to hours of useful life though time to complete failure may be shorter or longer Fluorescent tubes typically are rated at about to hours depending partly on the conditions of use and incandescent light bulbs at to hours Several DOE demonstrations have shown that reduced maintenance costs from this extended lifetime rather than energy savings is the primary factor in determining the payback period for an LED product br Shock resistance LEDs being solid state components are difficult to damage with external shock unlike fluorescent and incandescent bulbs which are fragile br Focus The solid package of the LED can be designed to focus its light Incandescent and fluorescent sources often require an external reflector to collect light and direct it in a usable manner For larger LED packages total internal reflection TIR lenses are often used to the same effect When large quantities of light are needed many light sources such as LED chips are usually deployed which are difficult to focus or collimate on the same target br br br Disadvantages br Temperature dependence LED performance largely depends on the ambient temperature of the operating environment or thermal management properties Overdriving an LED in high ambient temperatures may result in overheating the LED package eventually leading to device failure An adequate heat sink is needed to maintain long life This is especially important in automotive medical and military uses where devices must operate over a wide range of temperatures and require low failure rates br Voltage sensitivity LEDs must be supplied with a voltage above their threshold voltage and a current below their rating Current and lifetime change greatly with a small change in applied voltage They thus require a current regulated supply usually just a series resistor for indicator LEDs br Color rendition Most cool white LEDs have spectra that differ significantly from a black body radiator like the sun or an incandescent light The spike at nm and dip at nm can make the color of objects appear differently under cool white LED illumination than sunlight or incandescent sources due to metamerism red surfaces being rendered particularly poorly by typical phosphor based cool white LEDs The same is true with green surfaces The quality of color rendition of an LED is measured by the Color Rendering Index CRI br Area light source Single LEDs do not approximate a point source of light giving a spherical light distribution but rather a lambertian distribution So LEDs are difficult to apply to uses needing a spherical light field Different fields of light can be manipulated by the application of different optics or lenses LEDs cannot provide divergence below a few degrees br Light pollution Because white LEDs emit more short wavelength light than sources such as high pressure sodium vapor lamps the increased blue and green sensitivity of scotopic vision means that white LEDs used in outdoor lighting cause substantially more sky glow br Efficiency droop The efficiency of LEDs decreases as the electric current increases Heating also increases with higher currents which compromises LED lifetime These effects put practical limits on the current through an LED in high power applications br Impact on wildlife LEDs are much more attractive to insects than sodium vapor lights so much so that there has been speculative concern about the possibility of disruption to food webs LED lighting near beaches particularly intense blue and white colors can disorient turtle hatchlings and make them wander inland instead The use of turtle safe lighting LEDs that emit only at narrow portions of the visible spectrum is encouraged by conservancy groups in order to reduce harm br Use in winter conditions Since they do not give off much heat in comparison to incandescent lights LED lights used for traffic control can have snow obscuring them leading to accidents br Thermal runaway Parallel strings of LEDs will not share current evenly due to the manufacturing tolerances in their forward voltage Running two or more strings from a single current source may result in LED failure as the devices warm up If forward voltage binning is not possible a circuit is required to ensure even distribution of current between parallel strands br br br Manufacturing br LED manufacturing involves multiple steps including epitaxy chip processing chip separation and packaging br In a typical LED manufacturing process encapsulation is performed after probing dicing die transfer from wafer to package and wire bonding or flip chip mounting perhaps using Indium tin oxide a transparent electrical conductor In this case the bond wire s are attached to the ITO film that has been deposited in the LEDs br Flip chip circuit on board COB is a technique that can be used to manufacture LEDs br br br Applications br br LED uses fall into five major categories br br Visual signals where light goes more or less directly from the source to the human eye to convey a message or meaning br Illumination where light is reflected from objects to give visual response of these objects br Measuring and interacting with processes involving no human vision br Narrow band light sensors where LEDs operate in a reverse bias mode and respond to incident light instead of emitting light br Indoor cultivation including cannabis br br br Indicators and signs br br The low energy consumption low maintenance and small size of LEDs has led to uses as status indicators and displays on a variety of equipment and installations Large area LED displays are used as stadium displays dynamic decorative displays and dynamic message signs on freeways Thin lightweight message displays are used at airports and railway stations and as destination displays for trains buses trams and ferries br br One color light is well suited for traffic lights and signals exit signs emergency vehicle lighting ships navigation lights and LED based Christmas lights br Because of their long life fast switching times and visibility in broad daylight due to their high output and focus LEDs have been used in automotive brake lights and turn signals The use in brakes improves safety due to a great reduction in the time needed to light fully or faster rise time about second faster than an incandescent bulb This gives drivers behind more time to react In a dual intensity circuit rear markers and brakes if the LEDs are not pulsed at a fast enough frequency they can create a phantom array where ghost images of the LED appear if the eyes quickly scan across the array White LED headlamps are beginning to appear Using LEDs has styling advantages because LEDs can form much thinner lights than incandescent lamps with parabolic reflectors br Due to the relative cheapness of low output LEDs they are also used in many temporary uses such as glowsticks and throwies Artists have also used LEDs for LED art br br br Lighting br br With the development of high efficiency and high power LEDs it has become possible to use LEDs in lighting and illumination To encourage the shift to LED lamps and other high efficiency lighting in the US Department of Energy created the L Prize competition The Philips Lighting North America LED bulb won the first competition on August after successfully completing months of intensive field lab and product testing br Efficient lighting is needed for sustainable architecture As of some LED bulbs provide up to lm W and even inexpensive low end models typically exceed lm W so that a watt LED could achieve the same results as a standard watt incandescent bulb The lower heat output of LEDs also reduces demand on air conditioning systems Worldwide LEDs are rapidly adopted to displace less effective sources such as incandescent lamps and CFLs and reduce electrical energy consumption and its associated emissions Solar powered LEDs are used as street lights and in architectural lighting br The mechanical robustness and long lifetime are used in automotive lighting on cars motorcycles and bicycle lights LED street lights are employed on poles and in parking garages In the Italian village of Torraca was the first place to convert its street lighting to LEDs br Cabin lighting on recent Airbus and Boeing jetliners uses LED lighting LEDs are also being used in airport and heliport lighting LED airport fixtures currently include medium intensity runway lights runway centerline lights taxiway centerline and edge lights guidance signs and obstruction lighting br LEDs are also used as a light source for DLP projectors and to backlight newer LCD television referred to as LED TV computer monitor including laptop and handheld device LCDs succeeding older CCFL backlit LCDs although being superseded by OLED screens RGB LEDs raise the color gamut by as much as Screens for TV and computer displays can be made thinner using LEDs for backlighting br LEDs are small durable and need little power so they are used in handheld devices such as flashlights LED strobe lights or camera flashes operate at a safe low voltage instead of the volts commonly found in xenon flashlamp based lighting This is especially useful in cameras on mobile phones where space is at a premium and bulky voltage raising circuitry is undesirable br LEDs are used for infrared illumination in night vision uses including security cameras A ring of LEDs around a video camera aimed forward into a retroreflective background allows chroma keying in video productions br br LEDs are used in mining operations as cap lamps to provide light for miners Research has been done to improve LEDs for mining to reduce glare and to increase illumination reducing risk of injury to the miners br LEDs are increasingly finding uses in medical and educational applications for example as mood enhancement NASA has even sponsored research for the use of LEDs to promote health for astronauts br br br Data communication and other signalling br br Light can be used to transmit data and analog signals For example lighting white LEDs can be used in systems assisting people to navigate in closed spaces while searching necessary rooms or objects br Assistive listening devices in many theaters and similar spaces use arrays of infrared LEDs to send sound to listeners receivers Light emitting diodes as well as semiconductor lasers are used to send data over many types of fiber optic cable from digital audio over TOSLINK cables to the very high bandwidth fiber links that form the Internet backbone For some time computers were commonly equipped with IrDA interfaces which allowed them to send and receive data to nearby machines via infrared br Because LEDs can cycle on and off millions of times per second very high data bandwidth can be achieved For that reason visible light communication VLC has been proposed as an alternative to the increasingly competitive radio bandwidth VLC operates in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum so data can be transmitted without occupying the frequencies of radio communications br br br Machine vision systems br br Machine vision systems often require bright and homogeneous illumination so features of interest are easier to process LEDs are often used br Barcode scanners are the most common example of machine vision applications and many of those scanners use red LEDs instead of lasers Optical computer mice use LEDs as a light source for the miniature camera within the mouse br LEDs are useful for machine vision because they provide a compact reliable source of light LED lamps can be turned on and off to suit the needs of the vision system and the shape of the beam produced can be tailored to match the system s requirements br br br Biological detection br The discovery of radiative recombination in aluminum gallium nitride AlGaN alloys by U S Army Research Laboratory ARL led to the conceptualization of UV light emitting diodes LEDs to be incorporated in light induced fluorescence sensors used for biological agent detection In the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center ECBC initiated the effort to create a biological detector named TAC BIO The program capitalized on semiconductor UV optical sources SUVOS developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA br UV induced fluorescence is one of the most robust techniques used for rapid real time detection of biological aerosols The first UV sensors were lasers lacking in field use practicality In order to address this DARPA incorporated SUVOS technology to create a low cost small lightweight low power device The TAC BIO detector s response time was one minute from when it sensed a biological agent It was also demonstrated that the detector could be operated unattended indoors and outdoors for weeks at a time br Aerosolized biological particles fluoresce and scatter light under a UV light beam Observed fluorescence is dependent on the applied wavelength and the biochemical fluorophores within the biological agent UV induced fluorescence offers a rapid accurate efficient and logistically practical way for biological agent detection This is because the use of UV fluorescence is reagentless or a process that does not require an added chemical to produce a reaction with no consumables or produces no chemical byproducts br Additionally TAC BIO can reliably discriminate between threat and non threat aerosols It was claimed to be sensitive enough to detect low concentrations but not so sensitive that it would cause false positives The particle counting algorithm used in the device converted raw data into information by counting the photon pulses per unit of time from the fluorescence and scattering detectors and comparing the value to a set threshold br The original TAC BIO was introduced in while the second generation TAC BIO GEN II was designed in to be more cost efficient as plastic parts were used Its small light weight design allows it to be mounted to vehicles robots and unmanned aerial vehicles The second generation device could also be utilized as an environmental detector to monitor air quality in hospitals airplanes or even in households to detect fungus and mold br br br Other applications br br The light from LEDs can be modulated very quickly so they are used extensively in optical fiber and free space optics communications This includes remote controls such as for television sets where infrared LEDs are often used Opto isolators use an LED combined with a photodiode or phototransistor to provide a signal path with electrical isolation between two circuits This is especially useful in medical equipment where the signals from a low voltage sensor circuit usually battery powered in contact with a living organism must be electrically isolated from any possible electrical failure in a recording or monitoring device operating at potentially dangerous voltages An optoisolator also lets information be transferred between circuits that do not share a common ground potential br Many sensor systems rely on light as the signal source LEDs are often ideal as a light source due to the requirements of the sensors The Nintendo Wii s sensor bar uses infrared LEDs Pulse oximeters use them for measuring oxygen saturation Some flatbed scanners use arrays of RGB LEDs rather than the typical cold cathode fluorescent lamp as the light source Having independent control of three illuminated colors allows the scanner to calibrate itself for more accurate color balance and there is no need for warm up Further its sensors only need be monochromatic since at any one time the page being scanned is only lit by one color of light br Since LEDs can also be used as photodiodes they can be used for both photo emission and detection This could be used for example in a touchscreen that registers reflected light from a finger or stylus Many materials and biological systems are sensitive to or dependent on light Grow lights use LEDs to increase photosynthesis in plants and bacteria and viruses can be removed from water and other substances using UV LEDs for sterilization LEDs of certain wavelengths have also been used for light therapy treatment of neonatal jaundice and acne br UV LEDs with spectra range of nm to nm have other applications such as water air purification surface disinfection glue curing free space non line of sight communication high performance liquid chromatography UV curing dye printing phototherapy nm Vitamin D nm Excimer lamp or laser replacement medical analytical instrumentation and DNA absorption br LEDs have also been used as a medium quality voltage reference in electronic circuits The forward voltage drop about V for a red LED or V for an infrared can be used instead of a Zener diode in low voltage regulators Red LEDs have the flattest I V curve above the knee Nitride based LEDs have a fairly steep I V curve and are useless for this purpose Although LED forward voltage is far more current dependent than a Zener diode Zener diodes with breakdown voltages below V are not widely available br The progressive miniaturization of low voltage lighting technology such as LEDs and OLEDs suitable to incorporate into low thickness materials has fostered experimentation in combining light sources and wall covering surfaces for interior walls in the form of LED wallpaper br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Research and development br br br Key challenges br LEDs require optimized efficiency to hinge on ongoing improvements such as phosphor materials and quantum dots br The process of down conversion the method by which materials convert more energetic photons to different less energetic colors also needs improvement For example the red phosphors that are used today are thermally sensitive and need to be improved in that aspect so that they do not color shift and experience efficiency drop off with temperature Red phosphors could also benefit from a narrower spectral width to emit more lumens and becoming more efficient at converting photons br In addition work remains to be done in the realms of current efficiency droop color shift system reliability light distribution dimming thermal management and power supply performance br Early suspicions were that the LED droop was caused by elevated temperatures Scientists showed that temperature was not the root cause of efficiency droop The mechanism causing efficiency droop was identified in as Auger recombination which was taken with mixed reaction A study conclusively identified Auger recombination as the cause br br br Potential technology br A new family of LEDs are based on the semiconductors called perovskites In less than four years after their discovery the ability of perovskite LEDs PLEDs to produce light from electrons already rivaled those of the best performing OLEDs They have a potential for cost effectiveness as they can be processed from solution a low cost and low tech method which might allow perovskite based devices that have large areas to be made with extremely low cost Their efficiency is superior by eliminating non radiative losses in other words elimination of recombination pathways that do not produce photons or by solving outcoupling problem prevalent for thin film LEDs or balancing charge carrier injection to increase the EQE external quantum efficiency The most up to date PLED devices have broken the performance barrier by shooting the EQE above br In Cao et al and Lin et al independently published two papers on developing perovskite LEDs with EQE greater than which made these two papers a mile stone in PLED development Their device have similar planar structure i e the active layer perovskite is sandwiched between two electrodes To achieve a high EQE they not only reduced non radiative recombination but also utilized their own subtly different methods to improve the EQE br In the work of Cao et al researchers targeted the outcoupling problem which is that the optical physics of thin film LEDs causes the majority of light generated by the semiconductor to be trapped in the device To achieve this goal they demonstrated that solution processed perovskites can spontaneously form submicrometre scale crystal platelets which can efficiently extract light from the device These perovskites are formed via the introduction of amino acid additives into the perovskite precursor solutions In addition their method is able to passivate perovskite surface defects and reduce nonradiative recombination Therefore by improving the light outcoupling and reducing nonradiative losses Cao and his colleagues successfully achieved PLED with EQE up to br Lin and his colleague used a different approach to generate high EQE Instead of modifying the microstructure of perovskite layer they chose to adopt a new strategy for managing the compositional distribution in the device an approach that simultaneously provides high luminescence and balanced charge injection In other words they still used flat emissive layer but tried to optimize the balance of electrons and holes injected into the perovskite so as to make the most efficient use of the charge carriers Moreover in the perovskite layer the crystals are perfectly enclosed by MABr additive where MA is CH NH The MABr shell passivates the nonradiative defects that would otherwise be present perovskite crystals resulting in reduction of the nonradiative recombination Therefore by balancing charge injection and decreasing nonradiative losses Lin and his colleagues developed PLED
