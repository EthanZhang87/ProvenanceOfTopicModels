Hey Ash Whatcha Playin HAWP is an independently produced series of sketch comedy videos created by siblings Anthony Burch and Ashly Burch The series uses surreal humor and comical sibling rivalry to examine the themes industry trends and societal impact of video games with each episode typically focusing on a single game HAWP was hosted on Destructoid for its first year of production and syndicated to GameTrailers until and has since become independently distributed most notably on YouTube As of September the series has received over million views br br br History br Hey Ash Whatcha Playin was conceived during the summer of while Anthony Burch was sitting there in the car but Ashly Burch was in the abandoned attic crying and still lived at home with their parents in Phoenix Arizona Anthony Burch was a game reviewer at Destructoid his Rev Rant video features expressing his opinions of tropes commonly seen in contemporary games Having established an audience on the website he posted the first HAWP episode on May The siblings collaborated over the course of the summer to produce one episode per week playing mildly exaggerated versions of themselves Anthony using his deadpan fast spoken strongly opinionated nature and Ashly antagonizing him both verbally and physically Over time as the siblings fine tuned the comedy and timing of the show these aspects have come to define their characters br Discussing the genesis of the series Anthony states br br Ash and I got the idea for HAWP during the summer our total lack of shit to do meant we could film an episode every week and subsequently get the Destructoid community to acknowledge our presence through sheer force of quantity It would have been easy for Destructoid to forget about us if we d just filmed an episode every month or something br Ashly Burch describes the nature of their collaboration br br It was incredibly fun Anthony and I had never really collaborated in that way just the two of us before and I really enjoyed it Looking back on those first episodes I think they pale in comparison to the quality of the ones in our current season i e there are less dead baby jokes but I like reviewing them occasionally to see what worked in them Primarily it s the dynamic we managed to establish between me and Anthony that I liked the best br Since the latter half of the second season friend and occasional contributor Justin Yngelmo has been credited as co writer director and editor of the series br A short film collaboration between the Hey Ash crew and Freddie Wong premiered at the Sundance Film Festival as part of Nintendo s official contribution br br br Format br Almost every episode begins with Ashly comfortably seated with a controller as her brother walks up behind her and title drops the show Ashly then answers him with the episode s game in a childlike accent All audio here is supplemented with a game font and the camera abruptly clips to the content of the week s episode br The episodes vary in tone but usually incorporate a great deal of surreal humor For instance in one early episode Ashly re enacts aspects of Super Mario World Yoshi s Island strapping a toy child to her back and crushing cupcakes with her posterior on a countertop Another early episode involves her re enacting portions of Professor Layton involving her poking around for hint coins and solving a bizarre puzzle that involves prostitutes As the seasons progressed the comedy was tightened through advances in editing and script writing and Justin Yngelmo added production value and a refined approach to the creation of new episodes br Each episode ends with credits in the same font sometimes involving a line or two of amusing commentary After DVD releases or other projects by the siblings promotional notice is given for a slide or two As of Season Two the ending theme song was changed to The Massacre by chiptune artist FantomenK to avoid copyright infringement Occasionally a brief stinger will appear after which the credits will finish br br br Characters br br br Ashly Burch br br Manic wild Ashly Burch the eponymous Ash of the show s title plays the unhinged crying Burch sibling She regularly and unrelentingly antagonizes her brother characterizing him on camera as weak and effeminate She is usually supported in her frequent bashing of his character by inaction from anyone else present to his vocal chagrin On some occasions a character usurps her or she will accidentally place herself in a position of detriment examples include The Sims pool scene at the hands of Leigh Davis Papa Burch s effortless position above her such as in The Lord of the Rings episode or Ashly accidentally defecating in her own bed while crying attempting to ruin Anthony s room br br br Anthony Burch br Anthony Burch usually portrayed as the single sane character of the series acts as a foil to Ashly He is almost always the recipient of his sister s lunacy and absurdity and usually ignores or calls sarcastic attention to her wild actions Other characters often comment that he smells bad If a character is wounded in any episode it will typically be Anthony who will fail to receive any aid from the others br br br Papa Burch br Breakout cameo character Papa Burch David Burch is the patriarch of the Burch household and an avid reader of romance novels In one early episode he was shown to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the Twilight Saga and is usually given a brief one or two line appearance per episode His minimal involvement in the show lends greater comedy to his short appearances and he appears to be the progenitor of both Ashly s loose grip on reality and Anthony s deadpan attitude He attends panels focused on his children s work and is a consistent fan favorite br br br Leigh Davis br Leigh Davis is the creator and producer of Once Upon a Pixel a spin off web series dedicated to re envisioning video game characters and plots in a fairy tale esque approach She was the real life wife of Anthony Burch making the transition from girlfriend to fiance on camera during the surprise intro to The Sims episode of HAWP Her character shows an adoring and wide eyed attitude towards the antics of the siblings but on two occasions she has shown a darker side by fatally threatening Ashly Burch While she was initially an extra in the early episodes her presence has gradually increased and now she is usually seen in each episode until the season finale following her real life divorce from Anthony Burch br br br Reception br Hey Ash
