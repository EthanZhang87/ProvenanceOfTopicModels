A mascot is any human animal or object thought to bring luck or anything used to represent a group with a common public identity such as a school sports team society military unit or brand name Mascots are also used as fictional representative spokespeople for consumer products br In sports mascots are also used for merchandising Team mascots are often related to their respective team nicknames This is especially true when the team s nickname is something that is a living animal and or can be made to have humanlike characteristics For more abstract nicknames the team may opt to have an unrelated character serve as the mascot For example the athletic teams of the University of Alabama are nicknamed the Crimson Tide while their mascot is an elephant named Big Al Team mascots may take the form of a logo person live animal inanimate object or a costumed character and often appear at team matches and other related events Since the mid th century costumed characters have provided teams with an opportunity to choose a fantasy creature as their mascot as is the case with the Philadelphia Phillies mascot Phillie Phanatic the Philadelphia Flyers mascot Gritty the Seattle Kraken mascot Buoy and the Washington Commanders mascot Major Tuddy br Costumed mascots are commonplace and are regularly used as goodwill ambassadors in the community for their team company or organization br br br History br It was sports organizations that initially first thought of using animals as a form of mascot to bring entertainment and excitement for their spectators Before mascots were fictional icons or people in suits animals were mostly used in order to bring a somewhat different feel to the game and to strike fear upon the rivalry teams br As time went on mascots evolved from predatory animals to two dimensional fantasy mascots to finally what we know today three dimensional mascots Stylistic changes in American puppetry in the mid th century including the work of Jim Henson and Sid and Marty Krofft soon were adapted to sports mascots It allowed people to not only have visual enjoyment but also interact physically with the mascots br Marketers quickly realized the great potential in three dimensional mascots and took on board the costumed puppet idea This change encouraged other companies to start creating their own mascots resulting in mascots being a necessity amongst not only the sporting industry but for other organisations br br br Etymology br The word mascot originates from the French term mascotte which means lucky charm This was used to describe anything that brought luck to a household The word was first recorded in and popularised by a French composer Edmond Audran who wrote the opera La mascotte performed in December The word entered the English language in with the meaning of a specific living entity associated with a human organization as a symbol or live logo However before this the terms were familiar to the people of France as a slang word used by gamblers The term is a derivative of the word masco meaning sorceress or witch Before the th century the word mascot was associated with inanimate objects that would be commonly seen such as a lock of hair or a figurehead on a sailing ship From then to the twentieth century the term has been used in reference to any good luck animals objects etc and more recently including human caricatures and fictional creatures created as logos for sports teams br br br Choices and identities br br Often the choice of the mascot reflects the desired quality a typical example of this is the fighting spirit in which a competitive nature is personified by warriors or predatory animals br Mascots may also symbolize a local or regional trait such as the Nebraska Cornhuskers mascot Herbie Husker a stylized version of a farmer owing to the agricultural traditions of the area in which the university is located Similarly Pittsburg State University uses Gus the Gorilla as its mascot gorilla being an old colloquial term for coal miners in the Southeast Kansas area in which the university was established br In the United States controversy surrounds some mascot choices especially those using human likenesses Mascots based on Native American tribes are particularly contentious as many argue that they constitute offensive exploitations of an oppressed culture However several Indian tribes have come out in support of keeping the names For example the Utah Utes and the Central Michigan Chippewas are sanctioned by local tribes and the Florida State Seminoles are supported by the Seminole Tribe of Florida in their use of Osceola and Renegade as symbols FSU chooses not to refer to them as mascots because of the offensive connotation This has not however prevented fans from engaging in Redface dressing up in stereotypical Plains Indian outfits during games or creating offensive banners saying Scalp em as was seen at the Rose Bowl br Some sports teams have unofficial mascots individual supporters or fans that have become identified with the team The New York Yankees have such an individual in fan Freddy Sez Former Toronto Blue Jays mascot BJ Birdie was a costumed character created by a Blue Jays fan ultimately hired by the team to perform at their home games USC Trojans mascot is Tommy Trojan who rides on his horse and the official mascot of the school Traveler br br br Sports mascots br br Many sports teams in the United States have official mascots sometimes enacted by costumed humans or even live animals One of the earliest was a taxidermy mount for the Chicago Cubs in and later a live animal used in by the same team They abandoned the concept shortly thereafter and remained without an official cub until when they introduced a version that was a person wearing a costume br In the United Kingdom some teams have young fans become mascots These representatives sometimes have medical issues and the appearance is a wish grant the winner of a contest or under other circumstances Mascots also include older people such as Mr England who are invited by national sports associations to be mascots for the representative teams One of the earliest was Ken Baily whose John Bull inspired appearance was a regular at England matches from to br br br Controversies br On October University of Miami mascot Sebastian the Ibis was tackled by a group of police officers for attempting to put out Chief Osceola s flaming spear prior to Miami s game against long standing rival Florida State at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee Sebastian was wearing a fireman s helmet and yellow raincoat and holding a fire extinguisher When a police officer attempted to grab the fire extinguisher the officer was sprayed in the chest Sebastian was handcuffed by four officers but ultimately released br University of Miami quarterback Gino Torretta told ESPN Even if we weren t bad boys it added to the mystique

Cheetah Keebler Elf the Fruit of the Loom Guys Mickey Mouse Pizza Pizza Guy for Little Caesars Rocky the Elf the Coca Cola Bear and the NBC Peacock These characters are typically known without even having to refer to the company or brand This is an example of corporate branding and soft selling a company Mascots are able to act as brand ambassadors where advertising is not allowed For example many corporate mascots can attend non profit events or sports and promote their brand while entertaining the crowd Some mascots are simply cartoons or virtual mascots others are characters in commercials and others are actually created as costumes and will appear in person in front of the public at tradeshows or events br br br School mascots br br American high schools colleges and even
