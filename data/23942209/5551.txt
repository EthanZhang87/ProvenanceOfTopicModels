global average of Its economy once heavily dependent on agriculture has diversified to include sectors such as finance corporate services for foreign companies pharmaceuticals and ecotourism Many foreign manufacturing and services companies operate in Costa Rica s Free Trade Zones FTZ where they benefit from investment and tax incentives br Costa Rica was inhabited by indigenous peoples before coming under Spanish rule in the th century It remained a peripheral colony of the empire until independence as part of the First Mexican Empire followed by membership in the Federal Republic of Central America from which it formally declared independence in Following the brief Costa Rican Civil War in it permanently abolished its army in becoming one of only a few sovereign nations without a standing army br The country has consistently performed favorably in the Human Development Index HDI placing th in the world as of and fifth in Latin America It has also been cited by the United Nations Development Programme UNDP as having attained much higher human development than other countries at the same income levels with a better record on human development and inequality than the

Freedom Index it is the th most democratic country according to the Freedom in the World index and it is the rd happiest country in the World Happiness Report It is also a major tourist destination in the continent br br br History br br br Pre Columbian period br br Historians have classified the indigenous people of Costa Rica as belonging to the Intermediate Area where the peripheries of the Mesoamerican and Andean native cultures overlapped More recently pre Columbian Costa Rica has also been described as part of the Isthmo Colombian Area br Stone tools the oldest evidence of human occupation in Costa Rica are associated with the arrival of various groups of hunter gatherers about to years BCE in the Turrialba Valley The presence of Clovis culture type spearheads and arrows from South America opens the possibility that in this area two different cultures coexisted br Agriculture became evident in the populations that lived in Costa Rica about years ago They mainly grew tubers and roots For the first and second millennia BCE there were already settled farming communities These were small and scattered although the timing of the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture as the main livelihood in the territory is still unknown br The earliest use of pottery appears around to BCE Shards of pots cylindrical vases platters gourds and other forms of vases decorated with grooves prints and some modeled after animals have been found br The influence of indigenous peoples on modern Costa Rican culture has been relatively small compared to other nations since the country lacked a strong native civilization to begin with Most of the native population was absorbed into the Spanish speaking colonial society through inter marriage except for some small remnants the most significant of which are the Bribri and Boruca tribes who still inhabit the mountains of the Cordillera de Talamanca in the southeastern part of Costa Rica near the frontier with Panama br br br Spanish colonization br The name la costa rica meaning rich coast in the Spanish language was in some accounts first applied by Christopher Columbus who sailed to the eastern shores of Costa Rica during his final voyage in and reported vast quantities of gold jewelry worn by natives The name may also have come from conquistador Gil Gonz lez D vila who landed on the west coast in encountered natives and obtained some of their gold sometimes by violent theft and sometimes as gifts from local leaders br br During most of the colonial period Costa Rica was the southernmost province of the Captaincy General of Guatemala nominally part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain In practice the captaincy general was a largely autonomous entity within the Spanish Empire Costa Rica s distance from the capital of the captaincy in Guatemala its legal prohibition under mercantilist Spanish law from trade with its southern neighbor Panama then part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada i e Colombia and lack of resources such as gold and silver made Costa Rica into a poor isolated and sparsely inhabited region within the Spanish Empire Costa Rica was described as the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America by a Spanish governor in br Another important factor behind Costa Rica s poverty was the lack of a significant indigenous population available for encomienda forced labor which meant most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their land preventing the establishment of large haciendas plantations For all these reasons Costa Rica was by and large unappreciated and overlooked by the Spanish Crown and left to develop on its own The circumstances during this period are believed to have led to many of the idiosyncrasies for which Costa Rica has become known while concomitantly setting the stage for Costa Rica s development as a more egalitarian society than the rest of its neighbors Costa Rica became a rural democracy with no oppressed mestizo or indigenous class It was not long before Spanish settlers turned to the hills where they found rich volcanic soil and a milder climate than that of the lowlands br br br Independence br br Like the rest of Central America Costa Rica never fought for independence from Spain On September after the final Spanish defeat in the Mexican War of Independence the authorities in Guatemala declared the independence of all of Central America That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in Costa Rica even though technically under the Spanish Constitution of that had been readopted in Nicaragua and Costa Rica had become an autonomous province with its capital in Le n br On March the government of the State of Costa Rica officially proposed to the municipality of Nicoya its voluntary incorporation into the country through a document in which it invited it if it was convenient to join its Province without going against its will On July an open town hall was convened in Nicoya to discuss the matter but attendees declined the invitation under the argument that this Party cannot be dissident br On July a second plebiscite was called in the city of Nicoya After deliberation the incorporation into Costa Rica was decided in an open town hall meeting preparing a record in which the main reasons for it were noted pointing out the advantages in terms of trade the desire to participate in the advances that are palpable in Costa Rica the economic administrative and public service benefits the creation of schools security and quiet referring to the state of war that Nicaragua was experiencing at that time and the fear that it would spread to the Partido populations in addition to point out the poverty in which its towns find themselves and the geography of the territory as justifications for the union Three days later another similar plebiscite was held in Santa Cruz with the same result The election was by majority vote with of the Party s population in favor of incorporation and against it The town of Guanacaste was the only one that declined annexation due to the ties its residents had with the city of Rivas Nicaragua br Upon independence Costa Rican authorities faced the issue of officially deciding the future of the country Two bands formed the Imperialists defended by Cartago and Heredia cities which were in favor of joining the Mexican Empire and the Republicans represented by the cities of San Jos and Alajuela who defended full independence Because of the lack of agreement on these two possible outcomes the first civil war of Costa Rica occurred The Battle of Ochomogo took place on the Hill of Ochomogo located in the Central Valley in The conflict was won by the Republicans and as a consequence the city of Cartago lost its status as the capital which moved to San Jos br br In long after the Federal Republic of Central America ceased to function in practice Costa Rica formally withdrew and proclaimed itself sovereign The considerable distance and poor communication routes between Guatemala City and the Central Plateau where most of the Costa Rican population lived then and still lives now meant the local population had little allegiance to the federal government in Guatemala Since colonial times Costa Rica has been reluctant to become economically tied with the rest of Central America Even today despite most of its neighbors efforts to increase regional integration Costa Rica has remained more independent br Until when it became part of Panama Chiriqu was part of Costa Rica Costa Rican pride was assuaged for the loss of this eastern or southern territory with the acquisition of Guanacaste in the north br br br Economic growth in the th century br br Coffee was first planted in Costa Rica in and by the s it surpassed tobacco sugar and cacao as a primary export Coffee production remained Costa Rica s principal source of wealth well into the th century creating a wealthy class of growers the so called Coffee Barons The revenue helped to modernize the country br Most of the coffee exported was grown around the main centers of population in the Central Plateau and then transported by oxcart to the Pacific port of Puntarenas after the main road was built in By the mid s the main market for coffee was Britain It soon became a high priority to developing an effective transportation route from the Central Plateau to the Atlantic Ocean For this purpose in the s the Costa Rican government contracted with U S businessman Minor C Keith to build a railroad from San Jos to the Caribbean port of Lim n Despite enormous difficulties with construction disease and financing the railroad was completed in br Most Afro Costa Ricans descend from Jamaican immigrants who worked in the construction of that railway and now make up about of Costa Rica s population U S convicts Italians and Chinese immigrants also participated in the construction project In exchange for completing the railroad the Costa Rican government granted Keith large tracts of land and a lease on the train route which he used to produce bananas and export them to the United States As a result bananas came to rival coffee as the principal Costa Rican export while foreign owned corporations including the United Fruit Company later began to hold a major role in the national economy and eventually became a symbol of the exploitative export economy The major labor dispute between the peasants and the United Fruit Company The Great Banana Strike was a major event in the country s history and was an important step that would eventually lead to the formation of effective trade unions in Costa Rica as the company was required to sign a collective agreement with its workers in br br br th century br br Historically Costa Rica has generally enjoyed greater peace and more consistent political stability than many of its fellow Latin American nations Since the late th century however Costa Rica has experienced two significant periods of violence In General Federico Tinoco Granados ruled as a military dictator until he was overthrown and forced into exile The unpopularity of Tinoco s regime led after he was overthrown to a considerable decline in the size wealth and political influence of the Costa Rican military In Jos Figueres Ferrer led an armed uprising in the wake of a disputed presidential election between Rafael ngel Calder n Guardia who had been president between and and Otilio Ulate Blanco With more than dead the resulting day Costa Rican Civil War was the bloodiest event in Costa Rica during the th century br The victorious rebels formed a government junta that abolished the military altogether and oversaw the drafting of a new constitution by a democratically elected assembly Having enacted these reforms the junta transferred power to Ulate on November After the coup d tat Figueres became a national hero winning the country s first democratic election under the new constitution in Since then Costa Rica has held additional presidential elections the latest in With uninterrupted democracy dating back to at least the country is the region s most stable br br br Geography br br

br br Despite its size Costa Rica is one of the countries with the greatest biodiversity in all of Latin America br One national park the Corcovado National Park is internationally renowned among ecologists for its biodiversity including big cats and tapirs and is where visitors can expect to see an abundance of wildlife Corcovado is the one park in Costa Rica where all four Costa Rican monkey species can be found These include the white headed capuchin the mantled howler the endangered Geoffroy s spider monkey and the Central American squirrel monkey found only on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and a small part of Panama and considered endangered until when its status was upgraded to vulnerable Deforestation illegal pet trading and hunting are the main reasons for its threatened status La Amistad and Chirrip present the climate of the p ramo at a height of more than meters above sea level providing other types of flora and fauna such as the white nosed coati the sooty thrush

the population lives below the poverty line Costa Rica has one of the highest standards of living in Central America br High quality health care is provided by the government at a low cost to the users Housing is also very affordable Costa Rica is recognized in Latin America for the quality of its educational system a result of which is that the country has one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America General Basic Education is mandatory and provided without cost to the user A US government report confirms that the country has historically placed a high priority on education and the creation of a skilled workforce but notes that the high school drop out rate is increasing As well Costa Rica would benefit from more courses in languages such as English Portuguese Mandarin and French and also in Science Technology Engineering and Math STEM br Costa Rica sources much of its energy from renewables and is undertaking reforestation projects to reduce its overall greenhouse gas emissions In the Costa Rican government announced the commitment for Costa Rica to become the first carbon neutral country by Costa Rica would be according to its leaders the first country in the

pollutants into waterways In May the Costa Rican government announced its intentions to become carbon neutral by By percent of the country s electricity came from renewable sources In the country produced of its electricity from renewable sources and ran completely on renewable sources for continuous days br br In the Forest Law was enacted to provide direct financial incentives to landowners for the provision of environmental services This helped reorient the forestry sector away from commercial timber production and the resulting deforestation and helped create awareness of the services it provides for the economy and society i e carbon fixation hydrological services such as producing fresh drinking water biodiversity protection and provision of scenic beauty br A report by the U S government report identifies other challenges facing Costa Rica as it works to expand its economy by working with companies from the US and probably from other countries The major concerns identified
