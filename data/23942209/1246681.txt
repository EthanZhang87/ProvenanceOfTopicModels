technical subjects such as D modelling programs or physics middleware while Studio Profile and University Profile are single page summaries like Top Trumps but for game dev of particular developers or publishers and game related courses at higher education institutions br Although an overall list of contributors is printed in each issue s indicia the magazine typically has not used bylines to credit individual writers to specific reviews and articles instead only referring to the anonymous Edge as a whole Since some contributed features are credited with a byline The magazine s regular columnists have been consistently credited throughout the magazine s run The current columnists are James Leach Clint Hocking and Tadhg Kelly In addition several columnists appear toward the beginning of the magazine to talk about the game industry as a whole rather than focusing on specific game design topics They are Trigger Happy author Steven Poole Leigh Alexander and Brian Howe whose parody article section You re Playing It Wrong began with the new redesign br Previous columnists have included Paul Rose Mr Biffo the founder of Digitiser Toshihiro Nagoshi of Sega s Amusement Vision author

br Edge scores games on a ten point scale from a minimum of to a maximum of with five as ostensibly the average rating For much of the magazine s run the magazine s review policy stated that the scores broadly correspond to one of the following sentiments br br disastrous br appalling br severely flawed br disappointing br average br competent br distinguished br excellent br astounding br revolutionary br However with issue the scoring system was changed to a simple list of ten nine and so on a tongue in cheek reference to people who read too much into review scores It was almost three years before Edge gave a game a rating of ten out of ten and to date the score has been given to twenty four games br br In contrast only two titles have received a one out of ten rating Kabuki
