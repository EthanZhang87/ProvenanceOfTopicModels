Africa is the world s second largest and second most populous continent after Asia At about million km million square miles including adjacent islands it covers of Earth s land area and of its total surface area With billion people as of it accounts for about of the world s human population Africa s population is the youngest amongst all the continents the median age in was when the worldwide median age was Despite a wide range of natural resources Africa is the least wealthy continent per capita and second least wealthy by total wealth ahead of Oceania Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography climate corruption colonialism the Cold War and neocolonialism Despite this low concentration of wealth recent economic expansion and the large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context Africa has a large quantity of natural resources and food resources including diamonds sugar salt gold iron cobalt uranium copper bauxite silver petroleum natural gas and cocoa beans and tropical fruit br The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos It contains fully recognised sovereign states eight cities and islands that are part of non African states and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition This count does not include Malta and Sicily which are geologically part of the African continent Algeria is Africa s largest country by area and Nigeria is its largest by population African nations cooperate through the establishment of the African Union which is headquartered in Addis Ababa br Africa straddles the equator and the prime meridian It is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to the southern temperate zones The majority of the continent and its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere with a substantial portion and a number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere Most of the continent lies in the tropics except for a large part of Western Sahara Algeria Libya and Egypt the northern tip of Mauritania and the entire territories of Morocco Ceuta Melilla and Tunisia which in turn are located above the tropic of Cancer in the northern temperate zone In the other extreme of the continent southern Namibia southern Botswana great parts of South Africa the entire territories of Lesotho and Eswatini and the southern tips of Mozambique and Madagascar are located below the tropic of Capricorn in the southern temperate zone br Africa is highly biodiverse it is the continent with the largest number of megafauna species as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna However Africa also is heavily affected by a wide range of environmental issues including desertification deforestation water scarcity and pollution These entrenched environmental concerns are expected to worsen as climate change impacts Africa The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified Africa as the continent most vulnerable to climate change br The history of Africa is long complex and varied and has often been under appreciated by the global historical community Africa particularly Eastern Africa is widely accepted to be the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade also known as the great apes The earliest hominids and their ancestors have been dated to around million years ago including Sahelanthropus Australopithecus africanus A afarensis Homo erectus H habilis and H ergaster the earliest Homo sapiens modern human remains found in Ethiopia South Africa and Morocco date to circa and years ago respectively and Homo sapiens is believed to have originated in Africa around years ago Africa is also considered by anthropologists to be the most genetically diverse continent as a result of being the longest inhabited br Civilisations such as Ancient Egypt Kerma Punt and the Tichitt Tradition emerged in North East and West Africa during the th and rd millennia BC while the Bantu expansion from BC until AD was substantial in laying the foundations for societies and states in Central East and Southern Africa A complex historical patchwork of civilisations kingdoms and empires followed with most African societies recording their state apparatus literature and history via oral tradition Within Africa slavery was historically widespread and internal slave markets were used to fuel various exporting slave trades creating various diasporas including in the Americas From the late th century to early th century driven by the Second Industrial Revolution Africa was rapidly conquered and colonised by European nations reaching a point when only Ethiopia and Liberia were independent polities European rule had significant impacts on Africa s societies and the suppression of communal autonomy disrupted traditional local customary practices and caused the irreversible transformation of Africa s socioeconomic systems Most present states in Africa emerged from a process of decolonisation following World War II and established the Organisation of African Unity in the predecessor to the African Union br br br Etymology br br Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of what was then known as northern Africa located west of the Nile river and in its widest sense referring to all lands south of the Mediterranean also known as Ancient Libya This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe an ancestor of modern Berbers see Terence for discussion The name had usually been connected with the Phoenician word afar meaning dust but a hypothesis has asserted that it stems from the Berber word ifri plural ifran meaning cave in reference to cave dwellers The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania a Berber tribe originally from Yafran also known as Ifrane in northwestern Libya as well as the city of Ifrane in Morocco br Under Roman rule Carthage became the capital of the province then named Africa Proconsularis following its defeat of the Carthaginians in the Third Punic War in BC which also included the coastal part of modern Libya The Latin suffix ica can sometimes be used to denote a land e g in Celtica from Celtae as used by Julius Caesar The later Muslim region of Ifriqiya following its conquest of the Byzantine Eastern Roman Empire s Exarchatus Africae also preserved a form of the name br According to the Romans Africa lies to the west of Egypt while Asia was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy CE indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent the idea of Africa expanded with their knowledge br Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name Africa br br The st century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus Ant asserted that it was named for Epher grandson of Abraham according to Gen whose descendants he claimed had invaded Libya br Isidore of Seville in his th century Etymologiae XIV suggests Africa comes from the Latin aprica meaning sunny br Massey in stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian af rui ka meaning to turn toward the opening of the Ka The Ka is the energetic double of every person and the opening of the Ka refers to a womb or birthplace Africa would be for the Egyptians the birthplace br Mich le Fruyt in proposed linking the Latin word with africus south wind which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally rainy wind br Robert R Stieglitz of Rutgers University in proposed The name Africa derived from the Latin Aphir ic a is cognate to Hebrew Ophir rich br Ibn Khallikan and some other historians claim that the name of Africa came from a Himyarite king called Afrikin ibn Kais ibn Saifi Afrikus son of Abraham who subdued Ifriqiya br Arabic afr q feminine noun and ifr qiy now usually pronounced afr qiy feminine Africa from afara ain not alif to be dusty from afar dust powder and afir dried dried up by the sun withered and affara to dry in the sun on hot sand or to sprinkle with dust br Possibly Phoenician faraqa in the sense of colony separation br br br History br br br Prehistory br br Africa is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on Earth with the Human species originating from the continent During the mid th century anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as seven million years ago Before present BP Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern humans such as Australopithecus afarensis radiometrically dated to approximately million years BP Paranthropus boisei c million years BP and Homo ergaster c million years BP have been discovered br After the evolution of Homo sapiens approximately to years BP in Africa the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter gatherers These first modern humans left Africa and populated the rest of the globe during the Out of Africa II migration dated to approximately years BP exiting the continent either across Bab el Mandeb over the Red Sea the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco or the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt br Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern Africa Southeast Africa North Africa and the Sahara br br br Emergence of civilization br br br The size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions At the end of the Ice ages estimated to have been around BCE the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in sub Saharan Africa with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in Tassili n Ajjer dating back perhaps millennia However the warming and drying climate meant that by BC the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile Around BC due to a tilt in the Earth s orbit the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi permanent settlements A major climatic recession occurred lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa Since this time dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and increasingly during the last years in Ethiopia br The domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter gatherer cultures It is speculated that by BC cattle were domesticated in North Africa In the Sahara Nile complex people domesticated many animals including the donkey and a small screw horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia Between and BC pottery was independently invented in the region of Mali in the savannah of West Africa In the steppes and savannahs of the Sahara and Sahel in Northern West Africa people possibly ancestral to modern Nilo Saharan and Mand cultures started to collect wild millet around to BCE Later gourds watermelons castor beans and cotton were also collected Sorghum was first domesticated in Eastern Sudan around BC in one of the earliest instances of agriculture in human history Its cultivation would gradually spread across Africa before spreading to India around BC br People around modern day Mauritania started making pottery and built stone settlements e g Tichitt Oualata Fishing using bone tipped harpoons became a major activity in the numerous streams and lakes formed from the increased rains In West Africa the wet phase ushered in an expanding rainforest and wooded savanna from Senegal to Cameroon Between and BC Niger Congo speakers domesticated the oil palm and raffia palm Black eyed peas and voandzeia African groundnuts were domesticated followed by okra and kola nuts Since most of the plants grew in the forest the Niger Congo speakers invented polished stone axes for clearing forest br Around BC the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification This in turn decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and encouraged migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa During the first millennium BC a reduction in wild grain populations related to changing climate conditions facilitated the expansion of farming communities and the rapid adoption of rice cultivation around the Niger River br By the first millennium BC ironworking had been introduced in Northern Africa Around that time it also became established in parts of sub Saharan Africa either through independent invention there or diffusion from the north and vanished under unknown circumstances around AD having lasted approximately years and by BC metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa Ironworking was fully established by roughly BC in many areas of East and West Africa although other regions did not begin ironworking until the early centuries CE Copper objects from Egypt North Africa Nubia and Ethiopia dating from around BC have been excavated in West Africa suggesting that Trans Saharan trade networks had been established by this date br br br Antiquity BC AD br br br Northeast Africa br br From BC nomes ruled by nomarchs coalesced to form the kingdoms of Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt in northeast Africa Around BC Upper Egypt conquered Lower Egypt to unify Egypt under the st dynasty with the process of consolidation and assimilation completed by the time of the rd dynasty who formed the Old Kingdom of Egypt in BC The Kingdom of Kerma emerged around this time to become the dominant force in Nubia controlling territory as large as Egypt between the st and th cataracts of the Nile The th dynasty oversaw the height of the Old Kingdom and constructed many great pyramids however under the th dynasty power gradually decentralised to the nomarchs culminating in the disintegration of the kingdom exacerbated by drought and famine thus commencing the First Intermediate Period in BC This shattered state would last until BC when the th dynasty based in Thebes conquered the others to form the Middle Kingdom of Egypt with the th dynasty expanding into Lower Nubia at the expense of Kerma In BC the Middle Kingdom fractured in two ushering in the Second Intermediate Period The Hyksos a militaristic people from Palestine invaded and conquered Lower Egypt while Kerma coordinated invasions deep into Egypt to reach its greatest extent In BC the th dynasty eventually expelled the Hyksos and established the New Kingdom of Egypt Using the advanced military technology the Hyksos had brought the New Kingdom conquered the Levant from the Canaanites Mittani Amorites and Hittites and extinguished Kerma incorporating Nubia into the empire and sending the Egyptian empire into its golden age Internal struggles drought famine and invasions by a confederation of seafaring peoples contributed to the New Kingdom s collapse in BC commencing the Third Intermediate Period br Egypt s collapse liberated the more Egyptianised Kingdom of Kush in Nubia who manoeuvred into power in Upper Egypt and conquered Lower Egypt in BC to form the Kushite Empire The Kushites ruled for a century and oversaw a revival in pyramid building until they were forcibly driven out of Egypt by the Assyrians in BC as reprisal for their expansion towards the Assyrian Empire The Assyrians installed a puppet dynasty which later gained independence and once more unified Egypt until they were conquered by the Achaemenid Empire in BC Egypt regained independence under the th dynasty in BC however they were later reconquered by the Achaemenids in BC The conquest of Achaemenid Egypt by Alexander the Great in BC marked the beginning of Hellenistic rule and the installation of the Macedonian Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt The Ptolemaics lost their holdings outside of Africa to the Seleucids in the Syrian Wars however expanded into Cyrenaica and subjugated Kush in the rd century BC In the st century BC Ptolemaic Egypt became entangled in a Roman civil war leading to its conquest by the Romans in BC The Crisis of the Third Century in the Roman Empire freed the Levantine city state of Palmyra which conquered Egypt however their brief rule ended when they were reconquered by the Romans In the midst of this Kush regained total independence from Egypt and they would persist as a major regional power until having been weakened from internal rebellion amid worsening climatic conditions invasions by both Aksum and the Noba caused their disintegration into Makuria Alodia and Nobatia in the th century AD The Romans managed to hold on to Egypt for the rest of the ancient period br br br Horn of Africa br br In the Horn of Africa there was the Land of Punt a kingdom on the Red Sea likely located in modern day Eritrea or northern Somaliland The Ancient Egyptians initially traded via middle men with Punt until in BC when they established direct relations They would become close trading partners for over a millennium Towards the end of the ancient period northern Ethiopia and Eritrea bore the Kingdom of D mt beginning in BC In modern day Somalia and Djibouti there was the Macrobian Kingdom with archaeological discoveries indicating the possibility of other unknown sophisticated civilisations at this time After D mt s fall in the th century BC the Ethiopian Plateau came to be ruled by numerous smaller unknown kingdoms who experienced strong south Arabian influence until the growth and expansion of Aksum in the st century BC Along the Horn s coast there were many ancient Somali city states which thrived off of the wider Red Sea trade and transported their cargo via beden exporting myrrh frankincense spices gum incense and ivory with freedom from Roman interference causing Indians to give the cities a lucrative monopoly on cinnamon from ancient India br The Kingdom of Aksum grew from a principality into a major power on the trade route between Rome and India through conquering its unfortunately unknown neighbours gaining a monopoly on Indian Ocean trade in the region Aksum s rise had them rule over much of the regions from Lake Tana to the valley of the Nile and they further conquered parts of the ailing Kingdom of Kush led campaigns against the Noba and Beja peoples and expanded into South Arabia This led the Persian prophet Mani to consider Aksum as one of the four great powers of the rd century AD alongside Persia Rome and China In the th century AD Aksum s king converted to Christianity and Aksum s population who had followed syncretic mixes of local beliefs slowly followed The end of the th century saw Aksum allied with the Byzantine Empire who viewed themselves as defenders of Christendom balanced against the Sassanid Empire and the Himyarite Kingdom in Arabia br br br Northwest Africa br br The Maghreb and Ifriqiya were mostly cut off from the cradle of civilisation in Egypt by the Libyan desert exacerbated by Egyptian boats being tailored to the Nile and not coping well in the open Mediterranean Sea This caused its societies to develop contiguous to those of Southern Europe until Phoenician settlements came to dominate the most lucrative trading locations in the Gulf of Tunis Phoenician settlements subsequently grew into Ancient Carthage after gaining independence from Phoenicia in the th century BC and they would build an extensive empire and a strict mercantile network all secured by one of the largest and most powerful navies in the ancient Mediterranean Carthage would meet its demise in the Punic Wars against the expansionary Roman Republic however momentum in these wars was not linear with Carthage initially experiencing considerable success in the Second Punic War following Hannibal s infamous crossing of the alps into northern Italy Their defeat and subsequent collapse of their empire would produce two further polities in the Maghreb Numidia which had assisted the Romans in the Second Punic War Mauretania a Mauri tribal kingdom and home of the legendary King Atlas and various tribes such as Garamantes Musulamii and Bavares The Third Punic War would result in Carthage s total defeat in BC and the Romans established the province of Africa with Numidia assuming control of many of Carthage s African ports Towards the end of the nd century BC Mauretania fought alongside Numidia s Jugurtha in the Jugurthine War against the Romans after he had usurped the Numidian throne from a Roman ally Together they inflicted heavy casualties that quaked the Roman Senate with the war only ending inconclusively when Mauretania s Bocchus I sold out Jugurtha to the Romans br At the turn of the millennium they both would face the same fate as Carthage and be conquered by the Romans who established Mauretania and Numidia as provinces of their empire while Musulamii led by Tacfarinas and Garamantes were eventually defeated in war in the st century AD however weren t conquered In the th century AD the Vandals conquered north Africa precipitating the fall of Rome Swathes of indigenous peoples would regain self governance in the Mauro Roman Kingdom and its numerous successor polities in the Maghreb namely the kingdoms of Ouarsenis Aur s and Altava The Vandals ruled Ifriqiya for a century until Byzantine reconquest in the early th century AD The Byzantines and the Berber kingdoms fought minor inconsequential conflicts such as in the case of Garmul however largely coexisted Further inland to the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa were the Sanhaja in modern day Algeria a broad grouping of three groupings of tribal confederations one of which is the Masmuda grouping in modern day Morocco along with the nomadic Zenata their composite tribes would later go onto shape much of North African history br br br West Africa br br In the western Sahel the rise of settled communities occurred largely as a result of the domestication of millet and of sorghum Archaeology points to sizable urban populations in West Africa beginning in the th millennium BC which had crucially developed iron metallurgy by BC in both smelting and forging for tools and weapons Extensive east west belts of deserts grasslands and forests from north to south were crucial for the moulding of their respective societies and meant that prior to the accession of trans Saharan trade routes symbiotic trade relations developed in response to the opportunities afforded by north south diversity in ecosystems Various civilisations prospered in this period From BC the Tichitt culture in modern day Mauritania and Mali was the oldest known complexly organised society in West Africa with a four tiered hierarchical social structure Other civilisations include the Kintampo culture from BC in modern day Ghana the Nok culture from BC in modern day Nigeria the Daima culture around Lake Chad from BC Djenn Djenno from BC in modern day Mali and the Serer civilisation in modern day Senegal which built the Senegambian stone circles from the rd century BC There is also detailed record of Igodomigodo a small kingdom founded presumably in BC which would later go on to form the Benin Empire br Towards the end of the rd century AD a wet period in the Sahel created areas for human habitation and exploitation which had not been habitable for the best part of a millennium with the Kingdom of Wagadu the local name of the Ghana Empire rising out of the Tichitt culture growing wealthy following the introduction of the camel to the western Sahel revolutionising the trans Saharan trade which linked their capital and Aoudaghost with Tahert and Sijilmasa in North Africa Its founding myth holds that its first king came to power after killing Bida a serpent deity in search for water although accounts differ with some stating he did a deal with Bida to sacrifice one maiden a year in exchange for assurance regarding plenty of rainfall and gold supply Wagadu s core traversed modern day southern Mauritania and western Mali and Soninke tradition portrays early Ghana as warlike with horse mounted warriors key to increasing its territory and population although details of their expansion are extremely scarce Wagadu made its profits from maintaining a monopoly on gold heading north and salt heading south despite not controlling the gold fields themselves located in the forest regions It is probable that Wagadu s dominance on trade allowed for the gradual consolidation of many polities into a confederated state whose composites stood in varying relations to the core from fully administered to nominal tribute paying parity Based on large tumuli scattered across West Africa dating to this period it has been stipulated that relative to Wagadu there were further simultaneous and preceding kingdoms which have unfortunately been lost to time br br br Central Eastern and Southern Africa br br In Central Africa the Sao Civilisation flourished for over a millennium beginning in the th century BC The Sao lived by the Chari River south of Lake Chad in territory that later became part of present day Cameroon and Chad Sao artifacts show that they were skilled workers in bronze copper and iron with finds including bronze sculptures terracotta statues of human and animal figures coins funerary urns household utensils jewellery highly decorated pottery and spears Nearby around Lake Ejagham in south west Cameroon the Ekoi Civilisation rose circa nd century AD and are most notable for constructing the Ikom monoliths Further east the northern part of the Swahili coast was home to the elusive Azania most likely a Southern Cushitic polity br The Bantu expansion constituted a major series of migrations of Bantu peoples from central Africa to eastern and southern Africa and was substantial in the settling of the continent Commencing in the nd millennium BC the Bantu began to migrate from Cameroon to central eastern and southern Africa laying the foundations for future states such as the Kingdom of Kongo in the Congo Basin the Empire of Kitara in the African Great Lakes the Luba Empire in the Upemba Depression the Kilwa Sultanate in the Swahili coast by crowding out Azania with Rhapta being its last stronghold by the st century AD and forming various city states constituting the Swahili civilisation These migrations also prefaced the Kingdom of Mapungubwe in the Zambezi basin After reaching the Zambezi the Bantu continued southward with eastern groups continuing to modern day Mozambique and reaching Maputo in the nd century AD Further to the south settlements of Bantu peoples who were iron using agriculturists and herdsmen were well established south of the Limpopo River by the th century AD displacing and absorbing the original Khoisan To their west in the Tsodilo hills of Botswana there were the San a semi nomadic hunter gatherer people who are thought to have descended from the first inhabitants of Southern Africa years BP making them one of the oldest cultures on Earth br br br Ninth to th centuries br br Pre colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as different states and polities characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule These included small family groups of hunter gatherers such as the San people of southern Africa larger more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu speaking peoples of central southern and eastern Africa heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of Africa the large Sahelian kingdoms and autonomous city states and kingdoms such as those of the Akan Edo Yoruba and Igbo people in West Africa and the Swahili coastal trading towns of Southeast Africa br By the ninth century AD a string of dynastic states including the earliest Hausa states stretched across the sub Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan The most powerful of these states were Ghana Gao and the Kanem Bornu Empire Ghana declined in the eleventh century but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century br In the forested regions of the West African coast independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north The Kingdom of Nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes found at the town of Igbo Ukwu The bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century br br The Kingdom of Ife historically the first of these Yoruba city states or kingdoms established government under a priestly oba king or ruler in the Yoruba language called the Ooni of Ife Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West Africa and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture The Ife model of government was adapted at the Oyo Empire where its obas or kings called the Alaafins of Oyo once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non Yoruba city states and kingdoms the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey was one of the non Yoruba domains under Oyo control br The Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers where the locals were Arabized and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture under the unifying framework of Islam br Following the breakup of Mali a local leader named Sonni Ali founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans Saharan trade Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in and Jenne in building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants His successor Askia Mohammad I made Islam the official religion built mosques and brought to Gao Muslim scholars including al Maghili d the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship By the eleventh century some Hausa states such as Kano Jigawa Katsina and Gobir had developed into walled towns engaging in trade servicing caravans and the manufacture of goods Until the fifteenth century these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem Borno to the east br br br Height of the slave trade br br Slavery had long been practiced in Africa Between the th and the th centuries the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated million slaves to the New World In addition more than million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa between the th and th centuries br In West Africa the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities The gradual decline of slave trading prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World increasing anti slavery legislation in Europe and America and the British Royal Navy s increasing presence off the West African coast obliged African states to adopt new economies Between and the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately slave ships and freed Africans who were aboard br Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade for example against the usurping King of Lagos deposed in Anti slavery treaties were signed with over African rulers The largest powers of West Africa the Asante Confederacy the Kingdom of Dahomey and the Oyo Empire adopted different ways of adapting to the shift Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of legitimate commerce in the form of palm oil cocoa timber and gold forming the bedrock of West Africa s modern export trade The Oyo Empire unable to adapt collapsed into civil wars br br br Colonialism br br br Independence struggles br br Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II which left the major European powers weakened In Libya a former Italian colony gained independence In Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France Ghana followed suit the next year March becoming the first of the sub Saharan colonies to be granted independence Over the next decade waves of decolonization took place across the continent culminating in the Year of Africa and the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity in br Portugal s overseas presence in sub Saharan Africa most notably in Angola Cape Verde Mozambique Guinea Bissau and S o Tom and Pr ncipe lasted from the th century to after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in under the white minority government of Ian Smith but was not internationally recognized as an independent state as Zimbabwe until when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence the state remained under the control of the country s white minority initially through qualified voting rights and from by a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until br br br Post colonial Africa br br Today Africa contains sovereign countries Since independence African states have frequently been hampered by instability corruption violence and authoritarianism The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule However few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis per the criteria laid out by L hrmann et al only Botswana and Mauritius have been consistently democratic for the entirety of their post colonial history Most African countries have experienced several coups or periods of military dictatorship Between and though the continent as a whole has trended towards more democratic governance br Upon independence an overwhelming majority of Africans lived in extreme poverty The continent suffered from the lack of infrastructural or industrial development under colonial rule along with political instability With limited financial resources or access to global markets relatively stable countries such as Kenya still experienced only very slow economic development Only a handful of African countries succeeded in obtaining rapid economic growth prior to Exceptions include Libya and Equatorial Guinea both of which possess large oil reserves br Instability throughout the continent after decolonization resulted primarily from marginalization of ethnic groups and corruption In pursuit of personal political gain many leaders deliberately promoted ethnic conflicts some of which had originated during the colonial period such as from the grouping of multiple unrelated ethnic groups into a single colony the splitting of a distinct ethnic group between multiple colonies or existing conflicts being exacerbated by colonial rule for instance the preferential treatment given to ethnic Hutus over Tutsis in Rwanda during German and Belgian rule br Faced with increasingly frequent and severe violence military rule was widely accepted by the population of many countries as means to maintain order and during the s and s a majority of African countries were controlled by military dictatorships Territorial disputes between nations and rebellions by groups seeking independence were also common in independent African states The most devastating of these was the Nigerian Civil War fought between government forces and an Igbo separatist republic which resulted in a famine that killed million people Two civil wars in Sudan the first lasting from to and the second from to collectively killed around million Both were fought primarily on ethnic and religious lines br Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union also contributed to instability Both the Soviet Union and the United States offered considerable incentives to African political and military leaders who aligned themselves with the superpowers foreign policy As an example during the Angolan Civil War the Soviet and Cuban aligned MPLA and the American aligned UNITA received the vast majority of their military and political support from these countries Many African countries became highly dependent on foreign aid The sudden loss of both Soviet and American aid at the end of the Cold War and fall of the USSR resulted in severe economic and political turmoil in the countries most dependent on foreign support br There was a major famine in Ethiopia between and killing up to million people which most historians attribute primarily to the forced relocation of farmworkers and seizure of grain by communist Derg government further exacerbated by the civil war In a genocide in Rwanda resulted in up to deaths added to a severe refugee crisis and fueled the rise of militia groups in neighboring countries This contributed to the outbreak of the first and second Congo Wars which were the most devastating military conflicts in modern Africa with up to million deaths making it by far the deadliest conflict in modern African history and one of the costliest wars in human history br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Various conflicts between various insurgent groups and governments continue Since there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur Sudan which peaked in intensity from to with notable spikes in violence in and killing around people total The Boko Haram Insurgency primarily within Nigeria with considerable fighting in Niger Chad and Cameroon as well has killed around people since Most African conflicts have been reduced to low intensity conflicts as of However the Tigray War from to killed an estimated people primarily due to famine br Overall though violence across Africa has greatly declined in the st century with the end of civil wars in Angola Sierra Leone and Algeria in Liberia in and Sudan and Burundi in The Second Congo War which involved countries and several insurgent groups ended in This decline in violence coincided with many countries abandoning communist style command economies and opening up for market reforms which over the course of the s and s promoted the establishment of permanent peaceful trade between neighboring countries see Capitalist peace br Improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations mainly from China which further spurred economic growth Between and annual GDP growth in sub Saharan Africa averaged doubling its total GDP from billion to trillion constant USD North Africa experienced comparable growth rates A significant part of this growth can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone While several individual countries have maintained high growth rates since overall growth has considerably slowed primarily as a result of falling commodity prices continued lack of industrialization and epidemics of Ebola and COVID br br br Geology geography ecology and environment br br Africa is the largest of the three great

United Nations Environment Programme UNEP According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center of Africa s pasture lands and of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world Some sources claim that approximately of the original virgin

animals including snakes and primates and aquatic life such as crocodiles and amphibians In addition Africa has the largest number of megafauna species as it was least affected by the extinction of

boundary water resources rivers lakes and aquifers Around of sub Saharan Africa falls within international river basin catchments that traverse multiple borders This particular constraint can also be converted into an opportunity if the potential for trans boundary cooperation is harnessed in the development of the area s water resources A multi sectoral analysis of the Zambezi River for example shows that riparian cooperation could lead to a increase in firm energy production without any additional investments A number of institutional and legal frameworks for transboundary cooperation exist such as the Zambezi River Authority the Southern African Development Community SADC Protocol Volta River Authority and the Nile Basin Commission However additional efforts are required to further develop political will as well as the financial capacities and institutional frameworks needed for win win multilateral cooperative actions and optimal solutions for all riparians br br br Politics br br br African Union br br The African Union AU is a continental union consisting of member states The union was formed with Addis Ababa Ethiopia as its headquarters on June The union was officially established on July as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity OAU In July the African Union s Pan African Parliament PAP was relocated to Midrand in South Africa but the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights remained in Addis Ababa br The African Union not to be confused with the AU Commission is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union which aims to transform the African Economic Community a federated commonwealth into a state under established international conventions The African Union has a parliamentary government known as the African Union Government consisting of legislative judicial and executive organs It is led by the African Union President and Head of State who is also the President of the Pan African Parliament A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan African Parliament as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat AU Commission to the PAP The government of the AU consists of all union regional state and municipal authorities as well as hundreds of institutions that together manage the day to day affairs of the institution br Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa often under the oversight of the state Most of such violations occur for political reasons often as a side effect of civil war Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo Sierra Leone Liberia Sudan Zimbabwe and Ivory Coast br br br Boundary conflicts br br br Economy br br Although it has abundant natural resources Africa remains the world s poorest and least developed continent other than Antarctica the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations failed central planning high levels of illiteracy low self esteem lack of access to foreign capital legacies of colonialism the slave trade and the Cold War and frequent tribal and military conflict ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide Its total nominal GDP remains

Bank announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of per day versus the previous measure of Eighty one percent of the sub Saharan African population was living on less than PPP per day in compared with for India br Sub Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty per day some of the population living in poverty in million people a figure that rose to in before dropping to in million people The average poor person in sub Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only cents per day and was poorer in than in indicating increasing poverty in some areas Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors br Africa is now at risk of being in debt once again particularly in sub Saharan African countries The last debt crisis in was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries scheme HIPC The HIPC resulted in some positive and negative effects on the economy in Africa About ten years after the debt crisis in sub Saharan Africa was resolved Zambia fell back into debt A small reason was due to the fall in copper prices in but the bigger reason was that a large amount of the money Zambia borrowed was wasted or pocketed by the elite br From to Africa s rate of economic growth increased averaging in Some countries experienced still higher growth rates notably Angola Sudan and Equatorial Guinea all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity br In a recently published analysis based on World Values Survey data the Austrian political scientist Arno Tausch maintained that several African countries most notably Ghana perform quite well on scales of mass support for democracy and the market economy The following table is projection s as of in terms of the peak level of GDP nominal and Purchasing Power Parity by the IMF and the World Bank br br Tausch s global value comparison based on the World Values Survey derived the following factor analytical scales The non violent and law abiding society Democracy movement Climate of personal non violence Trust in institutions Happiness good health No redistributive religious fundamentalism Accepting the market Feminism Involvement in politics Optimism and engagement No welfare mentality acceptancy of the Calvinist work ethics The spread in the performance of African countries with complete data Tausch concluded is really amazing While one should be especially hopeful about the development of future democracy and the market economy in Ghana the article suggests pessimistic tendencies for Egypt and Algeria and especially for Africa s leading economy South Africa High Human Inequality as measured by the UNDP s Human Development Report s Index of Human Inequality further impairs the development of human security Tausch also maintains that the certain recent optimism corresponding to economic and human rights data emerging from Africa is reflected in the development of a civil society br br The continent is believed to hold of the world s cobalt of its platinum of its gold of its chromium of its tantalite of its manganese and one third of its uranium The Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC has of the world s coltan a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones The DRC also has more than of the world s diamond reserves Guinea is the world s largest exporter of bauxite As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels In fact the food security crisis of which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis pushed million people into food insecurity br In recent years the China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa s largest trading partner In Chinese companies invested a total of US billion in Africa br A Harvard University study led by professor Calestous Juma showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self sufficiency African agriculture is at the crossroads we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa s export of raw materials and importation of food Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity br br br Electricity generation br The main source of electricity is hydropower which contributes significantly to the current installed capacity for energy The Kainji Dam is a typical hydropower resource generating electricity for all the large cities in Nigeria as well as their neighbouring country Niger Hence the continuous investment in the last decade which has increased the amount of power generated br br br Demographics br br Africa s population has rapidly increased over the last years and is consequently relatively young In some African states more than half the population is under years of age The total number of people in Africa increased from million in to million in As of the population of Africa is estimated at billion Africa s total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent African population surpassed Europe in the s while the Americas was overtaken sometime around the year This increase in number of babies born in Africa compared to the rest of the world is expected to

Speakers of Bantu languages part of the Niger Congo family are the majority in southern central and southeast Africa The Bantu speaking peoples from the Sahel progressively expanded over most of sub Saharan Africa But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan San or Bushmen and Pygmy peoples in Southern and Central Africa respectively Bantu speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea and are found in parts of southern Cameroon In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa the distinct people known as the Bushmen also San closely related to but distinct from Hottentots have long been present The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa Pygmies are the pre Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa br The peoples of West Africa primarily speak Niger Congo languages belonging mostly to its non Bantu branches though some Nilo Saharan and Afro Asiatic speaking groups are also found The Niger Congo speaking Yoruba Igbo Fulani Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential In the central Sahara Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant Chadic speaking groups including the Hausa are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara and Nilo Saharan communities such as the Songhai Kanuri and Zarma are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa br br The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups Berbers in the northwest Egyptians in the northeast and Nilo Saharan speaking peoples in the east The Arabs who arrived in the th century CE introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa The Semitic Phoenicians who founded Carthage and Hyksos the Indo Iranian Alans the Indo European Greeks Romans and Vandals settled in North Africa as well Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and Algeria in the st century while to a lesser extent Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya The Berber speaking Tuareg and other often nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa In Mauritania there is a small but near extinct Berber community in the north and Niger Congo speaking peoples in the south though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates In Sudan although Arabic and Arab culture predominate it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo Saharan such as the Nubians Fur Masalit and Zaghawa who over the centuries have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula Small communities of Afro Asiatic speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan br In the Horn of Africa some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups like the Amhara and Tigrayans collectively known as Habesha speak languages from the Semitic branch of the Afro Asiatic language family while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro Asiatic br Prior to the decolonization movements of the post World War II era Europeans were represented in every part of Africa Decolonization during the s and s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers especially from Algeria and Morocco million pieds noirs in North Africa Kenya Congo Rhodesia Mozambique and Angola Between and over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone Nevertheless white Africans remain an important minority in many African states particularly Zimbabwe Namibia R union and South Africa The country with the largest white African population is South Africa Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today br European colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians particularly from the Indian subcontinent to British colonies Large Indian communities are found in South Africa and smaller ones are present in Kenya Tanzania and some other southern and southeast African countries The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in though many have since returned The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin often mixed with Africans and Europeans The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu Arab Indian and European origins Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds people with origins in two or more races and continents During the th century small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa

br Source Maddison and others University of Groningen br br br Religion br br br While Africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs the majority of the people respect African religions or parts of them However in formal surveys or census most people will identify with major religions that came from outside the continent mainly through colonisation There are several reasons for this the main one being the colonial idea that African religious beliefs and practices are not good enough Religious beliefs and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive topic for governments with mixed religious populations According to the World Book Encyclopedia Islam and Christianity are the two largest religions in Africa Islam is most prevalent in Northern Africa and is the state religion of many North African countries such as Algeria where of the population practices Islam The majority of people in most governments in Southern Southeast and Central Africa as well as in a sizable portion of the Horn of Africa and West Africa identify as Christians The Coptic Christians constitute a sizable minority in Egypt and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church is the largest church in Ethiopia with million and million adherents According to Encyclop dia Britannica of the population are Christians are Muslims and follow traditional religions A small

languages UNESCO has estimated around two thousand are spoken in Africa Most are of African origin though some are of European or Asian origin Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages but one or more European ones as well There are four major groups indigenous to Africa br br The Afroasiatic languages are a language family of about languages and million people widespread throughout the Horn of Africa North Africa the Sahel and Southwest Asia br The Nilo Saharan languages consist of a group of several possibly related families spoken by million people between languages Nilo Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in Chad Ethiopia Kenya Nigeria Sudan South Sudan Uganda and northern Tanzania br The Niger Congo language family covers much of sub Saharan Africa In terms of number of languages it is the largest language family in Africa and perhaps one of the largest in the world br The Khoisan languages form a group of three unrelated families and two isolates and number about fifty in total They are mainly spoken in Southern Africa by approximately people Many of the Khoisan languages are endangered The Khoi and San peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa br Following the end of colonialism nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages such as Swahili Yoruba Igbo and Hausa In numerous countries English and French see African French are used for communication in the public sphere such as government commerce education and the media Arabic Portuguese Afrikaans and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa and that are used by millions of Africans today both in the public and private spheres Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in Africa German is spoken in Namibia as it was a former German protectorate In total at least a fifth of Africans speak the former colonial languages br br br Health br br More than of individuals in Africa use traditional medicine as an alternative to often expensive allopathic medical health care and costly pharmaceutical products The Organization of African Unity OAU Heads of State and Government declared the s decade as the African Decade on African traditional medicine in an effort to promote The WHO African Region s adopted resolution for institutionalizing traditional medicine in health care systems across the continent Public policy makers in the region are challenged with consideration of the importance of traditional indigenous health systems and whether their coexistence with the modern medical and health sub sector would improve the equitability and accessibility of health care distribution the health status of populations and the social economic development of nations within sub Saharan Africa br AIDS in post colonial Africa is a prevalent issue Although the continent is home to about percent of the world s population more than two thirds of the total infected worldwide some million people were Africans of whom million have already died Sub Saharan Africa alone accounted for an estimated percent of all people living with HIV and percent of all AIDS deaths in In the countries of sub Saharan Africa most affected AIDS has raised death rates and lowered life expectancy among adults between the ages of and by about twenty years Furthermore the life expectancy in many parts of Africa has declined largely as a result of the HIV AIDS epidemic with life expectancy in some countries reaching as low as thirty four years br br br Culture br br Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post colonial regimes For example African customs were discouraged and African languages were prohibited in mission schools Leopold II of Belgium attempted to civilize Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft br Obidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M Cole The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art Fraser and Cole assert that in Igboland some art objects lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions Author Chika Okeke Agulu states that the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art Editors F Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe On the other hand Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music dance spirituality and other performative cultures to re assert themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies br There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures under such movements as the African Renaissance led by Thabo Mbeki Afrocentrism led by a group of scholars including Molefi Asante as well as the increasing recognition of
