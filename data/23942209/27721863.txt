fully customize the vehicles builds The game supports both local and online multiplayer for up to eight players The game was a critical and commercial success with it going on to be the best selling game on the Nintendo DS with over million copies sold worldwide br br br Gameplay br br Mario Kart carries on traditional Mario Kart gameplay in which players race against each other in go karts across courses new and retro Most are based on various locations in the Mario series but two new courses are set on Wuhu Island location from the Wii Fit and Wii Sports Resort games In addition to traditional button controls Mario Kart can be played using the Nintendo DS gyroscope in which the action is viewed in first person and the player steers the kart simply by tilting the entire game system While most gameplay occurs on the top screen of the DS hardware the bottom screen shows an overhead map of the race course While driving the players may use power up items obtained from running into item boxes located at specific points on the track that are used to hinder the progression of opponents or to help the player in the race Some of these power ups include the series staple items Koopa Shells Banana Peels and Super Mushrooms Three new items were added Fire Flower which allows the player to shoot up to ten fireballs the Super Leaf which gives the player a tail that allows them to flip over nearby players collect nearby Coins and deflect items and the Lucky Seven which bestows seven items at once Coins are also scattered about the tracks collecting them increases the kart s top speed Up to ten coins can be collected in each race but some will be lost if the player comes into contact with hazards or goes out of bounds Jump actions let players obtain a brief burst of speed when hitting a button prior to driving off ramps hang glider attachments sometimes allow for controllable gliding segments as well In the previous installments driving the kart into a body of water has been considered going out of bounds and would penalize the player by delaying them or being picked up by Lakitu In Mario Kart however the karts are fully submersible thus adding fully underwater track segments br The game features sixteen playable Mario characters including Wiggler Honey Queen Lakitu and Metal Mario who are new to the series as well as Mii characters saved in the Nintendo DS Mii Maker bringing the total to seventeen Like in the previous installments characters are divided into three different weight classes which impact their driving styles Mario Kart introduced the ability to customize vehicles prior to races Vehicle bodies tires and hang gliders can be customized with differing control attributes Mario Kart offers different race tracks which consist of new tracks and tracks from prior Mario Kart games br Mario Kart features four single player game modes Grand Prix Time Trial Balloon Battle and Coin Runners Some modes feature multiplayer options In Grand Prix the player races against seven computer controlled opponents in one of eight different cups each featuring four tracks The player receives points based on their finishing position in each race ranging from one to ten After all four races there will be an award ceremony and the player receives a trophy if they place in the top three of the final standings Players will also receive a star rank for their performance ranging from one to three stars In Time Trial the player races alone to finish the course in the fastest time possible using a Triple Mushroom that can be used at any time during the run The best time for each track is saved and recorded as a ghost which the player can compete against in later trials If the player has SpotPass enabled on their Nintendo DS they will be able to download ghosts from other players and can race against up to seven other ghosts simultaneously In the Balloon Battle and Coin Runners battle games the players drive around one of six arenas three for this game and three from the previous installments to collect items and attack their opponents to score points within the time limit of two minutes The player can play online via Nintendo Network until April participating in races or battles with up to seven other players br br br Development br Nintendo EAD began development on Mario Kart in early The idea to have hang gliding and submersible karts came during the development of the previous Mario Kart game Mario Kart Wii and was one of the first gameplay mechanics implemented The ability to customize the player s kart was added in order to make gameplay more strategic and to boost the multiplayer experience The game was first publicly announced at E under the tentative title Mario Kart DS and then shown again at E where it was announced for a late release br Because Nintendogs Cats was scheduled to be released first Mario Kart was given lower priority and only eight staff members were assigned to begin work on it When it was time to focus on the game producer Hideki Konno realized that there was not enough staff available due to many other titles being developed at the same time including The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword which had its production extended into In order to finish the game in time for the Christmas season Nintendo consulted with Retro Studios which had just finished making Donkey Kong Country Returns to co develop the game Retro started work on Mario Kart in December The team focused on producing the classic racing courses remakes of courses from the earlier Mario Kart titles in order to learn both lessons about the development process for Mario Kart games and about what makes a good course from a design perspective br The game s soundtrack was composed by both Kenta Nagata who worked on the previous Mario Kart titles Mario Kart and Mario Kart Double Dash and Star Fox D composer Satomi Terui br Shortly after its release it was discovered that three race tracks Wuhu Island Maka Wuhu and GBA Bowser Castle had contained glitches that allowed players to skip over a significant portion of the track often exploited as a cheat during online play An update to fix it in online play was released in May br br br Reception br br Mario Kart has received generally favorable reviews It holds an rating on Metacritic based on critic reviews and an rating on GameRankings

the same and the gliding mechanics feel underutilized br On the more negative side Jim Sterling of Destructoid gave the game a stating that sticking to tradition has not worked in Nintendo s favor and
