Joystiq was a video gaming blog founded in June as part of the Weblogs Inc family of weblogs now owned by AOL It was AOL s primary video game blog with sister blogs dealing with MMORPG gaming in general and the popular MMORPG World of Warcraft in particular br After declining readership it was announced that Joystiq would be shut down on February as part of moves to downsize AOL s operations by shuttering its underperforming properties br br br History br br br Predecessors br As of early Weblogs Inc was seeking to add a blog to its repertoire for the sole purpose of covering news related to video games as evidenced by the now defunct The Video Games Weblog founded February On March Weblogs Inc CEO Jason Calacanis announced two spinoff projects The Unofficial Playstation Weblog and The Unofficial Xbox both of which are now similarly retired though they would set a precedent for the launching of Joystiq s Fanboy blogs in However none of these three initial weblogs were ever aggressively marketed and The Video Games Weblog made its final post on May amassing blog entries in total a rather scant amount by Weblogs Inc standards All three blogs are now listed as On Hiatus Retired in the Weblogs Inc directory David Touve the primary contributor to these early blogs would later act as Joystiq s features editor for a short time in late before resigning due to the birth of his child br br br Formation br Later that year following s Electronic Entertainment Expo E Peter Rojas the founder of and lead contributor to the company s flagship blog Engadget formally introduced Joystiq to the masses positioning the blog as an extension to Engadget s Gaming subdomain However being a separate and wholly video game related entity Joystiq allowed for much more in depth analysis of the video game industry than the primarily consumer electronics oriented Engadget While Joystiq had featured content as early as April the blog is not officially considered to have been launched until Rojas s public revelation on Engadget on Wednesday June br br br Changes in site format br The first major shakeup in Joystiq s history occurred in June when senior editor Ben Zackheim after being offered a position at America Online s Games division announced his resignation due to a conflict of interest He was succeeded by Vladimir Cole a blogger who had been hired February and who held the position of Editor in Chief until February when Christopher Grant took over after Cole took a job with Microsoft s Xbox division Weblogs Inc was acquired in October by America Online br On November coinciding with the North American launch of the Xbox Joystiq welcomed its first spinoff project Xbox Fanboy a blog devoted solely to the in depth coverage of its namesake hardware For the next three weeks this trend would continue with PSP Fanboy launching on November WoW Insider on December and DS Fanboy on December On February a sixth blog was introduced Revolution Fanboy which was later renamed to Nintendo Wii Fanboy while March heralded the arrival of PS Fanboy completing Joystiq s trifecta of specialized next gen coverage While some have criticized the practice of splintering off Joystiq s primary areas of expertise as nothing more than a thinly veiled bid to increase traffic Jason Calacanis has justified these actions by asserting that as Joystiq grows so too does its potential audience and thus separate blogs are necessary to fulfill these specialized niches br On January Joystiq coined the phrase DS phat a nickname for the old style Nintendo DS that helps differentiate between the old DS and the DS Lite br On November Massively was launched to cover MMOs in general br On January the Fanboy sites were rebranded and integrated directly into the main Joystiq site DS and Wii Fanboy were merged into Joystiq Nintendo as were PSP and PS Fanboy merged into Joystiq PlayStation and Xbox Fanboy became Joystiq Xbox Until these sites continued to feature specialized posts in addition to relevant content from the main Joystiq site br On June as part of the new Futurestiq iteration of the site the three platform specific sites shut down with staff folded into Joystiq full time br In January Ludwig Kietzmann became the editor in chief after Grant left to form a new video game news website with Vox Media owners of The Verge known as Polygon br br br Shutdown br In January co owned blog TechCrunch reported that AOL was planning to shutter underperforming content properties particularly in the technology and lifestyle verticals to focus on its stronger properties video and advertising sales On January Re code reported that Joystiq was among the sites that were likely to be shut down as part of this restructuring plan Readership of Joystiq had seen sharp declines falling by at least over the previous year br On January various Joystiq staff members and eventually the site itself confirmed that the site along with its spin offs Massively and WoW Insider and fellow AOL property TUAW would cease operations after February Gaming oriented coverage was assumed by Engadget After the shutdown on February the staff of Massively launched a successor site Massively Overpowered dedicated to the continuation of their MMO coverage br br br Editors br The Joystiq staff before the closure included editor in chief Ludwig Kietzmann managing editor Susan Arendt feature content director Xav de Matos reviews content director Richard Mitchell news content director Alexander Sliwinski senior reporter Jess Conditt and contributing editors

Justin McElroy The three would discuss various gaming related news stories Segments included What Have you Been Playing Brush With Fame The Big Three The Do It Line and Reader Mail Various podcasts have included guests from other gaming websites such as CheapyD Chris Remo and Stephen Totilo br The first episode of the subsequent Joystiq Show posted on June promised a more serious academic format with a multifaceted examination of Duke Nukem Forever including an interview with voice actor Jon St John and a review roundtable Over time the show s format evolved to include more off the cuff discussion while maintaining the topical nature br The latest iteration of the podcast the Super Joystiq Podcast was announced at Joystiq s PAX East panel and officially released on May This podcast features every editor grouped together in a different configuration every week each participating in an intro news preview or Joystiq Research Institute segment br br br Awards br While Joystiq has been nominated for several awards in the category of technology related weblogs it has consistently been overshadowed in this regard by blogs representing a far wider spectrum of technology including Slashdot Gizmodo and its ubiquitous sibling Engadget Joystiq has however been included in a number of listings of outstanding weblogs including Forbes com s Best of the Web and the Feedster br br br
