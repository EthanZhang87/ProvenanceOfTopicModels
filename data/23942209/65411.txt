its editorial offices are in San Francisco California and its business office at Cond Nast headquarters in Liberty Tower in New York City Wired has been in publication since its launch in January Several spin offs have followed including Wired UK Wired Italia Wired Japan Wired Czech Republic and Slovakia and Wired Germany br From its beginning the strongest influence on the magazine s editorial outlook came from founding editor and publisher Louis Rossetto In Rossetto and founding creative director John Plunkett created a page Manifesto for a New Magazine nearly all of whose ideas were realized in the magazine s first several issues During the five years of Rossetto s editorship Wired s colophon credited Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan as its patron saint Wired went on to chronicle the evolution of digital technology and its impact on society br Wired quickly became recognized as the voice of the emerging digital economy and culture and a pace setter in print design and web design During its explosive growth in the mid s it articulated the values of a far reaching digital revolution driven by the people creating and using digital technology and networks It won the National Magazine Awards for General Excellence in its first year of publication and others subsequently for both editorial and design Adweek acknowledged Wired as its Magazine of the Decade in SF Gate called Wired the magazine that led the digital revolution br From to Wired magazine and Wired News which publishes at Wired com had separate owners However Wired News remained responsible for republishing Wired magazine s content online due to an agreement when Cond Nast purchased the magazine In Cond Nast bought Wired News for million reuniting the magazine with its website br Wired s second editor Katrina Heron published Bill Joy s Why the Future Doesn t Need Us breaking with Wired s optimism to present a dystopian view of the technological future br Wired s third editor Chris Anderson is known for popularizing the term the long tail as a phrase relating to a power law type graph that helps to visualize the s emergent new media business model Anderson s article for Wired on this paradigm related to research on power law distribution models carried out by Clay Shirky specifically in relation to bloggers Anderson widened the definition of the term in capitals to describe a specific point of view relating to what he sees as an overlooked aspect of the traditional market space that has been opened up by new media br The magazine coined the term crowdsourcing as well as its annual tradition of handing out Vaporware Awards which recognize products videogames and other nerdy tidbits pitched promised and hyped but never delivered In these same years the magazine also published the story written by Joshuah Bearman that became the movie Argo In more recent times the publication became known for its deep investigative reporting including a long story about Facebook Inside the Two Years that Shook Facebook and the World that became the publication s most read article of the modern era It was written by Fred Vogelstein and Nicholas Thompson the latter of whom was the publication s editor in chief and had also been the editor on the piece that became Argo br br br History br br The magazine was launched in by American expatriates Louis Rossetto and his life and business partner Jane Metcalfe Wired was originally conceived in Amsterdam the Netherlands when they were working on Electric Word a small groundbreaking technology magazine that developed a global following because of its focus not just on hardware and software but the people companies and ideas that were part of what they called the language industries Whole Earth Review called it The Least Boring Computer Magazine in the World This broader focus on the social economic and political issues surrounding technology became the core of the Wired editorial approach br Initial funding for Wired was provided by Eckart Wintzen a Dutch entrepreneur His Origin software company extended a contract for advertising and bought the first subscribers Rossetto and Metcalfe moved back to the United States to start Wired finding the European Union not a cohesive enough media market to support a continent wide publication br Origin s upfront payment was the seed capital which saw Rossetto and Metcalfe through fruitless months of fundraising They approached established computer and lifestyle publishers as well as venture capitalists and met constant rejection The Wired business concept was a radical departure Computer magazines carried no lifestyle advertising and lifestyle magazines carried no computer advertising And Wired s target audience of Digital Visionaries was unknown br Wired s fundraising breakthrough came when they showed a prototype to Nicholas Negroponte founder and head of the MIT Media Lab at the February TED Conference which Richard Saul Wurman comped them to attend Negroponte agreed to become the first investor in Wired but even before he could write his check software entrepreneur Charlie Jackson deposited the first investor money in the Wired account a few weeks later Negroponte was to become a regular columnist for six years through wrote the book Being Digital and later founded One Laptop per Child br By September Wired had rented loft space in the SoMa district of San Francisco off South Park and hired its first employees As Editor and CEO Rossetto oversaw content and business strategy and Metcalfe as President and COO oversaw advertising circulation finance and company operations Kevin Kelly was executive editor John Plunkett creative director and John Battelle managing editor John Plunkett s wife and partner Barbara Kuhr Plunkett Kuhr later became the launch creative director of Wired s website Hotwired They were to remain with Wired through the first six years of publication br br Rossetto and Metcalfe were aided in starting Wired by Ian Charles Stewart who helped write the original business plan John Plunkett who designed the Manifesto Eugene Mosier who provided production support to create the first prototype and later became Art Director for Production and Randy Stickrod who provided Rossetto and Metcalfe refuge in his office on South Park when they first arrived in San Francisco IDG s George Clark arranged nationwide newsstand distribution Associate publisher Kathleen Lyman joined Wired from News Corporation and Ziff Davis to execute on its ambition to attract both technology and lifestyle advertising and delivered from the first issue She and her prot g Simon Ferguson Wired s first advertising manager landed pioneering campaigns by a diverse group of industry leaders such as Apple Computer Intel Sony Calvin Klein and Absolut Lyman and Ferguson left in year two Cond Nast veteran Dana Lyon then took over ad sales Two years after they left Amsterdam and nearly five years after they first started work on the business plan Metcalfe and Rossetto and their initial band of twelve Wired Ones launched Wired as a quarterly on January and first distributed it by hand at Macworld Expo in San Francisco and later that week at the Consumer Electronics Show CES in Las Vegas Copies arrived on newsstand two weeks later as Bill Clinton took office as President with his Vice President Al Gore touting the Information Superhighway Due to the work of John Battelle s fianc e ex CBS producer Michelle Scileppi feature pieces on Wired s launch appeared on CNN and in The San Jose Mercury News Newsweek and Time magazines br Circulation and advertising response was so strong that Wired went bi monthly with its next issue and monthly by September with the William Gibson cover story about Singapore called Disneyland with the Death Penalty which was banned there In January Advance Publications s Cond Nast made a minority investment in Wired Ventures And in April that year Wired won its first National Magazine Award for General Excellence for its first year of publication During Rossetto s five years as editor it would be nominated for General Excellence every year win the design award in and a second General Excellence in br Wired s founding executive editor Kevin Kelly had been an editor of the Whole Earth Catalog Co Evolution Quarterly and the Whole Earth Review He brought with him contributing writers from those publications Six authors of the first Wired issue had written for Whole Earth Review most notably Bruce Sterling who was on the first cover and Stewart Brand Other contributors to Whole Earth who appeared in Wired included William Gibson who was also featured on Wired s cover in its first year br Wired co founder Rossetto claimed in his launch editorial that the Digital Revolution is whipping through our lives like a Bengali typhoon a bold statement at the time when there were no smart phones web browsers and less than million users connected to the Internet around the world barely half that in the United States Bold also describes John Plunkett s graphic design and its use of fluorescents and metallics Uniquely for magazines Wired was printed on a new state of the art high end six color press normally used for annual reports br The first issue covered interactive games cell phone hacking digital special effects digital libraries an interview with Camille Paglia by Stewart Brand digital surveillance Bruce Sterling s cover story about military simulations and Karl Taro Greenfeld s story on Japanese otaku And while Wired was one of the first magazines to list the email addresses of its authors and contributors the column by Nicholas Negroponte while written in the style of an email message surprisingly contained an obviously fake non standard email address br That was remedied in the second issue Wired first mentioned the World Wide Web in its third issue after CERN put it in the public domain in April Subsequently Wired focused extensively on the networking explosion carrying cover stories on Yahoo s origin story Neal Stephenson s word epic essay on the laying of the fiber optic datalink from London to Japan and Bill Gate s media strategy for Microsoft br On October months after its first issue and following the introduction of the first graphic web browser Mosaic Wired Ventures launched its Hotwired website the first with original content and Fortune advertising Inventing the banner ad Wired brought ATT Volvo MCI Club Med and seven other companies to the web for the first time on websites built by Jonathan Nelson s Organic Online Among the launch crew of was Jonathan Steuer who led the group Justin Hall a pioneer blogger who ran his own successful site on the side Howard Rheingold as executive editor and Apache server co creator Brian Behlendorf who was webmaster br Convinced the Web was the future of media and using Cond Nast s investment Wired bet its future by quickly expanding Hotwired into a suite of websites to include Ask Dr Weil Rough Guides extreme sports even cocktails In it introduced its search engine HotBot in partnership with Berkeley startup Inktomi Hotwired pioneered many of the features and techniques that would go on to define online journalism and online content creation in general The web was so new at the time Wired hired forty engineers to write the code for its edit and ad serving software By the end of Hotwired ranked sixth among all websites for revenue ahead of ESPN CNET and CNN br The New York Times commented Wired is more than a successful magazine Like Rolling Stone in the s it has become the totem of a major cultural movement br With Wired magazine and Hotwired s explosive growth Wired expansion accelerated By it had launched a book publishing division HardWired licensed a Japanese edition with Dohosha Publishing created a British edition Wired UK in a joint venture with the Guardian newspaper and had signed with Gruner and Jahr to do a German edition to be headquartered in Berlin And it began work on Wired TV in partnership with MSNBC as well as three new magazine titles a shelter book called Neo to be edited by Wired Editor At Large Katrina Heron and designed by Rhonda Rubenstein a business magazine called The New Economy and a concept magazine with New York design star Tibor Kalman focusing on the countdown to the new millennium br In reacting to the IPOs of web competitors Yahoo Lycos Excite and Infoseek Wired Ventures announced its own IPO It selected the leading East Cost investment bank Goldman Sachs and the leading West Coast bank Robertson Stephens as co leads with Goldman managing Scheduled to go out in June the IPO was postponed when the market declined days before When it finally went out in October Goldman was unable to close the round following another market downturn and Wired withdrew its IPO br Fingerpointing followed Some observers claimed the market rejected Wired s million internet valuation as too rich for what was a traditional publishing company Wired replied that its valuation was confirmed by savvy private investors who put million into the company in May at just under the original offering stock price They also argued that the offering price was set by the bankers and was merited since it pioneered web media and its revenue at Hotwired was greater than Yahoo when it went public at a higher valuation than Wired s For their part Wired executives blamed Goldman for mismanaging their IPO and then failing the company by not closing the round which already had investors booked The Goldman executive who managed the IPO is quoted as saying Had the market not been so volatile I believe the offering would have been quite successful br Goldman s failure left Wired Ventures cash strapped It turned to its current investor Tudor Investment Corporation Tudor brought on Providence Equity Capital concluding a private funding at the end of December Wired then proceeded to cut costs by focusing on its US magazine and web businesses shutting its UK magazine its book company and its TV operation and terminating work on new magazines By June Wired magazine was profitable The web company now rebranded Wired Digital was growing Wired execs wanted to try to go public again in catching what was to be the second runup in internet stocks which resulted in the dot com bubble In Wired Digital made up percent of the company s revenues and in it pulled in percent The unit was expected to contribute about percent of revenues in br Providence and Tudor had other plans and hired Lazard Freres to shop the company Rossetto and Metcalfe lost control of Wired Ventures in March The Street com commented that a company that started out as one of the more promising bastions of the digital revolution lost control to old fashioned vulture capitalism br Providence Tudor quickly cut a deal to sell the magazine to Miller Publishing for million When Wired Ventures investor Cond Nast heard about the deal through a leak to a Silicon Valley gossip columnist they peremptorily outbid Miller and bought Wired magazine for million dollars The month of the sale Wired s magazine and web businesses became cashflow positive Cond Nast declined to buy Wired Digital Four months later Providence Tudor sold Wired Digital to Lycos br The deal almost didn t close Wired Ventures s founders and early investors threatened lawsuits against Tudor and Providence for breach of fiduciary responsibility claiming they were engaging in unfair distribution of proceeds from the sale amounting to million Ultimately the controlling investors relented and the deal closed in June for million At that point Wired Digital was also cashflow positive Combined proceeds of the two sales exceeded the Wired Ventures valuation at the time of its failed IPO br br Rossetto s penultimate issue was five years after his first in January Appropriately the issue was entitled Change is Good Wired s unofficial slogan In his last issue in February he ushered in a complete redesign of the magazine the first since its start Katrina Heron became Wired s second editor in chief with the
