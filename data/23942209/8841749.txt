The iPhone is a line of smartphones produced by Apple that use Apple s own iOS mobile operating system The first generation iPhone was announced by then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January Since then Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates As of November more than billion iPhones had been sold br The iPhone was the first mobile phone to use multi touch technology Since the iPhone s launch it has gained larger screen sizes video recording waterproofing and many accessibility features Up to the iPhone and Plus iPhones had a single button on the front panel with the iPhone s and later integrating a Touch ID fingerprint sensor Since the iPhone X iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel less front screen design with Face ID facial recognition and app switching activated by gestures Touch ID is still used for the budget iPhone SE series br The iPhone is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android and is a large part of the luxury market The iPhone has generated large profits for Apple making it one of the world s most valuable publicly traded companies The first generation iPhone was described as a revolution for the mobile phone industry and subsequent models have also garnered praise The iPhone has been credited with popularizing the smartphone and slate form factor and with creating a large market for smartphone apps or app economy As of January Apple s App Store contained more than million applications for the iPhone br br br History br br Development of an Apple smartphone began in when Apple started to gather a team of employees led by hardware engineer Tony Fadell software engineer Scott Forstall and design officer Jony Ive to work on the highly confidential Project Purple br Then Apple CEO Steve Jobs steered the original focus away from a tablet which was later revisited in the form of the iPad towards a phone Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular Wireless later renamed AT T Mobility at an estimated development cost of US million over thirty months According to Jobs in the i word in iMac and thereafter iPod iPhone and iPad stands for internet individual instruct inform and inspire br Apple rejected the design by committee approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E a largely unsuccessful iTunes phone made in collaboration with Motorola Among other deficiencies the ROKR E s firmware limited storage to only iTunes songs to avoid competing with Apple s iPod nano Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone s hardware and software in house a rare practice at the time and paid Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue until the iPhone G in exchange for four years of exclusive U S sales until br Jobs unveiled the first generation iPhone to the public on January at the Macworld convention at the Moscone Center in San Francisco The iPhone incorporated a inch multi touch display with few hardware buttons and ran the iPhone OS operating system with a touch friendly interface then marketed as a version of Mac OS X It launched on June at a starting price of US in the United States and required a two year contract with AT T The price was reduced by a third after two months The resulting complaints forced Jobs to issue an apology and offer a partial rebate to early purchasers of the phone br br On July at Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC Apple announced the iPhone G and expanded its launch day availability to twenty two countries and it was eventually released in countries and territories The iPhone G introduced faster G connectivity and a lower starting price of US with a two year AT T contract It proved commercially popular overtaking Motorola RAZR V as the best selling cell phone in the US by the end of Its successor the iPhone GS was announced on June at WWDC and introduced video recording functionality br br The iPhone was announced on June at WWDC and introduced a redesigned body incorporating a stainless steel frame and a rear glass panel At release the iPhone was marketed as the world s thinnest smartphone it uses the Apple A processor being the first iPhone to use an Apple custom designed chip It introduced the Retina display having four times the display resolution of preceding iPhones and was the highest resolution smartphone screen at release a front facing camera was also introduced enabling video calling functionality via FaceTime br Users of the iPhone reported dropped disconnected telephone calls when holding their phones in a certain way and this issue was nicknamed antennagate In January as Apple s exclusivity agreement with AT T was expiring Verizon announced that they would be carrying the iPhone with a model compatible with Verizon s CDMA network releasing on February br The iPhone s was announced on October and introduced the Siri virtual assistant a dual core A processor and an megapixel camera with p video recording functionality The iPhone was announced on September and introduced a larger inch screen up from the inch screen of all previous iPhone models as well as faster G LTE connectivity It also introduced a thinner and lighter body made of aluminum alloy and the pin dock connector of previous iPhones was replaced with the new reversible Lightning connector br br The iPhone s and iPhone c were announced on September The iPhone s included a bit A processor becoming the first ever bit smartphone it also introduced the Touch ID fingerprint authentication sensor The iPhone c was a lower cost device that incorporated hardware from the iPhone into a series of colorful plastic frames br On September Apple introduced the iPhone and iPhone Plus and included significantly larger screens than the iPhone s at inch and inch respectively both models also introduced mobile payment technology via Apple Pay Optical image stabilization was introduced to the Plus camera The Apple Watch was also introduced on the same day and is a smartwatch that operates in conjunction with a connected iPhone Some users experienced bending issues from normal use with the iPhone and Plus particularly on the latter model and this issue was nicknamed bendgate br The iPhone s and s Plus were introduced on September and included a more bend resistant frame made of a stronger aluminum alloy as well as a higher resolution megapixel main camera capable of K video recording The first generation iPhone SE was introduced on March and was a low cost device that incorporated newer hardware from the iPhone s in the frame of the older iPhone s br The iPhone and Plus were announced on September which introduced larger camera sensors IP certified water and dust resistance and a quad core A Fusion processor utilizing big LITTLE technology the mm headphone jack was removed and was followed by the introduction of the AirPods wireless earbuds Optical image stabilization was added to the s camera A second telephoto camera lens was added on the Plus enabling two times optical zoom and Portrait photography mode which simulates bokeh in photos br The iPhone Plus and iPhone X were announced on September in Apple s first event held at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park All models featured rear glass panel designs akin to the iPhone wireless charging and a hexa core A Bionic chip with Neural Engine AI accelerator hardware The iPhone X additionally introduced a inch OLED Super Retina display with a bezel less design with a higher pixel density and contrast ratio than previous iPhones with LCD displays and introduced a stronger frame made of stainless steel It also introduced Face ID facial recognition authentication hardware in a notch screen cutout in place of Touch ID the home button was removed to achieve the bezel less design replacing it with a gesture based navigation system At its US starting price the iPhone X was the most expensive iPhone at launch br br The iPhone XR iPhone XS and XS Max were announced on September All models featured the Smart HDR computational photography system and a significantly more powerful Neural Engine The XS Max introduced a larger inch screen The iPhone XR included a inch LCD Liquid Retina display with a bezel less design similar to the iPhone X but does not include a second telephoto lens it was made available in a series of vibrant colors akin to the iPhone c and was a lower cost device compared to the iPhone X and XS br The iPhone Pro and Pro Max were announced on September The iPhone was the successor to the iPhone XR while the iPhone Pro and Pro Max succeeded the iPhone XS and XS Max All models gained an ultra wide lens enabling two times optical zoom out as well as larger batteries for longer battery life The second generation iPhone SE was introduced on April and was a low cost device that incorporated newer hardware from the iPhone in the frame of the older iPhone while retaining the home button and the Touch ID sensor br The iPhone Mini Pro and Pro Max were announced via a livestream event on October All models featured OLED Super Retina XDR displays introduced faster G connectivity and the MagSafe magnetic charging and accessory system a slimmer flat edged design was also introduced which combined with stronger glass ceramic front glass added better drop protection compared to previous iPhones The iPhone Mini introduced a smaller inch screen while the Pro and Pro Max had larger screens of inch and inch respectively The iPhone Pro and Pro Max additionally added a Lidar sensor for better accuracy in augumented reality AR applications br The iPhone Mini Pro and Pro Max were announced via a livestream event on September All models featured larger camera sensors larger batteries for longer battery life and a narrower notch screen cutout The iPhone Pro and Pro Max additionally introduced smoother adaptive Hz refresh rate ProMotion technology in its OLED display and three times optical zoom in the telephoto lens The low cost third generation iPhone SE was introduced on March and incorporated the A Bionic chip from the iPhone but otherwise retained similar hardware to the second generation iPhone SE br The iPhone Plus Pro and Pro Max were announced on September All models introduced satellite phone emergency calling functionality The iPhone Plus introduced the large inch screen size first seen on the iPhone Pro Max into a lower cost device The iPhone Pro and Pro Max additionally introduced a higher resolution megapixel main camera the first increase in megapixel count since the iPhone s it also introduced always on display technology to the lock screen and an interactive status bar interface integrated in a redesigned screen cutout entitled Dynamic Island br The iPhone Plus Pro and Pro Max were announced on September Starting with this group of devices all models switch to using USB C as their power connector to comply with European Commission regulations replacing Apple s proprietary Lightning connector after eleven years of use in previous models All models feature the Dynamic Island which debuted with the iPhone Pro effectively retiring the notch display cutout slightly curved edges and a frosted glass back The iPhone Pro and Pro Max also replace the mute switch and stainless steel edges with the Action button and titanium respectively br br br Models br br iPhone models have been produced The models in bold are devices of the latest generation br br br Production br Up to the iPhone all iPhones and other devices such as iPod Touch models and iPads were manufactured by Foxconn based in Taiwan In new CEO Tim Cook changed Apple s manufacturing strategy to diversify its supply base The iPhone s in was the first model to be manufactured simultaneously by two stand alone companies Foxconn and Pegatron the latter also based in Taiwan Although Foxconn still produces more iPhones Pegatron s orders have been slowly increased the company made part of the iPhone c line in and of iPhone devices in The Plus model was produced solely by Foxconn In Apple investigated reports that some Foxconn managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones In India Apple pays Wistron a Taiwan based manufacturer with a plant near Bangalore to assemble iPhones to sell in the region br In Apple announced that a portion of the iPhone would be manufactured in Tamil Nadu India as a response to China s zero COVID policy that has negatively affected global supply chains for many industries Apple has stated that they plan to shift of iPhone production to India by br br br Hardware br br Apple directly sub contracts hardware production to external OEM companies maintaining a high degree of control over the end product The iPhone contains most of the hardware parts of a typical modern smartphone Some hardware elements such as D Touch and the Taptic Engine are unique to the iPhone The main hardware of the iPhone is the touchscreen with current models offering screens of inches and larger All iPhones include a rear facing camera the front facing camera dates back to the iPhone The iPhone Plus introduced multiple lenses to the rear facing camera A range of sensors are also included on the device such as a proximity sensor ambient light sensor accelerometer gyroscopic sensor magnetometer facial recognition sensor or fingerprint sensor depending on the model and barometer In Apple added satellite communications to the iPhone with the release of the iPhone and iPhone Pro br br br Software br br br Operating system br br The iPhone runs iOS It is based on macOS s Darwin and many of its userland APIs with Cocoa replaced by Cocoa Touch and AppKit replaced by UIKit The graphics stack runs on Metal Apple s low level graphics API The iPhone comes with a set of bundled applications developed by Apple and supports downloading third party applications through the App Store br Apple provides free updates to iOS over the air or through Finder and iTunes on a computer Major iOS releases have historically accompanied new iPhone models br br br App Store and third party apps br br At WWDC on June Apple announced that the iPhone would support third party Ajax web applications that share the look and feel of the iPhone interface On October Steve Jobs in an open letter posted to Apple s Hot News weblog announced that a software development kit SDK would be made available to third party developers in February The iPhone SDK was officially announced and released on March The App Store was launched with the release of iPhone OS on July br Apple requires all third party apps to be downloaded from the App Store with exceptions for ad hoc apps used within enterprises Developers must pay a yearly fee as part of Apple s Developer Program if their membership expires their apps are removed from the App Store though existing users retain the ability to redownload the app Developers can release free apps or paid apps for which Apple takes a cut of proceeds Developers earning less than million in annual sales qualify for the App Store Small Business Program with Apple only taking a fee br Though iOS has far lower market share than Android its app ecosystem has been described as superior with higher quality apps and more iOS exclusive releases Android s version fragmentation less uniform hardware and lower app revenues have been cited as key factors br All apps must pass Apple s app review process before being distributed in the App Store Apple may also stop distributing apps it deems inappropriate For example in Apple rejected the Newspapers app due to The Sun s obscene topless Page girls In Apple removed Tumblr from the App Store citing illegal content causing Tumblr to ban all adult content from their platform The App Store s review process has been criticized by developers as frustrating anti competitive and asinine br Users can also install native apps outside of the App Store through jailbreaking or through exploits such as TrollStore Jailbreaking may cause security issues and is not supported by Apple br As of October Apple has passed billion app downloads As of September there have been over billion app downloads from the App Store As of January the App Store has over million apps for the iPhone br br br Jailbreaking br br Apple restricts the installation of unapproved third party apps and does not allow full access to the iPhone s filesystem According to Jonathan Zittrain the emergence of closed devices like the iPhone has made computing more proprietary than it was in the PC era Jailbreaking allows users to install apps not available on the App Store customize their device in ways not allowed by Apple and bypass SIM locks without carrier approval Some jailbreak tweaks were later copied by Apple and implemented into iOS like multitasking widgets and copy and paste br Apple attempted to use the DMCA to fight jailbreaking however in the U S found jailbreaking to be legal Jailbroken iPhones are at higher risk of malware due to Apple s lesser control of the app ecosystem In the United States Apple cannot void an iPhone s warranty solely due to jailbreaking Jailbreaks rely on exploits Apple has improved the iPhone s hardware and software security making these exploits harder to find as a result recent iPhones cannot currently be jailbroken br br br Accessibility br The iPhone contains a range of accessibility features to support users visual auditory and motor needs iPhones can notify users through onscreen banners audio alerts vibrations or the LED flash vibration patterns can be customized by users Since iOS Siri can read notifications out loud through earphones and since iOS through the device s speakers br Users with motor needs can use Assistive Touch to customize the way they navigate through menus it can assist users who have difficulties with some gestures like pinching and makes these gestures available by tapping on a menu The user can create their own gestures and customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu If the user has trouble pressing the Home button it can be set so that it can be activated with an onscreen tap Gestures like rotate and shake are available even when if the iOS device is mounted on a wheelchair Head Tracking can be used to control an iPhone using facial movements recognized by the front camera br Low vision users can enable VoiceOver a screen reader which describes what is on the screen while Siri allows for hands free interaction The iPhone also supports wireless braille displays to help users read its interface Text can be enlarged system wide The Magnifier app uses the iPhone s Lidar scanner to identify objects for example doors people and objects and can describe them to the user as well as their distance Door Detection can alert the user through sound speech and haptics br Hearing aids that are part of the Made for iPhone program can be controlled from an iPhone These hearing aids also feature Live Listen which enables the iPhone to act as a directional microphone beaming its audio to compatible hearing aids Live Listen can help the user hear a conversation in a noisy room or hear someone speaking across the room Apple built Live Listen support into all AirPods which can also relay audio from a connected iPhone s microphone Closed captioning and external TTY devices are supported while Live Caption can transcribe audio across all apps and display it onscreen Sound Recognition can recognize surrounding noises including door bells kettles water running and babies crying and notify the user with an onscreen alert br Guided Access helps people with autism ADHD or sensory challenges stay focused on a single app With Guided Access a parent teacher or therapist can limit an iOS device to stay on one app by disabling the Home button and limit the amount of time spent in an app The user can restrict access to the keyboard or touch input on certain areas of the screen br br br Marketing br The original iPhone was heavily promoted before its official announcement creating buzz and anticipation Upon its release it was marketed heavily in television web and print ads created in partnership with TBWA Chiat Day br Apple s premium market positioning has led the iPhone to be seen as a status symbol br The Apple ecosystem has been described as a key moat that increases iPhone brand loyalty iMessage has especially been singled out with its green bubbles phenomena In iMessage SMS messages from Android users appear as green bubble rather than the blue bubbles used for texts from other iPhone users Group chats between iOS and Android are poorly supported reactions display as text rather than bubbles and images are sent through MMS which degrades image quality Some teens have described being ostracized after switching to Android which Google has labelled bullying This has been described by critics as a key factor leading of U S teenagers to use iPhones br br br Retail br br br SIM unlocking br Many iPhones bought through a monthly carrier contract are SIM locked restricting their use to one particular carrier While the iPhone was initially sold in the U S only on the AT T network with a SIM lock in place various hackers found methods to bypass that SIM lock More than a quarter of first generation iPhones sold in the U S were not registered with AT T Apple speculated that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked a lucrative market before the iPhone G s worldwide release Today many carriers either remove the SIM lock automatically after a certain period or do it upon request either for free or for a small fee iPhones bought from Apple are not SIM locked Many carriers also sell the iPhone unlocked when purchased outright rather than on a long term contract br br br Retail strategy br Since iPhone buyers can obtain a trade in discount when buying a new iPhone directly from Apple The program aims to increase the number of customers who purchase iPhones at Apple Stores rather than carrier stores In Apple unveiled the iPhone Upgrade Program a month leasing agreement which Fortune described as a change in iPhone owners relationships with mobile carriers br br br Repairability br br Only Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers are allowed by Apple to perform genuine replacements Apple has taken steps to make third party repairs more difficult iPhone components are soldered and many are glued together iPhones receive low repairability scores in part due to the difficulty of obtaining genuine parts and the difficulty undertaking each repair This has given rise to the right to repair movement aimed at giving users cheaper options for repairing their phones Apple has lobbied against right to repair legistation Multiple jurisdictions aim to introduce right to repair laws including the EU U K and U S br In the past Apple bricked iPhone models after their home buttons were replaced displaying an Error message Apple called this a bug and released an update to address the issue On iPhones with a Touch ID sensor the home button cannot be replaced by users or independent repair shops without losing Touch ID functionality since Apple has not made their calibration tool public br In more recent models starting with the iPhone XR Apple displays warnings in the Settings app if the battery display or camera are replaced by a third party Additionally some features are disabled when a part labelled non genuine is detected like True Tone or the battery health measurement iFixit notes that a proprietary cloud linked System Configuration tool is required to complete a part repair meaning that even replacing a genuine part with another genuine part will fail Apple s genuine parts check unless said tool is used br In Apple rolled out a self service repair program allowing any user to buy parts rent repair tools from Apple and obtain repair manuals The program received a degree of praise by iFixit and repair advocates who also critically noted that Apple maintains control over the parts supply br br br Privacy br br br Tracking prevention br Apple introduced App Tracking Transparency ATT with iOS in April ATT requires apps to ask for explicit permission before being allowed to track the user across other apps and websites If the user refuses the app cannot access Apple s Identifier for Advertisers IDFA an identifier used to serve personalized ads ATT does not prevent personalized ads that are based on the user s behavior within the app itself The feature has been criticised by some as anti competitive including Facebook whose shares fell by after its rollout Apple exempts their own apps from their anti tracking measures which has led to anti trust investigations by the French and German governments br br br Location tracking controversy br In July Apple claimed that it collected iPhone users GPS coordinates and nearby Wi Fi networks twice a day a Wall Street Journal investigation found that Google s Android sent this data several times an hour br In September forensic expert Christopher Vance discovered a hidden unencrypted file named consolidated db that contained a record of iPhone users locations The file was added with the June iOS update though previous versions of iOS stored similar information in a file called h cells plist On April The Guardian publicized research by Alasdair Allan and Pete Warden who found that anyone with physical access to an iPhone could obtain a detailed record of its owner s location and movements over the past year Moreover the file was automatically backed up by iTunes onto any computer the iPhone was synchronized with A Wall Street Journal investigation found that users locations were still stored when location services are disabled The controversy led to U S congressional scrutiny and an FCC investigation and was dubbed Locationgate by the media br Apple responded on April claiming that the data was used to cache nearby Wi Fi hotspots and cell towers in order to improve location speed and accuracy The company also claimed that locations being collected when location services were off and being stored for more than a year were both bugs Apple issued an update for iOS version or for the CDMA iPhone which reduced the size of the cache encrypted it stopped it being backed up to iTunes and erased it entirely whenever location services were turned off Nevertheless in July a report on state owned China Central Television called iPhone tracking a national security concern br Currently iPhones contain a Frequent Locations database which records where users have been along with exact times they arrived and left raising concerns that the data could be used in court This feature can be turned off br br br Child safety controversy br In August Apple announced plans to scan iCloud Photos for child abuse imagery through an algorithm called NeuralHash and filter explicit images sent and received by children using iPhones dubbed Conversation Safety to be rolled out later that year More than policy and human rights groups wrote an open letter to condemn both features Apple s plan to implement NeuralHash on device rather than in the cloud led the EFF and security experts to call it a backdoor that could later be expanded to detect other types of contents and would decrease users privacy Apple claimed the system was misunderstood but announced in December that the photo scanning feature would never be implemented The other feature Conversation Safety was added in iOS br br br Security br Apple iOS is regarded by some security experts as more secure against common malware than Android Less than of mobile malware targets iOS br br br Encryption br Prior to the iPhone stored all messages pictures and videos contacts audio recordings and call history in unencrypted form enabling easy access by law enforcement This changed with iOS which adopted file based encryption Apple does not hold the decryption key and cannot be compelled to turn over user data even when presented with a government warrant Companies like Grayshift and Cellebrite developed exploits that enable law enforcement to extract user data from iPhones without needing the user s passcode br In and a dispute unfolded between Apple and the FBI The FBI had recovered the iPhone c of one of the San Bernardino attackers and iCloud backups of that phone from a month and a half before the shooting The U S government attempted to obtain a court order under the All Writs Act compelling Apple to produce a modified version of iOS that would allow investigators to brute force the device passcode Tim Cook responded on the company s website outlining a need for encryption arguing that a backdoor would compromise the privacy of all iPhone users The DOJ withdrew its request after the FBI bought an exploit to bypass the iPhone s passcode As a countermeasure Apple implemented USB Restricted Mode which was subsequently exploited too br br br Pegasus malware br In researchers discovered the Pegasus suite of exploits targeting iOS and Android which led to significant international media coverage Some Pegasus exploits are zero click meaning that they can fully compromise the device with no user interaction for example by sending a malformed iMessage to the user that would not even trigger a notification Pegasus can collect most data including chats passwords and photos and can turn on the phone s microphone and camera remotely Apple quickly issued an update fixing FORCEDENTRY and other known Pegasus exploits though Pegasus continued to be used relying on new exploits Apple also sued NSO the organization behind Pegasus announced a new security bounty and added an optional Lockdown Mode to iOS that reduces the iPhone s attack surface br Prominent victims of Pegasus include Jamal Khashoggi and numerous activists businessmen and politicians Pegasus has been widely used since and is still used by law enforcement and governments as of July br br br Reception and legacy br The original iPhone has been described as revolutionary a breakthrough handheld computer and the best phone that anybody has ever made It is now Apple s bestselling product has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world s most valuable publicly traded companies by Newer iterations have also received praise and awards br Before the iPhone smartphones were mostly used for texting calls and email more advanced functions were harder to use and inconvenient on a small screen They were also hard to develop for and lacked a thriving app ecosystem like the App Store released in Many phones were heavily customized by mobile carriers which led to feature fragmentation and prevented these phones from turning into thriving software platforms In contrast Apple s iPhone SDK provided a wide range of APIs made mobile development far more accessible and was instrumental in turning the iPhone into a Swiss army knife with a wide range of features and apps br Successive iPhone models have generated significant fan enthusiasm with many customers queuing up in front of Apple Stores on launch day As of the iPhone has higher brand loyalty than any other smartphone br The iPhone s success has led to the decline of incumbents Nokia BlackBerry and Motorola RIM Symbian and Microsoft all attempted to develop more modern operating systems to compete with the iPhone like Maemo Windows Phone and BlackBerry all were unsuccessful Google successfully started over on their Android project and designed it for mass adoption by carriers and phone hardware manufacturers Today iOS and Android account for of smartphones used worldwide br br br Sales br br Steve Jobs s initial target was to reach of phone market share in Apple sold million units of the original iPhone between Q FY and Q FY and million units of the iPhone G in Q FY and Q FY In the iPhone reached of worldwide mobile phone market share and of the smartphone market During this time it was quickly becoming relevant in North America and in market share was ranked second in the U S in behind the BlackBerry in the iPhone GS was the best selling smartphone in the U S the first time that an iPhone device reached top spot in that market br iPhone sales grew continuously year over year since its introduction until Q FY The iPhone briefly surpassed BlackBerry in Q FY and permanently overtook it starting in Q FY By Apple sold million iPhones worldwide and became the largest mobile phone vendor in the world by revenue surpassing long time leader Nokia Q FY marked Apple s best quarterly earnings in its history with of the company s revenues coming from iPhone sales Phone sales are strongly seasonal peaking in the holiday season Apple s Q With the release of the iPhone in Q FY Apple temporarily topped Samsung with million units shipped compared to Samsung s million In most quarters Apple is the second largest smartphone vendor by units Apple sold million iPhones in its financial year ending September br Today Samsung and Apple dominate the smartphone market with and worldwide market share respectively Due to Apple s small lineup Apple often dominates the list of bestselling smartphone models Despite its lower market share the iPhone s premium positioning has led it to capture nearly half of global smartphone revenue and of global smartphone profits with Samsung taking the other Carriers compete with each other to subsidize iPhone upgrades which is seen as a significant factor in iPhone sales though this has reduced carrier profits On July Apple announced that it had sold their billionth iPhone br Compared to other high tech products a greater proportion of iPhone users are female The iPhone has been adopted by both consumers and business users iPhone users are wealthier and spend more time on their phones than Android users on average The iPhone is especially popular in the U S where it has a market share and is used by of teenagers Worldwide the iPhone accounts for of the high end smartphone market br Android overtook the iPhone s installed base in according to NPD Group During Apple s earnings call on January Tim Cook said that billion iPhones were being actively used worldwide br br br Emerging markets br While other manufacturers make separate entry level phones Apple s entry level phones are the previous years models part of an effort to increase its market share in emerging markets without diluting its premium brand It also considers emerging market tastes in its product designs for example it introduced a gold iPhone after finding that gold was seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers In Apple started manufacturing previous years iPhone models in India in it began manufacturing the current iPhone there too Analysts have speculated that this was partly caused by Apple s desire to reduce its dependence on China and to overcome Indian import duties In the Chinese government banned the use of iPhones by government civil servants in what was seen as an effort to reduce dependence on foreign technology and strengthen
