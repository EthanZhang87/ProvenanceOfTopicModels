control and split second timing and was compared to regarding both gameplay and level of difficulty traditional platform games such as Super Mario Bros and Ghosts n Goblins br Levels in each chapter can be played in any order but a certain number of levels need to be completed to access the boss stage which unlocks the next chapter if cleared The player has an unlimited number of attempts to complete each level If Meat Boy is killed he immediately restarts the level though the ornamental red meat juice left behind on surfaces that the player has touched remains A replay function which may be accessed after a level is completed simultaneously shows all the player s attempts to complete the level Completing a level within a certain time earns an A grade which unlocks a harder alternate version of the level in the dark world an optional set of especially difficult levels Hidden stages called warp zones are accessed by finding portals in specific levels These warp zones feature bonus levels that have either the art style of older video games and a limit of three lives or are patterned after another indie video game such as Castle Crashers or Braid The player may control characters other than Meat Boy many of whom first appeared in other independent video games Each character has different attributes such as Commander Video s ability to momentarily float in midair These characters can be unlocked by collecting bandage items placed throughout the game s levels or completing certain warp zones Some bandages can only be collected by using certain characters Some levels such as warp zones and boss levels can only be played with specific characters The available characters vary depending on the version of the game played br The Xbox Live Arcade XBLA version features an unlockable mode called Teh Internets which is updated with new free officially curated levels The PC version has a Super Meat World section which allows users to play and rate additional levels that players have created with a level editor This editor was released in May Players can also access an unsupported developer mode inside the game to edit their own levels using the rough tools that Team Meat used to create the game br br br Plot br Meat Boy lives with his girlfriend Bandage Girl One day Bandage Girl is kidnapped by Dr Fetus an intelligent fetus in a life support suit Meat Boy then goes after Fetus until Fetus burns down the forest and tries to kill Meat Boy in his Lil Slugger which is destroyed after Meat Boy tricks him into running into a bunch of saws Fetus escapes to an abandoned hospital where he unleashes C H A D a giant monster made of blood Meat Boy shows the sun to the monster and redeems him but then continues after Fetus who goes to his salt factory There a

tries to kill Meat Boy and Bandage Girl by blowing up his facility but Brownie appears and saves the two while sacrificing himself As Bandage Girl hugs Meat Boy after escaping Fetus suddenly lands on Bandage Girl and tries to pummel her as the game cuts to credits If Dr Fetus is beaten in the Dark World It is shown in the true ending that Fetus s attacks were ineffective and Bandage Girl proceeds to stomp on him br br br Development and marketing br The original Meat Boy is an Adobe Flash game created by Edmund McMillen and programmed by Jonathan McEntee The game was developed over a three week period and was released on Newgrounds on October By April it had garnered over views at Newgrounds and million overall A map pack for the Flash version was released on December McMillen began development of Super Meat Boy after Nintendo and Microsoft requested that he make a game for their download services WiiWare and Xbox Live Arcade as they were impressed by the success of his Flash games Aether and Meat Boy At the time he was working with Tommy Refenes on a Flash game titled Grey Matter Although McMillen initially pitched the companies a sequel to Gish or Aether the pair decided to form Team Meat and work on an expanded version of Meat Boy instead Team Meat also includes soundtrack composer Danny Baranowsky and sound effects designer Jordan Fehr According to the developers Super Meat Boy is a big throwback to a lot of super hardcore NES classics like Ghosts n Goblins Mega Man and the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros with the plot written as a mash up of every videogame story from the early s The game was explicitly designed by the team to be reminiscent of Super Mario Bros and McMillen considered it a tribute to Shigeru Miyamoto the developer of Super Mario Bros br br McMillen worked on level design and artwork while Refenes coded the game it was tested primarily by the pair and their families McMillen and Refenes lived on opposite sides of the United States and met only a few times in person while working on the game They developed the control scheme by iterating through several designs trying to find one that felt fluid and logical Rather than use a pre built game engine Refenes programmed an original one The game was initially set to include around levels and to have co operative and competitive multiplayer modes During development however the multiplayer option was dropped and the number of levels was greatly increased The pair designed the game to be deliberately retro imitating the aesthetics of traditional platform games but with a modern sensibility regarding difficulty They wanted the game to be rewarding and challenging rather than frustrating to this end they included infinite lives quick restarts of levels obvious goals and short levels They felt the replay feature transformed death into a form of reward br Development of Super Meat Boy began in January Initially announced for WiiWare and PC the game was set to be released in the first quarter of The release date was pushed back to the fourth quarter because the developers wanted more time to create extra levels such as the dark worlds A picture released on Team Meat s Twitter page on February revealed that the game would also be released for XBLA The next day they announced that while all versions would be released in the same month the game would be released for XBLA first due to contractual obligations In August the developers were contacted by Microsoft with the prospect of inclusion in Microsoft s Fall GameFeast XBLA promotion two months later As they were almost out of money they did not believe that they could financially support themselves until the Spring event but felt they had four months worth of work left to complete on the game For the final two months of development they worked daily slept five hours a night and frequently forgot to eat a process that McMillen said he would never voluntarily go through again According to McMillen due to Microsoft s low expectations for the game Super Meat Boy was lightly promoted The level of promotion was not increased during the GameFeast though the game greatly outsold the rest of the games in the event The team described the effort required to finish the game for the promotion as by far the biggest mistake they made during SMB s development Their development struggle is depicted in the documentary Indie Game The Movie The game was released on XBLA in October and on PCs via Steam and Direct Drive a month later McMillen noted that the PC release was more heavily promoted than the XBLA version A version for Mac OS X was released in November while another version for Linux operating systems was released in December as part of the Humble Indie Bundle game pack br Due to Sony s initial lack of interest in the game Team Meat entered into contractual obligations that prohibited Super Meat Boy from ever being released on the PlayStation Despite this a version for the PlayStation and PlayStation Vita was eventually announced The WiiWare version was canceled because the game s file size had been expanded beyond the limits imposed by Nintendo Team Meat looked into releasing it as a retail Wii game but were told by all third party publishers they approached that a budget title would not be profitable so late into the Wii s lifecycle Versions of the game were eventually released for Nintendo s follow up systems Wii U and the Switch The PlayStation PlayStation Vita Wii U and Switch ports were produced by BlitWorks The Switch version includes a platform exclusive Race Mode allowing two players on the Switch s split screen and using separate Joy Con to race through sets of levels This mode was added to the Windows version in October br A limited edition retail version of the PC game was released in April It included bonuses such as behind the scenes videos a sample disc of the game s music and a Super Meat Boy comic In Team Meat began prototyping an iOS and Android version of the game The game was intended to be a different take on the Super Meat Boy concept that is more adapted to touch screen controls than a direct port would be This project would develop into the new endless runner game Super Meat Boy Forever revealed in at the video game convention PAX br Team Meat released several pieces of merchandise related to Super Meat Boy These include Super Meat Boy Handheld an iOS app released on April and styled on a Tiger Electronics handheld It was released as a joke after Refenes game Zits Giggles was removed from the iTunes Store following a statement by Refenes that likened the iPhone to a Tiger handheld McMillen has released a Super Meat Boy microgame for WarioWare D I Y Team Meat sells charms plush toys and posters related to the game as well as T shirts stickers stress balls and a limited edition Super Meat Boy comic In Voxelous released a set of four Super Meat Boy figures of Meat Boy Bandage Girl Brownie and Tofu Boy later making figures of Commander Video Jill Ogmo and Dr Fetus br br br Music br Super Meat Boy s soundtrack was composed by Danny Baranowsky who previously composed the soundtracks for the indie video games Canabalt Cortex Command and Gravity Hook He also composed the music for the original Meat Boy McMillen knew of Baranowsky s other work and approached him late in Meat Boy s development asking him to supply whatever tracks he had on hand For the soundtrack of Super Meat Boy Baranowsky incorporated the music he had provided for Meat Boy into an expanded soundtrack He tried to ensure that the music would accompany the action on the screen without overpowering the sound effects Baranowsky was given complete freedom for the game s music and retained all of the rights to it McMillen believed that being more invested in the game would let Baranowsky express the part of him that was manic obsessive complex and full of life McMillen feels that the soundtrack gets your heart rate up complements every aspect of its gameplay and stays with you for days br On October the game s soundtrack was released as a download only album via the online Bandcamp store titled Super Meat Boy Soundtrack This release features tracks and a minute runtime and includes several remixes of tracks from the game On January Baranowsky and Team Meat released a special edition soundtrack on Bandcamp as both a downloadable and physical album This edition includes a second disc of songs not included in the original release as well as additional remixes The

June br Baranowsky s music was not used for the PlayStation Nintendo Wii U Nintendo Switch and PlayStation Vita versions as he no longer had a working relationship with Team Meat and they could not agree on licensing terms Instead those versions of the game feature a soundtrack composed by Ridiculon Matthias Bossi and Jon Evans David Scattle Scatliffe and Laura Shigihara who have previously

platforming elements and often commented on the game s difficulty X Play reviewer Alexandra Hall said the game had riveting platforming action and added that Super Meat Boy s designers are masters of their craft Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar felt the platforming was perfect He wrote that while it s always tough and demanding it never feels cheap or like the game is cheating you A reviewer from GameTrailers stated that the difficulty rides the perfect line between driving you utterly bonkers when you fail and making you feel like a platform pro when you succeed Joystiq s Richard Mitchell echoed other reviewers comments Super Meat Boy is tough as tough as the toughest nails in the toughest universe Gilbert cited the level of difficulty which he believed made the game inaccessible to some players as his reason for not awarding the game a perfect score Tom McShea of GameSpot praised the game s precise control excellent level design and smooth difficulty curve Reviewer Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer warned that Super Meat Boy is a hard game It should make you want to throw the pad across the room br Critics gave high marks to the game s retro art direction and presentation Official Xbox Magazine UK s Mike Channel appreciated the variety found in each set of levels He stated that while the graphics may look crude the presentation is exceptional Each level has a distinct visual style Daemon Hatfield a reviewer for IGN noted the uniqueness of the game s visual presentation He commented that the warp zone levels pay tribute to classic bit games and lauded the game s soundtrack The rocking chiptune soundtrack is the best I ve heard since Scott Pilgrim vs The World The Game Joe Leonard of UP com noted that the game s humor and over the top gameplay help to calm frustrations regarding the difficulty Super Meat Boy s greatest strength has to be how it never takes itself too seriously as maddening as some of the levels got I could never stay angry at the game for too long said Leonard MTV Multiplayer reviewer Russ Frushtick praised the game s visual design He appreciated the game s cutscenes which he noted are hand drawn animated shorts which bear more than a passing resemblance to a classic video game intro br While the game received high praise overall certain publications voiced complaints Hatfield noted that the cutscenes had low production values stating that they don t have the polish of the rest of the game The reviewer for PC Gamer mentioned a few minor yet to be patched bugs Eduardo Reboucas of Game Revolution said that a lot of the levels in Super Meat Boy depend a little too much on twitch reflexes and trial and error memorization He also stated that there are some bits of toilet humor here and there that are duds and that the game s high level of difficulty will make most casual players shy away Mitchell Dyer of GamePro agreed saying that certain absurdly difficult levels broke the flow of the game especially in the boss levels and the later chapters br br br Legacy br Meat Boy has made cameo appearances in the video games Bit Trip Runner Bit Trip Fate and Bit Trip Presents Runner Future Legend of Rhythm Alien as well as in
