E short for Electronic Entertainment Expo was an annual trade event for the video game industry organized and presented by the Entertainment Software Association ESA It was held principally in Los Angeles from to with its final iteration held virtually in The event hosted developers publishers hardware manufacturers and other industry professionals who used the occasion to introduce and advertise upcoming games hardware and merchandise to the press During its existence E was the world s largest and most prestigious annual gaming expo br E included an exhibition floor for developers publishers and manufacturers to showcase their titles and products for sale in the upcoming year Before and during the event publishers and hardware manufacturers usually held press conferences to announce new games and products Before E was an industry only event the ESA required individuals wishing to attend to verify a professional relationship with the video game industry With the rise of streaming media several press conferences were broadcast to the public to increase their visibility E became open to the public for the first time with general admittance passes for those who wanted to attend br When hosted in Los Angeles E was held in the Los Angeles Convention Center The event was cancelled for the first time in due to the COVID pandemic and the event in was held as a virtual event to mixed reception The event was cancelled also due to the pandemic and with no virtual event held The ESA had planned to return to a full in person convention in with a new format including a fan convention component at a separate venue in collaboration with ReedPop br The pandemic further accelerated the use of standalone presentations by individual publishers and media outlets to promote upcoming games directly to consumers development timelines usually aligned around the convention had been disrupted and publishers were increasingly concerned over the costs of exhibiting at the convention E was cancelled after all major publishers pulled out of the event and E was cancelled in September in order to evaluate plans for On December the ESA announced that E had been retired and would no longer be held br br br History br br br Origins br Before E game publishers went to other trade shows like the Consumer Electronics Show and the European Computer Trade Show to display new or upcoming products as well as to pre sell shipments to retailers for the rest of the year including the late year holiday season as well as to view for press coverage of upcoming games As the game industry grew rapidly during the early s industry professionals felt that it had outgrown the older trade shows According to Tom Kalinske CEO of Sega America The CES organizers used to put the video game industry way way in the back In they put us in a tent and you had to walk past all the porn vendors to find us That particular year it was pouring rain and the rain leaked right over our new Genesis system I was just furious with the way CES treated the video game industry and I felt we were a more important industry than they were giving us credit for Sega did not return to CES the following year and several other companies exited from further CES shows br Separately in the video game industry had formed the Interactive Digital Software Association IDSA later becoming the Entertainment Software Association ESA in in response to attention the industry had drawn from the United States Congress over a lack of a ratings system in late The IDSA was formed to unify the video game industry and establish a commission the Entertainment Software Ratings Board ESRB to create a voluntary standard rating system that was approved by Congress br br The industry recognized that it needed some type of trade show for retailers According to Eliot Minsker chairman and CEO of Knowledge Industry Publications which produced and promoted the show with Infotainment World Retailers have pointed to the need for an interpretive event that will help them make smarter buying decisions by interacting with a wide range of publishers vendors industry influentials and opinion leaders in a focused show setting Attempts were made between the video game companies and the Consumer Electronics Association CEA which ran CES to improve how video games were treated at CES but these negotiations failed to produce a result Pat Ferrell creator of GamePro which was owned by International Data Group IDG conceived of an idea for starting a dedicated trade show for video games building off IDG s established experience in running the Macworld convention Ferrell contacted the IDSA who saw the appeal of using their position in the industry to create a video game specific tradeshow and offered to co found the Electronic Entertainment Expo with IDG br Though several companies agreed to present at this E event Ferrell discovered that CEA had offered video game companies a dedicated space at the next CES which would have conflicted with the planned E event requiring the companies to pick one or the other Most of the IDSA members supported E while Nintendo and Microsoft were still supportive of the CES approach After about three to four months Ferrell was told by CEA s CEO Gary J Shapiro that he had won and that they had canceled the CES video game event effectively making E the premier trade show for the video game industry br br br Growth and success through first decade br br The first event was held from May at the Los Angeles Convention Center which would generally be the convention s location in future years The organizers were unsure of how successful this would be but by the end of the convention they had booked most of the space at the Convention Center and saw more than attendees In the aftermath of its first year E was already regarded as the biggest event in the video game industry The IDSA realized the strength of a debut trade show and subsequently renegotiated with IDG to allow the IDSA to take full ownership of the show and the intellectual property associated with the name while hiring IDG to help with execution of the event During this E Sega had introduced the Sega Saturn priced at Sony also introduced the first PlayStation console with Sony Computer Entertainment North America s president Steve Race came on stage during their press event to simply say before leaving the stage to applause The surprise undercutting price had a significant impact on Sega and the current console war between Sega Sony and Nintendo From then on E was seen to play a major part in other console wars with journalists reporting on which manufacturer won E based on their product offerings br In IDG and the IDSA tried a Japanese version of E in preparation for a worldwide series of events at the Makuhari Messe in Tokyo as E Tokyo in association with TV Asahi Although Sony Computer Entertainment was the show s original sponsor the company withdrew its support in favor of its PlayStation Expo Sega then pulled out at the last minute leaving Nintendo the only big three company to appear Held November the presence of several other gaming expos and lack of support from Japanese game manufacturers led to reportedly poor turnout and rumored E events in Singapore and Canada did not take place br Due to failed negotiations for the convention space in Los Angeles the E conventions in and were held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta Georgia Turnout at these shows was dramatically lower than at the first two E s which has been attributed to a declining number of game developers and the fact that many video game companies were based on the West Coast making the cost of sending staff and equipment to Atlanta prohibitive The show returned to the Los Angeles Convention Center in and continued to grow in attendance ranging from to attendees br In addition to the event E started to support or became associated with several websites One was E introduced in an online community which attendees used to network and schedule meetings br br br Media and Business Summit br Following the convention the IDSA now ESA found that many exhibitors were worried about the high costs of presenting at the event spending between million for their booths They had also found that a larger proportion of attendees were bloggers and attendees who were not perceived to be industry professionals by vendors managing to secure access to the conference These additional attendees diluted the vendors ability to reach out to their target audience retailers and journalists Both of these reasons had previously caused the COMDEX trade show to shut down Several large vendors told the ESA that they were going to pull out of the next E which would have had a domino effect on other vendors br To avoid this the ESA announced in July that E would be downsized and restructured due to the overwhelming demand from the exhibitors and would limit attendees to those from the media and retail sectors For and E was renamed to the E Media and Business Summit and moved into the July timeframe about two months later in the year than previous shows The show was held at the Barker Hangar at the Santa Monica Airport and other nearby hotels in Santa Monica California with attendance limited to about and was the last time the show was not physically held at the Los Angeles Convention Center The event returned to the Los Angeles Convention Center but also capped attendance at about br ESA was harshly criticized for these smaller events Industry analyst Michael Pachter said that because consumers had been eliminated from attending the events there was little external media coverage of these E s reducing the visibility and commercialization opportunities for publishers and suggested that without a change E would become extinct Pachter also found that retailers were less interested in E due to the later calendar date Activision which had been a member of the ESA since its start opted to leave the ESA in and to no longer participate in the E event with their CEO Robert Kotick stating the company was too big for the E and ESA at that point riding on revenue from World of Warcraft br br br Return to larger format br Responding to the complaints from the previous two years the ESA announced that E would be more open but capping attendance at about and closed to the public as to achieve a balance between the two extremes All subsequent E s took place in June of the calendar year at the Los Angeles Convention Center br br Starting in some of the major video game companies particularly Nintendo and Electronic Arts have opted not to showcase at E In Nintendo s case they have foregone a large keynote presentation and instead have used pre recorded Nintendo Direct and live video events during the E week since to showcase their new products though they still run floor booths for hands on demonstrations Since there also have been Nintendo Treehouse Live streams that focused on several different games as well as tournaments for different titles Electronic Arts since have set up a separate EA Play event in a nearby locale to announce and exhibit their titles citing the move as a result of the lack of public access to the main E show Other vendors like Microsoft and Sony have used pre E events to showcase hardware reveals leaving the E event to cover new games for these systems br By traditional video game marketing had been augmented by the use of publicity through word of mouth by average gamers persons not normally part of the professional development community The ESA began to seek ways to allow these people to attend E in limited numbers without overwhelming the normal attendees For E tickets were distributed to vendors to be given to fans to be able to attend the event That same year also marked the introduction of the PC Gaming Show featuring games for personal computers across a range of developers and publishers br br br Opening to the public br E featured a separate but free E Live event at the nearby L A Live space that was to help provide a small scale version of the E experience While it drew about people it was found to be underwhelming In the ESA reserved tickets to the convention for members of the public to buy these were all sold leading to more than attendees during E which led to noticeable crowding and floor management issues ESA confirmed that E would include public passes but that for two of the days the event would be open only to industry attendees for three hours prior to admitting the public br The ESA unveiled the new logo for E replacing its previous one using three dimensional block letters with a flatter stylized graphic in October br While the ESA has the Convention Center space reserved through ESA s CEO Mike Gallagher said following the event that they were considering other options due to lack of modernization and upgrades that the center has had to make the space more appropriate for their needs Gallagher said that the ESA was working with the City and Anschutz Entertainment Group AEG which owns the Los Angeles Convention Center and the space around it with plans to have nearly sq ft m of additional exhibition space added by but that they would judge this in the show During the event drew attendees the largest since br With announcements of the dates for E the ESA declined to state where they had planned to hold the event Sony Interactive Entertainment had announced that it would not be participating in E having had participated in every E since its launch Sony stated that they are exploring new and familiar ways to engage our community in Sony s CEO Shawn Layden stated in a February interview that with changes in retailer procurement their own switch to fewer but more quality titles and the rapid spread of news via the Internet that having a trade show as late as June is no longer helpful and that Sony had to create its own Destination PlayStation experience in February as to secure retailer sales Industry Analyst Michael Patcher speaking to GamingBolt said I think it s a mistake to skip the show they will probably be there without a big booth It was a surprise to me br As of revenues from running E accounted for about of the organization s annual budget with another coming from membership dues With Sony s withdrawal from the conference and the controversies surrounding outgoing ESA president Mike Gallagher some member companies criticized the ESA for splitting its focus between producing E and acting as a legislative advocacy group with neither focus receiving adequate attention This led to calls advocating for the business of running E to be split out into a separate company Developers and publishers complained of the increasing cost to have a booth presence at E compared to simply holding a digital event streamed online saying the exposure afforded by E was not always worth the price Sony and Electronic Arts departure and Nintendo s move to a digital only keynote diminished E s status as the premier game announcement event which further eroded its ability to attract exhibitors E lost nearly of its exhibitors between and going from to br br br Data leak br On August it was found that an unsecured list of personal attendee data was publicly accessible from the ESA s site The list contained the information of over people most of them being the press and social media influencers that had attended E ESA removed the list after it was found and apologized for allowing the information to become public However using similar techniques to access the data users found similar data for over attendees of past E events still available on user authenticated portions of their website these too were subsequently pulled by the ESA once notified A number of journalists on the lists reported that they were subsequently harassed and had received death threats due to their private information being released as part of the leak Ahead of E the ESA stated they were taking stricter security measures to protect the privacy of those registering for E as a result of the leak ESA president Stanley Pierre Louis stated they plan to collect less data from attendees and take measures such as securing the data on separate servers to avoid this type of leak from occurring again br br br Impact of COVID and discontinuation br During the last day of the event in it was confirmed that E would be held at the LACC for at least another year with the edition The ESA affirmed they had renegotiated use of the LACC through but retained the rights to break that contract if desired br The ESA s membership approved an increase in the number of public passes from to for the show Alongside this the ESA had presented proposed but not finalized plans to make the event a fan media and influencer festival To mitigate the longer lines caused by increased public attendance they aimed to use queuetainment to advertise to attendees while they wait as well as a FastPass like system of reserving game demos in advance similar to the one employed by Disney Parks They planned to give priority to influencers by providing them appointment only presentations on new games Additionally with these changes the ESA were considering adding an extra day on the Tuesday of the convention week that would be an industry only day before the floor of the convention was opened to public passes Sony affirmed it would not attend the show stating that the vision for E did not meet their goals and instead would showcase their games at other events throughout the year In the wake of Sony s announcement ESA affirmed that the show will be an exciting high energy show featuring new experiences partners exhibitor spaces activations and programming that will entertain new and veteran attendees alike On February Geoff Keighley host of E Coliseum and The Game Awards released a statement announcing that he would also be forgoing his attendance of E for the first time in the expo s year history citing his discomfort with the direction planned for the event in br However in the months leading to the event the COVID pandemic created concerns related to large gatherings such as E As late as March the ESA had still intended to hold E though said they were monitoring the situation around the outbreak On March the ESA announced that E had been cancelled due to the pandemic The ESA also claimed that they would both fully refund prospective attendees and exhibitors and devise a virtual event that would enable exhibitors to hold digital presentations during the same week in lieu of a physical meeting However by April the ESA stated that the disruption caused by the pandemic made it impossible to host an online equivalent fully cancelling the event though the ESA would help its partners to present individual announcements via E s website Keighley would organize Summer Game Fest an event series encompassing various publisher led digital presentations and demo offerings from May to August br Despite cancelling the event the ESA stated it still planned to hold the event announcing its normal June dates to partners in April While the ESA had planned for a combined in person and virtual event the organization notified its partners in February that it was dropping the in person event but maintaining the virtual event plans According to Video Games Chronicle the ESA still planned to use the LACC to broadcast some of these virtual events during E as well as planning on further use of the space in and The virtual event faced a mixed reception among users and the industry including issues with the event s official mobile app and assessments that E as a virtual event was redundant to streaming presentations that could be held as standalone events by publishers br While Mayor Eric Garcetti stated that the ESA had planned E to be an in person event on January the ESA announced that the in person version of E had been cancelled due to COVID with no immediate confirmation of a virtual event Although this announcement came amid spread of the Omicron variant IGN reported that unlike past years E had no dates publicized by either the ESA or the LACC which had cast doubt especially amid the internal issues surrounding the event and the aforementioned reception to E over whether the event was even being planned at all Furthermore IGN reported via anonymous sources that the ESA had made a decision to cancel the event as early as late The ESA formally announced on March that they had fully cancelled E br In June the ESA stated that they still planned to return with a physical and virtual show in One month later the ESA confirmed that E would occur at the Los Angeles Convention Center during the second week of June and that they have partnered with ReedPop who operate conventions such as PAX events New York Comic Con and the Star Wars Celebration to help manage the event In September the ESA announced that the event would also include three Business Days where the floor would be limited to developers publishers retailers and recognized journalists while two days at a separate location would be held as Fan Days for all members of the public In January IGN reported that neither Microsoft Nintendo or Sony would exhibit at E with Nintendo confirming their absence the following month citing that this year s E show didn t fit into our plans Microsoft confirmed in March they would not be on the E showfloor but would be holding the digital events In the same month Ubisoft also announced that they would not be attending E and would be hosting their own presentation event in June instead On March IGN reported that both Sega and Tencent would be skipping E br On March the event was cancelled because of a lack of sustained interest According to ESA s president Stanley Pierre Louis the choice to cancel the show was a result of three factors that the COVID pandemic had impacted the typical development cycle for most companies that the current economy had publishers and developers re evaluate the need for attending E and that as a result there has been more exploration of the mix of in person and digital marketing events that individual companies have run While Pierre Louis stated that ESA was intending to hold E in they were looking themselves to find a balance that works for the industry br The ESA affirmed in September that there would be no E that they would not be using the LACC in the immediate future and that ReedPop was no longer working to help organize future events The ESA stated they were still in discussions with their partners on E and future shows with the former reportedly planned to have a complete reinvention On December the ESA announced that E had been discontinued citing the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners Pierre Louis said that events like Summer Game Fest were not responsible for the decision to end E while the increasing number of publisher specific showcases was a reason He further stated that ReedPop s departure was not solely responsible for their decision to end E but helped to inform their choice br br br Events br br br See also br Brasil Game Show
