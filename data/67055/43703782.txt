talk to him in private Tony says he will meet her inside An hour later he saunters in rather than immediately Pepper notices that he has started drinking again Tony shows her the latest Iron Man suit which is going to replace the Model the Endo Sym Armor A liquid smart metal design it utilizes elements of symbiotes and its boot process is fully psionic Pepper cuts out his spiel about its aesthetic appeal by accusing him of not considering the ramifications of giving everyone with a smartphone access to Extremis Everyone who had no way of accessing the app is the city s new underclass while everyone who had access to the app has become part of a wave of orgiastic irresponsibility that has swept the city On a street corner a gang of Extremis enhanced urbanites corner a homeless woman and accuse her of blemishing their perfect future Before the second punch is thrown though they are accosted by Daredevil who promises violence if they don t disperse Suddenly the leader of the mob keels

money Every single Extremis enhancile in San Francisco writhes on the pavement as their biology subtly rewrites itself to default Every single mobile device in the city pings explaining through a new message that their trial period has expired and that to continue they must pay per day Putting on his Endo Sym Armor Tony decides to get a good look at the city from the air That night Pepper discusses Tony s condition with someone She says that years ago Tony said his greatest fear was not that someone would take the contents of his life and use it against him but rather that something would take his mind and use him to destroy his life Pepper believes that this has happened and that she and her co conspirator need to activate the contingency Her ally steps from the shadows revealing that the unnamed person is wearing an early Iron Man suit as he agrees with her br br br Titles involved br br br Collected editions br br br Reception br IGN gave the story and the overall graphic novel a negative review of with the verdict AXIS stands as one of the great disappointments of Despite the top tier creators involved and the pedigree of Uncanny Avengers this event just didn t come together Only sporadic moments of fun crop up during the barrage of rushed art and poor characterization And while the overall pacing does benefit slightly in this collected format the hardcover s lack of extras and poor paper quality make the high cover price a hard pill to swallow br br br
