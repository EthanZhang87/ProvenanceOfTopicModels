over from the World Hockey Association WHA br br br Timeline br br br Early years br br br Four three teams br The four teams that began the inaugural NHL season were the Montreal Canadiens the Montreal Wanderers the original Ottawa Senators and the Toronto Arenas However after completing four games the Wanderers withdrew from the league due to their arena burning down and the NHL continued that season and the next with only three teams br br br Four teams br In its third season the NHL underwent its first expansion adding the Quebec Bulldogs Toronto changed its name to Toronto St Patricks br br br Quebec relocates to Hamilton br For the season Quebec relocated to Hamilton and changed their name becoming the Hamilton Tigers br br br Six teams br Two new teams joined the NHL in its eighth season the Boston Bruins the first expansion team in the United States and the Montreal Maroons br br br Seven teams br The next season the NHL added two new teams the Pittsburgh Pirates and the New York Americans The Americans were stocked by purchasing the contracts of the Hamilton Tigers players and the Tigers franchise was subsequently revoked by the league br br br Ten teams br The NHL continued to expand the following season adding the Chicago Black Hawks the Detroit Cougars and the New York Rangers growing to ten teams thus more than doubling its size in its first decade of existence The league realigned into two divisions the American Division and the Canadian Division Despite its name the Canadian Division contained at least one team based in the U S throughout its existence At the same time the Stanley Cup was contested between two NHL teams for the first time instead of at least one from an outside league br Midway through the season the Toronto St Patricks were sold and renamed the Toronto Maple Leafs however the league ruled the team must use the St Patricks name until season s end br br br Pittsburgh relocates to Philadelphia br For the season the Pirates moved from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia becoming the Philadelphia Quakers and Detroit was renamed the Detroit Falcons br br br Eight teams br After fourteen seasons of steady expansion the NHL contracted to eight teams dropping the Philadelphia Quakers and the original Ottawa Senators for the season br br br Nine teams br For the season after missing one season the original Ottawa Senators rejoined the NHL and the Detroit Falcons were renamed the Detroit Red Wings br br br Ottawa relocates to St Louis br For the season the Ottawa Senators relocated becoming the St Louis Eagles br br br Eight teams br The Eagles folded after one season and the NHL was once again an eight team league for three seasons br br br Seven teams br The Montreal Maroons withdrew from the league for the season further reducing the number of teams in the NHL to seven shrinking to the size the league was in Play continued for four seasons with seven teams with one single league table instead of any conference or divisions br br br The Americans change their name br The New York Americans changed their name to the Brooklyn Americans for the season their last br br br Original Six br br The season saw the folding of the Brooklyn Americans and ushered in an unprecedented era of br franchise stability in the NHL which lasted without any organizational changes for twenty five seasons Eventually the six teams that competed in the league during this period would come to be known as the Original Six br br br Expansion years br br br Twelve teams br The expansion doubled the number of teams in the league with an upfront expansion fee of million each million today For the season six new teams were added to the NHL the California Seals the Los Angeles Kings the Minnesota North Stars the Philadelphia Flyers the Pittsburgh Penguins and the St Louis Blues br Within a month into their first season the California Seals became the Oakland Seals br br br Fourteen teams br The Oakland Seals were renamed the Bay Area Seals for two games before changing their name again to the California Golden Seals for their fourth season in The same season the NHL added two new teams the Buffalo Sabres and the Vancouver Canucks paying an expansion fee of million each million today The Sabres and the Canucks were placed in the East partially as an effort to provide greater balance between the divisions and also so they would have rivalries with the other two Canadian teams while the Chicago Black Hawks moved to the West br br br Sixteen teams br Two more teams joined for the NHL season the New York Islanders and the Atlanta Flames With the competing World Hockey Association WHA starting that same season the NHL was not able to raise its expansion fee from the price of two years earlier million million today with the Islanders paying an additional million million today to the New York Rangers for infringing on their territory The Islanders were placed in the East and the Flames were placed in the West br br br Eighteen teams br Two more teams joined for the NHL season the Washington Capitals and the Kansas City Scouts but the ongoing competition from the WHA meant that the overall revenue stream of the NHL had not improved so the league kept the expansion fee for new owners at the million million today of two years and four years earlier The earnings situation for the new franchises was so poor that at least the Capitals were able to negotiate a reduction to a total fee of million million today br With teams the league realigned into four divisions and two conferences The teams were mixed up regardless of North American geography and thus the new conferences and divisions were not named after geographical references The East Division became the Prince of Wales Conference and consisted of the Adams Division and Norris Division The West Division became the Clarence Campbell Conference and consisted of the Patrick Division and Smythe Division br br br Two teams relocate br Going into the NHL season the California Golden Seals relocated to become the Cleveland Barons and the Kansas City Scouts moved to become the Colorado Rockies br br br Seventeen

of million each million today These new NHL teams were the Edmonton Oilers Hartford Whalers Quebec Nordiques and the original Winnipeg Jets This also doubled the number of Canadian teams in the league Standing at teams for twelve seasons this was one of the longer periods of league stability though surpassed by twenty five seasons of the Original Six when no additions moves nor name changes occurred br The Nordiques were placed in the Adams Division the Whalers in the Norris and the Oilers and the Jets in the Smythe The Washington Capitals moved from the Norris to the Patrick Division
