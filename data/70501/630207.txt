the only person to fill the position to date Among other duties the commissioner leads collective bargaining negotiations on behalf of the league and appoints officials for all NHL games br Until the NHL s top executive was the league president and for five months in the league had both a commissioner and a president The roles were amalgamated on July The presidency originated in the National Hockey Association NHA which Frank Calder presided over jointly as NHA acting president and NHL president in the period of the NHL s founding and the NHA s suspension br br br Definition and duties br

governors meetings br br br NHL presidents br br br Frank Calder br Calder wielded his power as president with such authority that he was rarely opposed When he ordered the Quebec Bulldogs franchise forfeited to Hamilton as happened in no one challenged him An example of his authority was when the Hamilton Tigers went on strike in Rather than talk to the players he suspended and fined them each br Calder was adamant about not restricting racial minorities entry into the NHL During the season upon hearing of the Boston Black Panthers the first all black hockey team he was reported to have remarked Pro hockey has no ruling against the coloured man nor is it likely to ever draw the line a reference to the segregation in baseball Only one attempt to remove Calder as president of the NHL was made This was in when the owner of the Chicago Black Hawks Frederic McLaughlin circulated a letter to the NHL board of governors to remove him The board rejected the motion br Commencing with the season Calder named the top rookie in the NHL Starting in he got the NHL s board of governors to let him buy a trophy to give to the league s top rookie and he did this until After his death the trophy was made permanent as the Calder Memorial Trophy Calder received a silver service in for his years as president of the NHL and the league extended their appreciation br br br Red Dutton br br Dutton was named managing director acting president of the NHL after the death of Frank Calder in February running the league at the direction of a subcommittee of the NHL Board of Governors He was eventually convinced to assume the presidency in but in September amid frustrations with the Board of Governors for their cancellation of the suspended Brooklyn Americans franchise that he had sought to revive he handed over the reins to his assistant Clarence Campbell a former NHL referee who had just returned from military service in Europe and had been in the job for less than a month br br br Clarence Campbell br One of Clarence Campbell s first acts of authority was in when he expelled players Billy Taylor and Don Gallinger from the NHL for betting on games br As NHL president Campbell is perhaps best remembered for suspending Montreal Canadiens superstar Maurice Richard for the remaining three games of the regular season and for the entirety of the playoffs His action came as a result of Richard s punching of linesman Cliff Thompson during a March game with the Boston Bruins Thompson was holding Richard allowing Boston s Hal Laycoe to punch the Rocket On March Campbell attended a game at the Montreal Forum between the Canadiens and the Detroit Red Wings Throughout the first period he was taunted and pelted with debris by outraged Montreal fans who saw him as a prime example of the city s English Canadian elite oppressing the French Canadian majority After a tear gas bomb was released in the arena Campbell exited the building the game was forfeited to the Red Wings and the Forum was evacuated What ensued was a full fledged riot in which people were arrested and in damage was done br Campbell was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in He was instrumental in the expansion which doubled the league in size He kept the league alive when the World Hockey Association raided its talent in the s and often worked hours a day in his office br At the beginning of the league s expansion era in the NHL clubs decided to highlight the achievements of the league president by donating the Clarence S Campbell Bowl in his honour When the league realigned into two conferences and four divisions in it further honoured Campbell by naming one of the two conferences after him and awarding the Campbell Bowl to the conference s regular season later playoff champion Although the Clarence Campbell Conference was renamed the Western Conference in the Campbell Bowl continues to be awarded to the conference s playoff champion br br br John Ziegler br In John Ziegler became the fourth president of the NHL succeeding Clarence Campbell It was under Ziegler s watch that the WHA disbanded in and the NHL absorbed four of its teams the Edmonton Oilers Quebec Nordiques Hartford Whalers and original Winnipeg Jets and near the end of his tenure in the San Jose Sharks began play returning the NHL to the Bay Area for the first time since br Also under Ziegler s watch NHL headquarters were moved from Montreal to New York City br In Rendez vous a series between the Soviet national team and a team of stars from the NHL was held in Quebec City The two teams split the two game series and propelled an influx of Soviet players being drafted into the NHL by the end of the s br The first league wide labor dispute occurred under Ziegler toward the end of the season Ziegler was forced out of office by the owners as a result of the settlement that resolved the ten day strike br br br Gil Stein br On June Gil Stein was announced as the new president of the league and formally took the position succeeding Ziegler Ziegler had been forced out by owners dissatisfied with his agreement with the NHLPA that ended a ten day strike initiated by Bob Goodenow br As president Stein greatly expanded the visibility of the president s office during his term often seen at games and being frequently interviewed on air and in print Among his early actions after becoming president was a shake up of league officers ousting several vice presidents including Brian O Neill who had been the league s disciplinarian under Ziegler Stein personally took over responsibility for league discipline making it mandatory that suspended players pay their fines He also implemented a policy of suspending players from practices on non game days instead of having them miss games He advocated the use of NHL players at the Winter Olympics but ran into opposition on the issue from team owners however his successor Gary Bettman was able to get NHL players to compete in the Winter Olympics beginning in and the league would take a break during years when the Winter Olympics were held until Stein oversaw a further expansion of the NHL in that the Tampa Bay Lightning and the new Ottawa Senators began play in the fall of br The league hired an executive search firm to help select someone for their newly created office of commissioner at the same time that Stein s appointment as president was announced Before the end of NHL governors selected Gary Bettman to become the league s first commissioner starting on February Stein had been a finalist for the job but bowed out to avoid an internecine battle and threw his support to Bettman br When Stein s term ended on July the presidency was abolished and its duties were conferred onto the commissioner br br br NHL commissioners present br br br Gary Bettman present br On February Gary Bettman s tenure as the first commissioner of the National Hockey League began replacing Gil Stein who served as the NHL s final president The owners hired Bettman with the mandate of selling the game in the U S markets ending labour unrest completing expansion plans and modernizing the views of the old guard within the ownership ranks br br br Expansion and relocation br When Bettman started as commissioner the league had already expanded by three teams to since and two more were set to be announced by the expansion committee the Florida Panthers and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim who would begin play in Similar to the previous expansion cycles the focus was on placing teams in the southern United States The Nashville Predators Atlanta Thrashers Minnesota Wild Columbus Blue Jackets Vegas Golden Knights and the Seattle Kraken have been added during Bettman s tenure In addition five franchises have relocated during Bettman s tenure the Minnesota North Stars to Dallas the Quebec Nordiques to Denver the original Winnipeg Jets to Phoenix the Hartford Whalers to North Carolina and the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg The Coyotes suspended in and a new team will play in Salt Lake City br Led by Bettman the league focused expansion and relocation efforts on the American South working to expand the league s footprint across the country As a result there has been significant growth in the sport of hockey at the grassroots level with children in the U S South playing the game in increasing numbers The move towards southern markets has been heavily criticized as well however with fans in Canada and the Northern United States lamenting the move away from traditional hockey markets br Bettman has also been accused of having an anti Canadian agenda with critics citing the relocation of the franchises in Quebec City and Winnipeg and his apparent refusal to help stop it along with the aborted sale of the Nashville Predators in to interests that would have moved the team to Hamilton Ontario Jim Balsillie accused Bettman of forcing the Predators to end negotiations with him to purchase the team Bettman was satirized in this vein as the character Harry Buttman in the Canadian movie Bon Cop Bad Cop br br br Labour unrest br Although Bettman was tasked with putting an end to the NHL s labour problems the league has nonetheless locked out its players three times during Bettman s tenure The lockout lasted days causing the season to be shortened from to games A key issue during the lockout was the desire to aid small market teams Led by Bettman the owners insisted on a salary cap changes to free agency and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries the union instead proposed a luxury tax system The negotiations were at times bitter with Chris Chelios famously issuing a veiled threat against Bettman suggesting that Bettman should be worried about his family and his well being because Some crazed fans or even a player might take matters into their own hands and figure they get Bettman out of the way br By the end of the deal in the owners were claiming that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues and that the league as a whole lost over US million in br As a result on September Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out prior to the start of the season Three months later Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season with the words It is my sad duty to announce that because a solution has not yet been attained it is no longer practical to conduct even an abbreviated season Accordingly I have no choice but to announce the formal cancellation of play for The NHL became the first North American league to cancel an entire season because of a labour stoppage br As in the owners position was predicated around the need for a salary cap In an effort to ensure solidarity amongst the owners the league s governors voted to give Bettman the right to unilaterally veto any union offer as long as he had the backing of just eight owners The players initially favoured a luxury tax system and a rollback on player salaries later increased to As the threat of another season being canceled loomed the players agreed to accept a salary cap br br br Television br Bettman quickly accomplished one of his stated goals signing a five year million deal with the Fox Broadcasting Company to broadcast NHL games nationally beginning in the season The deal was significant as a network television contract in the United States was long thought unattainable during the presidency of John Ziegler The Fox deal is perhaps best remembered for the FoxTrax puck which while generally popular according to Fox Sports generated a great deal of controversy from longtime fans of the game br Canadians were also upset as the league gave preference to Fox ahead of CBC for scheduling of playoff games as Pat Hickey of the Montreal Gazette wrote that the schedule was just another example of how the NHL snubs its nose at the country that invented hockey and its fans The controversy repeated itself in as the CBC was once again given second billing to Versus coverage of the playoffs br Despite falling ratings Bettman negotiated a five year million deal with ABC and ESPN in It was the largest television contract the NHL ever signed The million per year that ABC and ESPN paid for rights dwarfed the million that the NHL received from American national broadcasts in br The NHL s television fortunes have faded since the ABC deal however In the league could only manage a revenue sharing deal with NBC with no money paid up front by the network Also coming out of the lockout ESPN declined its million option for the NHL s cable rights in While wishing to retain the NHL it stated the cost was overvalued However Bettman was able to negotiate a deal with Comcast to air the NHL on the Outdoor Life Network which changed its name to Versus to reflect their increasing live sports coverage and was once again renamed to NBC Sports Network as a result of Comcast acquiring a majority of NBCUniversal The three year deal was worth million Bettman has been heavily criticized for the move to OLN Versus NBC Sports as detractors have argued that the league has lost a great deal of exposure since moving to the much smaller network which is often relegated to higher or specialty tiers on cable systems In the NHL and NBC announced a year billion contract br On November Bettman and NHL announced that it had sold twelve seasons worth of exclusive Canadian national broadcast rights to Rogers Media who would broadcast games across its numerous platforms including Sportsnet Sportsnet One and City from at a price of C billion Hockey Night in Canada would continue on the CBC for the next four seasons but under a sub licensing deal the public broadcaster would give Rogers free airtime to air the broadcasts CBC would be allotted time during the broadcasts to promote its other programming These moves left Bell Media and its TSN networks shut out of NHL broadcasts except for its regional properties br br br List of
