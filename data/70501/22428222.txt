title: 1979 NHL expansion
id: 22428222
The NHL expansion popularly referred to as the NHL WHA merger was the culmination of several years of negotiations between the National Hockey League NHL and the World Hockey Association WHA The result of the negotiations was that the WHA and its six surviving franchises folded and the owners of four of the teams the Edmonton Oilers New England Whalers Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets were granted expansion franchises which commenced play in the NHL in the season The agreement officially took effect on June it ended the seven year existence of the WHA and re established the NHL as the sole major league in North American professional ice hockey br The two leagues had discussed the possibility of some sort of amalgamation for numerous years despite the acrimonious relationship between the two after the WHA aggressively recruited NHL players upon the former s founding in The two sides came close to an agreement in but the proposed merger was defeated by a group of hard line NHL owners The NHL also initially rejected the expansion agreement by one vote however a massive boycott of Molson products in Canada led the Montreal Canadiens who were owned by Molson to reverse their position In a second vote in which the Vancouver Canucks also dropped their opposition the agreement was ratified br Although popularly called the NHL WHA merger the NHL refused to recognize the WHA s records or history as being any part of its own It explicitly treated the arrival of the WHA teams not as a merger but rather as an expansion consisting of four new teams which happened to have identical or similar names to some of the former WHA teams Notably and in stark contrast to amalgamations consummated within the preceding decade in American football and basketball the existing NHL teams were given the right to reclaim players to which they held NHL rights from the WHA clubs without compensation with the caveat that each of the new NHL franchises were permitted to retain two goaltenders and two skaters from their WHA rosters br To fill the remainder of the new teams NHL rosters an expansion draft was held The expansion teams were also placed at the end of the draft order for the NHL Entry Draft as opposed to typical expansion drafts in North American sports leagues which usually place the expansion teams at or very near the front of the draft order br br br Background br Since the demise of the Western Canada Hockey League in the NHL had existed as the only major professional North American ice hockey league After dwindling from ten teams to the so called Original Six in the NHL stabilized In the years following World War II the league became immensely profitable Similar to other professional leagues of the era the NHL enforced a reserve clause to prevent players from signing with other NHL teams after their contracts expired br Through to the end of the s the NHL refused to consider expansion seriously However following speculation that the Western Hockey League intended to declare itself a major league the NHL was entertaining expansion discussions by culminating four years later with the addition of six new teams for the NHL season this sparked the first significant expansion period for the league which continued until it had tripled in size to teams by br The WHA was founded in with twelve teams and intended to operate as a direct competitor to the NHL It was founded by Dennis Murphy and Gary Davidson who had together founded the American Basketball Association in with the guidance of veteran hockey owner Bill Hunter By its inaugural season NHL players had defected to the new league Former Chicago Black Hawks star Bobby Hull lent immediate credibility to the fledgling circuit when he signed a year contract with the Winnipeg Jets for million the largest in hockey history at the time The NHL attempted in court to block the defections earning an injunction against the Jets that initially prevented several players including Hull from playing in the WHA The new league challenged the orders stating that the NHL s reserve clause which tied players rights to their NHL team for life was illegal A Philadelphia district court sided with the WHA in November ruling that the reserve clause violated the Sherman Antitrust Act freeing all players to play in the WHA The ruling ended the NHL s monopoly on talent br Since hockey salaries were among the lowest in professional sports at the time a key part of the WHA s business plan was to place franchises like the Edmonton Oilers Winnipeg Jets Ottawa Nationals and Quebec Nordiques in mid sized Canadian markets cities the NHL had rejected for expansion franchises but which the WHA thought could sustain major professional teams The WHA also challenged the older league more directly by placing teams like the Philadelphia Blazers New York Golden Blades Toronto Toros and Chicago Cougars in NHL markets The WHA s existence prompted the NHL to expand hastily to Atlanta and Long Island in to keep the rival loop out of the newly completed Omni Coliseum and Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum br br br Merger talks br Merger negotiations between the two leagues had been ongoing since shortly after it became clear within NHL circles the WHA would indeed play In early NHL governors Bill Jennings of the New York Rangers and Ed Snider of the Philadelphia Flyers approached the WHA and offered to have all of its franchises join the NHL if the WHA franchises would pay million each in expansion fees This overture went nowhere particularly since in addition to the aforementioned franchise fees Jennings and Snider demanded exorbitant compensation for infringing on the territory of the Rangers and Flyers based on the indemnity paid by the Islanders when they were granted an NHL franchise on Long Island br Attempts at reconciliation were frequently blocked by Toronto s Harold Ballard Chicago s Bill Wirtz and Boston s Paul A Mooney owners of the three NHL teams most affected by the WHA s player raids By however both leagues were struggling under the financial pressures of competing against each other on the ice and in the courtroom Bobby Hull had become an outspoken proponent of a merger between the two leagues though Gordie Howe the NHL s all time scoring leader turned WHA player and WHA president Bill MacFarland disagreed arguing that the WHA was sustainable indefinitely br Long time NHL President Clarence Campbell was fiercely opposed to any union between the two leagues saying They re our rivals They were people that did their best to destroy us Why would we salvage them now To hell with them Despite this animosity some NHL teams agreed to play preseason exhibition games against WHA opponents prior to the season Campbell ordered this interleague play halted in but the following year the NHL president who by this time was facing both declining health and personal scandal relented and interleague exhibition games resumed although a few NHL clubs including Montreal and Toronto continued to boycott them br Campbell retired in and his successor John Ziegler was more open to unification Under Ziegler s presidency inter league exhibition games became more common eventually involving every NHL team except Los Angeles Buffalo Toronto and Montreal Merger negotiations also intensified and continued to be conducted openly The American teams were far less hostile to the idea of a merger than their Canadian counterparts There were a number of reasons for this but probably the most compelling was the Montreal Canadiens dominance of the NHL during the years of the WHA s existence The Canadiens won five Stanley Cup championships during this time including four in a row from through The Canadiens in particular are widely considered to be the most dominant team in NHL history Montreal owed this success in large part to its ability to better resist WHA efforts to lure away its players a notable exception being J C Tremblay who left the Canadiens to play for the WHA s Quebec Nordiques While this may have been in part because Canadian Hockey Night in Canada television revenues were mostly distributed among the three Canadian teams instead of across the league an additional factor was that star Qu b cois players were long accustomed to playing in their home province and even with the draft in effect these players in particular Guy Lafleur successfully leveraged the threat of signing with the Nordiques to ensure the Canadiens were able to acquire their NHL rights Hence adding Canadian teams and in particular absorbing or eliminating the Nordiques had the potential of blunting that advantage Also both NHL and WHA owners realized that the Canadian markets were a vital economic base both to the WHA and any future rival league that might take its place Absorbing the Canadian markets would therefore preclude the possibility of the NHL having to fight off another rival league br American support for a merger however was based on the assumption that all existing NHL teams would share the expansion fees equally this did not go over well with the league s Canadian owners The objection was not without precedent in Montreal and Toronto had only agreed to support Vancouver s addition to the NHL after they were paid indemnities for the inclusion of the Canucks in the Hockey Night in Canada television deal Although the three Canadian teams could not block any agreement on their own the fact that any deal needed three quarters support among the NHL owners meant that the Canadian teams only needed two American clubs to side with them to block any agreement br In June Ziegler announced that the NHL had created a committee to investigate the possibility of a merger while Bill DeWitt Jr owner of the WHA s Cincinnati Stingers stated that Ziegler had invited six WHA teams to join the NHL for the season if various conditions could be met This proposal would have seen the six teams become full NHL members but play in their own division with a separate schedule for the first year br Led by Toronto s Harold Ballard the owners voted down Ziegler s proposal The Calgary Cowboys who had hoped to be one of the six teams to join the NHL subsequently folded as did the Phoenix Roadrunners Minnesota Fighting Saints and San Diego Mariners This reduced the WHA to eight teams for the WHA season and left its long term future in doubt br br br revised agreement br br The intense competition between the leagues did not leave the NHL unscathed The Pittsburgh Penguins filed for bankruptcy in and nearly moved to Seattle before they found stable ownership with shopping mall magnate Edward J DeBartolo Sr a native of nearby Youngstown Ohio who decided to keep the team in Pittsburgh DeBartolo would later go on to own the San Francisco ers of the NFL The California Golden Seals and Kansas City Scouts were not as lucky as both teams moved for with the Golden Seals becoming the Cleveland Barons and the Scouts the Colorado Rockies after only two years in Kansas City By the NHL faced the possibility of two of its teams the Minnesota North Stars and Barons folding Ziegler was able to mitigate the damage by arranging a merger between the two clubs the Barons remain the most recent example of an American professional sports team in an established major league ceasing operations br Negotiations resumed in and it again appeared that the Houston Aeros as one of the league s strongest teams were an obvious candidate to join the NHL Unfortunately for Houston by this time Ziegler realized NHL owners would never vote to admit six teams and floated a proposal that would admit four WHA franchises The WHA responded by insisting that all three of its Canadian teams be admitted to the NHL This left room for only one American team with the only serious contenders for that spot being the Aeros and Whalers Aeros owner Kenneth Schnitzer attempted to persuade Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs to support the agreement that included the Aeros and not the Bruins neighbors based in Hartford only to find that Jacobs as one of the older league s most hard line owners was opposed to any sort of merger with the WHA and that Ziegler was cool to the idea of adding another Sun Belt NHL team Of the three Sun Belt teams that had joined the league since one the Golden Seals had already relocated and two the Los Angeles Kings and Atlanta Flames were struggling financially br During the final series of talks it soon became evident that no merger of any sort would take place in time for the NHL season It was also apparent that when there was a merger the Aeros were not likely to be included Schnitzer announced that the Aeros would not take part in the WHA season bringing the league down to seven teams He first applied for direct admission to the NHL only to find the older league uninterested in such an expansion with so many of its existing franchises struggling Finally Schnitzer campaigned to be allowed to purchase an existing club and relocate it to Houston The obvious candidate to move was the Barons the former Golden Seals who were on the verge of folding Schnitzer believed the older league would accept almost any other proposal as an alternative to the perceived embarrassment of having to disband a franchise and did come close to a deal to relocate the moribund Barons franchise to Houston However the NHL instead opted to approve a proposal from George and Gordon Gund the owners of the Barons to buy the North Stars franchise and merge it with their own Having run out of options Schnitzer folded the Aeros on July In doing so the Aeros became the only WHA playoff champion that did not eventually join the NHL br Discussion between the two leagues intensified into the season when the WHA made an offer to have five teams join the NHL the following year paying million each for the right to join Although the WHA offer was not accepted Ziegler was encouraged stating that owners were beginning to view the negotiations from a business standpoint rather than an emotional one The WHA saw the Indianapolis Racers fold after only games reducing the league further to six teams the lowest in league history br br br Final agreement br Six teams was widely seen as the absolute minimum to maintain a viable and credible league and with the WHA facing financial difficulty and struggling to meet payrolls the Racers demise left the floundering league s players and fans in doubt as to whether the league would even finish the season However the Racers left the league with a key piece of leverage when flamboyant owner Nelson Skalbania signed year old superstar Wayne Gretzky to a lucrative personal services contract At the time the NHL did not permit the signing of players under nor did it allow its owners to sign players to anything except standard NHL contracts but the WHA had no rules barring such signings Skalbania signed Gretzky to a personal services contract so that he would retain the rights to the teenaged superstar even if the WHA folded outright He knew the Racers would not be part of any merger but hoped to keep them alive long enough to reap a major windfall from selling the highly touted Gretzky s rights He also hoped to get compensation from the teams included in the merger br Gretzky only played eight games for the Racers Skalbania ultimately could not meet his obligations thus leading to his team s demise and opted to sell Gretzky s contract to Oilers owner Peter Pocklington Unlike Skalbania Pocklington was better financed at the time and owned a team that was much better supported and thus reasonably stable by WHA standards and were all but certain to be part of a merger deal br The two leagues reached an agreement in March to grant expansion franchises in four WHA cities pending ratification by the NHL s owners The NHL originally wanted to take in the New England Whalers Winnipeg Jets and Edmonton Oilers The owners of the Cincinnati Stingers and Birmingham Bulls were resigned to their exclusion from the NHL but the Quebec Nordiques fought the proposal The NHL s American teams were less enthusiastic about including Quebec than they were about Edmonton and Winnipeg and Ziegler thought that the Canadiens might be persuaded to support an agreement that excluded the Nordiques br Nevertheless the WHA insisted on NHL franchises for all three of its surviving Canadian markets and Ziegler finally agreed to put the matter to a vote of the NHL s Board of Governors At a March meeting in Key Largo Florida of the owners supported the proposal one short of the required three fourths majority teams out of would have represented of the league just past the threshold stipulated in the NHL constitution to grant expansion franchises As the initial vote stood it only represented The five teams that voted against the agreement were the Canadiens Vancouver Canucks Boston Bruins Toronto Maple Leafs and Los Angeles Kings br The five teams that cast a no ballot did so for different reasons The Bruins were not pleased with the prospect of sharing New England with the Whalers while the Canadiens were even less enamored with having to share the province of Quebec with the Nordiques The Canadiens Canucks and Maple Leafs disliked the idea of having to split Hockey Night in Canada revenues six ways rather than three while the Canucks and Kings feared the loss of dates with NHL teams from the east Maple Leafs owner Ballard had a personal grudge as well he had never forgiven the WHA for plundering his roster in the early s br The Canadiens were owned by Molson Brewery and when news emerged that the Canadiens had voted against the deal fans in Edmonton Winnipeg and Quebec City organized a boycott of Molson products believing that Molson was standing in the way of their cities remaining big league hockey towns The boycott quickly spread nationwide It caused a drain on the Canucks revenue as well since Pacific Coliseum sold Molson products The House of Commons of Canada weighed in as well unanimously passing a motion urging the NHL to reconsider A second vote was held in Chicago on March which passed by a margin as both Montreal and Vancouver reversed their positions Both teams hands were forced by the boycott and the Canucks were also won over by the promise of a balanced schedule with each team playing the others twice at home and twice on the road br The agreement resulted in the Oilers Whalers Nordiques and Jets joining the NHL for the NHL season increasing the league s membership to teams The NHL however insisted on treating the WHA teams arrival as an expansion not a merger The WHA teams each had to pay a million franchise fee for the right to enter the NHL and were responsible for indemnifying the Stingers and Bulls However since this was nominally the same fee paid by all of the other teams that joined the NHL in the s a decade of high inflation even with the indemnities the financial terms of the agreement were nominally favorable to the WHA Although some of the teams that joined earlier in the decade received concessions on their fees even after compensating Cincinnati and Birmingham the incoming teams paid less than half the million a Calgary based group headed by Skalbania would pay for the Atlanta Flames just one year later br The four surviving WHA teams paid the Stingers and Bulls million apiece in parachute payments Cincinnati and Birmingham and joined the Central Hockey League the league owned minor league for one season each The Stingers folded after games the Bulls played two full seasons before folding Major pro hockey has yet to return to Cincinnati or Birmingham though the NHL did place teams in the nearby markets of Columbus and Nashville in the late s br The rest of the agreement was slanted heavily in the NHL s favour The NHL held a reclamation draft for the established clubs in which nearly all of the players who had bolted from the NHL and were still active in the WHA saw their rights revert to their NHL clubs without compensation The WHA clubs were thus stripped of nearly all of their players for all intents and purposes they were effectively dissolved and had to rebuild their rosters from scratch In one of the few concessions to the WHA teams however they were allowed to protect two goalies and two skaters Some less formal exceptions were also made in particular for aging players hockey legends Gordie Howe and Dave Keon of the Whalers were allowed to remain with the Whalers rather than report to the Red Wings and Maple Leafs respectively while Bobby Hull was allowed to remain with the Jets rather than report to the Black Hawks Hull would later be traded from the Jets to the Whalers and play on the same line as Howe and Keon during the season br Even more controversial was the NHL s insistence that the four new teams be placed at the bottom of the order for the NHL Entry Draft Historically the NHL slots expansion teams at or near the top in an entry draft In what was not a complete coincidence the NHL also lowered the draft age to nineteen effectively doubling the size and depth of the talent pool in the draft Ostensibly this was done in exchange for the Oilers being allowed to retain Gretzky as a priority selection which unexpectedly became an issue after Gretzky made it clear he was not interested in voiding his personal services contract only to return to the junior ranks or join the floundering Colorado Rockies who would have presumably drafted Gretzky with the first overall pick had they been given the opportunity Gretzky was still only eighteen years old at the time but was allowed to join the NHL with the Oilers on account of his professional experience As a player joining from another professional league Gretzky was deemed ineligible for the league s Calder Memorial Trophy awarded each year to the league s top rookie br The former WHA teams were restocked via the NHL Expansion Draft with the established NHL teams receiving per player taken in that draft This compensation however formed part of the former WHA teams million franchise fees Additionally a good number of players on the list were either retired or of little value years later Oilers general manager coach Glen Sather said that the WHA teams knew this but went along only because they had to participate br As the league considered the agreement to be an expansion as opposed to a merger it refused to recognize WHA records The four new NHL franchises were regarded as new entities not as continuations of the former WHA franchises From the NHL s perspective the admission of former WHA organizations was no different than earlier enfranchisements involving cities with existing minor league organizations that were absorbed by incoming NHL franchises for example the purchase of the Vancouver Canucks of the Western Hockey League by the NHL Canucks in br The Canadian teams were permitted to operate under their established names colors logos and front office personnel To appease and satisfy the Bruins however the NHL insisted that the Whalers drop New England from their name and they entered the league as the Hartford Whalers instead The NHL continues to recognize all four franchises as having been founded on June which is also the date the WHA and its six remaining teams are reckoned to have formally ceased to exist br br br Aftermath br The NHL had originally intended to place its four newest franchises in each of its four divisions then called the Adams Norris Patrick and Smythe but the Oilers and Jets lobbied to be placed in the same division as the Canucks The league agreed although its decision to play a balanced league wide schedule rendered the divisional alignment irrelevant for the next two seasons Nevertheless the divisions were formally retained br Although the WHA clubs had performed quite well against their NHL rivals in inter league exhibition games of such games played the WHA won lost and tied they were nevertheless expected to struggle on the ice after joining the NHL due to the purging of their rosters However the NHL also expanded the Stanley Cup playoffs from teams to which allowed the Whalers and Oilers to qualify for the playoffs in their first NHL seasons both teams were swept in the first round The following year the Oilers stunned NHL loyalists when they swept the heavily favoured Canadiens in the first round br The addition of three new NHL teams in Canada led the league to reconsider other Canadian cities it had previously rejected placing franchises in One year after the expansion the Atlanta Flames relocated to Calgary becoming archrivals of the Oilers in the process br The final chapter of the expansion arguably took place in when Bill Hunter the original owner of the WHA Oilers reached an agreement with St Louis Blues owners Ralston Purina to purchase the Blues and relocate the team to his hometown of Saskatoon Saskatchewan Despite obtaining more than commitments for season tickets this bid met with universal hostility from NHL owners Although Hunter insisted such a franchise would be viable on the basis of being supported by the whole province similar to the Saskatchewan Roughriders football team Saskatoon itself was only a fraction of the size of any other NHL city The owners of the Oilers Flames and Jets were particularly opposed since Saskatchewan had become an important secondary market for all of them in terms of television revenues merchandise sales and even gate receipts although they were more reluctant than other owners to say so publicly so as not to alienate those same fans The Nordiques were still owned by Carling O Keefe which at the time owned a brewery in Saskatoon and also kept silent to avoid triggering a like boycott As this was occurring the final installments of the expansion fees were coming due To minimize public support for the bid Ziegler arranged to defer receipt of the fees from the Canadian teams until after the Board of Governors vote ostensibly making the Oilers Jets and Nordiques ineligible to vote on Hunter s bid so that they did not have to make their position officially known on a bid they privately opposed The Canadiens seeing no point in provoking another boycott by opposing a doomed bid voted in favour as did the Flames for a total of three votes in favour including the Blues against opposed including the Whalers Eventually a bidder willing to keep the team in St Louis and save them from contraction took over the team br In the NHL added an expansion franchise in Ottawa The league however rejected a bid to expand to Hamilton A bid from Saskatoon during this round of expansion was withdrawn before the final decision was made br br br Legacy br In its seven seasons the WHA paid its players million and lost over million The competition for talent introduced by the WHA and accelerated by the signing of Bobby Hull led to a rapid escalation of salaries for players in both leagues For the first time hockey players had meaningful leverage in contract negotiations Moreover in its search for talent the WHA turned to the previously overlooked European market signing players from Finland and Sweden Anders Hedberg Lars Erik Sj berg and Ulf Nilsson signed with the Jets in and thrived in North America both in the WHA and later the NHL The Jets won three of the six remaining WHA playoff championships after signing European players and their success sparked similar signings league wide Many of these players went on to NHL careers br Of the teams that joined the NHL in only the Edmonton Oilers remain in their original city today The other three franchises all moved and acquired new names within a three years of each other in the s the Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche in and won the Stanley Cup in their first season in Denver the Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes in a move which remains the only occasion since that the NHL has placed a team in a formerly active WHA city that did not previously host an NHL team and the Whalers became the Carolina Hurricanes in The Oilers nearly followed the other three teams south the following year after financially strapped owner Peter Pocklington received an offer from a buyer in Houston itself not only a former WHA city but one which was widely expected to keep the team s nickname due to Houston s well established history with it However a local ownership group was able to keep the team in Edmonton The Oilers were eventually acquired by Edmonton based billionaire Daryl Katz who became sole owner of the franchise in In the Oilers opened their new arena Rogers Place replacing Northlands Coliseum which had been their home since br Of the three cities to have lost their WHA NHL teams only Winnipeg has received one back when the Atlanta Thrashers relocated there in The Oilers are the only WHA team to win the Stanley Cup while in their WHA city which they have done on five occasions and The Avalanche won the Stanley Cup in their first season after leaving Quebec City and have since won Cup championships in and The Hurricanes won their only Stanley Cup in their ninth season after leaving Hartford The Jets Coyotes franchise has never appeared in the Stanley Cup Finals and has advanced to the second playoff round only three times and as the Jets and as the Coyotes and the conference final once br Notwithstanding the NHL s non recognition of WHA records all four surviving WHA teams subsequently retired at least one jersey number in recognition of on ice endeavors achieved exclusively or primarily in the WHA The three teams that re located in the s took different approaches with respect to the retired numbers both Colorado and Carolina disclaimed their teams pre relocation histories in both the WHA and NHL and re entered all previously retired numbers into circulation regardless of league although notably the Hurricanes have never issued the worn by Gordie Howe and retired by the Whalers The Coyotes previously decided to hang all previously retired Jets numbers in the rafters including notably the of Bobby Hull notwithstanding the fact Hull only played games for the Jets in their first NHL season the last of his career In doing so the Coyotes implicitly recognized the Winnipeg Jets entire history from to as their own The Coyotes later temporarily un retired so Hull s son Brett could wear it for the final five games of his NHL career By the time the NHL returned to Winnipeg the league had taken over the Coyotes following bankruptcy and had even entertained an offer from the eventual Thrashers purchasers to return the Coyotes to Manitoba The league therefore had to decide whether to allow the former Thrashers to reclaim the Jets name and history In the end the NHL decided to allow Winnipeg to reclaim its former name but not its pre history The pre Jets history therefore remained with the Arizona franchise while the Winnipeg franchise retained the Thrashers history aside from Gretzky s number that was retired league wide in the Thrashers did not officially retire any numbers while in Atlanta though they did remove from circulation following the death of Dan Snyder The number with Snyder s family s blessing returned to circulation in with Connor Hellebuyck currently wearing the number The new Jets immediately and controversially recognized the league s decision by issuing to Evander Kane who had worn the same number with the Thrashers In after the Coyotes changed their geographical identifier from Phoenix to Arizona they returned all of the numbers retired from the original Jets era to circulation reclassifying them as honoured numbers on the Arizona Coyotes Ring of Honor As for the modern day Jets they likewise honoured players from the original Jets via the Winnipeg Jets Hall of Fame despite the latter s history belonging to the Coyotes br On April the Arizona Coyotes suspended operations as a franchise with a majority of the team s assets sold to new ownership and relocated to Utah to stock the Utah NHL team Under the terms of the agreement with Coyotes owner Alex Meruelo if a new arena considered suitable for the NHL is built within five years the franchise may be reactivated br br br See also
