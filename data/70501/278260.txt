The National Hockey League All Star Game French Match des toiles de la Ligue nationale de hockey is an exhibition ice hockey tournament that is traditionally held during the regular season of the National Hockey League NHL with many of the League s star players playing against each other The game s proceeds benefit the pension fund of the players and the winning team is awarded towards a charity of their choice br The NHL All Star Game held in late January or early February marks the symbolic halfway point in the regular season though not the mathematical halfway point which for most seasons is usually one or two weeks earlier Between and it was held in late January After skipping due to the COVID pandemic the to editions were held on the first Saturday of February br br br Formats br From to the All Star Game primarily saw the previous season s Stanley Cup champions take on a team of All Stars from the other clubs There were two exceptions during this period The and games instead featured two teams of All Star players one consisting of players on American based teams and the other with players on Canadian based teams br Beginning in the format was geographic with the Wales Eastern Conference All Stars playing the Campbell Western Conference All Stars with the first team or starting line including the starting goaltender voted in by fans while the remainder of the teams rosters are chosen by the NHL s Hockey Operations Department in consultation with the teams general managers Since the head coaches for the two All Star teams have been the coaches of the two teams that are leading their respective conferences in point percentage i e fraction of points obtained out of total possible points Previously the two head coaches that appeared in the previous year s Stanley Cup Finals coached the All Star teams br The All Star Game was held in the same year as the Winter Olympics allowing the NHL to show off its players from all over the world For this event the NHL had the All Star teams consist of a team of North Americans playing against a team of stars from the rest of the world The North America vs World All Star format lasted through the Game the same year as the Winter Olympics before reverting to the Eastern vs Western Conference format in br During the season the NHL announced a change to the way the teams were selected modeled after drafts in fantasy sports The conference vs conference i e East vs West approach was replaced by a player draft conducted by the All Star players themselves to determine the rosters for each team The captains for each team now select players from a combined pool of both fan balloting and the NHL Hockey Operations Department The change in format was a joint effort by the League and the National Hockey League Players Association NHLPA This format lasted through the game br On November the NHL announced significant changes to the All Star Game format starting with the game instead of one game featuring two teams there are four All Star teams based on the league s four divisions competing in a single elimination tournament The format of all three games in the tournament is three on three with minute halves each If a tie remains after minutes then it directly goes to a three round shootout plus extra rounds as needed to determine the winner there is no standard overtime The winners of the two semifinal games then meet in an All Star Game Final In the format was slightly changed the division that wins the NHL All Star Skills Competition during the previous night then gets to pick which team they will play first in the semifinals br On November the NHL announced that it would be combining the four team three on three format with the fantasy draft used in the previous system The league selected the captains for each of the four teams from a combined pool of both fan balloting and the NHL Hockey Operations Department and the players then conducted a draft to determine the rosters for each team br br br Skills Competition br The All Star Game is preceded by the NHL All Star Skills Competition a competition showing the various talents of both the all stars Beginning in the All Star weekend also featured the NHL YoungStars Game an exhibition game exclusively featuring rookies playing under slightly modified rules In this game was eliminated in favor of having the rookies compete in the skills competition br br br History br br br Benefit games br The first official All Star Game was held during the NHL season Prior to that there have been several occasions when benefit games and All Star Games were played br br br Hod Stuart Benefit All Star Game br br The first All Star game in ice hockey predates the NHL It was played on January before fans at the Montreal Arena between the Montreal Wanderers and a team of All Stars players from the teams the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association It was held in memory of Wanderers player Hod Stuart who had drowned three months after the Wanderers won the Stanley Cup in The proceeds of that game over went to Stuart s family br br br Ace Bailey Benefit Game br br On December Toronto s King Clancy tripped Boston s Eddie Shore and in retaliation Shore hit the Leafs Ace Bailey from behind flipping him over backwards Bailey hit his head on the ice so hard that a priest in attendance gave him last rites Bailey lived for almost more years but his playing career was over Shore was suspended for games of a game season for the hit br As a benefit for Bailey and his family the NHL held its first ever All Star game on February The game was held at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto during which Bailey s uniform was retired by the Leafs It was the first number to be retired in the NHL The game saw the Leafs battle against an All Star team made of players from the other seven teams which the Leafs won One of the more memorable moments before the game was when Bailey presented Shore with his All Star jersey showing to the public that Bailey had clearly forgiven him for his actions Bailey also presented a trophy to NHL President Frank Calder before the game in the hope that the trophy would go to the winner of an annual All Star Game for the benefit of injured players br br br Howie Morenz Memorial Game br br Howie Morenz was one of the NHL s superstars of the s However his career and eventually life ended in a game between his Montreal Canadiens and the Chicago Black Hawks on January at the Montreal Forum In that game Morenz was checked by Chicago player Earl Seibert into the boards in what seemed like a normal hit However as the boards were made of wood at the time Morenz s leg shattered in five separate locations above the ankle He was carried off the ice on a stretcher to a hospital where he would stay for four and a half weeks until his death from a heart attack At one time one visitor noted that it was as if a party was being held inside of Morenz s hospital room complete with whiskey and beer Morenz died on March the same year from as teammate Aurele Joliat put it a broken heart Morenz suffered a heart attack the night before Morenz s sweater which had been hanging in its usual stall while he was in hospital was finally retired for good br While Morenz was in the hospital plans for a game for Morenz s benefit were already under way However the game was not as successful as Bailey s game partially because it took place many months after Morenz s passing on November at the Forum and partially because Morenz had not survived The game saw two All Star teams the first being a team of stars from the Canadiens and the Montreal Maroons the second being an All Star team made of players from the other teams with the latter team winning br br br Babe Siebert Memorial Game br On August Babe Siebert a Montreal Canadien who had just retired from play and had been named head coach drowned in Lake Huron To benefit his family the Canadiens and Montreal Maroons organized a benefit held on October at the Montreal Forum Six thousand fans attended a game between the Canadiens and the NHL All Stars raising CA CA in dollars for Siebert s family The All Stars won the game br br br Official games br Despite Bailey s hopes of an annual All Star Game it did not become an annual tradition until the NHL season In the All Star Game was moved from the start of the season to its current position in the middle of the season In the Challenge Cup series replaced the game and in it was replaced with Rendez vous Lockouts disrupted the NHL season in and and resulted in the cancellation of the game in those years COVID led to the cancelation of the game As part of the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement CBA that expired in and was later renewed the NHL agreed with the NHLPA not to hold an All Star Game during Winter Olympic years that they participated in consequently the contest was cancelled in and In however the contest was still played as NHL players did not participate in that year s Winter Olympics and in the contest was still played with players originally going to the Winter Olympics after but ultimately did not due to COVID postponing many games br br br s br br Both parts of Bailey s vision would however come true The first game of the annual tradition and the first official NHL All Star Game would be played in Maple Leaf Gardens on October The format of the All Star Game which remained the same with two exceptions until the NHL season called for the defending Stanley Cup champions to play against a selection of players from the other five teams For the first year the All Stars were a team composed of the First and Second NHL All Star teams not to be confused with the All Stars that played against the Cup champions as well as three players from the New York Rangers and one player each from the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Black Hawks br For the game the Gardens facilities were upgraded to use glass on the boards in an era where wire fences were the norm a point that fans complained about as the sounds of the checks were somewhat muted In what would be another tradition the defending Stanley Cup champions were presented before the game with various gifts that included sweater coats golf balls cigarette boxes ties cufflinks pocket knives watches and lifetime passes to Maple Leaf Gardens All in all the game was a success with the All Stars winning br Although the All Star Game called for the defending Cup champion to host it the game was held in Chicago Stadium in its second year as a consequence of the negotiations that set up the first game Also as a peculiarity as a result of the scheduling the game was held not before the season started as was the case before and would be for almost years following the game but three weeks into the season Like the year before players from the First and Second NHL All Star teams were automatically awarded spots on the All Star Game rosters an exception was Leafs goaltender Turk Broda having won the Cup played for the Leafs instead with the rest of the all stars being assembled so that each team was represented with at least three players on the All Stars As for the game itself the All Stars had won with all scoring coming in the second period br br br s br The defending Stanley Cup champions would win their first All Star Game in by a margin thanks to Detroit s Production Line and the fact that five of the First and Second NHL All Star teams were Red Wings Because of the one sidedness of the game many fans and hockey insiders considered options on how to make the All Star Game more balanced including one where the All Star Game was eliminated altogether in favour of a best of nine Stanley Cup Finals with the proceeds of two of the games going to the players pension fund and one which saw a Canadian Teams vs American Teams format a somewhat flawed concept in that nearly all NHL players of the era whether playing for teams representing American or Canadian cities were Canadians Ultimately the th NHL All Star Game saw the First NHL All Star team battle the Second with the players filling out the First team being from American teams and the Second team being filled with either Hab or Leaf players The game ended in a tie leaving many fans upset for the second straight year The same format of First vs Second with the First team being augmented by players from American teams and the Second being augmented by Leaf or Hab players continued the next year but the th All Star Game proved to be minutes of boring hockey as the teams skated to a tie br Criticisms of this new format as well as the boring hockey was what made the NHL revert the format of the All Star Game to its original incarnation Some of the criticisms included the fact that teammates often opposed each other in the All Star Game under the new format and some stated that the early date of the game was detrimental to the exposure of the NHL in the States being held at the same time as the World Series and the National Football League NFL season In what would be later a reality Toronto Star columnist Red Burnett suggested that the game should be played mid season and that fans should choose their starting lineup a system which had long been in use in the States with regard to Major League Baseball MLB br br br s br The game was moved from the start of the season to mid season in the season as part of the move to promote the NHL to six new cities who would have their own teams in October Because of the move to mid season the method of player selection for the All Stars largely unchanged for years was much scrutinized as playing the All Star Game mid season meant that the first and second All Star teams were decided almost a full year before the game itself and that by mid season the Cup winners were a vastly different team from the team that had won the Cup some eight or nine months before The mid season move also meant that rookies with outstanding first years such as Bobby Orr would be shut out of the game even if they deserved a spot on the All Stars br The st All Star Game one year later was somber compared to the before it as the days before the game were tragic On January two days before the game Bill Masterton had been checked by two Oakland Seals players and died from his on ice injuries The game itself was overshadowed by the debate on whether helmets should be worn in the NHL in the fallout of Masterton s untimely death As in the previous years the All Stars were represented by the first and second All Star teams as well as enough players so that each team was represented The East West format of future All Star Games was announced in the st All Star Game with the intention of being able to move the game anywhere alternating home ice between an East division team and a West division team year after year The idea along with the notion that the players chosen for the two All Star teams should be the best at the time of the game rather than the best of the players from the season before quickly gained popularity although the Cup champions reserved the right to host the nd All Star Game The St Louis Blues became the first Western host of the All Star Game the following year The th All Star Game was the first in which the game MVP received a car as a prize br br br s br With the realignment of the NHL into four divisions for the season the All Star Game was the first to pit the Wales Conference against the Campbell Conference br In amidst renewed interest in international hockey the NHL decided to replace the All Star Game with a three game series where the League s top players played against the Soviet Union s top players in the Challenge Cup held at Madison Square Garden in New York City br The Challenge Cup was being touted as a miniature world championship and for the first time fans could vote for certain members of the roster The NHL would lose the three game series two games to one with the third game being lost by an embarrassing margin br Over the next few years various aspects of the All Star Game came under scrutiny including the format of the game To make things worse the All Star Game itself was viewed in some circles as a bad thing with players opting out of the game in favour of the rest and prospective hosts repeatedly declining to host the event br br br s br With the geographical realignment of the NHL for the season the All Star Game was the first between the Wales and Campbell Conferences that featured players from eastern teams against players from western teams br The th All Star Game in marked the first time that honorary captains were selected for each team The game also brought forth the notion of fan balloting of the starting lineup already adopted in the National Basketball Association and by this time had returned following a hiatus brought on by ballot box stuffing to MLB the NFL gave the fans the vote in the s as the game was suffering from having little media coverage The idea came into fruition the following year br In the All Star Game was pre empted in favour of Rendez vous held at Le Colis e in Quebec City Like the Challenge Cup before it Rendez Vous was an event where the best the NHL could offer played against a Soviet squad which had an entire year to prepare To reduce the possibility of the NHL being embarrassed again Rendez Vous was a two game affair The series was split between the two teams with a game won by each br During the series NHL President John Ziegler stated that Soviet players would never be able to join the NHL because of the way the Soviet hockey programme worked and that NHLers would never be able to play in the Winter Olympics Soviet players would be allowed to play in the NHL within three years and an arrangement that would allow NHL players to play in the Olympics was announced within nine br br br s br The st All Star Game in was held on a Sunday after having been held on Tuesdays since That edition the NHL All Star Skills Competition and the Heroes of Hockey game were both introduced The Heroes of Hockey game featured NHL alumni and was set up much like the main game with Wales vs Campbell Many of these players retired before the introduction of the Wales and Campbell Conferences Future Heroes of Hockey games would have the hometown alumni play against the best of the rest much like the all star games of old The nd All Star Game introduced as part of the player selection two players chosen by the commissioner to honour their years to their game br With the renaming of conferences and divisions on a geographical basis for the season the All Star Game was the first between East and West in name since although the Wales vs Campbell format pitted east against west from to br The All Star Game in was a casualty of the NHL lockout which shortened that season to just regular season games San Jose the originally scheduled venue was instead awarded the All Star Game In the interim Boston hosted the All Star Game at the newly opened FleetCenter br The All Star Game featured the first change in format in years in an attempt to promote the first Olympic hockey tournament with participation from NHL players The First International Showdown as it was billed resulted in the North American All Stars winning br br br s br The Game s format was reverted to its classic East vs West format Dany Heatley scored four goals tying an All Star Game record in addition to recording a shootout goal Heatley also set the record for being the youngest player to score a hat trick in the All Star Game a record previously held by the Edmonton Oilers Wayne Gretzky This shootout the first of its kind in the NHL in the modern era received an enthusiastic frenzied response from the crowd when it was announced and carried on during the event This was influential in the later decision to decide regular season games tied after overtime with a shootout thus eliminating tie games br The All Star Game was dealt two serious blows in Not only was the game canceled along with the rest of the season as a result of the NHL lockout but the subsequent CBA that ended the lockout stipulated that heretofore the game was to be held only in non Olympic years Thus there was no All Star Game held during the season either br After a two season absence the Game was played in Dallas where the West defeated the East Daniel Briere of the Buffalo Sabres recorded a goal and four assists and was named the game s MVP br The Atlanta Thrashers hosted the Game as they had been originally scheduled to host the canceled Game in The Eastern Conference won the game on a late game winning goal by Marc Savard with seconds remaining in the third period beating St Louis Blues goaltender Manny Legace Eric Staal was named the MVP br In the Bell Centre the home of the Montreal Canadiens hosted the Game as well as the NHL Entry Draft In the game the Eastern Conference defeated the Western Conference in a shootout east west Approximately people attended the game where then Canadien Alexei Kovalev was the Eastern Conference captain and was named the game s MVP after scoring two goals and one assist as well as the shootout winner Montreal fans voted Kovalev into the starting lineup in addition to teammates Andrei Markov Carey Price and Mike Komisarek The Canadiens were picked to host both events because the Montreal Canadiens team celebrated its th anniversary in The team was established in as a founding member of the National Hockey Association NHA which became the NHL in br A small number of All Star players questioned their potential participation in Past and current All Stars must obtain an excused absence often related to injury or personal circumstances by the League if they will not participate If this approved absence is not obtained a one game regular season suspension is possible br br br s br There was no All Star Game in because of both a change to the CBA and being an Olympic Games year the Winter Olympics marked the first time that the Olympics had been hosted in an NHL market since the league allowed its players to compete in the Olympics br The All Star Game was played in Raleigh North Carolina home of the Carolina Hurricanes Gary Bettman announced at the RBC Center on April that the game would be held in Raleigh The Phoenix Coyotes were originally slated to host the game that year in replacement of the Game which they had again originally been awarded before the NHL ultimately decided not to hold the game the Olympic year Amid fears that the Coyotes franchise would not right its ship by February however the cities of Pittsburgh Raleigh and Ottawa rose as candidates for the Game with Raleigh eventually being chosen having been promised the game since the Hurricanes reached season ticket sales earlier in the decade The Game also introduced a new format replacing the traditional conference teams with a fantasy draft Fans voted for six players from either conference three forwards two defencemen and one goaltender while the NHL selected another players for a total of players The chosen players then selected two captains for each All Star team who then selected their teammates in a draft The chosen captains for the Game were Nicklas Lidstrom of Detroit and Eric Staal of Carolina br The Game repeated the fantasy draft format with Daniel Alfredsson and Zdeno Chara as captains The game was played in Ottawa to honor the th anniversary of the Senators joining the NHL br The All Star Game was originally scheduled for January at Nationwide Arena in Columbus the home of the Columbus Blue Jackets The game was postponed to however first due to the NHL lockout which delayed the start of the season until January followed by the inability to play in due to it falling on an Olympic Games year where NHL players competed at the Winter Olympics The game was eventually played on January br The All Star Game was played on January at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville the home of Nashville Predators The format was changed so that it was no longer a singular all star game per se instead four all star teams each representing one of the league s four divisions participate in a two round knockout tournament with each game being two minute halves in length and played with three skaters on each team In addition each division is required to select at least one player from all eight of its teams prior to the Central and Pacific Divisions only had seven teams both added an eighth team as of unlike in previous years where some teams were not represented in recent All Star Games The game was also notable for the appearance of John Scott a journeyman enforcer who was voted into the game through the fan vote Scott who had been demoted to the American Hockey League after the vote played as a member of no team and as captain of the Pacific Division scored two goals after scoring none the entire regular season up to that point and won the game s Most Valuable Player award br The All Star Game was played on January at Staples Center in Los Angeles to honour of the Kings th anniversary The All Star Game was then played on January at Amalie Arena in Tampa the second time the Tampa Bay Lightning have hosted the All Star Game the first being in and the third overall in Florida br The All Star Game was hosted by the San Jose Sharks at SAP Center on January the first time it was held on a Saturday after many years of the game being played on a Sunday br br br s br The All Star Game was hosted by the St Louis Blues at Enterprise Center on January The city last hosted the All Star Game in February br Originally the All Star Game would be hosted by the Florida Panthers at BB T Center on January which would have been its first All Star Game hosted since February However due to the COVID pandemic delaying the conclusion of the season to September and postponing the start of the following season the event was canceled with the possibility of moving the festivities to at its earliest The league said that it would consider changing the upcoming All Star Game s format so it would have a distinct international flavor using a model similar to the World Cup of Hockey br On June the league announced that the All Star Game would be played at T Mobile Arena in Paradise Nevada home of the Vegas Golden Knights for the first time The league cited the fact that they had not yet signed a deal with the International Olympic Committee on sending players to the Winter Olympics so they decided to schedule an All Star Game anyway at an arena in western North America to shorten travel to China if players did go On September a deal was officially reached to send players to the Olympics with an opt out clause should COVID health conditions worsen However on December the NHL announced that it would not send its players to the Olympics due to rising COVID cases and increasing number of postponed games Consequently the originally scheduled Olympic break following the All Star Game from February to was used to play postponed games br On February the NHL awarded Sunrise Florida the All Star Game two years after Sunrise s game was cancelled due to the pandemic br The All Star Game took place on February at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto The format was changed combining the four team three on three format used since with the fantasy draft format used from to In addition to player captains Quinn Hughes Nathan MacKinnon Auston Matthews and Connor
