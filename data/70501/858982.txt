The NHL entry draft French Rep chage d entr e dans la LNH is an annual meeting in which every franchise of the National Hockey League NHL systematically select the rights to available ice hockey players who meet draft eligibility requirements North American players years old and European international players years old all others enter the league as unrestricted free agents The NHL entry draft is held once every year generally within two to three months after the conclusion of the previous regular season During the draft teams take turns selecting amateur players from junior or collegiate leagues and professional players from European leagues br The first draft was held in and has been held every year since The NHL entry draft was known as the NHL amateur draft until The entry draft has only been a public event since and a televised event since br Up to the order was solely determined by the standings at the end of the regular season In the NHL draft lottery was introduced where only teams who had missed the playoffs could participate The lottery winner moved up the draft order a maximum of four places meaning only the five worst teams based on regular season points in a given season could pick first in the draft and no team in the non playoff group could move down more than one place The chances of winning the lottery were weighted towards the teams at the bottom of the regular season standings From to there was no limit of moving up in the draft order so the lottery winner would automatically receive the first overall pick and any teams above it in the draft order would still move down one spot From to there were three lottery winners that received the top three picks and any teams above it in the draft order would move down no more than three spots In the lottery system was changed to include two lottery winners and they received the top two overall picks and any teams above it in the draft order would move down no more than two spots br Beginning in the two lottery winners are limited to move up no more than ten places in the draft order meaning that only the bottom eleven teams based on regular season points could win first pick in the draft If a team outside the bottom eleven teams wins the first draft lottery they move up ten spots e g fourteenth team wins the lottery and moves up to fourth overall and lowest finishing team from the previous season is then awarded the first overall selection br br br History br The first NHL entry draft at that time known as the NHL amateur draft was held on June at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal Quebec In NHL president Clarence Campbell and Canadian Amateur Hockey Association CAHA president Fred Page announced a new tentative five year agreement on August with several proposed changes to the existing system effective July The direct sponsorship of junior teams by the NHL was to be phased out in the upcoming year and no new sponsored players could be registered or be required to sign a contract restricting movement between teams The agreement eliminated the A B and C forms which had angered the parents of amateur players and were the source of legal action threats when the professional team refused to release a player Junior aged players became eligible for the draft once they graduate from junior hockey or to be signed as a free agent in the year the player reaches his th birthday The NHL agreed to pay development fees to the CAHA for the drafted players The new agreement came at a time that also leveled the playing field for new NHL clubs in the NHL expansion br The NHL briefly changed the drafting age from years old to year olds in to compete with the new WHA which was allowing teams to sign underage junior players The year old rule returned for the draft br In the rules were changed allowing players who had previously played professionally to be drafted This rule change was made to facilitate the absorption of players from the defunct World Hockey Association Consequently the name of the draft was changed from NHL amateur draft to NHL entry draft The draft age was also dropped to include year old underage players In the age was dropped further to so that any player who is between the ages of and is eligible to be drafted In addition any non North American player over the age of can be selected From through and year old players could only be drafted in the first three rounds unless they met another criterion of experience which required them to have played in major junior U S college and high school or European hockey br In the entry draft became a public event and was held at the Montreal Forum Prior to that year the entry draft was conducted in Montreal hotels or league offices and was closed to the general public The first draft outside of Montreal was held at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre in Toronto Ontario in Live television coverage of the draft began in when the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation covered the event in both English and French for Canadian audiences The entry draft held at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit Michigan was the first NHL draft to be held in the United States SportsChannel America began covering the event in the United States in br Prior to the development of the draft NHL teams sponsored junior teams and signed prospects in their teens to the junior teams Players were signed to one of three forms the A form which committed a player to a tryout a B form which gave the team an option to sign a player in return for a bonus and the C form which committed a player s professional rights The C form could only be signed by the player at age eighteen or by the player s parents often in exchange for some signing bonus The first drafts up until the amateur draft were held to assign players who had not signed with an NHL organization before the sponsorship of junior teams was discontinued after br In October owners approved a proposal to switch the NHL Draft to a decentralized model in line with that of the NBA and NFL drafts in which only prospects and team representatives will be present in person at the Draft venue and business would be conducted remotely from the teams front offices These changes are scheduled to take effect in br br br Selection order and draft lottery br The selection order in the NHL entry draft is determined by a combination of lottery regular season standing and playoff results While teams are permitted to trade draft picks both during the draft and prior to it sometimes several years prior in all cases the selection order of the draft picks is based on the original holder of the pick not a team which may have acquired the pick via a trade or other means The order of picks discussed in this section always references the original team br The basic order of the NHL entry draft is determined based on the standings of the teams in the previous season As with the other major sports leagues the basic draft order is intended to favour the teams with the weakest performance who presumably need the most improvement in their roster to compete with the other teams Subject to the results of the NHL draft lottery discussed below the teams pick in the same order each round with each team getting one pick per round br The basic order of the picks is determined as follows br br The teams that did not qualify for the playoffs the previous season picks br The teams that made the playoffs in the previous season but did not win either their division in the regular season or play in the Conference Finals picks up to br The teams that won their divisions in the previous season but did not play in the Conference Finals potentially picks br The teams that lose in Conference Finals picks and br The team that was the runner up in the Stanley Cup Finals pick br The team that won the Stanley Cup in the previous season pick br The number of teams in the second and third group depends on whether the Conference finalists also won their division The teams in each group other than the Stanley Cup winner and runner up are ordered within that group based on their point totals in the preceding regular season with the lowest point total picking first Tie breakers are governed by the same rules used to determine ties in the regular season standings The order of picks may change during the first round of the draft based on the results of the NHL draft lottery In the subsequent rounds the basic order based on point totals is used br When teams lose their rights to a first round draft choice because that player was not signed to a contract and consequently re entered the entry draft or became an unrestricted free agent they are awarded a compensatory draft pick This selection will be the same numerical choice as the first round draft pick who was not signed but in the second round For example if a team cannot sign the seventh overall first round draft choice it will receive the seventh pick in the second round of the next draft as compensation br br br Draft lottery br At the conclusion of the regular season the teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round The teams are seeded in the basic draft order based on their regular season point totals The odds of winning the lottery are weighted on a descending scale that gives the greatest chance of winning to the team with the lowest point total and the worst chance to the team with the highest point total br The prize for winning the draft lottery is to be upgraded to the highest eligible pick in the first round of the draft with each team that preceded the winner in the basic draft order bumped one pick lower For example if the team with the th worst point total wins the lottery it would pick first and the teams with the worst through th worst records would pick second through fifth The remaining teams would be unaffected The teams would return to the basic order for the second and all subsequent rounds br From its inception through there was one winner of the lottery from to the team that won the draft lottery moved up no more than four positions in the draft order If the winner of the lottery was among the five worst teams in a given season that team won the first pick in the draft Otherwise the team will move up no more than four spots and that team will not receive the first pick in the draft from to the lottery winner received the first pick overall regardless of regular season point totals amongst the non playoff teams Beginning with the draft and lasting until the draft the first three selections were determined by the lottery Any team that did not make the playoffs had a weighted chance to be selected in the first second or third slot Beginning in only two draws will be held for the first two selections Starting with the lottery the teams winning one of the two lotteries will only be allowed to move up a maximum of ten spots in the draft order and teams will only be allowed to advance in the draft order because of winning a lottery twice in five years The remaining teams maintains their order of selection based on the points accrued the previous season As the lottery determines the top two slots no team can drop more than two places from the position established based on previous season point totals br The NHL draft lottery takes place just before or during the Stanley Cup playoffs and is hosted at the NHL Network s studios in Secaucus New Jersey from onwards The draft lottery previously took place at Sportsnet s studios in Toronto from to and at TSN s studios in Toronto from to br The odds for the first overall pick are determined as follows br br br Eligible
