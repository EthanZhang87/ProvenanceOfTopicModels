Millionaires formed by Frank and Lester Patrick Established in the Millionaires were one of three teams in the new Pacific Coast Hockey Association To accommodate the Millionaires the Patrick brothers directed the building of the Denman Arena which was known at the time as the world s largest artificial ice rink The arena was later destroyed in a fire in The Millionaires played for the Stanley Cup five times winning over the Ottawa Senators in on home ice It marked the first time the Stanley Cup was won by a West Coast team in the trophy s history Absorbed by the Western Canada Hockey League in

known as the Vancouver Canucks played from to in the Pacific Coast Hockey League and the Western Hockey League br br br NHL application br With the intention of attracting an NHL franchise Vancouver began the construction of a new modern arena the Pacific Coliseum in with the arena opening in January The WHL s Canucks were playing in a small arena at the time the Vancouver Forum situated on the same Pacific National Exhibition grounds as the Coliseum Meanwhile a Vancouver group led by WHL Canucks owner and former Vancouver mayor Fred Hume made a bid to be one of the six teams due to join the league in but the NHL rejected their application Bid leader Cyrus McLean called the denial a cooked up deal referring to several biases that factored against them Speculation long abounded afterwards that the bid was hindered by Toronto Maple Leafs president Stafford Smythe after a failed Vancouver based business deal he was quoted as saying that the city would not get an NHL franchise in his lifetime Additionally along with the Montreal Canadiens Smythe purportedly did not wish to split Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC hockey revenues three ways rather than two br Less than a year later the Oakland Seals were in financial difficulty and having trouble drawing fans An apparent deal was in place to move the team to Vancouver but the NHL did not want to see one of their franchises from the expansion of move so quickly and vetoed the deal In exchange for avoiding a lawsuit the NHL promised Vancouver would get a team in the next expansion round Another group headed by Minnesota entrepreneur Tom Scallen made a new presentation and was awarded an expansion franchise for the price of million three times the cost in The new ownership group purchased the WHL Canucks and brought the team into the league with the Buffalo Sabres as expansion teams for the season br In preparation for joining the NHL the WHL Canucks had brought in players with prior NHL experience Six of these players John Arbour George Gardner Len Lunde Marc Reaume Ted Taylor and Murray Hall would remain with the club for its inaugural NHL season The rest of the roster was built through an expansion draft br br br Early years br To fill the Canucks roster for their inaugural season the league held an Expansion Draft in the preceding summer A draft lottery was held on June determining who between the Canucks and Sabres would get the first selection in the Expansion Draft as well as the NHL Amateur Draft the Sabres won both spins With his first selection in the Expansion Draft Canucks General Manager Bud Poile chose defenceman Gary Doak Among the other players chosen by Vancouver were centre Orland Kurtenbach who was named the Canucks first captain as well as defenceman Pat Quinn who later became the team s general manager and coach in the s Two days later on June the Canucks made defenceman Dale Tallon their first ever Amateur Draft selection Tallon played three seasons with the club before being traded away to the Chicago Black Hawks By comparison the Sabres chose centre Gilbert Perreault with the first overall selection they won from the lottery Perreault went on to become a nine time All Star and member of the Hockey Hall of Fame br br With the Canucks roster set the team played its inaugural game against the Los Angeles Kings on October They lost the contest defenceman Barry Wilkins scored the Canucks lone goal in the game and first in franchise history a backhander against goaltender Denis DeJordy Two days later the squad recorded the first win in franchise history a victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs br The Canucks struggled in their early years failing to make the playoffs in their first four seasons Placed in the competitive East Division Poile assembled a core of players during this period led by Kurtenbach that included defencemen Tallon and Jocelyn Guevremont as well as wingers Andre Boudrias and Dennis Ververgaert Boudrias emerged as the team s leading point scorer in four of their first five seasons br Prior to the season Scallen and his ownership group from Minnesota sold the team to local media mogul Frank Griffiths for million Also in the summer of the Canucks were re aligned within the league and placed in the new Smythe Division They responded with their first winning record wins losses and ties backstopped by goaltender Gary Suitcase Smith finishing first in the Division with points Making their debut in the Stanley Cup playoffs the Canucks lost the opening series of the playoffs in five games to the Montreal Canadiens Head coach and general manager Phil Maloney the third GM in team history after Poile and Hal Laycoe recalled the importance of a successful season for the Canucks in that year specifically as the rival league World Hockey Association WHA had established another major professional team in the city the Vancouver Blazers Competing for the same hockey market the Canucks emerged over the Blazers as the latter relocated to Calgary Alberta the following season The Canucks posted a second consecutive winning record and made the playoffs in but lost to the New York Islanders in a two game preliminary series It would be another years until the team would have another winning record though they made the playoffs nine times in that span br Kurtenbach retired and assumed a coaching position with Vancouver His departure as a player marked the beginning of a seven year period in which the Canucks had four different captains Boudrias Chris Oddleifson Don Lever and Kevin McCarthy Following the season Maloney was replaced as general manager by Jake Milford who acquired such players as Stan Smyl Thomas Gradin Darcy Rota Ivan Boldirev and Richard Brodeur a core that would lead the team throughout the s br br br Stanley Cup run br br The Canucks made their first significant playoff impact in the playoffs In their previous five playoff appearances the team had failed to win a single series Though the Canucks finished three games under a win percentage in the regular season they began gaining momentum by finishing the campaign on a nine game unbeaten streak Meanwhile Smyl emerged as the club s leader replacing McCarthy as the captain after the latter was sidelined with an injury late in the season he would retain that position for a team record eight years Continuing their success in the playoffs the Canucks made the Stanley Cup Finals with a combined record in series against the Calgary Flames Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Black Hawks Despite having a losing regular season record Vancouver had a home ice advantage in the first series having finished second in the Smythe Division to the Edmonton Oilers The Canucks also had a home ice advantage during the second round series against the Kings who upset the Oilers in the first round br Late in Game of the Conference Finals in Chicago Vancouver Interim Head Coach Roger Neilson frustrated with what he felt was the poor officiating in the game placed a white towel on the end of a hockey stick and held it up in a gesture mocking surrender waving the white flag The players on the Canucks bench followed suit When the series shifted to Vancouver for the next two games the team s fans cheered them on by waving white towels above their heads The habit stuck becoming an original Canuck fan tradition now seen across the league and in other sports known as Towel Power The Canucks proceeded to win the series in five games making it to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in their history br Entering the Finals against the New York Islanders the Canucks were the first team from Western Canada to play for the Stanley Cup in years when the Victoria Cougars reached the Stanley Cup Finals It also marked the first ever coast to coast Stanley Cup Finals Competing against the Islanders the Stanley Cup champions of the previous two years who had finished with points more than Vancouver in the regular season standings Vancouver took the first game to overtime In the final minute of the extra period Canucks defenceman and fan favourite Harold Snepsts gave the puck away with an errant pass from behind his net leading to a Mike Bossy goal Like the first game the Canucks held a lead after the first two periods in the second game but were not able to keep their lead and lost The Canucks were unable to complete their Cinderella run and were swept losing their next two games by and scores The playoffs proved to be the last year in which Vancouver won a playoff series until br br br Decline br After their improbable Stanley Cup run the Canucks slipped back into mediocrity for the rest of the s making the playoffs only four times for the rest of the decade Notable players that joined the Canucks core following the playoffs included offensively skilled forwards Patrik Sundstrom and Tony Tanti Beginning in the Canucks scoring title was held by either Sundstrom or Tanti for four of the next five seasons the only season in which neither won the team scoring title was when it was won by Petri Skriko For most of the second half of the s the Canucks competed with the Los Angeles Kings for the final playoff spot in the Smythe Division In the years in which they qualified for the playoffs the team was eliminated in the first round by either the Edmonton Oilers in or the Calgary Flames in and the Flames championship season of which was decided in Game both division rivals br br Following Milford s tenure as general manager from to the position was held by Harry Neale for three years then Jack Gordon for two The latter was responsible for trading away power forward Cam Neely to the Boston Bruins in In addition to Neely the Canucks gave up their first round draft pick with which the Bruins chose Glen Wesley and in return acquired centre Barry Pederson While Pederson collected back to back point seasons with the Canucks in his first two seasons after the trade he was traded away to the Pittsburgh Penguins in as his performance quickly declined Neely went on to have a Hall of Fame career with the Bruins recording three goal seasons and Wesley had a solid year career br br br Pat Quinn era br After the installation of former Canucks defenceman Pat Quinn as general manager in the summer of the team underwent an immediate rebuilding process trading away core veterans for younger prospects and players Among the more key transactions was a deal with the New Jersey Devils in which Sundstrom was traded away in exchange for winger Greg Adams and goaltender Kirk McLean In addition to Quinn s trades the team improved through the draft route with two selections in particular With the second overall selection in the NHL Entry Draft the Canucks chose winger Trevor Linden from the Western Hockey League WHL The following year the team made a controversial selection by choosing Russian winger Pavel Bure th overall Bure was believed by most teams to be ineligible for selection that year Consequently his draft by the Canucks took a year to be verified by the league as team management went about procuring documents to prove his eligibility br As the decade turned a shift in the Canucks leadership occurred as Stan Smyl resigned his captaincy prior to the season due to a reduced on ice role with the team In his place the Canucks implemented a rotating captaincy of Linden Dan Quinn and Doug Lidster of the three Linden retained the captaincy thereafter becoming the youngest permanent captain in team history at years of age At the end of the season Smyl retired as the team s all time leader in games played goals assists and points Led by Linden and in large part to Quinn s dealings the Canucks rose to prominence in the early s This increased success came roughly around the time the Oilers and Flames began to sink in the standings As a result Vancouver won their first division title in years with wins losses and ties during the season it was also the team s first winning season since the season During the campaign the Canucks honoured Smyl who had remained on the team as an assistant coach by making him the first player in team history to have his jersey number retired In the playoffs the Canucks won their first series since before being eliminated by the Oilers in the second round Quinn and Bure became the first Canucks recipients of major NHL awards in the off season being awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach Quinn assumed a dual coaching and general managerial role starting that year and the top rookie in the league respectively The following year the Canucks repeated as regular season division champions while Bure emerged as arguably the team s first superstar with his first of back to back goal seasons totals which remain the highest recorded in Canucks history As the team struggled to score in the second half of the season Bure recorded goals in the club s final games and contributed to of his team s goals in the final games of the season to carry the Canucks into the postseason Jim Matheson of the Edmonton Journal called Bure the NHL s best forward the last games scoring almost a goal a game br br br Stanley Cup run br br In the Canucks made their second trip to the Stanley Cup Finals entering the playoffs as the seventh seed in the renamed Western Conference Despite underachieving in the regular season their points total decreased by from the previous year although they finished second in the newly renamed Pacific Division the Canucks played well in the playoffs and embarked on another unexpected run br Opening the playoffs with a close first round series against the Calgary Flames Vancouver rallied from a three games to one deficit to win the series in seven contests Games through were all won in overtime with goals from Geoff Courtnall Trevor Linden and Pavel Bure respectively The deciding seventh game featured two of the most recognizable and celebrated plays in Canucks history With the game tied in the first overtime goaltender Kirk McLean made what became known thereafter as The Save sliding across the crease feet first and stacking his pads on the goal line to stop Robert Reichel on a one timer pass from Theoren Fleury The following period Pavel Bure received a breakaway pass from defenceman Jeff Brown before deking Calgary goaltender Mike Vernon to score and win the series Fifteen years later Bure s goal and McLean s save were ranked first and second in a Vancouver Sun article listing the most memorable moments in team history br Following their victory over the Flames the Canucks then upset both the Dallas Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs both in five games en route to the franchise s second Stanley Cup Finals appearance Forward Greg Adams sent the Canucks into the Finals with a double overtime goal against Maple Leafs goaltender Felix Potvin in Game Staging the second coast to coast Finals in league history the Canucks were matched against the Presidents Trophy winning New York Rangers Vancouver achieved victory in Game by a score of in overtime largely due to a save performance by goaltender McLean After losing the next games the Canucks won the next two to force a seventh game at Madison Square Garden on June Despite a two goal effort one on a shorthanded breakaway from Linden who was playing with cracked ribs Vancouver lost the game by a score The Canucks efforts to tie the game included a post hit by forward Nathan LaFayette with just over a minute remaining in regulation The loss was followed by a riot in Downtown Vancouver which resulted in property damage injuries and arrests Two days after the riots the team held a rally at BC Place attended by fans who congratulated the team for their effort br With a young core that included Linden Bure and McLean still in their s after the playoffs the Canucks appeared poised to remain contenders in the league However the team failed to record a winning season in the six years following their Stanley Cup Finals appearance Prior to the lockout shortened season Quinn stepped down as head coach to focus on his managerial duties and was replaced by Rick Ley Vancouver finished with a record that year Their elimination from the Stanley Cup playoffs in Game of the second round marked the Canucks last game played at the Pacific Coliseum as the team moved into the new General Motors Place since renamed Rogers Arena a new million arena situated in Downtown Vancouver the following season br br The Canucks made another significant move in the off season by acquiring high scoring Russian forward Alexander Mogilny from the Buffalo Sabres reuniting Bure with his former CSKA Moscow and national team linemate While Mogilny became the second player in team history to record goals and points in a season chiefly playing with centre Cliff Ronning the expected chemistry between Mogilny and Bure never materialized with the latter suffering a season ending knee injury early in the campaign Vancouver finished two games below and were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the Colorado Avalanche The season also marked the arrival of another future Canucks superstar as Markus Naslund was acquired from the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Alek Stojanov The deal is regarded as one of the most lopsided trades in NHL history as Stojanov soon became a minor leaguer while Naslund became the team s all time leading goal and point scorer years later Despite a late season swoon Ley was fired and replaced by Quinn down the stretch The team limped into the playoffs losing to the Colorado Avalanche in the first round br In the off season Quinn hired Tom Renney whose tenure as the team s head coach lasted less than two seasons Despite strong performances from Mogilny and team leading point scorer Martin Gelinas in Bure and Linden s absence both of whom were injured for long periods of time during the season the Canucks missed the playoffs for the first of four consecutive seasons that year Making another high profile acquisition on July the Canucks signed free agent Mark Messier to a three year deal They had come close to signing Wayne Gretzky the previous summer but were reportedly spurned away when they refused to continue negotiations and gave Gretzky an ultimatum to sign br br br Keenan and Messier br br Heading into the season Linden resigned his captaincy for Messier who had developed a strong reputation as a leader having captained the New York Rangers over the Canucks in he also captained the Oilers to a Stanley Cup in Linden later recalled regretting the decision feeling that Messier generated hostility and tension in the dressing room Messier later said if he could change one thing about his time in Vancouver he would not have accepted the captaincy br The Canucks began the campaign overseas in a two game series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in Tokyo Japan It marked the first time in NHL history that a regular season game was held outside of North America an effort from the league to attract attention to the sport in anticipation of the Winter Olympics which were held in Nagano Japan As the team s performance continued to worsen starting the season with three wins in the first games Quinn was fired as general manager after ten years with the team Soon thereafter Renney was fired and replaced as coach by Mike Keenan reuniting him with Messier another central figure from the Rangers team Keenan s hiring reportedly exacerbated tensions between groups of Canucks players and his negative relationship with Linden was given ample media attention Two months into his tenure with the team his role was expanded and he was made de facto general manager With control of player personnel Keenan overhauled the roster making ten trades within two months most notably dealing Linden to the New York Islanders Although the trade was unpopular with fans the Canucks received winger Todd Bertuzzi in return who would later become an integral part of the team s return to success in the next decade Defenceman Bryan McCabe was also part of the deal who would eventually be involved in a key transaction in the NHL Entry Draft br br br Brian Burke era br br br West Coast Express years and the early years of the Sedins br After the Canucks finished the season last in the Western Conference former NHL Vice president Brian Burke was named general manager in the summer Suffering their worst season since the subsequent year Keenan was fired midway through and replaced with Marc Crawford who had won the Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche in Meanwhile Pavel Bure unhappy in Vancouver had withheld himself from the team and requested a trade at the beginning of the campaign By January he was dealt to the Florida Panthers in a seven player trade which saw eventual five time NHL All Star Ed Jovanovski heading west The trade also involved two draft picks Finishing last in the Western Conference for a second straight year Vancouver possessed the fourth overall pick in the NHL Entry Draft Set on drafting highly touted Swedish forwards Daniel and Henrik Sedin Burke orchestrated several transactions to move up to the second and third overall picks with which he chose both players br The Canucks began to show improvement in the season finishing four points out of a playoff spot During the campaign Mogilny was traded to the New Jersey Devils for forwards Denis Pederson and Brendan Morrison With Bure gone and Messier in the last year of his contract several previously under achieving players began developing into key contributors for the team most notably Markus Naslund and Todd Bertuzzi In the off season Messier left the team and returned to the Rangers during the team s September training camp held in Sweden Naslund was selected to replace Messier as captain a position he held for seven seasons As part of the team s stay in Sweden they played exhibition games against Swedish and Finnish teams as part of the NHL Challenge br Under the leadership of general manager Brian Burke and head coach Marc Crawford the Canucks once again became a playoff team After qualifying for the postseason in and as the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference losing to the eventual Stanley Cup winners Colorado Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings respectively the Canucks became regular contenders for the Northwest Division title br br Coinciding with the team s success in the early s was the rise of power forward Todd Bertuzzi and captain Markus Naslund into high scoring wingers and NHL All Stars Joined by centre Brendan Morrison during the season the trio were nicknamed the West Coast Express after the Vancouver rail service of the same name among Canucks fans and media Over the next three years Naslund ranked in the top five among league scorers and was a Lester B Pearson Award winner and Hart Memorial Trophy finalist in Bertuzzi was also a top five scorer in the league in and During this span Burke made a trade with the Washington Capitals to facilitate the return of Trevor Linden The ex captain returned to a markedly different Canucks team with a young core consisting of the aforementioned trio defencemen Ed Jovanovski and Mattias Ohlund as well as goaltender Dan Cloutier br In the Canucks set a franchise record with a game win streak but lost the division title to the Colorado Avalanche on the last day of the regular season Individually Naslund was surpassed the same night by Avalanche forwards Peter Forsberg and Milan Hejduk for the Art Ross Trophy and Maurice Rocket Richard Trophy respectively Entering the playoffs with the fourth seed in the Western Conference the Canucks won their first playoff series in eight years defeating the St Louis Blues in seven games before losing to the Minnesota Wild in the second round In both series they were comebacks the Canucks rallied to beat the Blues but lost their own lead to the Wild who had also come back from a deficit in the first round against the Avalanche br Amidst a run for the team s first Northwest Division title the following season the Canucks received significant media attention for their involvement in a violent on ice attack during a game against the Avalanche On March Bertuzzi grabbed Avalanche forward Steve Moore from behind and punched him in the head As Moore fell to the ice Bertuzzi landed on top of him Moore suffered three fractured neck vertebrae facial cuts and a concussion The incident was in retaliation of a hit that Moore landed on Naslund during a previous game between the two teams For his actions Bertuzzi was suspended by the NHL and International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF through to the start of the season He also faced legal action in British Columbia court while Moore filed lawsuits against him and the Canucks organization in Colorado and Ontario courts br The Canucks went on to win their first Northwest Division title that season but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Calgary Flames After their elimination Burke s contract as general manager was not renewed and he was replaced by assistant general manager and director of hockey operations Dave Nonis At years old he became the youngest general manager in team history Due to the NHL lockout the season was not played Several Canucks players went overseas to Europe to play professionally including Naslund and the Sedin twins who all returned to their former Swedish team Modo Hockey br br br Dave Nonis era br Upon the resolution of the labour dispute between NHL players and owners new gameplay rules were set in place for the season that were intended to benefit skilled players and generate more goal scoring As the Canucks basis of success in previous seasons was built on playing a fast paced high scoring style of play expectations for the team were high going into the season However the team failed to qualify for the playoffs completing the regular season ninth place in the conference The first line of Naslund Bertuzzi and Morrison suffered offensively as all three players recorded decreased points totals Head Coach Marc Crawford later recalled the campaign as a turning point for the team s offensive leadership as the Sedin twins began their rise to stardom matching the top line
