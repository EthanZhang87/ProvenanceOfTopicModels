Ferrari S p A Italian fer ra ri is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello Founded in by Enzo Ferrari the company built its first car in adopted its current name in and began to produce its current line of road cars in Ferrari became a public company in and from to it was a subsidiary of Fiat S p A It was spun off from Fiat s successor entity Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in In the Wall Street Journal described the company as having been synonymous with opulence meticulous craftsmanship and ridiculously fast cars for nearly a century br The company currently offers a large model range which includes several supercars grand tourers and one SUV Many early Ferraris dating to the s and s count among the most expensive cars ever sold at auction Owing to a combination of its cars enthusiast culture and successful licensing deals in Ferrari was labelled the world s strongest brand by the financial consultancy Brand Finance As of May Ferrari is also one of the largest car manufacturers by market capitalisation with a value of approximately US billion br Throughout its history the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing especially in Formula One where its team Scuderia Ferrari is the series single oldest and most successful Scuderia Ferrari has raced since first in Grand Prix events and later in Formula One where since it has fielded fifteen champion drivers won sixteen Constructors Championships and accumulated more race victories finishes podiums pole positions fastest laps and points than any other team in F history Historically Ferrari was also highly active in sports car racing where its cars took many wins in races such as the Mille Miglia Targa Florio and Hours of Le Mans as well as several overall victories in the World Sportscar Championship Scuderia Ferrari fans commonly called tifosi are known for their passion and loyalty to the team br br br History br br br Early history br br Enzo Ferrari formerly a salesman and racing driver for Alfa Romeo founded Scuderia Ferrari a racing team in Originally intended to service gentleman drivers and other amateur racers Alfa Romeo s withdrawal from racing in combined with Enzo s connections within the company turned Scuderia Ferrari into its unofficial representative on the track Alfa Romeo supplied racing cars to Ferrari who eventually amassed some of the best drivers of the s and won many races before the team s liquidation in br Late in Scuderia Ferrari was liquidated and absorbed into Alfa Romeo but Enzo s disagreements with upper management caused him to leave in He used his settlement to found his own company where he intended to produce his own cars He called the company Auto Avio Costruzioni and headquartered it in the facilities of the old Scuderia Ferrari due to a noncompete agreement with Alfa Romeo the company could not use the Ferrari name for another four years The company produced a single car the Auto Avio Costruzioni which participated in only one race before the outbreak of World War II During the war Enzo s company produced aircraft engines and machine tools for the Italian military the contracts for these goods were lucrative and provided the new company with a great deal of capital In under threat of Allied bombing raids the company s factory was moved to Maranello Though the new facility was nonetheless bombed twice Ferrari remains in Maranello to this day br br br Under Enzo Ferrari br br In Ferrari adopted its current name Work started promptly on a new V engine that would power the S which was the marque s first car and many subsequent Ferraris The company saw success in motorsport almost as soon as it began racing the S won many races in and several early victories including the Hours of Le Mans and Carrera Panamericana helped build Ferrari s reputation as a high quality automaker Ferrari won several more races in the coming years and early in the s its road cars were already a favourite of the international elite Ferrari produced many families of interrelated cars including the America Monza and series and the company s first series produced car was the GT Coup beginning in br In Ferrari was reorganized as a public company It soon began searching for a business partner to handle its manufacturing operations it first approached Ford in though negotiations fell through later talks with Fiat who bought of Ferrari s shares in were more successful In the second half of the decade Ferrari also produced two cars that upended its more traditional models the Dino GT which was its first mass produced mid engined road car and the GTB which possessed streamlined styling that modernised Ferrari s design language The Dino in particular was a decisive movement away from the company s conservative engineering approach where every road going Ferrari featured a V engine placed in the front of the car and it presaged Ferrari s full embrace of mid engine architecture as well as V and V engines in the s and s br br br Contemporary br Enzo Ferrari died in an event that saw Fiat expand its stake to The last car that he personally approved the F expanded on the flagship supercar approach first tried by the GTO four years earlier Enzo was replaced in by Luca Cordero di Montezemolo under whose year long chairmanship the company greatly expanded Between and he increased the profitability of Ferrari s road cars nearly tenfold both by increasing the range of cars offered and through limiting the total number produced Montezemolo s chairmanship also saw an expansion in licensing deals a drastic improvement in Ferrari s Formula One performance not least through the hiring of Michael Schumacher and Jean Todt and the production of three more flagship cars the F the Enzo and the LaFerrari In addition to his leadership of Ferrari Montezemolo was also the chairman of Fiat proper between and br After Montezemolo resigned he was replaced in quick succession by many new chairmen and CEOs He was succeeded first by Sergio Marchionne who would oversee Ferrari s initial public offering and subsequent spin off from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and then by Louis Camilleri as CEO and John Elkann as chairman Beginning in Camilleri was replaced as CEO by Benedetto Vigna who has announced plans to develop Ferrari s first fully electric model During this period Ferrari has expanded its production owing to a global increase in wealth while becoming more selective with its licensing deals br br br Motorsport br br Since the company s beginnings Ferrari has been involved in motorsport Through its works team Scuderia Ferrari it has competed in a range of categories including Formula One and sports car racing though the company has also worked in partnership with other teams br br br Grand Prix and Formula One racing br br The earliest Ferrari entity Scuderia Ferrari was created in ten years before the founding of Ferrari proper as a Grand Prix racing team It was affiliated with automaker Alfa Romeo for whom Enzo had worked in the s Alfa Romeo supplied racing cars to Ferrari which the team then tuned and adjusted to their desired specifications Scuderia Ferrari was highly successful in the s between and the team fielded such top drivers as Antonio Ascari Giuseppe Campari and Tazio Nuvolari and won out of its races br Ferrari returned to Grand Prix racing in which was at that point metamorphosing into modern day Formula One The team s first homebuilt Grand Prix car the F was first raced at the Italian Grand Prix where its encouraging performance convinced Enzo to continue the company s costly Grand Prix racing programme Ferrari s first victory in an F series was at the British Grand Prix heralding its strong performance during the s and early s between and the team took home six World Drivers Championships and one Constructors Championship Notable Ferrari drivers from this era include Alberto Ascari Juan Manuel Fangio Phil Hill and John Surtees br Ferrari s initial fortunes ran dry after and its began to receive its titles in isolated sprees Ferrari first started to slip in the late s when it was outclassed by teams using the inexpensive well engineered Cosworth DFV engine The team s performance improved markedly in the mid s thanks to Niki Lauda whose skill behind the wheel granted Ferrari a drivers title in and similar success was accomplished in following years by the likes of Jody Scheckter and Gilles Villeneuve The team also won the Constructors Championship in and br Following another drought in the s and s Ferrari saw a long winning streak in the s largely through the work of Michael Schumacher After signing onto the team in Schumacher gave Ferrari five consecutive drivers titles between and this was accompanied by six consecutive constructors titles beginning in Ferrari was especially dominant in the season where it lost only three races After Schumacher s departure Ferrari won one more drivers title given in to Kimi R ikk nen and two constructors titles in and These are the team s most recent titles to date as of late Ferrari has struggled to outdo recently ascendant teams such as Red Bull and Mercedes Benz br br br Ferrari Driver Academy br br Ferrari s junior driver programme is the Ferrari Driver Academy Begun in the initiative follows the team s successful grooming of Felipe Massa between and Drivers who are accepted into the Academy learn the rules and history of formula racing as they compete with Ferrari s support in feeder classes such as Formula Three and Formula As of out of programme inductees had graduated and become F drivers one of these drivers Charles Leclerc came to race for Scuderia Ferrari while the other four signed to other teams Non graduate drivers have participated in racing development filled consultant roles or left the Academy to continue racing in lower tier formulae br br br Sports car racing br br Aside from an abortive effort in Ferrari began racing sports cars in when the S won six out of the ten races it participated in Ferrari continued to see similar luck in the years to follow by just ten years after beginning to compete Ferrari had won three World Sportscar Championships seven victories in the Mille Miglia and two victories at the Hours of Le Mans among many other races These races were ideal environments for the development and promotion of Ferrari s earlier road cars which were broadly similar to their racing counterparts br This luck continued into the first half of the s when Ferrari won the WSC s GT class three consecutive times and finished first at Le Mans for six consecutive years Its winning streak at Le Mans was broken by Ford in and though Ferrari would win two more WSC titles one in and another in poor revenue allocation combined with languishing performance in Formula One led the company to cease competing in sports car events in From that point onward Ferrari would help prepare sports racing cars for privateer teams but would not race them itself br In Ferrari reentered sports car racing For the FIA World Endurance Championship Ferrari in partnership with AF Corse fielded two P sports prototypes To commemorate the company s return to the discipline one of the cars was numbered referencing the fifty years that had elapsed since a works Ferrari competed in an endurance race The P finished first at the Hours of Le Mans ending Toyota Gazoo Racing s six year winning streak there and becoming the first Ferrari in years to win the race br br br Other disciplines br From to Scuderia Ferrari operated a motorcycle racing division which was conceived as a way to scout and train future Grand Prix drivers Instead of Italian motorcycles the team used British ones manufactured by Norton and Rudge Though Ferrari was successful on two wheels winning three national titles and overall victories it was eventually pushed out of the discipline both by the obsolescence of pushrod motorcycle engines and broader economic troubles stemming from the Great Depression br Ferrari formerly participated in a variety of non F open wheel series As early as Ferrari had developed cars for Formula Two and Formula Libre events and the company s F programme led directly to the creation of the Dino engine which came to power various racing and road Ferraris The final non F formula in which Ferrari competed was the Tasman Series wherein Chris Amon won the championship in a Dino Tasmania br At least two water speed record boats have utilized Ferrari powertrains both of them kg class hydroplanes from the early s Neither boat was built by or affiliated with Ferrari though one of them Arno XI had its engine order approved directly by Enzo Ferrari Arno XI still holds the top speed record for an kg hydroplane br br br Race cars for other teams br br Throughout its history Ferrari has supplied racing cars to other entrants aside from its own works Scuderia Ferrari team In the s and s Ferrari supplied Formula One cars to a number of private entrants and other teams One famous example was Tony Vandervell s team which raced the Thinwall Special modified Ferraris before building their own Vanwall cars The North American Racing Team s entries in the final three rounds of the season were the last occasions on which a team other than Scuderia Ferrari entered a World Championship Grand Prix with a Ferrari car br Ferrari supplied cars complete with V engines for the A Grand Prix series from the season The car was designed by Rory Byrne and is styled to resemble the Ferrari Formula one car Ferrari currently runs a customer GT program for a racing version of its and has done so for the s predecessors dating back to the in the late s Such private teams as the American Risi Competizione and Italian AF Corse teams have been very successful with Ferrari GT racers over the years This car made for endurance sportscar racing to compete against such racing versions of the Audi R McLaren MP C and BMW Z E has proven to be successful but not as successful as its predecessor the F The Ferrari Challenge is a one make racing series for the Ferrari The FXX is not road legal and is therefore only used for track events br br br Road cars br br The first vehicle made with the Ferrari name was the S Only two of this small two seat sports racing V car were made In the Inter was introduced marking the company s significant move into the grand touring road car market The first Inter was a four seat berlinetta coupe with body work designed by Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera Road cars quickly became the bulk of Ferrari sales The early Ferrari road cars typically featured bodywork designed and customised by independent coachbuilders such as Vignale Touring Ghia Pininfarina Scaglietti and Bertone br The original Ferrari road cars were typically two seat front engined V s This platform served Ferrari well through the s and s In the V powered Dino GT was introduced as the first production rear mid engined car built by Ferrari The GT was sold under the lower cost Dino marque named after Enzo Ferrari s late son and sold in greater numbers than any previous Ferrari model The first rear mid engine model to be sold under the Ferrari name came in with the flat powered Berlinetta Boxer This rear mid engine layout would go on to be used in many Ferraris continuing into the present day Current Ferrari road cars typically use V or V engines with V models making up over half of the marque s total production br For a time Ferrari built versions of its mid engined V cars Although they looked quite different from their seat counterparts both the GT and Mondial were closely related to the GTB br The company has also produced several front engined cars culminating in the recent V model Lusso and V models Roma Portofino and Lusso T The California is credited with initiating the popular current model line of V front engined grand touring performance sports cars br Starting in the early s with the LaFerrari Ferrari shifted its focus away from using independent coachbuilders most notably Pininfarina to instead relying on in house design from the Centro Stile Ferrari for the design of all its road cars The Ferrari F was the last Ferrari production model to feature Pininfarina design although Ferrari has stated that they will continue to collaborate with Pininfarina on special projects br The Ferrari SF Stradale is the first ever Ferrari to feature PHEV Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle architecture which sees the internal combustion engine integrated with three electric motors two of which are independent and located on the front axle with the third at the rear between the engine and the gearbox br br br Current models br br br Customisation br In the s and s clients often personalized their vehicles as they came straight from the factory This philosophy added to the mystique of the brand at the time Every Ferrari that came out of Maranello could be built to an individual customer s specification br Ferrari formalized this concept with its earlier Carrozzeria Scaglietti programme The options offered here were more typical such as racing seats rearview cameras and other special trim In late Ferrari announced a significant update of this philosophy The Tailor Made programme allows clients to work with designers in Maranello to make decisions at every step of the process Through this program almost any trim any exterior colour or any interior material is possible The program carries on the original tradition and emphasizes the idea of each car being unique br br br Big supercars br br The GTO is considered by some to be the first in the line of Ferrari flagship supercars This pedigree is considered to extend through the F F Enzo Ferrari and the LaFerrari These are sometimes referred to by collectors as the Big br br br Concept cars and specials br br Ferrari has produced a handful of concept cars such as the Modulo Mythos and Pinin Some of these were quite radical and never intended for production while others showed styling elements that were later incorporated into production models Most of Ferrari s concept cars have been collaborations with design studio Pininfarina The most recent concept car to be produced by Ferrari themselves was the Millechili br A number of one off special versions of Ferrari road cars have also been produced commissioned to coachbuilders by wealthy owners Examples include the P and the Kappa br br br Ferrari Special Projects br The Special Projects programme also called the Portfolio Coachbuilding Programme was launched in as a way to revive the tradition of past one off and limited production coachbuilt Ferrari models allowing clients to work with Ferrari and top Italian coachbuilders to create bespoke bodied models based on modern Ferrari road cars Engineering and design is done by Ferrari sometimes in cooperation with external design houses such as Pininfarina or Fioravanti and the vehicles receive full homologation to be road legal Since the creation of Ferrari s in house styling centre in though the focus has shifted away somewhat from outside coachbuilders and more towards creating new in house designs for clients br The first car to be completed under this programme was the SP commissioned by a Japanese business executive The second was the P Superfast Aperta commissioned by an American collector The following is a list of Special Projects cars that have been made public br br br Bio fuel and hybrid cars br An F Spider that runs on ethanol was displayed at the Detroit Auto Show At the Geneva Motor Show Ferrari unveiled a hybrid version of their flagship Called the HY KERS Concept Ferrari s hybrid system adds more than horsepower on top of the Fiorano s hp Also in mid the flagship LaFerrari was put into production featuring a hybrid system Ferrari introduced their first plug in hybrid PHEV model in with the SF Stradale followed by the in br br br Naming conventions br From the beginning the Ferrari naming convention consisted of a three digit unitary displacement of an engine cylinder with an additional suffix representing the purpose of a vehicle Therefore Ferrari S had L cc V engine with a unitary displacement of cc whilst S suffix represented Sport Other race cars also received names invoking particular races such as Ferrari MM for Mille Miglia With the introduction of road going models the suffix Inter was added inspired by the Scuderia Inter racing team of Igor Troubetzkoy Popular at that time series had L cc engines with cc of unitary displacement and a very diverse series had L cc of total displacement and cc of unitary Later series of road cars were renamed Europa and top of the line series America and Superamerica br Until the early s Ferrari followed a three number naming scheme based on engine displacement and a number of cylinders br br V and V models used the total displacement in decilitres for the first two digits and the number of cylinders as the third Thus the was a L V powered vehicle while the used a L V although for the F the last digit refers to valves per cylinder Upon introduction of the Modena the digits for V models which now carried a name as well as a number refer only to total engine displacement The numerical indication aspect of this name carried on to the F the F s replacement the Italia uses the same naming as the and The uses the system formerly used by the V cars br V models used the displacement in cubic centimetres of one cylinder Therefore the famed Daytona had a cc cu in V However some newer V engined Ferraris such as the have three number designations that refer only to total engine displacement or boxer style designations such as the nominally six litre V br Flat models used the displacement in litres for the first digit and the number of cylinders for the next two digits Therefore the BB was five litre flat a Berlinetta Boxer in this case However the original Berlinetta Boxer was the GT BB which was named in a similar manner to the V models br Flagship models aka halo cars use the letter F followed by the anniversary in years such as the F and F The Enzo skipped this rule although the F name was applied to a Ferrari Formula One car and is sometimes attached to the Enzo br Some models such as the Mondial and Testarossa did not follow a three number naming scheme br br Most Ferraris were also given designations referring to their body style In general the following conventions were used br br M Modificata placed at the end of a model s number denotes a modified version of its predecessor and not a complete evolution see F M and M Maranello br GTB Gran Turismo Berlinetta models are closed Berlinettas or coup s br GTS Gran Turismo Scoperta this suffix can be seen in older spiders or convertibles see GTS Now the convertible models use the suffix Spider spelt i see F Spider and Spider In more recent models this suffix is used for targa top models see Dino GTS and F GTS which is an absolutely correct use of the suffix since scoperta means uncovered An increasing number of people tend to refer to GTS as Gran Turismo Spyder which creates the false assumption that Ferrari does not know the difference between spyder and targa The TS which is the only targa named differently is an exception br GTO Gran Turismo Omologata placed at the end of a model s number denotes a modified version of its predecessor It designates a model that has been designed and improved for racetrack use while still being street legal Only three models bear those three letters the GTO of the GTO of and the GTO of br This naming system can be confusing as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style Many Ferraris also had other names affixed such as Daytona to identify them further Many such names are actually not official factory names The Daytona name commemorates Ferrari s triple success in the February Hours of Daytona with the P Only in the Daytona Hours a GTB run by NART who raced Ferraris in America ran second behind a Porsche br The various Dino models were named for Enzo s son Dino Ferrari and were marketed as Dinos by Ferrari and sold at Ferrari dealers for all intents and purposes they are Ferraris br In the mid s Ferrari added the letter F to the beginning of all models a practice abandoned after the F M and F but adopted again with the F but not with its successor the Ferrari br br br Identity br br br The Prancing Horse br br Ferrari s symbol is the Prancing Horse Italian Cavallino Rampante lit little prancing horse a prancing black horse on a yellow background Minor details of its appearance have changed many times but its shape has remained consistent it is always presented either as a shield with the Italian tricolour above the horse and the initials SF Scuderia Ferrari below or as a rectangle replacing SF with the word Ferrari rendered in the company s trademark typeface br Enzo Ferrari offered an account of the horse s origins In his story after a victory in Ravenna the family of Francesco Baracca a deceased flying ace who painted the emblem on his airplane paid him a visit Paolina de Biancoli Francesco s mother suggested that Ferrari adopt the horse as a good luck charm he accepted the request and the Prancing Horse was first used by his racing team in applied to their Alfa Romeo C with the addition of a canary yellow background the colour of Modena Enzo s hometown The rectangular Prancing Horse has been used since when the Ferrari S also the first Ferrari branded sports car became the first to wear it br br br Colour br br For many years rosso corsa racing red was the required colour of all Italian racing cars It is also closely associated with Ferrari even after livery regulations changed allowing race teams to deviate from their national colours Scuderia Ferrari continued to paint its cars bright red as it does to this day On Ferrari s road going cars the colour has always been among the company s most popular choices in per cent of Ferraris left the factory painted red while in the early s the figure was even higher at per cent Some Ferrari vehicles such as the GTO have only been made available in red br Although rosso corsa is the colour most associated with Ferrari it has not always been the colour of choice Ferraris raced by privateers have run in a rainbow of colours and one GT SWB used as a test mule for the GTO was a rare non red factory backed car it raced in blue br In a particularly noteworthy case from while protesting the FIA s homologation requirements the company moved its racing assets to the North American Racing Team an affiliated team based in the United States As a result Ferrari and the driver John Surtees won the Formula One season in American colours blue with a white racing stripe By the early s red had also become less common on Ferrari s road cars fighting with newly popular colours such as yellow silver and white br Speaking to both the popularity of rosso corsa and the power of the Ferrari brand Enzo Ferrari is reported to have once said the following Ask a child to draw a car and he will certainly paint it red br br br Brand image br Ferrari meticulously manages its brand image and public perception it goes to great lengths to protect its trademarks and its customers are expected to honour its rules and guidelines when caring for their cars The company is noted for its frequent and diverse lawsuits which have centred around such subjects as the shape of the Ferrari GTO s bodywork exclusive rights to model names including Testarossa and Purosangue replica vehicles and several unsanctioned owner modifications Via a bounty system individuals may receive rewards for reporting counterfeit Ferrari products to the company br br Ferrari aims to cultivate an image of exclusivity and refined luxury To facilitate this vehicle production is deliberately limited to below customer demand and purchasers are internally ranked based on their desirability and loyalty Some cars may only be purchased by customers who have already owned multiple Ferraris and the company s most exclusive supercars such as the LaFerrari have wait lists many times in excess of total production with only the most loyal customers selected to purchase one In the company s head of sales stated that the purpose of this strategy was to maintain the brand s value and to keep alive this dream that is called Ferrari br Sometimes Ferrari s desire to maintain its brand perception goes against the wishes of its clientele In one case the company sued the fashion designer Philipp Plein over distasteful Instagram posts featuring his personal Superfast The posts which showcased two models in suggestive positions atop the car were seen by Ferrari as unlawfully appropriating the Ferrari brand to promote Plein s clothing and as being outside Ferrari s intended brand perception Furthermore the company places restrictions on what owners may do with their cars they are not allowed to undertake certain modifications and the company s right of first refusal contract designed to discourage speculation and flipping prohibits unauthorised sales within the first two years of ownership Purchasers who break these rules are placed on a blacklist and may not be permitted to buy a Ferrari vehicle through official means These owner restrictions came to high profile in when the musician Deadmau was sent a cease and desist letter regarding his highly customised Italia the car which he dubbed the Purrari possessed custom badges and a Nyan Cat themed wrap and was put up for sale on Craigslist br Ferrari does encourage its buyers to personalise their cars but only through official channels which include its Tailor Made programme for bespoke trim packages and special coachbuilding initiatives for more demanding commissions The customisation options offered through these channels are extensive though they are always in line with Ferrari s desired branding for example the company offers no pink paint for its cars In the CEO of the company s Australasia branch commented that this and similar customisations are against the company s ethos and that such a stance is a brand rule No pink No Pok mon Ferraris br br br Corporate affairs br In Enzo Ferrari was approached by the Ford Motor Company about a possible buy out Ford audited Ferrari s assets but legal negotiations and talks were unilaterally cut off by Ferrari when he realized that the deal offered by Ford would not enable him to stay at the helm of the company racing program Henry Ford II consequently directed his racing division to negotiate with Lotus Lola and Cooper to build a car capable of beating Ferrari on the world endurance circuit eventually resulting in the production of the Ford GT in br As the Ford deal fell through FIAT approached Ferrari with a more flexible proposal and purchased controlling interests in the company in Enzo Ferrari retained a share which is currently owned by his son Piero Lardi Ferrari br Ferrari has an internally managed merchandising line that licences many products bearing the Ferrari brand including eyewear pens pencils electronic goods perfume cologne clothing high tech bicycles watches cell phones and laptop computers br Ferrari also runs a museum the Museo Ferrari in Maranello which displays road and race cars and other items from the company s history br br br Formula Uomo programme br In Ferrari launched a long term master planned effort to improve overall corporate efficiency production and employee happiness The program was called Formula Uomo and became a case study in social sustainability It took over ten years to fully implement and included over million in investment br br br Technical partnerships br Ferrari has had a long standing relationship with petroleum company Shell Oil from the late s to the early s and currently since Shell develops and supplies fuel and oils to the Scuderia Ferrari s Formula One and World Endurance Championship teams as well as Ducati Corse s MotoGP and World Superbike teams The Shell V Power premium gasoline fuel is claimed to have been developed with the many years of technical expertise between Shell and Ferrari br Ferrari has had agreements to supply Formula One engines to a number of other teams over the years and currently supply the Sauber and Haas F F teams br br br Sales history br As of the end of the total of Ferrari built and sold cars in their whole company history is br In October Ferrari started accepting payment in cryptocurrency for its vehicles in the US with intentions to expand the scheme to Europe in The cryptocurrency payments will be immediately traded into traditional currency to avoid price swings br br Annual Ferrari sales to end customers number of type approved vehicles br br

for passenger airbags due to the Takata airbag recalls If the inflator explodes the airbag will spew metal shrapnel at passengers which can cause severe injury Every car involved will get a new passenger side airbag assembly complete with a new inflator without the dangerous propellant br On August the company recalled almost every car it s sold in the US since over a potential for brake failure According to an NHTSA recall filing Ferrari models sold in America are fitted with a potentially faulty brake fluid reservoir cap that may not vent pressure adequately The affected cars will be fitted with a replacement cap and receive a software update br br br Stores and attractions br Roughly thirty Ferrari boutiques exist worldwide with two owned by Ferrari and the rest operating as
