title: 1967 NHL expansion
id: 30871687
The National Hockey League NHL expansion added six new franchises for the season doubling the size of the league to teams It was the largest expansion undertaken at one time by an established major sports league and the first change in the composition of the NHL since ending the era of the Original Six br The six new teams were the Los Angeles Kings Minnesota North Stars Oakland Seals Philadelphia Flyers Pittsburgh Penguins and St Louis Blues This expansion including placing two new clubs on the West Coast was the result of the league s fears of a rival league that would challenge the NHL for players and the Stanley Cup In addition the league hoped that the expansion would result in a lucrative TV contract in the United States br The Seals later renamed the California Golden Seals and then the Cleveland Barons are the only team from the expansion to cease operations and not reach the Stanley Cup The Blues Flyers Kings and Penguins continue to operate in their home cities while the North Stars relocated to Dallas Texas and became the Dallas Stars All active teams have won the Stanley Cup at least once with the Penguins holding the most Cup titles among the expansion franchises at five br br br Background br br In the aftermath of the shakeout caused by the Depression and World War II in which the National Hockey League contracted from ten teams to the so called Original Six clubs Boston Bruins Montreal Canadiens Toronto Maple Leafs New York Rangers Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Black Hawks the NHL became immensely profitable Professional sports teams of the era were primarily gate driven enterprises however attendances consistently rose after the end of the war With arenas that generally held around spectators in this era selling out with increasing frequency the league expanded the schedule from the wartime games to games by the s Meanwhile owners aggressively kept costs especially player salaries as low as possible and ruthlessly suppressed all attempts by the players to unionize in particular when they perceived a threat by the organizing efforts of Red Wings star Ted Lindsay br As the NHL stabilized it came under the control of a few wealthy tycoons in particular the powerful Norris family James E Norris the owner of the Red Wings effectively controlled the league s other three American teams as well After the elder Norris died in this control was exercised by his son James D Norris NHL owners staunchly resisted applications to expand beyond six franchises Groups representing Philadelphia which had secured rights to the dormant Montreal Maroons franchise Los Angeles and the AHL Cleveland Barons were each in turn given conflicting requirements that seemed to contemporary observers designed to disqualify the bids and it was widely understood that the existing NHL owners wanted no encroachments upon their profits br The NHL had been an early leader in television broadcasting both in Canada and the U S However by its TV contracts had expired and the league had none until The owners saw that the televising of other sports had enhanced the images of those leagues players and feared that this would provide leverage at salary time Already Montreal and William M Jennings in New York took power br br br Expansion teams br br In Rangers governor William Jennings introduced to his peers the idea of expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the season His argument was based around concerns that the Western Hockey League intended to operate as a major league in the near future He also hoped that teams on the west coast would make the league truly national and improve the chances of returning to television in the United States as the NHL had lost its deal with CBS While the governors did not agree to the proposal the topic of expansion arose every time the owners met thereafter br The expansion process formally began in March when NHL President Clarence Campbell announced that the league proposed to expand its operations through the formation of a second six team division San Francisco Oakland and Vancouver were declared acceptable cities with Los Angeles and St Louis as potential sites In February the NHL Board of Governors considered applications from different ownership groups including five from Los Angeles two from Pittsburgh and one each from Minneapolis Saint Paul Philadelphia San Francisco Oakland Baltimore Buffalo and Vancouver Cleveland and Louisville had also expressed previous interest but were not represented br Six franchises were ultimately added the California Seals San Francisco Oakland Los Angeles Kings Minnesota North Stars Philadelphia Flyers Pittsburgh Penguins and St Louis Blues Had one of the teams been unable to start a franchise would have then been awarded to Baltimore Four of those teams are still playing in their original cities under their original names In the North Stars merged with the Cleveland Barons who were the relocated Seals and in the North Stars became the Dallas Stars Both the San Francisco Oakland market and the Minneapolis St Paul markets were eventually granted new teams as the San Jose Sharks and the Minnesota Wild br br br Opposition br Canadian fans including Prime Minister Lester Pearson were irate that no Canadian teams were added particularly since Vancouver had been generally considered a lock for a team Internal considerations took a hand in that since as Montreal and Toronto were not interested in sharing CBC television revenues with another Canadian club and Chicago owner Arthur Wirtz s support was reputedly contingent on the creation of a St Louis team although that city had not submitted a formal bid to purchase the decrepit St Louis Arena which the Black Hawks ownership then also owned Buffalo also nearly got a team over nearby Pittsburgh until Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney who served as a minority investor in the Penguins early years persuaded the Norris brothers whom he knew through their common interest in horse racing to vote for Pittsburgh in the expansion process Vancouver and Buffalo both subsequently received teams for the NHL s next expansion in br On a more general note many traditionalists resisted expansion claiming it would dilute the talent in the league Even some proponents of expansion were worried at the idea of immediately doubling the NHL s size and wanted to ease teams in gradually as Major League Baseball was doing br The expansion fee was US million and players taken in the very strict expansion draft came at a cost of each Experts tended to see that as high and most expansion teams were seen as having no hope of competing successfully with the established teams in the near future br Because of the inherent competitive imbalance there was some support for the idea of placing the new teams in a completely separate division or conference with a separate schedule for the first few seasons and then gradually integrating the new teams into the established NHL much like the then progressing AFL NFL merger was being carried out Ultimately the league partly implemented the idea by placing all six of the new teams in the new West Division Alternative proposals included putting Detroit and Chicago in the West with Pittsburgh and Philadelphia going to the East In a surprising concession the league also agreed to implement a strictly divisional playoff bracket meaning that four expansion teams would make the playoffs and an expansion team was guaranteed a slot in the Stanley Cup Finals br br br Changes br br The new teams offered a big change to the league After seeing virtually the same red blue black uniforms for over years purple green sky blue and orange were introduced Teams now regularly travelled between cities by air because of the distances involved at the time all of the Original Six cities had daily overnight passenger rail service between one another br br br Aftermath br The expansion marked the end of the Original Six era and the beginning of a new era of the NHL The expansion Bobby Orr s record million contract in and the formation of the World Hockey Association WHA in forever changed the landscape of the North American professional game It was the WHA that ended up being the NHL s chief rival during the s while the Western Hockey League ceased operations in The NHL s first expansion period ended in by which time the league had tripled in size to teams and then merged with the WHA by absorbing four of its teams in As a result the NHL retained its status as the premier professional ice hockey league in North America no other league has attempted to compete against the NHL since then br However the NHL s other goal of immediately securing a lucrative TV contract in the U S similar to MLB and the NFL never fully materialized until decades later Despite the expansion and the subsequent merger with the WHA NHL broadcasting on a national scale in the U S continued to be spotty between and Although NBC and CBS held rights at various times neither network carried anything close to a full schedule even carrying only selected games of the Stanley Cup Finals br All the expansion teams were placed in the same division in so their success was largely gauged relative to each other before the realignment which radically mixed up all of the league s teams into four divisions and two conferences Subsequent expansions and realignments separated both the Original Six and the expansion teams even further essentially reviving the league s earlier alternative plan to put Detroit and Chicago in the West and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in the East After the realignment which reorganized the league into six divisions only the Flyers and the Penguins are in the same division When the league realigned again in to a different four division setup the Stars and Blues were placed in the same division br The St Louis Blues immediately made an impact by appearing in three consecutive Stanley Cup Finals in the first three years but were swept in each Their first Stanley Cup title in came years after their previous finals appearance Although they were the first team from the expansion to reach the finals the Blues were the last of the five active teams to win the Stanley Cup br After the season the league moved Chicago to the West Division and altered the playoff format to force Eastern and Western teams to face each other prior to the final Until no expansion team defeated an Original Six team in a playoff series or even reached the Final again That season the Philadelphia Flyers who had steadily built a strong team defeated Boston to win the Stanley Cup The Flyers repeated as champions in by defeating the Buffalo Sabres in the first modern Stanley Cup Finals to not feature an Original Six club As of the end of the NHL season which marked the th season for the expansion teams the Flyers are the most successful of the expansion team in terms of all time points percentage second only to the Montreal Canadiens in NHL history Additionally the Flyers have the most appearances in the league semi finals known as the conference finals since the season out of all expansion teams with and the most Stanley Cup Finals appearances with a total of eight br The Pittsburgh Penguins were largely unsuccessful in the beginning failing to win their division until the season but accumulated draft picks and built a strong team that won two consecutive Stanley Cups in and In the Penguins became the first of the expansion teams to win three Cups Then in Pittsburgh tied the New York Rangers an Original Six team and the New York Islanders a expansion team with four Cups After successfully defending their title the following year the franchise tied the Edmonton Oilers at five Cups with the Oilers joining the league in the merger with the WHA br The Los Angeles Kings did not make a Stanley Cup Finals appearance until during the Wayne Gretzky era The Kings did not return to the Cup Finals again until when they finally won their first Cup Los Angeles won the Cup again in br While four of the expansion teams still play in their original cities one has relocated and one ceased operations The Oakland San Francisco Bay Area based franchise was the least successful of the expansion teams noncompetitive both on the ice and at the box office the club eventually moved to Cleveland to become the Barons in While the Minnesota North Stars were in a traditional hockey area the team was struggling financially In the two ownership groups merged the franchises into the North Stars with the Barons owners Gordon and George Gund III becoming the majority owners of the team Although the merged North Stars improved on the ice and made two finals appearances in and they continued to have financial difficulties br In late s the Gunds attempted to relocate the North Stars to the Bay Area but were denied by the league The NHL and the Gunds came to a compromise with the Gunds selling the North Stars and were given an expansion team that became the San Jose Sharks in As part of the compromise the North Stars and Sharks had a player dispersal and expansion draft in which the North Stars roster was split between the two teams and then each took part in the expansion draft The new owners of the North Stars only kept the team in Minnesota for two more seasons and moved to Dallas Texas in to become the Dallas Stars eventually winning their first Cup in The NHL returned to the Twin Cities market when the Minnesota Wild began play in br br br th Anniversary season br During the NHL season the four expansion six teams still in their original cities had festivities commemorating their th year in the NHL and each unveiled uniform patches to be worn by those teams The patches were unveiled on February on the th anniversary of the NHL awarding the franchises which led the Penguins to unveil a patch with three Stanley Cups With the Penguins winning that year s Stanley Cup Finals their patch was modified to have four Cups The season ended with the Penguins clinching their fifth Cup br br br Timeline of the expansion teams br Among the six expansion teams four still play in their original cities One has since relocated while the other relocated and then was merged out of existence br br br See also br NHL Expansion Draft br History of the National Hockey League br History of the National Hockey League br History of organizational changes in the NHL
