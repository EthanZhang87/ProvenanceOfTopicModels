History br br br Formation br br The National Hockey League NHL which had grown from six teams in to fourteen in had not planned further expansion until at least However the formation of a rival major league the World Hockey Association WHA altered the NHL s plans and resulted in the two leagues battling for players and markets The NHL sought to keep the WHA out of the newly constructed Nassau Coliseum in Long Island New York The league also opted to place a team in the American South The NHL announced on November that it was expanding to Long Island and Atlanta The Atlanta franchise was awarded to Atlanta real estate developer Tom Cousins who also owned the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association NBA and would play out of the newly built Omni Coliseum The team cost million Cousins named the franchise the Flames in homage to the burning of Atlanta by United States Army General William Sherman during the American Civil War br The Flames hired Cliff Fletcher formerly of the St Louis Blues to serve as the team s general manager Former Montreal Canadiens player Bernie Geoffrion was hired as the team s head coach The team stocked its roster via an expansion draft held on June Fletcher focused on goaltending choosing Phil Myre with his first selection and rookie Dan Bouchard with his second Fletcher drafted a competent roster but one that was young and inexperienced Two days later the Flames selected Jacques Richard as the second overall pick in the NHL Amateur Draft br br br br The Flames made their NHL debut in Long Island against their expansion cousins the New York Islanders on October They won the game Morris Stefaniw scored the first goal in franchise history and the first NHL goal in Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum The team made its home debut one week later on October Hosting the first event in Omni Coliseum history the Flames tied the Buffalo Sabres before a sellout crowd of The team was respectable through much of the season on the strength of Bouchard and Myre s goaltending performances and by mid January had a win loss tie record The Flames won only five more games through the rest of the season finishing at Atlanta finished in seventh place in the West Division and missed the playoffs The team was reasonably successful at the gate it sold nearly season tickets by the start of the season and averaged fans per game br Tom Lysiak selected second overall at the NHL Amateur Draft joined the Flames for the season and made an immediate impact Lysiak led the Flames in scoring with points and finished second to the Islanders Denis Potvin in voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL s top rookie Improving to the Flames finished fourth in the West and qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs They made their post season debut against the division winning Philadelphia Flyers The first game played April was a victory for the Flyers Philadelphia went on to defeat the Flames in their best of seven series with four consecutive wins Geoffrion was praised for his coaching of the club and finished second in voting for the Jack Adams Award as top coach br The NHL s expansion to teams in resulted in realignment The league moved to a four division format placing the Flames in the Patrick Division Lysiak repeated as the Flames top scorer with points while Eric Vail playing his first full season led with goals Vail s total led all rookies and earned him the Calder Trophy The team overcame an eight game losing streak in December and injuries to several key players to post their first winning season with a record However they finished fourth in the Patrick Division and failed to qualify for the post season Citing personal reasons Geoffrion resigned as head coach late in the season He was replaced by Fred Creighton who had been coaching the Flames minor league affiliate the Omaha Knights Fletcher later credited Geoffrion s outgoing personality as being the primary reason why people in Atlanta followed the Flames in the franchise s first seasons while the team s players later stated an appreciation for Creighton s more technical coaching and teaching style br br br br br Creighton produced a consistent but not outstanding team as the Flames finished third in the Patrick for the following three seasons and typically won a few games more than they lost each year The team qualified for the playoffs all three years but lost in the preliminary round each time In they were defeated by the Los Angeles Kings in a best of three series two games to none The Kings again eliminated the Flames in but Atlanta earned its first playoff victory in franchise history in the second game of the series Vail scored the game winning goal in a victory over the Kings on April but the Flames were eliminated in the third game draft pick Willi Plett emerged as a young star for the Flames He scored goals in his rookie season of and won the Calder Trophy br Seeking to improve his team s fortunes Fletcher made several moves over the following seasons to rework the Flames roster His goaltending tandem of Bouchard and Myre had begun to feud with each other by the season as both sought more playing time Fletcher responded by naming Bouchard his number one goaltender and trading Myre to the St Louis Blues for three players They made it into the playoffs again but were the only team to fall to a team with fewer points than them the Detroit Red Wings in a best of three series two games to none In March Fletcher completed an eight player trade that sent franchise leading scorer Tom Lysiak and four players to the Chicago Black Hawks for three players led by defenseman Phil Russell Fletcher hoped the addition of Russell would help his team achieve playoff success br Buoyed by a franchise record ten game winning streak in October the Flames posted the best record in their Atlanta years at Bob MacMillan acquired in the Myre deal became the first Flame other than Lysiak to lead the team in scoring in six years and along with Guy Chouinard was one of the first two Flames players to score points in one season Chouinard also became the team s first goal scorer MacMillan won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy that season as the NHL s most gentlemanly player In the playoffs against the Toronto Maple Leafs Atlanta again failed to win a game as they lost a best of three series two games to none br Fletcher continued to alter his team s make up throughout the Al MacNeil replaced Creighton as head coach prior to the season and the team acquired Swedish star Kent Nilsson following the demise of the WHA Nilsson led Atlanta in scoring with goals and assists At the NHL Entry Draft Fletcher selected four players Paul Reinhart Jim Peplinski Pat Riggin and Tim Hunter who would ultimately become regulars in the Flames line up However while the Flames again qualified for the playoffs in they again lost in the first round losing a best of five series to the New York Rangers three games to one br br br Relocation br br As the team stagnated on the ice the Flames struggled at the gate They peaked at an average of fans per game in their second season but fell to three years later and then in Concerns that low attendance could result in the relocation of the team surfaced by prompting politicians and the players themselves to purchase tickets in a bid to stabilize the franchise The Flames attempted to boost attendance in by signing Jim Craig goaltender of the American Olympic team that had won the Olympic gold medal following its Miracle on Ice victory over the Soviet Union It was not successful as attendance fell to an average of Adding to the Flames financial woes was the fact that the Omni Coliseum was one of the last major arenas in North America to be built without revenue generating luxury suites which led Fletcher to describe the facility as being out of date when it opened br Cousins announced he was seeking to sell the club following the Flames exit from the playoffs Their final game a loss against the New York Rangers was played in Atlanta on April He claimed to have suffered significant financial losses on the team while low viewership hampered his ability to sign a television contract Additionally the real estate crunch of the s hit Cousins especially hard Most of his money not tied up in his real estate interests was tied up in the Flames leading him to put the Flames on the market The Flames estimated to have lost million in its eight years had been rumored for months to be moving to Calgary though Dallas and Houston were also mentioned as possible destinations Dallas got an NHL team in when the erstwhile Minnesota North Stars relocated to the city to become the Dallas Stars br The Seaman brothers Daryl and Byron had made an offer of million while the City of Calgary prepared to build a new arena for the team However Canadian businessman Nelson Skalbania emerged as a rival bidder for the team before joining the Calgary consortium The group agreed to purchase the Flames for million at the time the highest price ever paid for an NHL franchise The sale was announced on May and the franchise relocated to Canada where it became the Calgary Flames The Flames have since used the Atlanta logo for both its alternate captains and the team s former affiliate that played in the American Hockey League AHL the Adirondack Flames br The last active Atlanta Flames player in the NHL was Kent Nilsson who played his final game in Several former players of the team returned to Atlanta once their careers ended Among them Tom Lysiak operated a horse farm outside the city Eric Vail returned to operate a nightclub and Willi Plett operated a sporting theme park and golf course Fletcher would remain the team s general manager until steering the team to two appearances in the Stanley Cup Finals and a Cup victory in The Flames would appear in the playoffs every year until a streak of consecutive seasons dating to their fourth year in Atlanta br br br The NHL returns to Atlanta then leaves again br The NHL returned to Atlanta in when the Atlanta Thrashers joined the league as an expansion franchise The Flames and Thrashers were however in opposing conferences this meant that the Flames who were in the Western Conference would play one game in Atlanta annually until the season when the Thrashers announced that they were sold and relocating to Winnipeg Manitoba becoming the second incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets Atlanta is the only other city besides Quebec City to have lost two NHL teams in both cases relocating to Western Canada br br br Uniform br In their eight year history the Atlanta Flames wore red and white uniforms with yellow accents This set generally had contrasting color stripes with yellow borders along the sleeves socks and tail A red shoulder stripe adorned the white uniforms They carried this set over to Calgary following the relocation replacing the flaming A with the flaming C decal in front The flaming A was later used by the Calgary Flames to denote alternate captains br Coincidentally their then sister team Atlanta Hawks also changed their colors to red and yellow shortly after the Flames were established They would keep this color scheme until only to be restored in The Hawks also added black as a tertiary color in with the now Calgary Flames following suit in as of both teams currently wear black uniforms as third jerseys while their primary uniforms dropped black from the color scheme br br br Season by season record br br
