expressed both regrets for the franchise s relocation and sympathy for the Thrashers fan base He stated I think it s sad for the city I believe this city can support a team and support it in a good way Obviously it s been some chaotic years pretty much from day one with ownership not being on the same page and I think that has hurt the franchise quite a bit We ve kind of made this sort of our second home for five years now and obviously the Thrashers were the reason we came here in the first place Hedberg said I know all the people involved I know all the people working in the front office and in hockey operations and I know a lot of the fans around They re hard core fans that really don t want to lose the team So I would have feeling of sadness There s no doubt this could be a good hockey city but it needs to be done the right way This ownership has never given it a chance to do that after it got off on the wrong foot br Hedberg s family which includes his wife and three
