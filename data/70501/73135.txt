Minnesota North Stars began play in as part of the league s six team expansion Home games were played at the newly constructed Metropolitan Sports Center Met Center in Bloomington Minnesota Initially successful both on the ice and at the gate the North Stars fell victim to financial problems after several poor seasons in the mid s br br In the North Stars merged with the Cleveland Barons formerly the California Golden Seals owned by George III and Gordon Gund With both teams on the verge of folding the league permitted the two failing franchises to merge The merged team continued as the Minnesota North Stars while the Seals Barons franchise records were retired However the Gunds were the merged team s principal owners and the North Stars assumed the Barons place in the Adams Division in order to balance out the divisions The merger brought with it a number of talented players and the North Stars were revived they reached the Stanley Cup Finals in where they lost in five games to the New York Islanders However by the early s declining attendance and the inability to secure a new downtown revenue generating arena led ownership to request permission to move the team to the San Francisco Bay Area in The league rejected the request and instead agreed to award an expansion franchise the San Jose Sharks to the Gund brothers The North Stars were sold to a group of investors that were originally looking to place a team in San Jose although one of the group s members former Calgary Flames part owner Norman Green would eventually gain control of the team In the following season the North Stars made it to the Stanley Cup Finals only to lose to the Pittsburgh Penguins br After the season the North Stars suffered through declining profits coupled with distraction and uncertainty caused by relocation attempts The team s fortunes were further impeded by the terms of the settlement with the Gund brothers in which they were permitted to take a number of North Stars players to San Jose In their final two seasons in Minnesota the team adopted a new logo which omitted any reference to the word North from North Stars leading many fans to anticipate the team heading south Green explored the possibility of moving the team to Anaheim to play at a new arena which is now the Honda Center under construction and intended to call the team the Los Angeles Stars However in the league decided to award an expansion franchise to The Walt Disney Company to play in Anaheim s new arena this franchise eventually became the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim br br br Relocation and early years in Dallas br br In amid further attendance woes and bitter personal controversy Green obtained permission from the league to move the team to Dallas for the season with the decision announced on March Green was convinced by former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach that Dallas would be a suitable market for an NHL team With the team s move to the Southern United States Green decided to drop the North adjective but otherwise retained the Stars nickname which in its shortened form quickly proved popular as it matched the state of Texas official nickname as The Lone Star State An NHL franchise Dallas was an experiment for the league as at that time the Stars would be one of the three southernmost teams in the league along with two recently created expansion teams in the Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers as the league s first real ventures into southern non traditional hockey markets The Stars would move into Reunion Arena built in the downtown arena already occupied by the National Basketball Association s Dallas Mavericks br To quell the ensuing controversy surrounding the North Stars move to Dallas the NHL promised that the Twin Cities would receive an expansion franchise in the near future that promise was fulfilled in in the form of the Minnesota Wild br With the league changing the names of the conferences and divisions that season the newly relocated Stars were placed in the Central Division of the Western Conference although these were essentially continuations of the Norris Division and Campbell Conference respectively both of which the North Stars had been part of The first NHL game in Dallas was played on October and was a win against the Detroit Red Wings Somewhat ironically Minnesota native Neal Broten scored the first Stars goal in Dallas Though the Stars were relatively still low on the Dallas Fort Worth sports pecking order upon their arrival popularity of the team grew rapidly and the immediate success of the team on the ice as well as Mike Modano s career best season goals points helped spur the team s popularity in North Texas The Stars set franchise bests in wins and points in their first season in Dallas qualifying for the playoffs The Stars further shocked the hockey world by sweeping the St Louis Blues in the first round but lost to the eventual Western Conference Champion Vancouver Canucks in the second round The Stars success in their first season along with Modano s spectacular on ice performances would be an integral part of the Stars eventual franchise success in the immediate years to come br The almost immediate success of the Stars was also helped by the long legacy of minor league hockey in the area Both incarnations of the Central Hockey League had two teams in the area the Dallas Black Hawks and the Fort Worth Texans for years before the Stars arrival The two teams were bitter rivals and some of the traditions and famous rivalry incidents including what is thought to be the first known use anywhere at an athletic event of Rock and Roll Part by the Fort Worth Texans and the famous Cent Beer Night near riot in helped create awareness of hockey Amateur and youth hockey in North Texas were also extremely popular because of the long presence of the minor league teams br br br Arrival of Tom Hicks and building for a championship br The season was shortened by an owners lockout The Stars traded captain Mark Tinordi along with Rick Mrozik to the Washington Capitals before the season began for Kevin Hatcher Longtime North Stars hold over Neal Broten was named his

ligaments In the second round they again met the Edmonton Oilers this time defeating them in five games However without Nieuwendyk the Stars lacked the firepower to overcome the defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Finals and lost in six games The Red Wings went on to win their second consecutive Stanley Cup br br br Stanley Cup contention and Stanley Cup championship br br br Stanley Cup title and Stanley Cup Finals run br br In the off season after falling just short in the Western Conference Finals the Stars added what they believed was the final piece toward winning a championship star goalscoring winger Brett Hull Hull had already had a successful career with the St Louis Blues with three consecutive goal seasons and a Hart Memorial Trophy but a fallout with Blues management led Hull to leave St Louis via free agency Additionally this was the first season for the Stars in the Pacific Division after the NHL division re alignment br In

games at a series tie the Avalanche won Game by a score of taking a series lead The Stars rallied winning game six on the road and Game at home both by scorelines br This was the Stars first Stanley Cup Finals appearance as the Dallas Stars although they made the finals twice as the Minnesota North Stars They faced the Eastern Conference champion Buffalo Sabres who had defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Eastern Conference Finals After splitting the first four games the Stars vaunted defense would hold the Sabres to only one goal in the next two winning Game and Game on a triple overtime goal by Brett Hull Hull s goal at of the third overtime was allowed to stand only after a lengthy official review That season the league still had the crease rule in effect which provided that if any player of the attacking team who did not have possession of the puck entered the crease before the puck then any resulting goal was disallowed Hull had initially gained possession of the puck outside the crease and had made a shot that was blocked by Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek One of Hull s skates entered the crease as he corralled the rebound and Hull s second shot scored the Cup winning goal The goal was eventually allowed as having simply blocked Hull s shot rather than catching it Hasek never took possession of the puck away from Hull Officials therefore determined that rather than calling it a loose puck Hull would be considered to have had continuous possession of the puck from before his first shot outside the crease The complexity of the crease rule and the attendant difficulties in understanding its application by fans and players alike combined with the controversy arising out of the disputed Stanley Cup winning goal resulted in the crease rule being repealed the following season Hull s goal marked the th time a Stanley Cup winning goal was scored in overtime and only the fourth to be scored in multiple overtimes This was the only time between and that a

Finals and lost the series in Game on a double overtime goal by New Jersey forward Jason Arnott br br br Continued playoff contention br Hoping to win back the Stanley Cup the Stars again captured the Pacific Division posting a solid record in the season In the playoffs the Stars and the Edmonton Oilers met in the first round battling back and forth through the first four games with each game decided by one goal including three going into overtime Game would also go to overtime as the Stars took a series lead on a goal by Kirk Muller However in Game in Edmonton the Stars did not need overtime advancing to the second round with a win Facing the St Louis Blues the Stars would run out of gas being swept in four straight games The Game loss would be the last NHL game played in Reunion Arena br br Moving into the brand new American Airlines Center for the season the Stars had a slow start to the season as goaltender Ed Belfour struggled through one of his worst seasons Head coach

Conference at and along the way two way star Jere Lehtinen won his third Frank J Selke Trophy In the playoffs the Stars once again met the Edmonton Oilers and once again the Oilers would prove a contentious opponent winning two of the first three games However the Stars would prove the better team again by winning the next three games to take the series in six games The Stars second round series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim got off to an unbelievable start as the game went deep into overtime tied However Mighty Ducks goaltender Jean Sebastien Giguere stopped shots as the Ducks scored early in the fifth overtime Game would be more of the same as the Ducks stunned the Stars in overtime Desperately needing a win the Stars bounced back to take Game in Anaheim However the Ducks would take a series lead by breaking a scoreless tie late in the third period of Game In Game the Stars finally solved Giguere by scoring four goals to keep their playoff hopes alive However the Stars dreams of a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals would end in heartbreaking fashion as the Ducks broke a tie with left in Game on a goal by defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh br Coming off their disappointing playoff loss the Stars would get off to a shaky start to the season as they played mediocre hockey through the first three months of the season posting a sub record However as the calendar turned to the Stars began to find their game as they posted a record in January As the season wore on the Stars would get stronger climbing up the playoff ladder and eventually reaching second place in the Pacific Division where they finished with a solid record Marty Turco had another outstanding season recording a GAA However the Stars could not carry their momentum into the

remained one of the strongest teams in the Western Conference for the start of as they won four of their first five games on the way to a solid October November would be even better for Dallas as they won of games and took over first place in the Pacific Division a position they would hold most of the season as they went on to finish with a terrific record of One reason for the Stars success was their strong play in shootouts as forward Jussi Jokinen was nearly automatic making of shot attempts Also performing strongly in shootouts was Sergei Zubov who used a slow but steady backhand to go for as the Stars ultimately won of games that were settled by a shootout As the number two seed in the Western Conference the Stars faced the seventh seeded Colorado Avalanche The Stars were favorited to win the Western Conference and some even predicted them to win the Stanley Cup However the Stars would stumble right from the start losing Game by a score of as the Avalanche scored five unanswered goals after the Stars jumped out to a promising lead Game would see the Stars suffer another setback at home as the Stars lost in overtime on a goal by Joe Sakic On the road in Game the Stars led in the final minute before the Avalanche forced overtime on a goal by Andrew Brunette while Alex Tanguay won the game just seconds into overtime to put the Stars in a hole The Stars would avoid the sweep
