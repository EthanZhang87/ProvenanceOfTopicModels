by Ted Lindsay of the Detroit Red Wings and Doug Harvey of the Montreal Canadiens after the league had refused to release pension plan financial information The owners sabotaged the certification of

NHL teams met and elected Bob Pulford their first president and appointed Alan Eagleson as its executive director br To prevent the new NHLPA from suffering the fate of its predecessor Pulford met with the owners of the NHL teams and demanded they recognize the new union or the union would seek official recognition from the Canadian Industrial Relations Board CIRB br Additionally the players sought guarantees where no member of the new union would be punished for being a member The owners acceded br In return the NHLPA agreed it should represent at least two thirds of the active players in the NHL and that the players would refrain from striking for the duration of the agreement so long as the owners did not contravene any terms or conditions br br br Bob Goodenow era br Eagleson stayed on until the end of when the players replaced him with Bob Goodenow Eagleson went on to face criminal charges relating to his conduct during the time he worked at the NHLPA and ultimately on

sentenced to months in jail br Bob Goodenow would seek to restore respect and honour to the association during his successful years of service to the players as executive director He led all NHLPA members through the strike of which most notably gave players the rights to the marketing of their own images In he was at the helm as the players endured a lockout ensuring that a fair deal was reached A decade later in the owners locked out the players again becoming the first professional sports league to cancel an entire season Goodenow would depart following the lockout notifying the

executive board selected Michael Cammalleri Calgary Flames Chris Chelios retired Shawn Horcoff Edmonton Oilers Eric Lindros retired and Robyn Regehr retired to form a search committee for a new executive director With the assistance of Reilly Partners an executive search firm from Chicago the search committee would review the resumes of hundreds of candidates br The committee would ultimately recommend that Paul V Kelly a founding partner of Kelly Libby and Hoopes law firm in Boston become the fourth executive director since the NHLPA s inception in Through a secret ballot system the Player Representatives voted in favour of the committee s recommendation and Kelly would be introduced at a media conference on October br On December the NHLPA and the David Suzuki

claims that it is all hearsay and nothing is concrete between the NHLPA and Donald Fehr However Fehr would be formally named as executive director later in br On January the NHLPA rejected a proposal for realignment in the league for beginning in the season which impacted CBA discussions br On September with no agreement being reached on a new CBA the owners locked out the players thus threatening the start of the NHL season Three months later on December the NHL filed a class action suit with the U S District Court in New York seeking to establish the lockout was legal They also filed an unfair labor practice charge with the U S National Labor Relations Board stating the union had been negotiating in bad faith and their threat to disclaim interest is a negotiating ploy which violates the collective bargaining process On December a person told the Associated Press a vote was cast to give the NHLPA executive board a chance to file a disclaimer of interest with the vote in favor The board had until January to file the disclaimer in which then the union would have dissolved and became a trade organization which would have allowed players to file antitrust lawsuits against the NHL br On January the NHLPA reached a tentative agreement with the NHL to end the lockout The NHLPA then approved a league proposal for realignment in the league beginning in the season br In it was announced Fehr would be replaced as Executive Director by former United States Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh br br br Organization br While the management of daily operations is the responsibility of
