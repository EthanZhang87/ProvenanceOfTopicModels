The Stanley Cup playoffs French Les s ries liminatoires de la Coupe Stanley is the annual elimination tournament to determine the winner of the Stanley Cup and the league champion of the National Hockey League NHL The four round best of seven tournament is held after the NHL s regular season Eight teams from each of the league s two conferences qualify for the playoffs based on regular season points totals The final round is commonly known as the Stanley Cup Finals which matches the two conference champions br The NHL is the only one of the big four major leagues in Canada and the United States to refer to its playoffs by the name of its championship trophy a tradition which has arisen because the Stanley Cup is North America s oldest professional sports trophy dating back more than two decades before the establishment of the NHL Originally inscribed the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup the trophy was donated in by Lord Stanley of Preston then Governor General of Canada initially as a challenge trophy for Canada s top ranking amateur ice hockey club From when the first Cup was awarded to the champions held onto the Cup until they either lost their league title to another club or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and defeated the reigning Cup champion in a final game to claim their win Professional teams then first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in Starting in the Cup was officially contested between the champion of the National Hockey Association NHA and the champion of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association PCHA After a series of league mergers and folds including the establishment of the NHL as a successor to the NHA the Stanley Cup became the championship trophy of the NHL prior to the season br The NHL has always used a playoff tournament to determine its champion The league s playoff system has changed over the years from the NHL s inception in to when the NHL took over the Cup in to the current setup today br br br Current format br br br Format br The Stanley Cup playoffs consists of four rounds of best of seven series Each series is played in a format meaning the team with home ice advantage hosts games one two five and seven while their opponent hosts games three four and six Games five six and seven are only played if needed br Eight teams in each conference qualify for the playoffs In the playoff series format instituted in the first second and third place teams in each of the four divisions qualify for the playoffs automatically Two additional teams from each conference regardless of divisional alignment also qualify for the playoffs by having the highest point totals out of the remaining teams in the conference These teams are referred to as the wild cards Since there is no attention paid to divisional alignment with the wild cards it is possible for one division in a conference to have five teams in the postseason while the other has just three br In the First Round the teams are split into two separate brackets by conference Each bracket consists of the top three divisional qualifiers and one of the wild cards The lower seeded wild card plays against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card plays against the other division winner and both wild cards are de facto No seeds The other two series match the second and third place teams from the divisions br The winners of both First Round series advance to the Second Round The reseeding in the previous format which ensured the top seed would play the lowest remaining seed was discarded The winners of these series advance to the conference finals and the two conference finals winners move on to the Stanley Cup Finals br In the first two rounds the higher seeded team has home ice advantage regardless of point record Thereafter it goes to the team with the better regular season record regardless of seeding in the case of a tie the league s standard tie breaking procedure is applied The team with home ice advantage hosts games one two five and seven while the opponent hosts games three four and six games five through seven are played if necessary br Any ties in the standings at the end of the regular season are broken using the following protocols br br The greater number of regulation wins only used since the NHL season reflected by the RW statistic br The greater number of regulation and overtime wins excluding shootouts used since the NHL season reflected by the ROW statistic br The greater number of total wins including shootouts br The greater number of points earned in games between the tied clubs br If two clubs are tied and have not played an equal number of home games against each other the points earned and available in the first game played in the city of the club that had the greater number of home games in games between the two are not included br If more than two clubs are tied the higher percentage of available points earned in games among those clubs and not including any odd games are used to determine the standing The odd games are identical to those mentioned in the previous paragraph that is the first game in the city of the club that has had more home games in games between each club in the tie Note that because of this procedure if two teams in the multi team tie also applicable in a two team tie have only played once against each other the points earned in that game are not included br The greater differential between goals for and goals against during the entire regular season br The greater number of goals for used since the NHL season reflected by the GF statistic br If two clubs are still tied on regulation wins regulation and overtime wins total wins points earned between the tied clubs excluding the points earned and available in the first game played in the city of the club that had the greater number of home games in games between the two regular season goal differential and regular season goal scored a one game playoff is played under Stanley Cup playoff rules br br br Overtime rules br br Unlike the regular season where a contest could eventually be decided in a shootout overtime in the playoffs is played in multiple sudden death minute five on five periods until one team scores Although a playoff game could theoretically last indefinitely only two contests have reached six overtime periods and neither of those went beyond six During playoff overtime periods the only break is to shovel away the loose ice shavings at the first stoppage after the period is halfway finished br br br History br br br Origins br br The Stanley Cup was commissioned in as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup and was named after Lord Stanley of Preston the Governor General of Canada who donated it as an award to Canada s top ranking amateur ice hockey club The entire Stanley family supported the sport the sons and daughters all playing and promoting the game The first Cup was then awarded in to Montreal Hockey Club br During the period from to the champions held the Cup until they lost their league title to another club or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and subsequently defeated them in a special game or series The competitive format of each Cup challenge was determined by negotiation between the two clubs Furthermore none of the leagues that played for the Cup had a formal playoff system to decide their respective champions whichever team finished in first place after the regular season won the league title A playoff would only be played if teams tied for first place in their leagues at the end of the regular season br As the prestige of winning the Cup grew so did the need to attract top players and thus professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in Then in the Allan Cup was introduced as the trophy for Canada s amateurs and the Stanley Cup became a symbol of professional hockey supremacy In the National Hockey Association NHA held its inaugural season and soon emerged as the best professional hockey league in Canada keeping the Cup for the next four years In the Victoria Aristocrats of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association PCHA challenged the NHA and Cup champion Toronto Blueshirts One year later the NHA and the PCHA began an agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup effectively ending the Cup challenge games br After years of the NHA not having an annual playoff tournament to determine its league champion the NHA season saw the league split its schedule into two halves with the top team from each half moving on to the league finals which was a two game total goals series The PCHA continued to award their league title to the team that finished in first place after the regular season br br br Emergence of the NHL br The National Hockey League NHL was founded in November as a successor to the NHA From the NHL s inception until both NHL and PCHA teams were eligible for the Stanley Cup The NHL inherited the NHA s regular season system of dividing it into two halves with the top team from each half moving on to the league finals The NHL finals was a two game total goals series in and a best of seven series in In the Ottawa Senators were automatically declared the league champion when the team had won both halves of the regular season The two halves format was abandoned the next year and the top two teams faced off for the NHL championship in a two game total goals series br At the time the NHL champion would later face the winners of the PCHA and from the Western Canada Hockey League WCHL in further rounds in order to determine the Stanley Cup champion During this time as the rules of the NHL and those of the western leagues differ the main difference being that NHL rules allowed five skaters while the western leagues allowed six the rules for each game in the Stanley Cup Finals alternated between those of the NHL and the western leagues Before the WCHL competed for the Stanley Cup the Cup championship series was a best of five series Following the involvement of the WCHL one league champion was given a bye straight to the finals a best of three affair starting in while the other two competed in a best of three semifinal As travel expenses were high during these times it was often the case that the NHL champions were sent west to compete In a dispute between the leagues in about whether to send one or both western league champions east the winner of the PCHA WCHL series would proceed to the Stanley Cup Finals while the loser of the series would face the NHL champion both series being best of three br In the NHL playoffs expanded from two to three teams with the top team getting a bye to the two game total goal NHL finals but because the first place Hamilton Tigers refused to play under this format the second and third place teams played for the NHL championship in a two game total goals affair The Stanley Cup Finals series returned to a best of five format the same year br br br NHL takes control of Stanley Cup br With the merger of the PCHA and WCHL in and the merged league s collapse in the NHL took de facto control of the Stanley Cup While the Cup would not be formally deeded to the league until from onward the NHL playoffs and the Stanley Cup playoffs are considered synonymous The NHL was subsequently divided into the Canadian and American divisions for the season For six teams qualified for the playoffs three from each division with the division semifinals and finals being a two game total goals affair and the Stanley Cup Finals becoming a best of five series In the playoff format was changed so that the two teams with identical division ranking would face each other i e the division winners played each other the second place teams play each other and likewise for the third place teams The first place series was a best of five affair with the winner proceeding to the best of three Stanley Cup Finals while the others were a two game total goals series The winner of the second and third place series played each other in a best of three series with the winner earning the other berth to the Stanley Cup Finals This format had a slight modification the following year where the semifinal series became a two game total goals affair and the Stanley Cup Finals became a best of five series The two game total goals format was abolished in with those series being changed to best of three affairs br br br Original Six era br The s saw the reduction of teams from ten to seven which resulted in an end to the Canadian and American divisions The Stanley Cup playoffs saw the first and second place teams play against each other in a best of seven series for one berth in the Stanley Cup Finals while the third to sixth place teams battled in a series of best of three matches for the other berth with the third place team taking on the fourth place team and the fifth place team against the sixth place team In the Stanley Cup Finals became a best of seven series the format still used today br The season saw the removal of the New York Americans leaving six remaining teams now known as the Original Six From to all playoff match ups were best of seven affairs The first and third place teams played in one semifinal while the second and fourth place teams played in the other semifinal with the semifinal winners advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals During this time Detroit Red Wings fans often threw an octopus onto the ice as a good luck charm as eight wins were required to win the Stanley Cup br br br Expansion era br The expansion saw the number of teams double from six to twelve for the season and with it the creation of the Western and Eastern divisions The playoff format remained largely the same with four teams in each division qualifying for the playoffs all series remaining best of seven and the division champions battling for the Stanley Cup The season because of fan demand brought forth the first inter conference playoff match up outside of the Stanley Cup Finals since the pre war expansion which had the winner of the second place versus fourth place match up in one conference take on the winner of the first versus third place match up in the other conference for a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals The following year had one minor change to its playoff format a stronger team would face a weaker opponent Thus instead of a first place versus third place and a second versus fourth place match up in the first round the first round had the first place versus the fourth and the second versus the third place This practice of having stronger teams facing weaker opposition has continued to the present day This change necessitated the need to reseed the winners of the quarterfinals by matching up the highest remaining seed of one division against the lowest remaining seed from the other division in the semifinals br The season saw another change to the playoff system to accommodate a league that had expanded to teams in two conferences and four divisions Under this system twelve teams qualified for the playoffs The top team from each division would earn a bye to the quarterfinal while the second and third place teams from each division started their playoff run from a best of three preliminary round In each round of the playoffs the teams remaining were seeded regardless of divisional or conference alignment with the preliminary round series being a best of three affair while the remainder of the series remained best of seven The season had one minor change in its playoff format although the second place finishers from each division would qualify for the preliminary round the four playoff spots reserved for the third place teams were replaced by four wild card spots spots for the four teams with the highest regular season point total that did not finish first or second in their divisions br With the absorption of four teams from the World Hockey Association in the season a new playoff system was introduced where of the league s teams qualified for postseason play The four division winners qualified for the playoffs while twelve wild card positions rounded out the sixteen teams At the beginning of each round the teams were seeded based on their regular season point totals with the preliminary round being a best of five series while all other playoff series were best of seven br The season brought forth the return of divisional matchups with the top four teams from each division qualifying for the playoffs Division champions would be determined followed by the conference champions who would meet in the Stanley Cup Finals The Division Semifinals was a best of five affair until the season when it became a best of seven series while all other series remained best of seven br br br Modern era present br For the season the league revamped its playoff structure to become conference based rather than division based Eight teams in each conference qualified for the playoffs The first place teams in each division were seeded first and second in their respective conference playoffs the next six best teams in each conference also qualified and were seeded third through eighth All teams played in the conference quarterfinals first place versus eighth second versus seventh third versus sixth and fourth versus fifth after each round the surviving teams were reseeded to play the conference semifinals then a conference final with the conference champions playing against each other in the Stanley Cup Finals Home ice advantage was determined by higher seed in the first three rounds and by regular season points of the two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals All series were best of seven but the arrangement of home games was changed for Central and Pacific division teams Instead of the normal rotation a series involving teams from both divisions was with the higher seeded team having the option of starting play at home or on the road the format was used four times in between and all higher seeded teams opted to start play at home with the format br For the season the league re organized into two conferences of three divisions apiece resulting in the playoff format used through the season The qualifiers remained sixteen but the seeding changed The three first place teams in each division qualified and were seeded first through third for the playoffs of the other teams in each conference the top five finishers qualified for the fourth through eighth seeds The format otherwise remained identical to that of the system br The NHL realigned into a four division two conference system for the season Under the postseason system from to and onward the top three teams in each division make the playoffs with two wild cards in each conference for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference The format is division based similar to the system In the First Round the top ranked team in the conference plays against the lowest ranked wild card while the other division winner plays against the higher ranked wild card The second and third place teams in each division play each other The first round winners then meet in the Second Round The third round still consists of the Western Conference and Eastern Conference finals with those conference winners advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals br br br Temporary formats during the COVID pandemic br br Special formats were used in and due to the COVID pandemic br As a result of the pandemic prematurely ending the regular season a team conference based format with from each conference was adopted for the playoffs Seeding was based on each team s points percentage at the time the regular season was suspended on March The top four teams competed in a round robin tournament to determine final seeding in the First Round while the bottom eight seeds in each conference played in a best of five series to determine who advanced to face one of the Round Robin teams in the First Round Teams then were reseeded after each round similar to the conference based formats used from to br The closure of the Canada United States border during the regular season caused the NHL to temporarily abolish both conferences and realign into four different divisions putting all Canadian teams into one of those divisions The top four teams in each division then made the playoffs All four rounds of the playoffs remained as best of seven series and the first two rounds of the playoffs featured intra divisional matchups similar to the division based formats previously used The four division champions were reseeded based on regular season point total in the Stanley Cup Semifinals The best ranked division winner played against the worst ranked division winner while the other two division champions faced off against each other with the second best division champion having home ice advantage The winners of these series advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals as before br br br Traditions and trends br Compared to other major professional sports leagues playoff upsets are relatively common in the NHL According to NHL broadcaster Darren Eliot this is because the style of competition in the playoffs is different from the regular season instead of playing different teams every night the goal is to advance through four best of seven playoff series The Presidents Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a better goaltender a better defensive team or other players that pose matchup problems If the regular season champion s primary success was only outscoring others they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out For the first time during the Stanley Cup playoffs all division winners were eliminated in the first round which also saw the first instance that a Presidents Trophy winner was swept in the opening round br And although rare another aspect is that the NHL leads the other leagues in game seven comebacks In four instances an NHL team has been able to come back from being down to win a seven game series the Toronto Maple Leafs the New York Islanders the Philadelphia Flyers and the Los Angeles Kings There has been only one such reverse sweep comeback in MLB postseason the Boston Red Sox and none in the NBA playoffs br br Despite having more American based teams than Canadian based ones throughout much of the NHL s existence dating back to the Original Six era when it was two Canadian clubs to four American ones and now to since there have been only two times in league history where none of the Canadian teams qualified for the postseason and However the Montreal Canadiens remain the last Canadian club to win the Stanley Cup as of br The Stanley Cup playoffs MVP award the Conn Smythe Trophy is based on the entire NHL postseason instead of just the championship game or series unlike the playoff MVP awards presented in the other major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada the Super Bowl MVP the NBA Finals MVP and the World Series MVP although in its history the trophy has never been given to someone that was not in the finals Doug Gilmour and Peter Forsberg in and respectively are the only players who have topped the postseason in scoring without making it to the Finals br NHL players have often grown beards when their team is in the playoffs where they do not shave until their team is eliminated or wins the Stanley Cup The tradition was started in the s by the New York Islanders and is often mirrored by the fans as well br At the conclusion of a playoff series players and coaches line up and exchange handshakes with their counterparts on the opposing team and this has been described by commentators as one of the great traditions in sports However there have been rare occasions that individual players have refused to participate such as Gerry Cheevers who left the ice without shaking hands with any of the Flyers in and Billy Smith who avoided handshakes as he was particularly passionate about losses More recent examples of players refusing the handshake include the playoffs when several Detroit Red Wings players protested the dirty hit by the Colorado Avalanche s Claude Lemieux and in the playoffs when Martin Brodeur refused to shake Sean Avery s hand after Avery screened him in an earlier game br It is common among players to never touch or hoist the Prince of Wales Trophy Eastern Conference champion or Clarence S Campbell Bowl Western Conference champion after they have won the conference finals the players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that they should be hoisting However there have been many exceptions to this Nineteen of the conference champions since have touched the trophy of which teams went on to win the Stanley Cup Scott Stevens of the Devils in and Sidney Crosby of the Penguins in and Alexander Ovechkin of the Capitals in and Steven Stamkos of the Lightning in In recent years the captain of the winning team poses usually looking solemn with the conference trophy and sometimes the entire team poses as well br There are many traditions and anecdotes associated with the championship trophy the Stanley Cup br Because the Ice Hockey World Championships are held in the same time period as the Stanley Cup playoffs the only NHL players who can participate in the former are those on NHL teams that have been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention This policy has been in place since a agreement between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation which allowed Team Canada to field a team in the World Championships after an eight year absence br br br Postseason appearances br Correct as of Stanley Cup playoffs br br br Appearances by active teams br br br See also br List of NHL
