title: Potential National Hockey League expansion
id: 22743196
The National Hockey League NHL has undergone several rounds of expansion and other organizational changes during its history to reach its current thirty two active teams twenty five in the United States and seven in Canada The newest additions to the league are the Seattle Kraken in and the unnamed Utah team in The league has also relocated several franchises most recently in when the former Atlanta Thrashers became the second and current incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets br To gauge interest and help determine whether the NHL should entertain further expansion the NHL Board of Governors accepted applications for new franchises during the off season Two potential ownership groups submitted applications for prospective teams in Las Vegas and Quebec City The geographic distribution of teams between the NHL s two conferences was not a primary consideration for expansion and the earliest time when a new franchise could start play was the season On June the NHL approved expansion to Las Vegas starting in the season with the Golden Knights but deferred Quebec City s bid for a team br With the Quebec City bid still shelved by the league s board of directors the league opened up another expansion window in December specifically to allow an ownership group from Seattle to place a bid no other cities were allowed to submit bids in that window The Seattle bid was approved on December and the team began play in the season as the Kraken commissioner Gary Bettman then stated the league would not expand any further for the foreseeable future while deputy commissioner Bill Daly stated that the league may revisit expansion in the near future if it is deemed in the best interest of the league br In NHL insiders Kevin Weekes and John Buccigross hinted that the league was considering franchises in Houston and Atlanta In January the Smith Entertainment Group chaired by Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith issued a formal request for the NHL to open an expansion process to bring a team to Salt Lake City Two weeks later during the All Star Weekend commissioner Bettman publicly listed six cities that had expressed interest in expansion In March former player Anson Carter and the newly formed Alpharetta Sports Entertainment also issued a formal request to bring the NHL back to Atlanta In April the league established the new Utah Hockey Club under the ownership of the Smith Entertainment Group with the hockey assets of the Arizona Coyotes franchise which was simultaneously deactivated with the option to rejoin the league as an expansion team contingent on constructing a new arena br br br Expansion sites in Canada br The potential of adding additional franchises in Canada had been an ongoing source of controversy for the NHL in recent years as numerous groups proposed expanding the league into a new Canadian city or purchasing a struggling American franchise and relocating it north to a certain extent these issues continue even after the Atlanta Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg becoming the country s seventh active team Quebec City and the Golden Horseshoe area of Southern Ontario are most frequently proposed as locations for new Canadian teams as was Winnipeg prior to the announced relocation of the Thrashers br br br Background br br br History of Canadian franchises present br Throughout the history of the NHL attempts to bring franchises to Canadian cities have caused points of contention Among them the league s existing Canadian teams especially the Montreal Canadiens historically have raised concerns about further dividing the NHL s Canadian television revenue br Vancouver s rejected bid for one of six new franchises added in outraged Canadians who felt they had been sold out Prime Minister Lester B Pearson stated that the NHL decision to expand only in the US impinges on the sacred principles of all Canadians br Three years later the Vancouver Canucks joined as the league s third Canadian franchise br The defeat by a single vote of a merger agreement between the NHL and the rival World Hockey Association that would have resulted in three Canadian WHA franchises the Edmonton Oilers Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets joining the NHL led to a mass boycott of Molson products across Canada In a second vote the Montreal Canadiens owned by Molson reversed their position allowing the Oilers Nordiques who were owned at the time by then rival brewery Carling O Keefe and Jets to join the NHL for the NHL season along with the New England Whalers who would be renamed the Hartford Whalers The Calgary Flames became Canada s seventh franchise in relocating from Atlanta br br There was considerable upheaval amongst Canadian franchises in the s In the NHL returned to Ottawa beating out Hamilton for an expansion team However the declining value of the Canadian dollar at that time coupled with rapidly escalating salaries placed hardships on Canadian franchises As a result the Nordiques and Jets left Canada becoming the Colorado Avalanche in and the Phoenix Coyotes in respectively Fears persisted up to the NHL lockout that the Flames Oilers and Senators could follow suit The financial fortunes of Canada s teams rebounded following the lockout Canada s six franchises represented one third of NHL revenues in primarily due to the surging value of the Canadian dollar br In May True North Sports and Entertainment an ownership group with the support of billionaire David Thomson rd Baron Thomson of Fleet purchased the Atlanta Thrashers and moved the team to Winnipeg Manitoba This was the first franchise relocation since and the first franchise to locate in Canada since the Ottawa Senators entered the league in At the NHL Entry Draft it was announced that the team would be named the Jets br br br Current views on Canadian expansion br br Former National Hockey League Players Association executive director Paul Kelly has repeatedly argued in favor of bringing a new team to Canada In early he described the Canadian market to The Palm Beach Post The six Canadian franchises do so well they pack the buildings get great TV great revenue streams If you put another team up there be it in Nova Scotia or Hamilton it would be more of the same Prior to the relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg Prime Minister Stephen Harper spoke in favor of another team in Canada stating he has spoken with NHL owners in the past about bringing a new team to southern Ontario br A study published in April by the University of Toronto s Mowat Centre for Policy Innovation concluded that Canada can support NHL teams twice the number it had at the time of the study including second franchises for Montreal Toronto and Vancouver br In May Nate Silver editor of the polling and statistical analysis website FiveThirtyEight concluded that there were about as many avid hockey fans in Canada as in the United States despite the US having nine times Canada s population He determined that among current NHL media markets the average Canadian market had considerably more hockey fans than the typical US market and that Canada could support or teams with two additional franchises in the Golden Horseshoe a second franchise in Montreal and a team in Quebec City Silver also believed Vancouver could support a second franchise although he thought that some of the Vancouver area hockey market could be drawn by a Seattle based team br br br Quebec City br br Quebec City has been home to two NHL hockey teams The first the Quebec Bulldogs were founded in and joined the NHL upon its founding in After they moved to Hamilton Ontario The second the Quebec Nordiques played from to in the World Hockey Association before joining the NHL as part of the NHL WHA merger In they moved to Denver to become the Colorado Avalanche Part of the challenge for both the Bulldogs and Nordiques was that Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the NHL According to the Television Bureau of Canada a prospective Quebec City team would now be in the league s second smallest market ahead of only Winnipeg However Silver s analysis suggested that the Quebec City market was comparable to the US markets of Buffalo and Washington D C in terms of avid hockey fans br In October Quebec City mayor Regis Labeaume spoke with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and former Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut regarding a new Nordiques team no relation to the previous team of the same name Bettman stated that Quebec City could be considered as a candidate for an NHL team provided it built a new arena and a team were for sale br In May Labeaume stated that Pierre Karl P ladeau president and CEO of Quebecor was in talks with the NHL regarding a new Nordiques team in Quebec City He later became a politician for and leader of the Parti Qu b cois a sovereignist political party in the province In September Quebec premier Jean Charest a member of the rival Liberal Party and whose government had invested in the new arena claimed that the political aspect might hinder Quebec City s chances of getting a franchise saying that Bettman might be less likely to allow a team to move if sovereignists were in power According to Sports Illustrated the league is wary of the Quebec sovereignty movement because of concerns that it could destabilize the Canadian dollar However Mayor Labeaume insisted that P ladeau s involvement in politics would not hinder either the management of the new arena or the negotiations over getting a franchise br In March news broke that former Canadian prime minister and vice chairman of Quebecor Brian Mulroney was also involved with negotiations Labeaume pointed out that Mulroney and Bettman had negotiated directly for some time and that Mr Bettman is a businessman The Quebec sovereignty project will not bother him br br Prior to the NHL season an exhibition game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Tampa Bay Lightning was played at the Colis e Pepsi the former home of the Nordiques The Canadiens were well received despite being from rival Montreal and the designated away team of the game Montreal was also scheduled to host the Carolina Hurricanes at the Colis e Pepsi in however that game was canceled due to the NHL lockout In September construction started on an seat arena in Quebec City that would eventually become known as Centre Vid otron the cost of which C million was split equally between the provincial and municipal governments The arena opened on September br On June Quebecor announced that it planned to apply for an NHL expansion franchise with the aim of bringing a Nordiques team back to Quebec City Nearly a month later on July Quebecor formally announced it had submitted an application to the NHL for an expansion franchise On July the NHL confirmed it had received an application from Quebecor On August it was announced that Quebec City had moved on to Phase II of the expansion process The bid subsequently advanced to Phase III which ended on September br Centre Vid otron hosted a neutral site preseason game between the Canadiens and the Pittsburgh Penguins on September The following day in New York City Quebecor and the Las Vegas ownership group presented their bids to the NHL s executive committee However NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated in a press conference after the NHL s Board of Governors meeting that though the league continued to explore the possibility of expansion no deadline had been established for a decision Commissioner Bettman also said that expansion requires a three quarters affirmative vote from the Board of Governors but the members of the executive committee would first have to make a recommendation to the group br Quebec City s bid on an expansion team while not entirely ruled out was significantly weakened after the Canadian dollar declined in value against its US counterpart As of June the Quebec City bid was said to be still being seriously considered but not yet decided Accepting the Las Vegas bid the league ultimately decided to defer the Quebec City bid in citing the value of the Canadian dollar cents to one US dollar when the deferment was announced and the distribution of teams across the two conferences which at the time placed teams in the West and the other in the East the league was therefore more interested in adding teams to the West br Centre Vid otron was awarded some exhibition games leading into the World Cup of Hockey an international tournament operated by the NHL as well as a pair of NHL preseason games in successive years on October and September between the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens In November Quebec Premier Fran ois Legault stated that he would meet with Commissioner Bettman in the coming months to find out what we need to bring back the Nordiques br br br Hamilton br Hamilton was a candidate for expansion in being one of the favorites but lost out to the Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning Hamilton s bid group attempted to negotiate the million expansion fee a condition the NHL rejected While it was speculated that the Toronto Maple Leafs and Buffalo Sabres did not want an NHL team in Hamilton due to territorial competition former league president Gil Stein has denied that was the case br br BlackBerry founder and former co CEO Jim Balsillie has made several attempts to purchase an existing NHL team with the purpose of bringing it to Southern Ontario He signed an agreement in principle to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins for US million on October Penguins majority owner Mario Lemieux agreed to the sale after struggling to gain support from local governments to build a new arena Balsillie s purchase agreement offered to help finance a new arena but also contained a stated intention to relocate the team to Hamilton or Kitchener Waterloo if no deal on a new arena could be reached Balsillie later retracted his bid claiming that the NHL had placed conditions on the sale that he was not comfortable with including a commitment to keep the team in Pittsburgh under any circumstances br Balsillie then reached an agreement to purchase the Nashville Predators for million on May and began a season ticket campaign in Hamilton a week later intending to prove that the city was capable of hosting an NHL team Thousands of fans purchased tickets however the sale again fell through a month later when Predators owner Craig Leipold terminated the agreement The Predators were later sold to a group of ten investors led by Nashville businessman David Freeman who promised to keep the team in Nashville Leipold accepted million less from Freeman s group than Balsillie offered and later ended up as the majority owner of the Minnesota Wild br During the NHL season the future of the Phoenix Coyotes was on shaky ground as the team expected to lose as much as million and the league had to step in to assist with paying the team s bills Coyotes managing partner Jerry Moyes filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection in early May Immediately afterwards an offer by Balsillie to purchase the team was made public The NHL challenged the Coyotes ability to file for bankruptcy claiming that as a result of the financial support the league had been offering the franchise the league itself is in control of the team and that Moyes did not have authority to act as he did Balsillie launched a public relations campaign aiming at igniting Canadian nationalistic feelings and the perception that Bettman had an anti Canadian agenda including a website His bid to purchase the Coyotes failed as the bankruptcy judge ruled his offer did not meet the NHL s rules on relocation br The Hamilton Spectator reported in May that a Vancouver based group led by Tom Gaglardi was planning to make a bid to purchase the Atlanta Thrashers and relocate the team to Hamilton in time for the NHL season This never materialized and the idea was eventually rendered moot by the Thrashers sale and relocation to Winnipeg Gaglardi later purchased the Dallas Stars and kept the team in Dallas br br Under NHL rules an expansion or relocation of a team to Hamilton could potentially be blocked by the Buffalo Sabres or the Toronto Maple Leafs because FirstOntario Centre the likely venue for a Hamilton NHL team is located less than miles kilometres from the Sabres and the Leafs home arenas Roughly of the Sabres business comes from residents of the area of Ontario between Hamilton and Buffalo and the Sabres or the Leafs could require an enormous indemnification payment to allow an additional team to be established within a mile radius An unnamed bidder made a bid for the Sabres in February offering million for the team to move it out of Buffalo which would either mean the team would relocate to Hamilton or it would clear the way for another team to make such a move The bid was rejected in favor of an offer from Terry Pegula who planned to keep the team in Buffalo Relocation to Kitchener Waterloo would avoid the territorial rights compensation as it is more than miles kilometres from Buffalo and Toronto br br br Greater Toronto Area br Although Toronto is already home to the Toronto Maple Leafs and that team s AHL development team the Toronto Marlies its suburbs have been mentioned as potential sites for an NHL franchise under the premise that the Greater Toronto Area or GTA is the most populous metropolitan area in Canada and therefore could support two NHL teams Unlike other potential expansion markets a new arena would need to be constructed and most of the proposals for a new Toronto area team include a new arena along with them br In April a group of businesspeople met with NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly to discuss the possibility of bringing a second NHL franchise into the Toronto area most likely in Vaughan Ontario Despite the talks Daly reportedly stated the NHL is not currently considering expansion nor do we have any intention or desire to relocate an existing franchise br In June a group headed by Andrew Lopez and Herbert Carnegie proposed a billion plan for a second Toronto team called the Legacy to begin play no earlier than The group announced a plan for a seat arena half of which would be priced at C or less The arena would be situated in Downsview Park in the north of the city Twenty five percent of net profits would be given to charity br In a proposal surfaced to build a multi purpose seat arena in Markham Ontario northeast of Toronto that could be used for an NHL team The C million arena was proposed as part of a proposed entertainment complex The company behind the proposal GTA Sports and Entertainment was headed by W Graeme Roustan Roustan a Montreal raised private equity investor whose firm Roustan Capital partnered with Kohlberg Company and purchased Bauer from Nike was also the chairman of Bauer The proposed location for the arena was near the Unionville commuter train station on land owned by Rudy Bratty chairman and CEO of Remington Group an organization that is charged with the development of Markham s downtown However the GTA Sports and Entertainment Group did not file an application for expansion prior to the July deadline in the most recent round of league expansion br br br Saskatoon br Saskatoon came close to landing an NHL team in when Saskatoon native Wild Bill Hunter one of the founders of the World Hockey Association and its Edmonton Oilers led an investment group that made an agreement to purchase the struggling St Louis Blues from Ralston Purina with a plan to relocate the franchise to Saskatchewan in time for the season Hunter secured provincial backing to construct a new NHL sized arena thousands of season ticket deposits a multi million dollar sponsorship arrangement with Molson s and even provisionally hired Don Cherry to coach the team However most NHL owners wary of Saskatoon as a market and of Hunter as a key figure in the WHA were opposed to the move and the NHL s board of governors vetoed the sale Instead the league took over the team and eventually sold it to Harry Ornest who agreed to keep the team in St Louis Even though the scheme fell apart Saskatoon went ahead and constructed a new arena Saskatchewan Place which opened in Hunter made one more attempt to land a team for Saskatoon applying for an expansion franchise during the league s s expansion rush Hunter reportedly raised million but after failing to secure the remaining million he required from the province withdrew the bid br br When the Ice Edge Holdings investment group made a bid to purchase the Phoenix Coyotes in they planned to move a portion of the team s home games to Saskatoon in an effort to maintain the team s viability in its main home in Phoenix similar to the former Bills Toronto Series arrangement in the National Football League The group had leased Saskatoon s SaskTel Centre for five home games in the season The group was believed to lack the funds to buy the team outright but remained in contention as potential minority owner until May when it pulled out of negotiations Some members of the Ice Edge group later joined the ownership group led by Canadian businessman George Gosbee who ultimately purchased the Coyotes and kept them in Arizona br On Ice Management an ownership group backed by auto racer former Moncton Wildcats owner and former professional hockey player John Graham backed a long shot bid to bring the NHL to Saskatoon The Calgary Flames were scheduled to host the Ottawa Senators in Saskatoon for a preseason game sponsored by Graham in September That game led to speculation that the city may host the Flames if the team s regular arena Scotiabank Saddledome which had been damaged in the Alberta floods did not complete its repairs in time for the season In the end repairs were completed on a compressed schedule and the Saddledome reopened in September Although neither Graham nor any other bidder representing Saskatoon placed a bid in the expansion window the city again hosted a neutral site preseason game in br br br Expansion sites in the United States br Several cities in the United States have been mentioned in the media as possible future sites for new or relocated NHL teams In December organizations from Houston Kansas City Las Vegas and Seattle presented their proposals for a franchise to the NHL s executive committee the latter two later received expansion teams with the Vegas Golden Knights joining the NHL in and the Seattle Kraken joining in br br br Atlanta br Formerly the home of the Flames and Thrashers an attempt to bring a third NHL team to Atlanta has been reported as a possibility as part of an arena development plan in the suburbs of Forsyth County called The Gathering at South Forsyth The proposed arena would cost billion USD and would have a seating capacity of for ice hockey br Unrelated to the South Forsyth project former NHL player Anson Carter and several partners announced the formation of Alpharetta Sports Entertainment in early requesting that the NHL begin the expansion process to bring a team to a proposed development in Alpharetta br br br Houston br br Greater Houston is the largest market in terms of both city proper and metro population in the US or Canada without an NHL franchise since Houston is also now the largest metropolitan area without a complete set of teams in the major professional sports leagues The area ranks second in the nation with based Fortune companies only behind New York City which has br Professional ice hockey dates back to in Houston with the establishment of the Houston Skippers This was followed by the Houston Apollos the Houston Aeros of the WHA and the Houston Aeros of the AHL The WHA Houston Aeros were an original member of the World Hockey Association From to the Aeros twice won the AVCO World Trophy and featured the first father son combination to play together in professional hockey Gordie Howe and his two sons Mark and Marty The Aeros despite being a successful franchise were left out of the NHL WHA merger and were forced to fold in Another team also named the Aeros of the American Hockey League AHL played at The Summit renamed the Compaq Center in and converted to a megachurch after the Aeros departure and moved to the Toyota Center in the Aeros were unable to negotiate a lease extension leading to the team s departure from Houston in br The Minnesota North Stars briefly considered Houston when applying for relocation in but ultimately chose Dallas and became the Stars instead due to frosty reception from the Houston Rockets towards the idea of sharing The Summit As part of the lease agreement between Toyota Center which has NHL capacity with seats in its hockey configuration and the Rockets only an NHL team owned by the owner of the Rockets is allowed to play at the arena The Rockets have twice explored the purchase of an NHL team for the building with the closest being then owner Les Alexander s attempt to purchase the Edmonton Oilers in which was thwarted when a local ownership group came together and matched his offer br In the Toyota Center and Houston Rockets were purchased by Tilman Fertitta In a press conference Fertitta expressed his interest in bringing an NHL team to the Toyota Center and he had reportedly met with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman Fertitta has stated his intentions of possibly finding a tenant that could help fill the building throughout the year including the mention of attracting an NHL franchise In it was reported that the Toyota Center was beginning a staged a M renovation of the facility which notably included the installation of permanent ice making equipment In reports indicated that discussions between Fertitta and the NHL were turning more serious and that Fertitta hoped an ice hockey franchise could boost activity in Downtown Houston br br br Phoenix br During the Arizona Coyotes sale to Ryan Smith and relocation to Salt Lake City after the season it was announced that rather than function as an official relocation the Coyotes franchise instead was marked inactive by the NHL with the Utah franchise considered an expansion team in a similar manner to the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens Former Coyotes owner Alex Meruelo remained part of the NHL Board of Governors and retain the rights to the Coyotes brand Meruelo also was granted a five year window to build a new arena in the Phoenix area after which he would have been be awarded a new expansion franchise acting as a reactivated Coyotes br Two months after being granted the aforementioned opportunity Meruelo stepped away as owner of the Coyotes ending the possibility of automatic re activation PHNX Sports journalist Craig Morgan later stated there are other suitors who are interested in bringing an NHL team back and Phoenix remains on the table for future expansion br br br Other locations br During the All Star Weekend commissioner Gary Bettman publicly listed six cities that had expressed interest in expansion besides the aforementioned Atlanta and Houston as well as the later awarded Salt Lake City commissioner Bettman also noted that groups from Cincinnati Kansas City and Omaha had reached out to the league br Cincinnati s professional hockey lineage includes the World Hockey Association s Cincinnati Stingers for whom future Hockey Hall of Famers Mike Gartner and Mark Messier played as well as the American Hockey League s Cincinnati Mighty Ducks and multiple incarnations of the now ECHL Cincinnati Cyclones Potential expansion however is made difficult by the need to replace the aging Heritage Bank Center with a more modern arena as well as a lack of interested ownership br br Kansas City previously hosted the NHL s Kansas City Scouts who played two seasons at Kemper Arena from to the team ultimately relocated to Denver to become the Colorado Rockies owing to poor attendance and on ice performance in Kansas City The city has since hosted a succession of minor league teams most recently the currently active Kansas City Mavericks of the ECHL it was also a candidate for relocating the Pittsburgh Penguins in though this did not materialize The T Mobile Center is capable of hosting an NHL team having previously hosted St Louis Blues preseason games and both local officials including Mayor Quinton Lucas and prominent Kansas City individuals including Mavericks owner Lamar Hunt Jr and Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes have expressed interest in either expansion or the relocation of an existing team However no interested ownership groups have publicly come forward with Hunt previously describing the NHL s million USD expansion fee as ridiculously big in and later stating in that an expansion team doesn t seem realistic br Omaha has had a comparatively limited hockey history with its professional lineage limited to multiple incarnations of the minor league Omaha Knights Omaha Ak Sar Ben Knights The city currently hosts NCAA collegiate hockey at the Division I level with the University of Nebraska Omaha Mavericks and USHL junior hockey with the Omaha Lancers While Omaha currently lacks an NHL capable venue local property developer Rod Yates has publicly stated a desire to build an arena in Gretna as part of a proposed Good Life District surrounding the Nebraska Crossing lifestyle center Yates and Governor Jim Pillen additionally met with NHL officials in New York City in February in order to pitch the league on expansion br br br Expansion outside Canada and the United States br Speculation about NHL expansion to Europe took place as far back as the s David Molson then owner of the Montreal Canadiens stated that he looked forward to a world playoff for the Stanley Cup In Clarence Campbell president of the NHL was quoted as saying It is conceivable that the Stanley Cup will be played for in Moscow in the not too distant future When it does the World Tournament as we know it will just disappear The game will continue to expand br Although no European cities have been named in recent years NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly stated in that expansion into Europe was a possibility within years time In August the International Ice Hockey Federation president Ren Fasel stated that he would strongly oppose any expansion by the NHL into European markets Time zone complications would also be an obstacle was also the year that the Russian Superleague evolved into the Kontinental Hockey League which is recognized as one of the world s premier professional leagues after the NHL and has grown to include several other European
