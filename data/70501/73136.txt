id: 73136
The Los Angeles Kings are a professional ice hockey team based in Los Angeles The Kings compete in the National Hockey League NHL as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference and was founded on June after Jack Kent Cooke was awarded an NHL expansion franchise for Los Angeles on February becoming one of the six teams that began play as part of the NHL expansion The team plays its home games at Crypto com Arena in Downtown Los Angeles their home since the start of the season Prior to that the Kings played for years at the Forum in Inglewood California a suburb of Los Angeles br During the s and early s the Kings had many years marked by impressive play in the regular season only to be washed out by early playoff exits Their highlights in those years included the strong goaltending of Rogie Vachon and the Triple Crown Line of Charlie Simmer Dave Taylor and Hall of Famer Marcel Dionne who had a famous upset of the rising Edmonton Oilers in a playoff game known as the Miracle on Manchester In the Kings traded with the Oilers to get their captain Wayne Gretzky leading to a successful phase of the franchise that raised hockey s popularity in Los Angeles and helped elevate the sport s profile in the American Sun Belt region Gretzky fellow Hall of Famer Luc Robitaille and defenseman Rob Blake led the Kings to the franchise s sole division title in and the Kings first Stanley Cup Finals appearance in where they lost to the Montreal Canadiens br After the Finals the Kings entered financial problems with a bankruptcy in which led to the franchise being acquired by Philip Anschutz the owner of Anschutz Entertainment Group and the operators of Crypto com Arena and Edward P Roski A period of mediocrity ensued with the Kings only resurging as they broke a six year playoff drought in the season with a team that included goaltender Jonathan Quick defenseman Drew Doughty and forwards Dustin Brown Anze Kopitar and Justin Williams Under coach Darryl Sutter who was hired early in the season and with the acquisition of Jeff Carter the Kings won two Stanley Cups in three years over the New Jersey Devils and over the New York Rangers while Quick and Williams respectively won the Conn Smythe Trophy br br br Franchise history br br br NHL expansion and the Forum Blue and Gold years br br When the NHL decided to expand for the season amid rumblings that the Western Hockey League WHL was proposing to turn itself into a major league and compete for the Stanley Cup Canadian entrepreneur Jack Kent Cooke paid the NHL million to place one of the six expansion teams in Los Angeles Following a fan contest to name the team Cooke chose the name Kings because he wanted his club to take on an air of royalty and picked the original team colors of purple or Forum Blue as it was later officially called and gold because they were colors traditionally associated with royalty This color scheme first popularized by the NCAA s LSU Tigers and later on the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League NFL was then adopted by the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association NBA which Cooke also owned Cooke wanted his new NHL team to play in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena home of the Lakers but the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission which managed the Sports Arena and still manages the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum today had already entered into an agreement with the WHL s Los Angeles Blades whose owners had also tried to land the NHL expansion franchise in Los Angeles to play their games at the Sports Arena Frustrated by his dealings with the Coliseum Commission Cooke said I am going to build my own arena I ve had enough of this balderdash br Construction on Cooke s new arena the Forum was not yet complete when the season began so the Kings opened their first season at the Long Beach Arena in the neighboring city of Long Beach on October defeating another expansion team the Philadelphia Flyers The Fabulous Forum finally opened its doors on December with the Kings being shut out by the Flyers While the first two seasons had the Kings qualifying for the playoffs afterwards poor management led the Kings into hard times The general managers established a history of trading away first round draft picks usually for veteran players and attendance suffered during this time Eventually the Kings made a few key acquisitions to resurge as a contender By acquiring Toronto Maple Leafs winger Bob Pulford who would later become the Kings head coach in Finnish center Juha Widing in a trade from the New York Rangers and Montreal Canadiens goaltender Rogie Vachon in the Kings went from being one of the worst defensive teams in the league to one of the best and in they returned to the playoffs br br br Marcel Dionne and the Triple Crown Line br After being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in both and the Kings moved to significantly upgrade their offensive firepower when they acquired center Marcel Dionne from the Detroit Red Wings Behind Dionne s offensive prowess the strong goaltending of Rogie Vachon and the speed and scoring touch of forward Butch Goring the Kings played two of their most thrilling seasons yet with playoff match ups against the then Atlanta Flames in the first round and the Boston Bruins in the second round both times being eliminated by Boston br br Bob Pulford left the Kings after the season after constant feuding with then owner Jack Kent Cooke and General Manager Jake Milford decided to leave as well This led to struggles in the season where the Kings finished below and were easily swept out of the first round by the Maple Leafs Afterwards Vachon became a free agent and sign with the Red Wings The following season Kings coach Bob Berry tried juggling line combinations and Dionne found himself on a new line with two young mostly unknown players second year right winger Dave Taylor and left winger Charlie Simmer who had been a career minor leaguer Each player benefited from each other with Simmer being the gritty player who battled along the boards Taylor being the play maker and Dionne being the natural goal scorer This line combination known as the Triple Crown Line would go on to become one of the highest scoring line combinations in NHL history During the first three seasons of the Triple Crown Line a period where Dr Jerry Buss purchased the Kings the Lakers and the Forum for million the Kings were eliminated in the first round The Kings regressed in finishing th overall but this was nevertheless good enough to make the Stanley Cup playoffs under the new format put in place that year as they were still fourth in their division with points the lowest point total of any playoff team but ahead of the Colorado Rockies the worst team in the league that season However Los Angeles managed to upset the second overall Edmonton Oilers who finished points ahead of them during the season and were led by the young Wayne Gretzky With two victories in Edmonton and one at the Forum dubbed Miracle on Manchester where the Kings managed to erase a deficit at the third period and eventually win in overtime the Kings upset the vaunted Oilers but they wound up eliminated by eventual finalists Vancouver Canucks in five games br The off season saw the moribund Rockies move to East Rutherford New Jersey To keep the divisions geographically and numerically balanced the renamed New Jersey Devils were re aligned to the Patrick Division while the Winnipeg Jets took their place in the Smythe Division It was immediately apparent that the Kings now the lone American team in the division would have a much more difficult time staying out of last place since Winnipeg after struggling for their first two seasons after moving over from the WHA had already improved to a record the previous season Despite Dionne s leadership the Kings missed the playoffs in the next two seasons br The Kings managed to record a winning record in under coach Pat Quinn although it was still only good enough for fourth place This time the Kings were quickly swept out of the playoffs by the Oilers on their way to capturing their second straight Stanley Cup championship After a losing season in the Kings saw two important departures during as Quinn signed a contract in December to become coach and general manager of the Vancouver Canucks with just months left on his Kings contract eventually being suspended by NHL President John Ziegler for creating a conflict of interest and Dionne left the franchise in March in a trade to the New York Rangers Despite these shocks a young squad that would lead the Kings into the next decade including star forwards Bernie Nicholls Jimmy Carson Luc Robitaille and defenseman Steve Duchesne started to flourish under head coach Mike Murphy who played thirteen season with the Kings and was their captain for seven years and his replacement Robbie Ftorek The Kings made the playoffs for two seasons but they were unable to get out of the first round given the playoff structuring forced them to play either the Oilers or the equally powerful Calgary Flames en route to the Conference Finals In all the Kings faced either the Oilers or the Flames in the playoffs four times during the s br br br The Gretzky era br br In coin collector Bruce McNall purchased the Kings from Buss and turned the team into a Stanley Cup contender almost overnight After changing the team colors to silver and black McNall acquired the league s best player Wayne Gretzky in a blockbuster trade with the Edmonton Oilers on August The trade rocked the hockey world especially north of the border where Canadians mourned the loss of a player they considered a national treasure Gretzky s arrival generated much excitement about hockey and the NHL in Southern California and the ensuing popularity of the Kings is credited for the arrival of another team in the region the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim renamed the Anaheim Ducks in as well as the arrival of a new team in Northern California the San Jose Sharks and the NHL s expanding or moving into other Sun Belt cities such as Dallas Phoenix Tampa Miami Nashville and Las Vegas br In Gretzky s first season with the Kings he led the team in scoring with points on goals and assists and won his ninth Hart Memorial Trophy as the league s Most Valuable Player The fourth overall Kings eliminated Gretzky s old team the Oilers in the first round of the playoffs before being swept out in the second round by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Flames Clashes between Gretzky and head coach Robbie Ftorek led to Ftorek s dismissal and he was replaced by Tom Webster The next season where Gretzky became the league s all time leading scorer was the inverse of its predecessor with the Kings eliminating the defending champion Flames before falling to the eventual champion Oilers Gretzky spearheaded the Kings to their first regular season division title in franchise history in the season but the heavily favored Kings lost a close series against Edmonton in the second round that saw four games go into overtime After a third straight elimination by the Oilers in Webster was fired General manager Rogie Vachon was moved to a different position in the organization and named Nick Beverley as his successor and Beverley hired Barry Melrose then with the American Hockey League s Adirondack Red Wings as head coach br Melrose would help the Kings reach new heights in the season even if Gretzky missed games with a career threatening herniated thoracic disk Led by Luc Robitaille who served as captain in Gretzky s absence the Kings finished with a record points clinching third place in the Smythe Division Heavily contested series in the playoffs had the Kings eliminating the Flames Canucks and Leafs en route to their first berth in the Stanley Cup Finals In the Stanley Cup Finals the Kings faced the Montreal Canadiens They won the first game but late in Game with the Kings leading by a score of Canadiens coach Jacques Demers requested a measurement of Kings defenseman Marty McSorley s stick blade His suspicions proved to be correct as the curve of blade was too great and McSorley was penalized The Canadiens pulled their goaltender Patrick Roy giving them a two man advantage and Eric Desjardins scored on the resulting power play to tie the game Montreal went on to win the game in overtime on another goal by Desjardins and the Kings never recovered They dropped the next two games in overtime and lost Game giving the Canadiens their league leading th Stanley Cup in franchise history br br br Bankruptcy move to the Staples Center and rebuild br The years after the playoff run were tough for the Kings as a sluggish start in the season cost them a playoff berth their first absence from the postseason since However Gretzky provided a notable highlight during that year on March when he scored his nd career goal to pass Gordie Howe as the NHL s all time leading goal scorer At the same time McNall defaulted on a loan from Bank of America who threatened to force the Kings into bankruptcy unless he sold the team After the federal government launched an investigation into his financial practices McNall finally sold the club to IDB Communications founder Jeffrey Sudikoff and former Madison Square Garden president Joseph Cohen It later emerged that McNall s free spending ways put the Kings in serious financial trouble at one point Cohen and Sudikoff were even unable to meet player payroll and were ultimately forced into bankruptcy in They were forced to trade many of their stronger players and the middling results led to Gretzky demanding a trade to a legitimate Stanley Cup contender He would be dealt to the St Louis Blues in br br On October one day before the season opener a bankruptcy court approved the purchase of the Kings by Philip Anschutz and Edward P Roski for million The subsequent rebuild saw the Kings only return to the playoffs in led by captain Rob Blake and players like Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray where the highly skilled St Louis Blues swept the team in four games The Kings suffered through an injury plagued season in as they finished last in the Pacific Division and missed the playoffs with a record leading to the dismissal of head coach Larry Robinson br The Kings along with the Los Angeles Lakers made an even bigger move in as they left The Forum after seasons and moved to the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles which was built by Anschutz and Roski Staples Center was a state of the art arena complete with luxury suites and all modern amenities With a new home a new coach Andy Murray a potential goal scorer in the fold in Zigmund Palffy and players such as Blake Robitaille Murray Stumpel Donald Audette Ian Laperri re and Mattias Norstrom the Kings improved dramatically finishing the season the season with a record points good for second place in the Pacific Division While Audette would struggle under the Kings system and was unhappy as the number two right wing most of the new Kings like Bryan Smolinski and Palffy would find success under Andy Murray But in the playoffs the Kings were once again dispatched in the first round this time by the Detroit Red Wings in a four game sweep br The season was controversial as fans began to question AEG s commitment to the success of the Kings because they failed to significantly improve the team during the off season Adding fuel to the fire was the February trade of star defenseman and fan favorite Rob Blake to the Colorado Avalanche Despite this two players received in the deal right wing Adam Deadmarsh and defenseman Aaron Miller became impact players for the Kings who finished the season with a record points good for a third place finish in the Pacific Division and another first round playoff date with the Detroit Red Wings The heavily favored Red Wings suffered an upset losing in six games for the Kings first playoff series win since In the second round the Kings forced seven games in their series against the Avalanche but lost to the eventual Stanley Cup champions br Afterwards during the off season Luc Robitaille turned down a one year deal with a substantial pay cut and ended up signing with Detroit as the Red Wings represented his best chance at winning the Stanley Cup and like Tomas Sandstrom before him in Robitaille won the Stanley Cup with Detroit in The Kings started off the season with a sluggish October and November and then found their game again to finish with points They in fact were tied in points with the second place Phoenix Coyotes and only finished third in the Pacific Division and seventh in the West due to a head to head record the Coyotes won the season series In the playoffs they met the Colorado Avalanche once again this time in the first round The series would prove to be a carbon copy of their previous meeting with the Kings behind three games to one and bouncing back to tie the series only to be dominated in the seventh game and eliminated The next seasons would be major disappointments as the Kings hit another major decline missing the postseason up until the season br During those mediocre seasons there would be a few bright spots in the form of draft picks that would attribute to future success for the team beginning with the NHL entry draft Players such as Dustin Brown Anze Kopitar Jonathan Quick both and Drew Doughty were drafted and would help the Kings reach the playoffs once again br br br Return to the playoffs br br During the season the team had built a consistent roster with goaltender Jonathan Quick defenseman Drew Doughty and forwards Dustin Brown Anze Kopitar and Justin Williams Finishing sixth overall in the West with points just the third plus point season in franchise history and establishing a franchise record with a nine game unbeaten streak the Kings returned to the playoffs where they lost to a highly skilled Vancouver Canucks team in six games The Kings entered the playoffs as the seventh seed in the West and played San Jose in the first round Despite Anze Kopitar s absence with injury the Kings pushed the series to six games until an overtime goal by Joe Thornton qualified the Sharks br br br Stanley Cup championships br A bad start to the season resulted in coach Terry Murray being fired with Darryl Sutter being chosen as his replacement The Kings were much improved under Sutter finishing with the eighth seed after trading for Jeff Carter midseason and having finishing the season with a record for points The Kings then headed into the playoffs against the back to back Presidents Trophy winning Vancouver Canucks After playing two games in Vancouver and one in Los Angeles the Kings were up in the series a franchise first By winning Game in Vancouver in overtime the Kings advanced to the Conference Semi finals for the first time since the season whereupon they swept the second seeded St Louis Blues advancing to the Western Conference Finals for only the second time in franchise history In doing so the Kings also became the first NHL team to enter the playoffs as the eighth seed and eliminate the first and second seeded teams in the Conference They then defeated Phoenix in five games to reach the Finals culminating in an overtime goal by Dustin Penner in Game and thus becoming the second team in NHL history to beat the top three Conference seeds in the playoffs the Calgary Flames achieved the same feat in ironically also under Darryl Sutter and the first eighth seed to accomplish the feat br Los Angeles faced the New Jersey Devils in the Final defeating them in six games to win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history With the Game victory occurring on home ice at Staples Center the Kings became the first team since the Anaheim Ducks to win the Stanley Cup at home as well as the second Californian NHL team to do so The Kings became the first eight seed champion in any of the North American major leagues the first Stanley Cup champion that finished below fifth in its conference and the third to finish below second in its division after the Canadiens and the Devils Goaltender Jonathan Quick was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player during the playoffs and soon after signed a ten year contract extension on June br br Due to the NHL lockout the NHL season began on January and was shortened to games The Kings finished the season as the fifth seed in the West and began the defense of the Cup on the road against the St Louis Blues who they swept in the playoffs After losing the first two games the Kings won four in a row to eliminate the Blues in six games In the second round they then played a very tough San Jose Sharks team this time with home ice advantage In the first game Jarret Stoll suffered an injury from the Sharks Raffi Torres who ended up being suspended for the rest of the series The Kings eventually won in seven games In the Western Conference Finals they faced the number one seed in the West and Presidents Trophy winning Chicago Blackhawks After dropping the first two games the Kings won Game with Jeff Carter suffering an injury from Blackhawks defenseman Duncan Keith who was suspended for Game as a result After losing Game the Kings battled the Blackhawks through two overtime periods in Game with Patrick Kane eventually scoring the game winning goal that won the game and the series sending the Blackhawks to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Boston Bruins whom they defeated in six games for their second Stanley Cup in four season and ending the Kings season br During the season the Kings acquired Marian Gaborik and qualified for their fifth straight playoffs with the sixth best result of the West In the first round of the playoffs the Kings played their in state rivals the San Jose Sharks After losing the first three games to the Sharks the Kings became the fourth team in NHL history to win the final four games in a row after initially being down three games to none beating the Sharks in San Jose in the deciding Game In the second round the Kings played another in state rival Anaheim After starting the series with two wins the Kings lost three straight games trailing the series three games to two However for the second time in the first two rounds of the playoffs the Kings were able to rally back after being down in the series and defeated the Ducks in Anaheim in Game In the third round the Kings jumped out to a three games to one lead against Stanley Cup defending Chicago but were unable to close out the series in the fifth and sixth games On June the Kings advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the second time in three years after winning Game in overtime through a goal from Alec Martinez clinching their third Western Conference title in franchise history The Kings became the first team in NHL history to win three Game s en route to a Stanley Cup Finals berth Not only were the Kings the first team in history to accomplish this feat but they also managed to win all game sevens on opposing ice For the third time the Kings were finalists after finishing third in their division and sixth or lower in their conference br br In the Final the Kings faced the Eastern Conference winning New York Rangers who had defeated the Montreal Canadiens in six games in the Eastern Finals The Kings won the Stanley Cup in five games culminating with an Alec Martinez goal in the second overtime of Game at Staples Center The championship run had a record tying playoff games the Philadelphia Flyers and Calgary Flames being the others with the Kings facing elimination a record seven times With their Game victory in the Conference Finals and wins in the first two games of the Cup Finals they became the first team to win three consecutive playoff games after trailing by more than one goal in each game Justin Williams who scored twice in the Finals and had points in all three Game s throughout the playoffs won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP br br br Post Stanley Cup titles and continued contention present br Having won two Stanley Cup championships in the last three years the Kings entered the season as the early favorites to retain their title However the Kings struggled often with scoring slumps defensemen losing games to injury and suspensions and frequent road losses A defeat to the Calgary Flames in the penultimate game of the season eliminated the Kings from playoff contention while qualifying Calgary which coincidentally missed the postseason during the Kings five season playoff streak Despite finishing with a record of the Kings became the first defending Stanley Cup champion to miss the postseason since the Carolina Hurricanes and only the fourth overall since the NHL expansion season br br At the start of the season the Kings were expected to make the playoffs They entered the playoffs as the fifth seed in their conference and second seed in their division They faced the San Jose Sharks but lost to them in five games On June the Kings named Anze Kopitar the th captain in team history replacing Dustin Brown who had led the team for the past eight seasons br The Kings celebrated their th anniversary during the season along with the other still active expansion teams the St Louis Blues Philadelphia Flyers and Pittsburgh Penguins and for the first time since they hosted the NHL All Star Game Jeff Carter and Drew Doughty would represent the Kings at the All Star Game with the former leading the team in scoring this season Goaltender Jonathan Quick suffered an injury on opening night that sidelined him for most of the season and the Kings struggled without him Backup Peter Budaj filled the void earning his first starting duties since his time with the Colorado Avalanche six years earlier but near the trade deadline the Kings traded him to Tampa Bay for another goaltender Ben Bishop who shared the crease with Jonathan Quick down the stretch the superstar having returned from his injury Despite the trade the Kings ultimately missed the playoffs for the second time in three seasons and in the off season fired general manager Dean Lombardi and head coach Darryl Sutter Assistant general manager Rob Blake was promoted to be the new general manager and John Stevens took over as head coach after serving as associate head coach for the Kings for several seasons In the NHL expansion draft the Vegas Golden Knights drafted defenseman Brayden McNabb who had been left unprotected by the Kings In the next season the Kings clinched the playoffs as a wild card but were swept by the expansion Golden Knights br On November the Kings fired Stevens as head coach after the team started the season and replaced him with Willie Desjardins In Desjardins debut on November the Kings defeated the Ducks The Kings finished the season in last place in both the Pacific Division and Western Conference with points and they missed the playoffs for the third time in five seasons br The Kings hired Todd McLellan as their next head coach on April The season was highlighted by several rebuilding moves as players such as Trevor Lewis Jack Campbell Kyle Clifford Derek Forbort and Alec Martinez would all depart the team through trades or in Lewis case via free agency The team notably won the NHL Stadium Series in a win over the Colorado Avalanche which saw Tyler Toffoli score the league s first hat trick in an outdoor regular season game Toffoli was traded to the Vancouver Canucks two days after the feat In their later portion of the season the Kings called up several prospects including Mikey Anderson Gabriel Vilardi and Cal Petersen as the team went on a seven game win streak showcasing their deep and talented prospect pool However this win streak would mark the end of their season the NHL would pause its season due to the COVID pandemic and as part of their plan to return to play the regular season was officially ended and the Kings were one of seven teams left out of the playoffs They were automatically entered into the first phase of the NHL draft lottery in which the Kings received the second overall pick br In the season the Kings had another

during the off season They also signed defenseman Alexander Edler in an effort to bolster their blue line presence The Kings qualified for the playoffs for the first time in four seasons despite losing Drew Doughty to injury This season would also prove to be Dustin Brown s last as the forward announced on April that he would retire following the playoffs They were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers in seven games in the First Round br During the off season the Kings acquired Kevin Fiala from the Minnesota Wild to replace Brown on the first line The season would start off well as Fiala would lead the team in points for much of the season and be elected to the All Star Game Clinching the playoffs the Kings once again faced the Edmonton Oilers in the First Round this time losing in six games br The Kings made a blockbuster move in the off season trading forwards Gabriel Vilardi Alex Iafallo and Rasmus Kupari to the Winnipeg Jets in exchange for forward Pierre Luc Dubois who signed an eight year million contract upon being traded br The Kings season got off to a strong start as the team began the season with an record on the road breaking the NHL record previously held by the Buffalo Sabres for the longest unbeaten road streak to start the year Goaltender Cam Talbot s resurgent play lead to him being named to the NHL All Star Weekend However in January the Kings season collapsed despite making no major lineup or personnel changes the Kings suddenly won just three of their final seventeen games before the all star break On February the Kings fired head coach McLellan with assistant Jim Hiller named interim head coach Under Hiller the Kings regained their footing but never fully returned to their stronger form from earlier in the season They finished third in the playoffs where they would yet again be eliminated by the Oilers for the third year in a row br Hiller was subsequently promoted to full time head coach following the season Much discussion during and after the Kings season centered around Pierre Luc Dubois as his season in Los Angeles was largely underwhelming Dubois only managed goals and points and finished with a plus minus rating of despite the heavy expectations that came with his new deal His first season with the Kings would be his only one as he would be traded in a one for one deal to the Washington Capitals in exchange for goaltender Darcy Kuemper who had previously spent time with the Kings br br br Team identity br br br Uniforms and logos br br The Los Angeles Kings debuted in the NHL wearing purple officially the
