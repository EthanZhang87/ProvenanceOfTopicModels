Alabama AL BAM is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States It borders Tennessee to the north Georgia to the east Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south and Mississippi to the west Alabama is the th largest by area and the th most populous of the U S states br Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State after the state bird Alabama is also known as the Heart of Dixie and the Cotton State The state has diverse geography with the north dominated by the mountainous Tennessee Valley and the south by Mobile Bay a historically significant port Alabama s capital is Montgomery and its largest city by population and area is Huntsville Its oldest city is Mobile founded by French colonists Alabama Creoles in as the capital of French Louisiana Greater Birmingham is Alabama s largest metropolitan area and its economic center Politically as part of the Deep South Alabama is predominantly a conservative state and is known for its Southern culture Within Alabama American football particularly at the college level plays a major part of the state s culture br Originally home to many native tribes present day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century The British won the territory in until losing it in the American Revolutionary War Spain held Mobile as part of Spanish West Florida until In December Alabama was recognized as a state During the antebellum period Alabama was a major producer of cotton and widely used African American slave labor In the state seceded from the United States to become part of the Confederate States of America with Montgomery acting as its first capital and rejoined the Union in Following the American Civil War Alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship in part due to agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the state s economy Similar to other former slave states Alabamian legislators employed Jim Crow laws from the late th century up until the s High profile events such as the Selma to Montgomery march made the state a major focal point of the civil rights movement in the s and s br During and after World War II Alabama grew as the state s economy diversified with new industries NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville would help Alabama s economic growth in the mid to late th century by developing an aerospace industry Alabama s economy in the st century is based on automotive finance tourism manufacturing aerospace mineral extraction healthcare education retail and technology br br br Etymology br The European American naming of the Alabama River and state was derived from the Alabama people a Muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river In the Alabama language the word for a person of Alabama lineage is Albaamo or variously Albaama or Alb amo in different dialects the plural form is Albaamaha The word s spelling varies significantly among historical sources The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of Garcilaso de la Vega used Alibamo while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu respectively in transliterations of the term As early as the French called the tribe the Alibamon with French maps identifying the river as Rivi re des Alibamons Other spellings of the name have included Alibamu Alabamo Albama Alebamon Alibama Alibamou Alabamu and Allibamou The use of state names derived from Native American languages is common in the U S an estimated states have names of Native American origin br Sources disagree on the word s meaning Some scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather The meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants The state has numerous place names of Native American origin br An article in the Jacksonville Republican proposed it meant Here We Rest This notion was popularized in the s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek Experts in the Muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation br br br History br br br Pre European settlement br br Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization Trade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period BCE CE and continued until European contact br The agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from to CE with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville Alabama This is the second largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era after Cahokia in present day Illinois which was the center of the culture Analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex SECC Contrary to popular belief the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture but developed independently The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood br Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in present day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee an Iroquoian language people and the Muskogean speaking Alabama Alibamu Chickasaw Choctaw Creek and Koasati While part of the same large language family the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages br br br European settlement br br The Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama during their exploration of North America in the th century The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila and other parts of the state in More than years later the French founded the region s first European settlement at Old Mobile in The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in This area was claimed by the French from to as part of La Louisiane br After the French lost to the British in the Seven Years War it became part of British West Florida from to After the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War the territory was divided between the United States and Spain The latter retained control of this western territory from until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U S forces on April br Thomas Bassett a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early s The district s boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County northernmost Mobile County and most of Washington County br What are now Baldwin and Mobile counties became part of Spanish West Florida in part of the independent Republic of West Florida in and finally part of the Mississippi Territory in Most of what is now the northern two thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from onwards Following the Revolutionary War it remained a part of Georgia although heavily disputed br With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands what is now the lower one third of Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in following the Yazoo land scandal Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the Adams On s Treaty officially ceded it to the United States in br br br th century br br Before Mississippi s admission to statehood on December the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory The United States Congress created the Alabama Territory on March St Stephens now abandoned served as the territorial capital from to br Alabama was admitted as the nd state on December with Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention From July to August delegates met to prepare the new state constitution Huntsville served as temporary capital from to when the seat of government moved to Cahaba in Dallas County br Cahaba now a ghost town was the first permanent state capital from to The Alabama Fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the Union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation Part of the frontier in the s and s its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men br br Southeastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded The economy of the central Black Belt named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew mainly from slave labor The area also drew many poor disenfranchised people who became subsistence farmers Alabama had an estimated population of under people in but it increased to more than people by Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in br From to Tuscaloosa served as Alabama s capital On January the Alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery The first legislative session in the new capital met in December A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia The first structure burned down in but was rebuilt on the same site in This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter Maine br br br Civil War and Reconstruction br br By the population had increased to people of which nearly half were enslaved African Americans and were free people of color On January Alabama declared its secession from the Union After remaining an independent republic for a few days it joined the Confederate States of America The Confederacy s capital was initially at Montgomery Alabama was heavily involved in the American Civil War Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state Alabama contributed about soldiers to the war effort br br A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville Alabama joined Nathan Bedford Forrest s battalion in Hopkinsville Kentucky The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coattails This led to them being greeted with Yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army br Alabama s slaves were freed by the th Amendment in Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May until its official restoration to the Union in From to with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African American congressmen Jeremiah Haralson Benjamin S Turner and James T Rapier br Following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton During Reconstruction state legislators ratified a new state constitution in which created the state s first public school system and expanded women s rights Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation Organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans Besides the short lived original Ku Klux Klan these included the Pale Faces Knights of the White Camellia Red Shirts and the White League br Reconstruction in Alabama ended in when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor s office through an election dominated by fraud and violence They wrote another constitution in and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools The same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools Railroad passenger cars were segregated in br br br th century br br The new Constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans and tens of thousands of poor European Americans through making voter registration difficult requiring a poll tax and literacy test The constitution required racial segregation of public schools By only African Americans were registered in Alabama although at least were literate This compared to more than African Americans eligible to vote in The numbers dropped even more in later decades The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the s jails were segregated in hospitals in toilets hotels and restaurants in and bus stop waiting rooms in br While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax By whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws whites vs African Americans Nearly all Blacks had lost the ability to vote Despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens br The rural dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas They often donated land and labor as well br br Beginning in the first Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African American children A total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places br Continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South Reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in Alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from to br At the same time many rural people migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs Birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the Magic City By Birmingham was the th largest city in the United States Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy Its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution This did not change until the late s following a lawsuit and court order br br Beginning in the s when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters the Alabama legislature took several counter steps designed to disfranchise black voters The legislature passed and the voters ratified as these were mostly white voters a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants Black citizens in Mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment The legislature also changed the boundaries of Tuskegee to a sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial gerrymandering violated the Constitution In the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections br Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile Between and more than people moved into the city to work for war related industries Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base br Despite massive population changes in the state from to the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas One result was that Jefferson County containing Birmingham s industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature A study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature br In the United States Supreme Court cases of Baker v Carr and Reynolds v Sims the court ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties br African Americans continued to press in the s and s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges In the U S Supreme Court ruled in Brown v Board of Education that public schools had to be desegregated but Alabama was slow to comply During the s under Governor George Wallace Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama including the Montgomery bus boycott Freedom Rides in and Selma to Montgomery marches These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of and Voting Rights Act of by the U S Congress br Legal segregation ended in the states in but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court According to The New York Times by many of Alabama s African Americans were living in Alabama s cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery Also the Black Belt region across central Alabama is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African American These counties include Dallas Lowndes Marengo and Perry br In for the first time since the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census This benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts br Alabama has made some changes since the late th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation In the s an omnibus redistricting case Dillard v Crenshaw County challenged the at large voting for representative seats of Alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards At large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county as the majority tended to take all seats Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at large jurisdictions br As part of settlement of this case five Alabama cities and counties including Chilton County adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi seat jurisdictions This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters In another form of proportional representation jurisdictions use limited voting as in Conecuh County In limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens br Beginning in the s the state s economy shifted away from its traditional lumber steel and textile industries because of increased foreign competition Steel jobs for instance declined from in to in However the state particularly Huntsville benefited from the opening of the George C Marshall Space Flight Center in a major facility in the development of the Saturn rocket program and the space shuttle Technology and manufacturing industries such as automobile assembly replaced some the state s older industries in the late twentieth century but the state s economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area such as Georgia and Florida br br br st century br In Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore installed a statue of the Ten Commandments in the capitol in Montgomery In the th US Circuit Court ordered the statue removed but Moore refused to follow the court order which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument The monument was removed in August br A few natural disasters have occurred in the state in the twenty first century In Hurricane Ivan a category storm upon landfall struck the state and caused over billion of damage It was among the most destructive storms to strike the state in its modern history A super outbreak of tornadoes hit the state in April and killed people devastating many communities br br br Geography br br Alabama is the thirtieth largest state in the United States with square miles km of total area of the area is water making

natural disaster A foot m wide meteorite hit the area about million years ago The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme star wound because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface In Christian

Coast around Mobile Bay averages between and days per year with thunder reported This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about days per year Occasionally thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita br br Alabama along with Oklahoma and Iowa has the most confirmed F and EF tornadoes of any state according to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January to June Several long tracked F EF tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since than any other state The state was affected by the Super Outbreak and was devastated tremendously by the Super Outbreak The Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state The tally reached br The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring The northern part along the Tennessee River Valley is most vulnerable The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is

as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation the Native American peoples who have sometimes been of mixed race have

br The foundational document for Alabama s government is the Alabama Constitution the current one having been adopted in The Alabama constitution adopted in was with over amendments and almost words by some accounts the world s longest constitution and roughly forty times the length of the United States Constitution br There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama s constitution Critics have argued that Alabama s constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature leaving practically no power in local hands Most counties do not have home rule Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and frequently by state referendum The former constitution was particularly criticized for its complexity and length intentionally codifying segregation and racism br br Alabama s government is divided into three coequal branches The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives with members and the Alabama Senate with members The Legislature is responsible for writing debating passing or defeating state legislation The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority most state Legislatures require a two thirds majority to override a veto br Until the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county with one per county It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in as a result urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either In Reynolds v Sims the U S Supreme Court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented Further the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems br At that time Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas For instance Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one third of the state budget but Jefferson County received only th of state services in funding Through the legislative delegations the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments br br The executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws It is headed by the governor of Alabama Other members of the executive branch include the cabinet the lieutenant governor of Alabama the Attorney General of Alabama the Alabama Secretary of State the Alabama State Treasurer and the State Auditor of Alabama The current governor is Republican Kay Ivey br The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections Statewide officials such as the governor lieutenant governor attorney general and other constitutional officers take office the following January br The judiciary is responsible for interpreting the Constitution of Alabama and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases The state s highest court is the Supreme Court of Alabama Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges Since the s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized The current chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party There are two intermediate appellate courts the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals and four trial courts the circuit court trial court of general jurisdiction and the district probate and municipal courts br Alabama has the death penalty with authorized methods of execution that include the electric chair and the gas chamber Some critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country In some years it imposes more death sentences than does Texas a state which has a population five times larger However executions per capita are significantly higher in Texas Some of its cases have been highly controversial the U S Supreme Court has overturned convictions in death penalty cases It was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence in cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole that were voted unanimously by juries This judicial authority was removed in April br On May Alabama passed the Human Life Protection Act banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy unless there is a serious health risk with no exceptions for rape and incest The law subjects doctors who perform abortions with to years imprisonment The law was originally supposed to take effect the following November but on October U S District Judge Myron Thompson blocked the law from taking effect due to it being in conflict with the U S Supreme Court case Roe v Wade On June after the U S Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in Dobbs v Jackson Women s Health Organization Judge Thompson lifted the injunction allowing the law to go into effect br Alabama is one of the very few states that does not allow the creation of state lotteries br br br Taxes br Taxes are collected by the Alabama Department of Revenue Alabama levies a or personal income tax depending on the amount earned and filing status Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax even if taking the standard deduction those who itemize can also deduct FICA the Social Security and Medicare tax br The state s general sales tax rate is Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases For example the total sales tax rate in Mobile County Alabama is and there is an additional restaurant tax of which means a diner in Mobile County Alabama would pay an tax on a meal br In sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted for of all state and local revenue Only Alabama Mississippi and South Dakota tax groceries at the full state sales tax rate br The corporate income tax rate in Alabama is The overall federal state and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax burdened state in the country Property taxes of of assessed value per year are the second lowest in the U S after Hawaii The state constitution currently requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes br br br County and local governments br br Alabama has counties Each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission It also has limited executive authority in the county Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution which centralizes power in the state legislature only seven counties Jefferson Lee Mobile Madison Montgomery Shelby and Tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule Instead most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning br The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the Alabama Constitutional Commission Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county United States Supreme Court decisions in Baker v Carr required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census to implement the principle of one man one vote Before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to under representation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties The rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas br The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution Alabama s constitution has been amended more than times and almost one third of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance br Alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state A total of of the counties are dry counties which ban the sale of alcohol and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales br br br Politics br During Reconstruction following the American Civil War Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope In the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans in part by suppressing the black vote through violence fraud and intimidation After a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents a process completed in provisions of the constitution Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites By more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised to The total effects were greater on the black community as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law br From through the s the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas As counties were the basis of election districts the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three quarters of the century until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in to meet equal representation Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the s and s during the civil rights movement when whites bureaucratically and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform Governor George Wallace the state s only four term governor was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of and Voting Rights Act of did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights In many jurisdictions they continued to be excluded from representation by at large electoral systems which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards br In the Alabama Legislature passed and Republican governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact In a symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America In Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in years br As of February there are a total of registered voters with active and the others inactive in the state br The American Values Atlas by Public Religion Research Institute found that a majority of Alabama residents support same sex marriage br br br Elections br br br State elections br With the disfranchisement of Blacks in the state became part of the Solid South a system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary with generally only token Republican challengers running in the general election Since the mid to late th century however white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party In Alabama majority white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal state and local office br Members of the nine seats on the Supreme Court of Alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office Until no Republicans held any of the court seats In that general election the then incumbent chief justice Ernest C Hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately votes to Republican Perry O Hooper Sr Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench br In the early st century Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education In Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in years The last remaining statewide Democrat who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in br Only three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise The three GOP lieutenant governors are Steve Windom Kay Ivey and Will Ainsworth present br br br Local elections br Many local offices county commissioners boards of education tax assessors mayors etc in the state are still held by Democrats Many metropolitan and suburban counties have voters who are majority Democrats resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary Similarly most rural counties are majority Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary However since local governments in Alabama are weaker than in other parts of the country Republicans have the upper hand in government br Alabama s county sheriffs are elected in partisan at large races and Republicans retain the vast majority of those posts The current split is Democrats and Republicans as of However most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over urban and more populated counties The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more rural counties with lower population The state of Alabama
