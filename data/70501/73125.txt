Division in the Eastern Conference and is owned by Ted Leonsis through Monumental Sports Entertainment The team initially played its home games at the Capital Centre in Landover Maryland before moving to the Capital One Arena in Washington D C in br The franchise was founded in as an expansion team alongside the Kansas City Scouts and struggled throughout its first eight years of existence In David Poile was hired as general manager helping to turn the team s fortunes around With a core of players such as Mike Gartner Rod Langway Larry Murphy and Scott Stevens the Capitals became a regular playoff contender for the next fourteen seasons After purchasing the team in Leonsis revitalized the franchise by drafting star players such as Alexander Ovechkin Nicklas Backstrom John Carlson and Braden Holtby The Capitals won the franchise s first Presidents Trophy for being the team with the most points at the end of the regular season They won it a second time in and for a third time the

the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League and the South Carolina Stingrays of the ECHL br br br History br br br Early years br The NHL awarded an expansion franchise to the city of Washington on June and the Capitals joined the NHL as an expansion team for the season along with the Kansas City Scouts The Capitals were owned by Abe Pollin also owner of the National Basketball Association s Washington Bullets Wizards Pollin had built the Capital Centre in suburban Landover Maryland to house both the Bullets who formerly played in Baltimore and the Capitals His first act as owner was to hire Hall of Famer Milt Schmidt as general manager br With a combined teams between the NHL and the World Hockey Association WHA the available talent was stretched thin The Capitals had few players with professional experience and were at a disadvantage against the long standing teams that were stocked with veteran players br br The Capitals inaugural season was dreadful even by expansion standards They finished with the worst record in the league at their points were half that of their expansion brethren the Scouts The eight wins are the fewest for an NHL team playing at least games and the winning percentage is still the worst in NHL history They also set records for most road losses out of most consecutive road losses and most consecutive losses Head coach Jim Anderson said I d rather find out my wife was cheating on me than keep losing like this At least I could tell my wife to cut it out Schmidt himself had to take over the coaching reins late in the season br In Washington went straight games without a win and allowed goals en route to another horrendous record points In the middle of the season Schmidt was replaced as general manager by Max McNab and as head coach by Tom McVie For the rest of the s and early s the Capitals alternated between dreadful seasons and finishing only a few points out of the Stanley Cup playoffs in and for instance they were in playoff contention until the last day of the season The one bright spot during these years of futility was that many of McNab s draft picks e g Rick Green Ryan Walter Mike Gartner Bengt Gustafsson Gaetan Duchesne and Bobby Carpenter would impact the team for years to come either as important members of the roster or as crucial pieces in major trades br Pollin stuck it out through the Capitals first decade even though they were usually barely competitive This stood in contrast to the Scouts they were forced to move to Denver after only two years because their original owners did not have the resources or patience to withstand the struggles of an expansion team By the summer of however there was serious talk of the team moving out of the U S capital and a Save the Caps campaign was underway br br br Gartner Langway era br br In August the team hired David Poile as general manager As his first move Poile pulled off one of the largest trades in franchise history on September when he dealt longtime regulars Ryan Walter and Rick Green to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Rod Langway named captain only a few weeks later Brian Engblom Doug Jarvis and Craig Laughlin This move turned the franchise around as Langway s solid defense helped the team to dramatically reduce its goals against and the explosive goal scoring of Dennis Maruk Mike Gartner and Bobby Carpenter fueled the offensive attack Another significant move was the drafting of defenseman Scott Stevens during the NHL Entry Draft the pick was made by interim general manager Roger Crozier prior to Poile s hiring The result was a point jump a third place finish in the powerful Patrick Division which had teams such as the high powered New York Islanders Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers Another result was the team s first playoff appearance in Although they were eliminated by the three time defending and eventual Stanley Cup champion Islanders three games to one the Caps dramatic turnaround ended any talk of the club leaving Washington br br br Fourteen consecutive playoff appearances br The Capitals would make the playoffs for each of the next years in a row becoming known for starting slow before catching fire in January and February However regular season success did not carry into the playoffs Despite a continuous march of stars like Gartner Carpenter Langway Gustafsson Stevens Mike Ridley Dave Christian Dino Ciccarelli Larry Murphy and Kevin Hatcher Washington was knocked out in either the first or second round seven years in a row In for instance the Caps finished with points and won games for the first time in franchise history good enough for the third best record in the NHL They defeated the Islanders in the first round but were eliminated in the second round by the New York Rangers br br The season brought even more heartbreak with a loss to the Islanders in the Patrick Division Semifinals This series was capped off by the classic Easter Epic game which ended at am on Easter Sunday The Capitals had thoroughly dominated most of the game outshooting the Islanders but lost in overtime when goaltender Bob Mason was beaten on a Pat LaFontaine shot from the blue line For the playoff push Gartner and Murphy were traded to the Minnesota North Stars in exchange for Ciccarelli and defenseman Bob Rouse However the goaltending once again faltered and they were eliminated in the first round by the Philadelphia Flyers The Capitals finally made the Wales Conference Finals in but went down in a four game sweep at the hands of the first place Boston Bruins br br br Bondra Gonchar era br From to the Capitals would lose in either the first or the second round of the playoffs They would eliminate the Rangers in the first round but lost the second round to the Pittsburgh Penguins in In and they would lose in the first round to the Penguins and the Islanders respectively In they won their first round series against the Penguins but lost in the second round to the Rangers In and they lost in the first round both times to the Penguins They would miss the playoffs in but they came close to winning their first Stanley Cup one year later br br br First Stanley Cup Finals appearance br br In as the Caps opened MCI Center Peter Bondra s goals led the team veterans Dale Hunter Joe Juneau and Adam Oates returned to old form and Olaf Kolzig had a solid save percentage as the Caps got past the Boston Bruins Ottawa Senators and Buffalo Sabres the latter on a dramatic overtime win in game six on a goal by Joe Juneau en route to the team s first Stanley Cup Finals appearance The Capitals won six overtime games three in each of their series against the Bruins and Sabres However the team was outmatched by the defending champions the Detroit Red Wings who won in a four game sweep That same season Oates Phil Housley and Hunter all scored their th career point the only time in NHL history that one team had three players reach that same milestone in a single season This series is also famous for Esa Tikkanen s missed open net goal in Game br br br Disappointments and rebuilding br After their championship run the Capitals finished the season with a record of and failed to qualify for the playoffs During the season the team was sold to a group headed by AOL executive Ted Leonsis The Capitals went on to win back to back Southeast Division titles in and yet both years lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Penguins After the season Adam Oates demanded a trade but management refused and stripped him of his team captaincy br In the summer of the Capitals landed five time Art Ross Trophy winner Jaromir Jagr by trading three young prospects to the Pittsburgh Penguins Jagr was signed to the largest contract ever in NHL history million over seven years at an average salary of million per year over per game with an option for an eighth year However after Adam Oates was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers the Capitals failed to defend their division title and missed the playoffs in despite a winning record Still the season marked the highest attendance in franchise history drawing in fans and per game br Before the season the Caps made more roster changes including the signing of highly regarded Robert Lang as a free agent a linemate of Jagr s from Pittsburgh Washington returned to the playoffs in but disappointed fans again by losing in six games to the Tampa Bay Lightning after starting off with a two game lead in the best of seven first round series The series is well remembered for the three overtime Game at the then MCI Center At the time it was the longest game in the building s history and was eventually decided by a power play goal by Tampa Bay br br In the season the Caps unloaded much of their high priced talent not just a cost cutting spree but also an acknowledgment that their attempt to build a contender with high priced veteran talent had failed Jagr had never lived up to expectations during his time with the Capitals failing to finish among the league s top scorers or make the postseason All Star team The Caps tried to trade Jagr but as only one year was left on the existing NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement CBA before it expired few teams were willing to risk million on an underperforming player In Jagr was finally sent to the New York Rangers in exchange for Anson Carter and an agreement that Washington would pay approximately million per year of Jagr s salary with Jagr himself agreeing to defer with interest million per year for the remainder of his contract to allow the trade to go ahead This was quickly followed by Peter Bondra departing for the Ottawa Senators Not long after Robert Lang was sent to the Detroit Red Wings as well as Sergei Gonchar to the Boston Bruins The Lang trade marked the first time in the history of the NHL that the league s leading scorer was traded in the middle of the season The Capitals ended the year tied for the second worst

Dion Phaneuf br Many longtime Capitals had career years with Dainius Zubrus netting points Halpern having a career best assists Matt Pettinger putting in a career best goal point effort and seven others on the relatively young team topping points for the first time Two notable landmarks were also hit by Capitals as the team s longest tenured player Olaf Kolzig won his th game in goal and
