east of Disneyland and across the Orange Freeway from Angel Stadium the team s name was announced The team s name was inspired by the Disney film The Mighty Ducks about a struggling youth hockey team who with the help of their new coach become champions Philadelphia arena management specialist Tony Tavares was chosen to be team president and Jack Ferreira who previously helped create the San Jose Sharks became the Ducks general manager The Ducks selected Ron Wilson to be the first head coach in team history The Ducks and the expansion Florida Panthers team filled out their rosters in the NHL Expansion Draft and the NHL Entry Draft In the former a focus on defense led to goaltenders Guy Hebert and Glenn Healy being the first picks followed by Alexei Kasatonov and Steven King In the latter the Ducks selected as the fourth overall pick Paul Kariya who only began play in but would turn out to be the face of the franchise for many years The resulting roster had the lowest payroll of the NHL at only million br Led by captain Troy Loney the Ducks finished the season a record breaking number of wins for an expansion team which the Florida Panthers also achieved The Ducks sold out of home games including the last and filled the Arrowhead Pond to of its season capacity Ducks licensed merchandise shot to number one in sales among NHL clubs helped by their presence in Disney s theme

Winnipeg Jets improved the franchise The Ducks sent Chad Kilger Oleg Tverdovsky and a third round pick to the Jets in return for Marc Chouinard a fourth round draft pick and right winger Teemu Selanne Following the trade Ducks center Steve Rucchin commented Paul Kariya had a lot of pressure on him He single handedly won some games for us this year Now that we have Teemu there s no way everybody can just key on Paul These three players formed one of the most potent lines of their time Although the trade proved to be an important effort in the team they still finished short of the playoffs losing the eighth spot in the Western Conference to the Winnipeg Jets based on the number of wins br During the season Kariya became team captain following Randy Ladouceur s retirement in the off season and

the Detroit Red Wings in a four game sweep After the season Ron Wilson was fired after saying he would like to coach the Washington Capitals Pierre Page succeeded him The Ducks started out slowly in in part because Kariya missed the first games of the season in a contract dispute He came back in December but on February he suffered a season ending concussion when the Chicago Blackhawks Gary Suter
