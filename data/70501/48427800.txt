championship series or game where the U S broadcaster s feed of the National Football League s Super Bowl Major League Baseball s World Series and the National Basketball Association Finals is usually simulcast by a Canadian broadcaster with simultaneous substitution of the commercials With the prominence of Hockey Night in Canada since the s and with Canadian teams like the Edmonton Oilers and the Montreal Canadiens making multiple championship runs during the s and s the Stanley Cup Finals has regularly been produced and aired on broadcast television in Canada for decades Meanwhile U S
