city with the Canadiens who eventually came under the same ownership as the Maroons but were intended to appeal to the French Canadian population This was the first time since when the Montreal Wanderers folded that Montreal had a second major league professional hockey team In order to accommodate the Maroons a new arena was built for them in the Montreal Forum The Maroons were a highly competitive team winning the Stanley Cup twice and finishing first in their Canadian Division twice more Some of the best players of the era played for the Maroons eleven players were elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame while five of the six head coaches of the Maroons were also honoured br Financial difficulties resulting from the Great Depression led to the Maroons suspending play after Despite efforts to revive the team the franchise was cancelled in leaving the Canadiens as the sole NHL team in Montreal Since the Maroons demise no NHL team that has won a Stanley Cup at any point in its history has subsequently folded or relocated br br br History br br br Formation br br The Montreal Maroons hockey team was created to appeal to the anglophone neighbourhoods of Montreal On January

before settling in the Mount Royal Arena which had natural ice and seating for The Wanderers team of Montreal s anglophone community folded By work began to build a team to appeal to the anglophones and return to the NHL In July construction began on a new arena on the site of a former roller skating rink known as the Forum By fall at a cost of CA equivalent to about in the Montreal Forum was complete The Montreal Forum was the first large arena in the NHL The Maroons joined the NHL in along with the league s first United States based team the Boston Bruins The Canadiens initially objected to a second team in Montreal but relented when compensated by the expansion fee The expansion fee for each team was CA equivalent to about in The Canadiens the local rivals of the Maroons received of the Maroons fee While the Canadiens owner initially lodged a formal objection to ensure he would get adequate compensation for sharing his franchise s territory he was actually quite enthusiastic about having a second franchise in the same city rather he would later state he saw in them an important and lucrative local rivalry br br At the time of their founding the Maroons had no nickname The Maroons president James Strachan had been the owner of the Wanderers in the s He attempted to secure the Wanderers name but negotiations failed Wanderers last owner Sam Lichtenhein wanted CA equivalent to about in so the club was known by its official name the Montreal Professional Hockey Club With the team introducing maroon coloured sweaters complete with a large capital letter M for a logo the letter officially stood for their home city not the colour the Maroons nickname was picked up by the media The club never officially changed the organizational name to incorporate the Maroons name br br br Success at the gate and on the ice br br In the Maroons first season of operation they finished second to last in the league However the new Forum was selling out and with the addition of players Nels Stewart Babe Siebert and Bill Phillips success came quickly In a single year the Maroons went from having their worst record in franchise history to their best In only their second season of operation Montreal won their first Stanley Cup The NHL playoffs that year were a two game total goals format Montreal won the opening series over the Pittsburgh Pirates then upset the favored Ottawa Senators In the NHL playoff final Montreal defeated Ottawa to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Victoria Cougars of the Western Hockey League In the last Stanley Cup Finals involving two different leagues Montreal defeated Victoria three games to one Contributing to the victory was rookie and future Hall of Fame member Nels Stewart who scored six of the Maroons ten goals in the series Stewart won the Hart Trophy for most valuable player While not a smooth skater Stewart compensated with size at six foot one and pounds he was a giant compared to other players of that era toughness amassing penalty minutes and shooting scoring of Montreal s goals during the season Stewart s goals remained an NHL record for rookies until the season During this era a team s best players often played the entire game with substitutions only made for injuries br For the season the NHL expanded to ten teams and was divided into American and Canadian divisions The Maroons finished third in the Canadian division behind their rivals the Canadiens with whom they now shared the Forum The two teams met in the playoffs for a two game total goals series The Forum was packed with fans in a building whose capacity was listed at to watch the Canadiens defeat the defending Stanley Cup champions The Maroons also participated in another moment of hockey history when on November they were the competition in the New York Rangers NHL debut game br The Maroons got revenge on the Canadiens in the season by eliminating them in the semifinals of the playoffs The Maroons then met the New York Rangers for the Stanley Cup Finals but lost the series three games to two Because the Ringling Bros and Barnum Bailey Circus occupied Madison Square Garden all five games were played at the Forum br br The season was an oddly bad season for the Maroons as they finished last in the Canadian division However they rebounded in the season by finishing first During these years the Maroons were led by one of the most feared forward lines in the early NHL years the S Line consisting of Hooley Smith Babe Siebert and Nels Stewart which was also one of the most penalized br In the season Dunc Munro was signed as player coach of the team It was during this season that Clint Benedict of the Maroons became the first goaltender in NHL history to wear a mask when he donned one to protect a broken nose Although the Maroons finished first in the Canadian Division they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Boston Bruins br For the season Stewart again led his team in goals and points but the Maroons only finished third in the Canadian division and were eliminated easily in the first round of the playoffs by the New York Rangers br The Maroons made it into the playoffs of the season by finishing five points ahead of the New York Americans Montreal defeated Detroit in the opening round but lost the semifinal match against the Toronto Maple Leafs br The Maroons finished

playoffs of the season the Chicago Black Hawks eliminated both Montreal teams first defeating the Canadiens then upsetting the Maroons in the semifinals br In Leo Dandurand owner of the Montreal Canadiens sold that team to Canadian Arena Company Ernest Savard Louis Gelinas and Maurice Forget which also owned the Montreal Maroons for br br br Great Depression and cessation of operations br br In Montreal financial strains from the Great Depression hurt the attendances of both the Canadiens and Maroons However there were far more francophone supporters for the Canadiens than anglophone supporters for the Maroons As a result the Maroons finished with the worst attendance in the league three seasons in a row Also by both teams were owned by Canadian Arena Company Ernest Savard and Maurice Forget who owned the Canadiens were part of the Canadian Arena Company as were Maroons owners James Strachan and Donat Raymond It became obvious that only one team could represent Montreal The Maroons dire financial straits caused them to sell off several players including star winger Hooley Smith Despite the Maroons financial troubles they continued to play competitive hockey well into the s br br For the season the Maroons hired Tommy Gorman as coach who had coached the Chicago Black Hawks to the Championship the previous year The Maroons finished the season in second place behind Ottawa In the playoffs the Montreal Maroons defeated Chicago with defensive hockey defeated the New York Rangers at wide open offensive hockey and then defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs who Gorman considered one of the best hockey teams of all time in three straight games The Maroons won their second Stanley Cup Gorman remains the only coach in history to win back to back Cups with two different teams The Maroons team were the last team to win the Cup without a loss in the playoffs for years Gorman called this Maroon team the greatest team that ever stepped on the ice br The playoffs of the season are famous for the longest NHL playoff game of all time On March the Maroons lost to the Detroit Red Wings in of play of the sixth overtime period The game was especially significant for Detroit goaltender Normie Smith who began his career with the Maroons He shut out the Maroons again in the second game and allowed Detroit to complete a three game sweep by allowing only one goal Detroit proceeded to win the first Stanley Cup in their history br In December Maroons captain Hooley Smith was traded to the Boston Bruins a move which would mark the beginning of the end for the franchise The season saw Nels Stewart break Howie Morenz s record for career goals with Stewart would hold the all time career record for goals until it was broken by Maurice Richard in br By the start of the season rumours were rampant that the Maroon franchise would be moved to another city In September Maroons president Donat Raymond said the team would be staying in Montreal The team s bleak financial situation finally caught up with them as they finished the club s worst season since winning only nine games in Lionel Conacher retired prior to the season to enter politics winning a seat in the Ontario general election as a member of the Liberal Party Tommy Gorman had tried to convince Conacher to stay with the Maroons and take over as coach his retirement led Gorman to hire King Clancy Clancy did not help improve the team s record and on December he was fired after games and Gorman was re instated as coach Their last game for the Maroons franchise was a loss on March against the Canadiens They finished the season with a record of wins losses and ties for points in games placing the team last in the Canadian Division and last overall in the league br At the annual league meeting on June the Maroons formally asked the league to suspend the franchise for a year this was refused and the league asked the Maroons to confirm by August if they were to participate in the upcoming season or not br The league allowed the Maroons to suspend operations for the season Lacking a formal dispersal draft some of the Maroons were transferred to the Canadiens Most of the Maroons players were either sold to the remaining NHL teams or washed out of the league altogether br br br Attempted revival br The Maroons owners tried to sell their dormant franchise to interests in St Louis Missouri but doubts regarding the previous failure of the St Louis Eagles led to the league refusing permission At the annual league meeting held on September it was noted that the backers of the Maroons franchise were in discussion to sell to a group from Philadelphia fronted by Canadiens board member Len Peto The league governors were prepared to approve the transfer provided the Philadelphia group could prove they had the necessary funds for a hockey team They also made sure to clarify that the Maroons franchise rights would expire in April unless something was done with them br Peto was able to get the necessary funding and persuaded the league to transfer the Maroons to Philadelphia However despite being larger than all but two NHL cities Philadelphia did not have an arena that could accommodate an NHL team The Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania did not have an ice plant and both Penn and Madison Square Garden which managed the Palestra balked at the expense of installing one Neither was the city owned Convention Hall equipped to produce ice The only arena in the city with an ice plant Philadelphia Arena was ruled out because its sight lines and capacity were deemed inadequate even for temporary use The league refused to extend its deadline to give Peto more time to find or build a suitable arena In February Peto announced plans to build a seat arena on the site of the old Baker Bowl at a cost of US equivalent to about in However when his group was unable to get funding for the project by the league imposed deadline the NHL
