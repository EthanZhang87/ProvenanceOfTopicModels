The Carolina Hurricanes colloquially known as the Canes are a professional ice hockey team based in Raleigh North Carolina The Hurricanes compete in the National Hockey League NHL as part of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference and play their home games at PNC Arena br The franchise was formed in as the New England Whalers of the World Hockey Association WHA The Whalers saw success immediately winning the Eastern Division in the WHA s first three seasons and becoming the inaugural Avco World Trophy Champions to cap off the season The Whalers again competed for the World Trophy in this time falling short to the Winnipeg Jets in a rematch of the Finals The franchise joined the NHL in as part of the NHL WHA merger renaming themselves the Hartford Whalers The team relocated to North Carolina in rebranding themselves as the Hurricanes Carolina advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in where they were defeated by the Detroit Red Wings The Hurricanes won the Stanley Cup over the Edmonton Oilers giving the state of North Carolina its first major professional sports championship and its only major championship as of br br br Franchise history br br br New England Hartford Whalers br br The New England Whalers were established in November when the World Hockey Association WHA awarded a franchise to begin play in Boston Massachusetts For the first two years of their existence the club played their home games at the Boston Arena and Boston Garden With the increasing difficulty of scheduling games at Boston Garden owned by the NHL rival Boston Bruins the owners decided to move the team to Hartford Connecticut beginning with the season While waiting for the completion of a new arena in Hartford the Whalers played the first part of the season at The Big E Coliseum in West Springfield Massachusetts On January the team played its first game in front of a sellout crowd at the Hartford Civic Center Coliseum and would maintain its home there through br br As one of the most stable WHA teams the Whalers along with the Edmonton Oilers Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets were admitted to the NHL when the rival leagues merged in However under pressure from the extant NHL team in the New England area the Boston Bruins the Whalers were compelled to rename the team the Hartford Whalers The Whalers were never as successful in the NHL as they had been in the WHA recording only three winning seasons They peaked in the mid to late s winning their only playoff series in over the Nordiques before bowing out in the second round to the Montreal Canadiens taking the Habs to overtime of Game in the process The next year the club secured the regular season Adams Division title only to fall to the Nordiques in six games in the first round of the playoffs In the Whalers made the playoffs for the final time but were bounced in the first round in seven games by the Canadiens Two years later the team hired Jim Rutherford as general manager a position that he would hold within the franchise for twenty years br For years the organization maintained many Whalers connections among its off ice personnel in addition to many members of executive management and the coaching staff broadcasters Chuck Kaiton John Forslund and Tripp Tracy at the time a minor league player and equipment managers Wally Tatomir Skip Cunningham and Bob Gorman all made the move to North Carolina with the team Finally the old goal horn from the Hartford Civic Center remains in use at PNC Arena Kaiton and Forslund would both eventually leave the franchise Kaiton in and Forslund in br br br Move to North Carolina br The Whalers were plagued for most of their existence by limited marketability Hartford was the smallest American market in the league and was located on the traditional dividing line between the home territories for New York City and Boston teams It did not help matters that the Hartford Civic Center was one of the smallest arenas in the league seating under spectators for hockey The Whalers off ice problems were magnified when the start of the s triggered a spike in player salaries br Despite assurances made when he purchased the team in that the Whalers would remain in Hartford at least through in March owner Peter Karmanos announced that the team would move elsewhere after the season because of the team s inability to negotiate a satisfactory construction and lease package for a new arena in Hartford On May Karmanos announced that the Whalers would move to the Research Triangle area of North Carolina and the new Entertainment and Sports Arena ESA in Raleigh Due to the relatively short time frame for the move Karmanos himself thought of and decided upon the new name for the club the Carolina Hurricanes rather than holding a contest as is sometimes done Later that summer the team dropped the Whalers colors of blue green and silver for a new black and red scheme matching the colors of the North Carolina State University Wolfpack with whose men s basketball team they would share the arena in Raleigh The Hurricanes inherited the Whalers place in the Northeast Division br Unfortunately for the team the ESA would not be complete for two more years The only arena in the Triangle area with an ice plant was year old Dorton Arena at seats it was too small even for temporary use The Hurricanes chose to play home games in Greensboro minutes west of Raleigh for their first two seasons after the move However the team would be based in Raleigh and practice in nearby Hillsborough effectively saddling the Hurricanes with road games for the next two years This choice was disastrous for the franchise s attendance and reputation With a capacity of over people for hockey the Greensboro Coliseum was the highest capacity arena in the NHL However Triangle area fans balked at making the mile drive down I to Greensboro Likewise fans from the Piedmont Triad mostly refused to support a lame duck team that had displaced the popular Greensboro Carolina Monarchs minor league franchise As a result even with the first game hosting more than fans most games in Greensboro attracted crowds of or fewer The crowds looked even smaller than that in the cavernous environment Furthermore only out of games were televised over the air and cable combined and radio play by play coverage on WPTF was often pre empted by Wolfpack basketball for whose broadcasts WPTF was the flagship station leaving these games totally unavailable to those who did not have a ticket With by far the smallest season ticket base in the NHL and attendance figures routinely well below the league average Sports Illustrated ran a story titled Natural Disaster and ESPN anchors mocked the Green Acres of empty seats in a interview Karmanos admitted that as it turns out Greensboro was probably a mistake Under the circumstances the Hurricanes managed to stay competitive but still finished last in the Northeast Division with points nine points out of the playoffs br For the Hurricanes curtained off most of the upper deck lowering the Coliseum s listed capacity to about Attendance continued to lag Most games attracted crowds of well under Conversely on the ice the Hurricanes performance improved led by the return of longtime Whalers captain Ron Francis Keith Primeau s goals and Gary Roberts penalty minutes They tallied their first winning season and playoff appearance since They also won the newly formed Southeast Division by eight points only their second division title as an NHL team following the Adams Division title as the Whalers Tragedy struck hours after the team s first round loss to the Bruins when defenseman Steve Chiasson was thrown from his pickup truck and killed in a single vehicle drunk driving crash br The team finally moved to their newly completed arena in Raleigh in They became the first major sports team to play in Raleigh and remain the only such team there as of br The aforementioned season was marked by an ultimately franchise altering mid season trade which saw Primeau dealt to the Philadelphia Flyers for several players including future captain Rod Brind Amour With the move to the new arena the Hurricanes introduced the Storm Squad the first cheerleaders for professional ice hockey in North America In the Hurricanes managed to claim the eighth seed nosing out the Boston Bruins and landed a first round match up with the defending champions the New Jersey Devils The Devils eliminated the Hurricanes in six games Down in the series the Hurricanes extended it to a sixth game thereby becoming only the th team in NHL history to do so Game in Raleigh featured their best playoff crowd that year as well as their loudest Despite the loss Carolina was given a standing ovation by their home crowd as the game ended erasing some of the doubts that the city would not warm up to the team br br br Stanley Cup Finals and slow starts br The Hurricanes made national waves for the first time in the playoffs They survived a late charge from the Washington Capitals to win the division but expectations were low entering the first round against the defending Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Devils However Arturs Irbe and Kevin Weekes were solid in goal and the Hurricanes won two games in overtime as they defeated the Devils in six games Their second round matchup was against the Montreal Canadiens who were riding a wave of emotion after their captain Saku Koivu s return from cancer treatment In the third period of game four in Montreal down in the series and in the game Carolina would tie the game and later win on Niclas Wallin s overtime goal The game became known to Hurricanes fans as the Miracle at Molson Carolina won the next two games by a combined margin over a dejected Habs club to take the series br In the Eastern Conference Finals Carolina met the heavily favored Toronto Maple Leafs In Game in Toronto the Leafs Mats Sundin tied the game with seconds remaining to send it to overtime where Carolina s Martin Gelinas would score to send the franchise to their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance During this series several Hurricanes fan traditions drew hockey wide media attention for the first time fans met the team at the airport on the return from every road trip and echoed football season habits honed for games across the parking lot by hosting massive tailgate parties before each home game a relative novelty in the cold weather centric NHL Inside the building the CBC s Don Cherry lauded the RBC Center as the loudest building in the NHL praise that would be echoed in br In the Stanley Cup Finals Carolina would face the Detroit Red Wings thought to be the prohibitive favorite all year Though the Hurricanes stunned the Wings in game one when Ron Francis scored in the first minute of overtime Detroit stormed back to win the next four games Game three in Raleigh featured a triple overtime thriller eventually won by Detroit s Igor Larionov the oldest player to score a last round goal br br The Hurricanes looked poised to pick up where they left off in the but never recovered from a loss January and finished dead last in the league with points After a similarly slow start to the season Paul Maurice who had been the team s coach since midway through their next to last season in Hartford was fired and replaced with former New York Islanders bench boss Peter Laviolette Under Laviolette Weekes remained tough but the offense was suspect center Josef Vasicek led the team with a mere goals and assists for points Many of the new fans attracted to the team and to hockey itself during the playoff run lost interest and attendance declined One of the few positive results of these losing years was the team s drafting of Eric Staal in br br br Stanley Cup champions br The outcome of the NHL lockout led to the shrinking of the payroll to million The Hurricanes turned out to be one of the NHL s biggest surprises turning in the best season in the franchise s year history including the years as the Whalers They finished the regular season with a record and points shattering the previous franchise records of points in the WHA set by the Whalers and points in the NHL set in It was the first time ever that the franchise had passed the win and point plateaus The point figure was good for fourth overall in the league easily their highest overall finish as an NHL team tied with the third overall Dallas Stars in points but with one fewer win than the Stars and second in the East one point behind the Ottawa Senators The Hurricanes also ran away with their third Southeast Division title finishing points ahead of the Tampa Bay Lightning Attendance increased from the season averaging just under per game and the team made a profit for the first time since the move from Hartford br In the playoffs after losing the first two games of the Conference Quarterfinal series against the Montreal Canadiens Laviolette lifted goalkeeper Martin Gerber who had been struggling to regain his form after playing through a bout of intestinal flu in favor of rookie Cam Ward This proved to be a consequential decision as the Hurricanes went on to win both games in Montreal tying up the playoff series and turning the momentum around winning the series on a game six overtime goal by Cory Stillman Carolina then faced the New Jersey Devils in the Conference Semifinals which proved surprisingly one sided as the Hurricanes beat the Devils in five games Stillman struck again once again scoring the series winning goal br In the Eastern Conference Finals the Hurricanes faced the Buffalo Sabres who had finished just one spot behind the Hurricanes in the overall standings The contentious series saw both coaches Lindy Ruff and Laviolette taking public verbal shots at each other s team In the deciding game seven the Hurricanes rallied with three goals in the third to win by a score of Rod Brind Amour scored the game winner as the Hurricanes reached the Stanley Cup finals for the second time in team history br br The Stanley Cup Finals saw the Hurricanes facing the Edmonton Oilers The Hurricanes rallied from a deficit in game one to win after Rod Brind Amour scored with seconds left In Game the Hurricanes shelled the Oilers to take a two game lead The Oilers won game three in Edmonton as Ryan Smyth scored the game winning goal with left to play Carolina rebounded in game four with a victory and came home with a chance to win the Cup on home ice However game five saw the Oilers come back with a stunning overtime win on a shorthanded breakaway by Fernando Pisani In Game in Edmonton Carolina was soundly defeated the only bright point for the Hurricanes was the return of forward Erik Cole from a broken neck that had sidelined him since March In Game before the then second largest home crowd in franchise history the Hurricanes won sealing the Hurricanes first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history Cam Ward was honored with the Conn Smythe Trophy for being the playoffs most valuable player becoming just the fourth rookie to be honored with the award Several Hurricanes raised the Cup for the first time in their long NHL careers Rod Brind Amour and Bret Hedican had both played over years without winning the Cup while Glen Wesley the last remaining member of the Hartford Whalers on the Hurricanes roster had waited seasons On the managerial side general manager Jim Rutherford finally won the Cup in his twelfth year with the franchise since joining the Whalers in br The Hurricanes Stanley Cup championship marked the first professional major league sports title for a team from North Carolina As well they were the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup despite losing at least nine playoff games in that year the Boston Bruins the Los Angeles Kings the Pittsburgh Penguins and the St Louis Blues are the only other teams to have achieved this feat br br br Post championship slump br The Hurricanes were unable to follow up their recent success Losing four players to free agency in the off season and man games to injury during the the team struggled throughout the regular season and once eliminated in the last game the Hurricanes finished third in the Southeast and th overall in the Eastern Conference This finish made them the first champions since the Chicago Black Hawks to have failed to qualify for the playoffs both the seasons before and after their championship season and the third champion overall to not defend its title after both the Blackhawks and the New Jersey Devils In the Carolina again missed out as Washington Capitals stormed back to take the division title on the last day of the season leaving the Hurricanes second in the division and ninth overall in the conference and making the Hurricanes only the second club in NHL history to miss the playoffs for two seasons running after a Stanley Cup triumph br br After a slow start to the season Cup winning coach Peter Laviolette was fired in early December and replaced by his own predecessor Paul Maurice Teetering on the edge of the playoff picture again the club on February acquired utility forward Jussi Jokinen from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for Wade Brookbank Josef Melichar and Carolina s fourth round draft pick in then reacquired winger Erik Cole from the Edmonton Oilers at the March trade deadline and proceeded on a run to close out the season The stretch run included nine straight wins matching a franchise record from the season and capped off a streak of straight home wins which set a new franchise mark The team finished sixth in the Eastern Conference with points the second most points in franchise history br The Hurricanes playoff run featured two tight series with dramatic finishes Game of the first round matchup with the New Jersey Devils saw Stanley Cup playoff history when Jussi Jokinen scored with seconds left in regulation to win the game the latest regulation game winning goal in NHL history Then in Game the Devils took a lead into the final two minutes of the game at the Prudential Center in Newark before the Hurricanes struck With to play Tim Gleason saved a puck on his knees at the right point passed it to Joni Pitkanen on the left boards who then hit Game hero Jussi Jokinen at the far post for the tying goal Just seconds later Chad LaRose sprang Eric Staal for a solo down ice rush to give the Hurricanes game and series win Staal s goal was the latest regulation Game winning goal in playoff history The Game comeback would become known as the Shock at the Rock In the second round matchup with the top seeded Boston Bruins the Hurricanes ran out to a lead before the Bruins battled back for two wins In Game in Boston Scott Walker scored the game and series winner into overtime to send Carolina to the Eastern Conference finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins The Penguins though put a decisive end to the Hurricanes string sweeping the series on the way to their own Stanley Cup championship br As a result of their surprise run very few changes were made in the off season Veterans such as Aaron Ward Andrew Alberts and Stephane Yelle were brought in to help drive the team further but things did not go according to plan The Hurricanes experienced a game losing streak spanning October and November and midway through the year the Hurricanes replaced their only post lockout captain Rod Brind Amour with Eric Staal Despite improved play during the second half of the season they could not overcome the deficit from early on in the season The Hurricanes would end up with the seventh overall pick in the NHL Entry Draft eventually selecting Jeff Skinner from the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League OHL Brind Amour retired over the off season to take a coaching job with the club br br The season was widely expected to be a transitional year from the veteran heavy high salary club that opened to a younger cheaper base The Hurricanes contended for a playoff slot for the entire season aided by Skinner s emergence as an offensive phenomenon who as the youngest player in the league would lead all rookies in points Raleigh hosted the NHL All Star Game in January and Eric Staal captained a team he selected opposite a team selected by the Detroit Red Wings Nicklas Lidstrom that featured Skinner the youngest All Star in NHL history Cam Ward and for the SuperSkills competition defenseman Jamie McBain The Hurricanes went into the final day of the season able to determine their own fate but lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning to finish ninth in the East Skinner was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year the first player in franchise history to receive that honor br In December the Carolina Hurricanes fired coach Paul Maurice and hired Kirk Muller On February the Carolina Hurricanes signed Tim Gleason to a four year million extension and two days later on February they also signed Tuomo Ruutu to a four year million extension Two months later the Carolina Hurricanes announced that they had signed Jiri Tlusty to a two year deal that would pay him million for and million for Gleason and Tlusty would eventually be traded to the Washington Capitals and the Winnipeg Jets over the next few seasons Despite the signings of Gleason Ruutu and Tlusty the Hurricanes would finish fifth in the Southeast Division and twelfth in the Eastern Conference during the season which forced them to miss the playoffs for a third consecutive season br On May the Stanley Cup champions Carolina Hurricanes Game victory was recognized as one of the NC Hall of Fame s Great Moments series During the NHL Entry Draft the Carolina Hurricanes traded Brandon Sutter Brian Dumoulin and their first round draft pick Derrick Pouliot to the Penguins in exchange for Jordan Staal uniting the player with his older brother Eric Staal On March the Hurricanes signed Alexander Semin to a five year deal worth million However in the lockout shortened season the team would finish third in the Southeast Division and th in the Eastern Conference which would make the team miss the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season after a strong start was cut short by an injury to starting goaltender Cam Ward br br br Continued decline and relocation rumors br Before the season the Hurricanes were realigned into the new Metropolitan Division They would finish seventh in the division during the season ahead of only the New York Islanders and would miss the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season which prompted management to fire head coach Kirk Muller In addition longtime general manager Jim Rutherford was moved to an advisory role after the season with longtime Whalers Hurricanes star Ron Francis announced as his replacement on April br On June Bill Peters was named head coach becoming the fifth head coach in franchise history Peters teams would not break the Hurricanes playoff drought During the season the team finished last in the Metropolitan Division and would miss the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season After team captain Eric Staal was traded to the New York Rangers at the trade deadline the team finished sixth in the division during the season Things did not improve in the season The Hurricanes finished seventh in the division missing the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season br The Hurricanes also experienced uncertainty about their future in Raleigh during this time Karmanos was looking to sell the team something he d been trying to do for years Attendance at PNC Arena had declined at a consistent rate since It became so bad the team finished second to last in average league attendance in and Rumors started circulating in that the Hurricanes were possible contenders to move to either Las Vegas or Quebec City The Quebec rumors in particular were widely reported with the Hurricanes and the NHL both refuting the claims Las Vegas would eventually gain an expansion team in the Vegas Golden Knights br br br Tom Dundon and the Bunch of Jerks present br Before the season the Hurricanes unveiled new uniforms On July it was reported that Chuck Greenberg had sent Karmanos a letter of intent to buy the team for million Greenberg would ultimately back out of a deal On December it was announced that Thomas Dundon signed an agreement to purchase the Hurricanes which ensured that the team would not be relocated The deal was finalized on January with Dundon becoming majority owner and having a percent stake in the team while Karmanos retained a minority interest br Dundon wasted little time in overhauling the Hurricanes front office On March the team announced that general manager Ron Francis had been moved to the role of president of hockey operations However Sportsnet reporter Elliotte Friedman reported that the promotion was likely in name only noting that there were rumblings Francis and Dundon did not see eye to eye Subsequently coach Bill Peters resigned from his position on April to pursue a similar opportunity with the Calgary Flames he ultimately replaced Glen Gulutzan as the Flames head coach three days later and the Hurricanes officially fired Francis from the organization altogether on April leaving vacancies in both the head coach and general manager positions br Early in the Hurricanes search for a replacement general manager it was reported that Dundon s salary offerings for the position could be prohibitive in attracting quality candidates Sportsnet s Nick Kypreos reported that the Hurricanes were offering in the ballpark of a year a fraction of the salary figures of many other teams coaches let alone those of their general managers who serve in a higher ranking position Leading up to Kypreos report candidates such as Nashville Predators assistant general manager Paul Fenton New Jersey Devils assistant general manager Tom Fitzgerald and Los Angeles Kings assistant general manager Mike Futa had all reportedly passed on the position br br Ultimately on May the Hurricanes announced the hiring of former Atlanta Thrashers general manager Don Waddell as team president and general manager Waddell had previously been serving as the team s interim general manager since the promotion of Francis At the same time it was announced that former team captain Rod Brind Amour had been named head coach after serving with the team as an assistant coach since br On April the Hurricanes won over the New Jersey Devils clinching a playoff spot for the first time since and only the second time since their Cup win During their stretch run the Hurricanes gained notice for their on ice victory celebrations which they called Storm Surges This led Don Cherry of Hockey Night in Canada to call the Hurricanes a bunch of jerks The Hurricanes adopted Bunch of Jerks as a battle cry even going as far as projecting it on the ice at PNC Arena before and after games br During the Stanley Cup playoffs on April the Hurricanes defeated the defending Stanley Cup champions the Washington Capitals in double overtime in game seven winning their first playoff series since The team would then go on to defeat the New York Islanders in four straight games in the second round recording the first best of seven playoff series sweep in franchise history and advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since It was also the first time since that an opposing team the Islanders that swept their opponent in the first round the Pittsburgh Penguins would then go on to lose four straight and drop the series This trend continued into the third round against the Hurricanes favor as they themselves were swept by the Boston Bruins thus losing the Eastern Conference Finals br On February on the th anniversary of the Miracle on Ice Hurricanes emergency goaltender David Ayres became the first emergency goaltender in NHL history to win a game a win against the Toronto Maple Leafs the team whose minor league affiliate he works for as a Zamboni driver and maintenance man The season would come to an abrupt end on March due to the COVID pandemic On August Andrei Svechnikov became the first Hurricanes Whalers player to score a hat trick in the postseason in a win over the New York Rangers By beating the Rangers the Hurricanes made the playoffs for a second straight season However they lost to the Bruins in five games The loss also marked the first time since the playoffs that the Hurricanes lost in the first round br The season concluded with the Hurricanes winning the Central Division their first division championship since winning the Southeast Division in It was also the first time since moving to Raleigh that they had qualified for the postseason three years in a row and the first time in the history of the franchise that a head coach had taken the team to the playoffs in three consecutive years They defeated the Nashville Predators in the first round in six games but lost to the eventual champion Tampa Bay Lightning in the second round in five games Defenseman Jaccob Slavin won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy notably only having two penalty minutes PIM for the entire season Defenseman Dougie Hamilton was named to NHL s All Star second team and goaltender Alex Nedeljkovic was named to NHL s All Rookie team and placed third in the Calder Memorial Trophy voting while head coach Brind Amour was awarded the Jack Adams Award being the first in Hartford Carolina history to receive it On June it was announced that Tom Dundon had purchased all remaining minority shares in the team br The off season saw the Hurricanes overhaul the roster resulting in many players departing Warren Foegele was traded to Edmonton for Ethan Bear Ian Cole and Brendan Smith was signed to complement the depth on defense The team also overhauled their goaltending trading away Alex Nedeljkovic for a pick and signing Frederik Andersen and Antti Raanta as the new goalie tandem In perhaps their most talked about moves the Hurricanes signed Tony DeAngelo and signed Jesperi Kotkaniemi to an offer sheet br The season concluded with the Hurricanes winning the Metropolitan Division for the first time in franchise history This was the first time the Hurricanes had ever won division titles in back to back years since relocation The Hurricanes finished the regular season with wins the most in franchise history Andersen and Sebastian Aho each represented the team at the NHL All Star Game In the playoffs the top seeded Hurricanes defeated the Boston Bruins in the first round before falling to the New York Rangers in seven games br br br Logos and uniforms br The Hurricanes primary logo has always been a stylized hurricane with a storm warning flag on a hockey stick as the secondary logo A stylized black triangle sat behind the flag referencing the Triangle region After the team s first season in the team altered the color scheme to a slightly darker shade of red and kept the other colors br The Carolina Hurricanes currently wear black uniforms at home and white uniforms on the road While black is one of the team s core colors until the Hurricanes kept its usage at a minimum opting for red helmets and red pants while using black exclusively as a trim color along with silver Nevertheless the Hurricanes have worn black alternate uniforms for select games since br br br Original uniforms br The initial Hurricanes uniforms featured the primary logo in front with the secondary logo on the shoulders One enduring feature of this uniform was the red and black storm warning flags that dot the tail along with silver red black and white stripes In black trim was added on the player s name and upon moving to Reebok s Edge template in piping was added on the shoulder yoke br In the Hurricanes unveiled their first black alternate uniform featuring the flag logo in front and the primary logo recolored to dark grey on the shoulders As with the primary uniforms warning flag patterns dot the tail albeit recolored to silver and black V stripes of red and silver accent the sleeves and socks br br br New looks br In the Hurricanes replaced their primary uniforms with a new set The biggest changes for these uniforms included the omission of black and silver On the red uniform black was relegated exclusively to the neck piping letter trim and logo while on the white uniform it was featured more prominently on the numbers and striping Silver was almost completely removed from both the red and white uniforms except for the logo outline In addition a red nameplate with white letters and black trim was placed near the red shoulder yoke of the white uniforms Both sets removed the flag logo and warning flag patterns while letters were updated to Univers Condensed font The front logo also reduced in size compared to the prior set Despite these changes the Hurricanes continued to wear the prior black alternate uniform with this new set br Upon moving to Adidas AdiZero template in the Hurricanes made little changes to their white uniform However their new red uniform brought back a few elements from the original set including black striping and the warning flag pattern now recolored with a dark red shade on the tail br In the Hurricanes unveiled a new black alternate uniform featuring an updated flag logo corrected to a hurricane warning flag This flag logo also became the new additional logo On the dark grey shoulder yoke the primary logo was placed on the right while the Flag of North Carolina was added to the left Both logos were recolored in black and grey The logo also features the state of North Carolina in the negative space between the flags This alternate has since become the Hurricanes primary home uniform during the playoffs br In a new white uniform was released replacing the one worn since This new uniform featured the CANES nickname written diagonally in front with the flag logo returning on the shoulders The warning flag patterns and red letters with black trim also returned from the original set The new uniform came at the behest of owner Tom Dundon who was not a fan of the previous white uniform br The Hurricanes have not worn variants of their uniforms often On April the Hurricanes wore their alternate black pants with the white road uniforms for the first time in a game against the Buffalo Sabres Two nights later also against the Sabres the Hurricanes paired their alternate black helmets and pants with the primary red home uniform On December against the Pittsburgh Penguins the Hurricanes began wearing red helmets with the white road uniforms br In August the Hurricanes officially promoted their black uniform to their full time home uniform They also brought back the original red uniform as an alternate in commemoration of the th anniversary of
