The NHL season was the th regular season of the National Hockey League The Stanley Cup winners were the New Jersey Devils who won the best of seven series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim br br br Teams br br br Regular season br The regular season saw several surprises The San Jose Sharks who many felt would be one of the elite teams in the West stumbled early and badly disassembled much of the team The two year old Minnesota Wild on the other hand got out to an early start and held onto their first ever playoff berth throughout the season winning coach Jacques Lemaire the Jack Adams Award br The most surprising team was probably the Tampa Bay Lightning which many had predicted to finish last winning their first Southeast Division title and making the playoffs for the first time in seven years The most disappointing teams other than the Sharks were the New York Rangers who finished out of the playoffs again despite bearing the league s leading payroll and the Carolina Hurricanes who finished last overall after a surprise run to the Stanley Cup Finals the year before On January Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Michael Leighton gained a shutout in his NHL debut in a tie versus the Phoenix Coyotes Coyotes goaltender Zac Bierk earned his first career shutout although it was not his NHL debut It was the first and with the abolition of ties two years later the only time that two goalies in the same game both earned their first career shutouts br At the midpoint of the season the Canucks led the Western Conference and Ottawa led the East Vancouver stumbled somewhat over the stretch and lost the Northwest Division title to Colorado and the Western Conference to Dallas Ottawa continued to dominate having the best season in franchise history and winning both the Eastern Conference and the Presidents Trophy br The season was also marred by financial difficulties Despite their success the Ottawa Senators were in bankruptcy protection for almost all of and at one point could not pay the players Owner Rod Bryden tried a variety of innovative financing strategies but these all failed and the team was purchased after the season by billionaire Eugene Melnyk The Buffalo Sabres also entered bankruptcy protection before being bought by New York businessman Tom Golisano The financial struggles of the Pittsburgh Penguins continued as the team continued to unload its most expensive players br The season was marked by a great number of coaches being fired from Bob Hartley in Colorado to Darryl Sutter in San Jose and Bryan Trottier of the New York Rangers br Worries over the decline in scoring and the neutral zone trap continued The season began with an attempted crack down on obstruction and interference but by the midpoint of the season this effort had petered out br br br Final standings br Note W Wins L Losses T Ties OTL Overtime Losses GF Goals For GA Goals Against Pts Points br br br Eastern Conference br br Divisions AT Atlantic NE
